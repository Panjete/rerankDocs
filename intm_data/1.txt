a novel viral pneumonia originating from china was announced to the world health organization on december 31 2019 who 2020b as of march 26 2020 there were 465915 confirmed cases and 21031 confirmed deaths from this coronavirus disease covid-19 across the globe who 2020a this pandemic has rapidly and profoundly affected every part of daily life from the way people work live shop socialize and plan for the future although the psychological impact of these changes has been well documented by the media the mental health care needs of those suffering from this crisis have been relatively neglected xiang et al 2020 this is surprising given that research on previous global disease outbreaks has shown that people suffering from pandemic-related anxiety tend to exhibit elevated levels of post-traumatic stress general stress anxiety health anxiety and suicidality chong et al 2004 wheaton et al 2012 organization 2020a march 11 organization 2020b march 27 wu et al 2009 yip cheung chau  law 2010 therefore the coronavirus anxiety scale cas lee 2020 was recently created to help identify those particularly affected by the fear and uncertainty of this growing pandemic crisis see table 1
the cas is a 5-item mental health screener designed to efficiently and effectively aid healthcare professionals and researchers identify probable cases of dysfunctional anxiety associated with the covid-19 crisis lee 2020 each item of the cas taps a distinct physiologically-based fear or anxiety reaction to coronavirus related thoughts or information it is important to note that coronavirus anxiety has also been referred to as coronaphobia in this emerging line of research asmundson  taylor 2020 the cas was developed using online data of 775 adults who experienced significant anxiety over the infectious disease outbreak in the study the cas demonstrated solid reliability s  93 for both an exploratory factor analysis subsample and a confirmatory factor analysis subsample validity ie factorial and construct-related and measurement equivalence across age race and gender cas scores were found to be correlated with coronavirus diagnosis impairment alcoholdrug coping religious coping hopelessness suicidal ideation as well as attitudes toward president trump and chinese foodproducts these correlations support the cas as a measure of mental health because coronavirus anxiety was related to clinically significant disturbances across psychological interpersonal and behavioral processes lee 2020 the cas exhibited good diagnostic properties auc  94 p  001 and with an optimized cut score of  9 it has been able to accurately distinguish between persons with and without dysfunctional anxiety 90 sensitivity and 85 specificity although these findings are promising there have been no other studies to date that examined the reliability of these results independent studies investigating the psychometric properties of the cas are absolutely essential for establishing the scientific legitimacy of this instrument thus the purpose of this study was to examine the reliability and validity of the cas using an online sample of 398 adultsonline survey data from 398 adults that were collected from march 23 to 24 2020 were used in this irb approved study the participants were recruited through amazon mturk in exchange for payment 050 and were eligible if they provided consent complete information and followed the directions to a validity itemthe studys sample consisted of 207 men and 191 women with a combined mean age of 3591 sd  1173 years see table 2

their likelihood of changing future plans m  407 sd  122 by the item how likely will you change your future travel vacation or shopping plans because of the coronavirusan adapted version of mundt marks shear and greists 2002 work and social adjustment scale wsas was used to measure functional impairment   88 participants were asked to rate five items of wsas using a 9-point severity scale 0  not at all to 8  very severely how much impairment they experienced because of their fear or anxiety over the coronavirus eg because of my fear or anxiety about coronavirus my home management cleaning tidying shopping cooking looking after home or children paying bills is impaired according to mundt et als 2002 analysis wsas scores  21 suggest moderately severe or worse psychopathology therefore using this cut score 317 of the sample were classified as functionally impaired due to their fear or anxiety over the coronavirusdysfunctional coronavirus related fear and anxiety were measured using the five-item long coronavirus anxiety scale cas lee 2020 the cas items which are based on the psychology of fear and anxiety literature american psychiatric association 2013 barlow 1991 cosmides

about the coronavirusa series of bootstrap 2000 samples maximum likelihood confirmatory factor analyses cfas were run on the cas to test the instruments factor structure and invariance across demographic groups conventional standards were used to determine goodness of fit and invariance brown 2006 byrne 2001 specifically acceptable fit for a cfa model was defined by a standardized root-mean-square residual srmr value  005 root-mean-square-error of approximation rmsea value  010 and comparative fit index cfi and tucker lewis index tli values  090 invariance was defined by acceptable model fit statistics as well as a non-significant value p  05 on a chi-square difference testa receiver operating characteristic roc analysis was used to examine the diagnostic accuracy of the cas to identify functionally impaired adults and test whether or not the cut-off value of  9 proposed by the original cas investigation lee 2020 continues to be an optimal score for psychiatric screening based on the results of previous psychiatric screening tests spitzer et al 2006 stockman and baker 2020 march 20 van dam gros earleywine  antony 2013 weinstein berwick goldman murphy  barsky

cut-score should have a sensitivity value  80 specificity value  70 and yield the highest youden index which is a commonly used measure of overall diagnostic effectiveness all of the statistical analyses were calculated using spss version 260 except for the cfas which were run using amos version 250a preliminary screening of the data suggested that the cas items were suitable for factor analysis tabachnick  fidell 2001 specifically the data did not have issues pertaining to sample size missing data nonnormality multicollinearity or singularity moreover the correlation matrices were deemed factorable bartletts test of sphericity  p  001 kaiser-meyer-olkin test  88a cfa was run to test whether or not the five symptoms identified in the original cas investigation lee 2020 cohered together into a single coronavirus anxiety construct the current studys results were consistent with the original cas investigation findings lee 2020 by demonstrating that the single-factor model was

investigation which showed that the cas factor structure was invariant across race gender and agereceiver operating characteristic roc analyses were used to evaluate the diagnostic viability of the cas as a mental health screening tool as well as determine a cut score that best distinguishes individuals who experience clinically significant impairment because of coronavirus anxiety individuals who scored  20 on the wsas from those who were not impaired by this form of anxiety the roc graph displayed the convex pattern that is indicative of good discrimination ability see figure 1
 while the area under the curve auc demonstrated solid diagnostic accuracy for the cas auc 88 p  001the results of the roc analysis also showed that the cas score  9 which is based on the results of the original cas investigation yielded the highest youden index among cut scores see table 3
 however this cut score also yielded a sensitivity of 76 which was below the 80 proposed guideline and a specificity of 90 which exceeded both the proposed criterion of 70 and original cas investigation finding of 85 although the sensitivity of the  9 cut score was just below the recommended criterion the overall diagnostic superiority of this cut-point over the other cas scores coupled with its excellent false positive rate of 10 continues to make this the optimal score to use for classifying individuals with functional impairment due to coronavirus related anxietyan analysis of variance anova showed that there was a race difference in cas scores f4393  335 p  05 post hoc analysis using the games-howell criterion for significance indicated that blacks m  726 sd  571 had significantly higher cas scores than asians m  311 sd  370 this pattern was opposite from what was found in the original cas investigation where asians had higher cas scores than blacks and whites no other race differences were found in cas scoresindependent samples t-tests revealed that those who were diagnosed m  1106 sd  413 with coronavirus had higher cas scores than those who were not diagnosed m  476 sd  504 with the infection t4274  835 p  001 while those who had a history of anxiety m  656 sd  524 had higher cas scores than those who did not m  465 sd  517 t26424  345 p  01 women m  619 sd  519 had higher cas scores compared to men m  446 sd  520 t39355  332 p  01 while correlation analysis see table 4
 showed that younger adults and people with higher education reported higher cas scores than their counterparts all of these patterns were consistent with the findings of the original cas investigation except for the small gender and history of anxiety effects which were not found previouslycorrelation analyses were also used to examine the relationships between cas scores and measures of impairment psychological distress and maladaptive coping cas scores were found to be positively correlated with functional impairment worry about coronavirus alcohol or drug coping negative religious coping extreme hopelessness passive suicidal ideation approval of president trumps responses to the coronavirus outbreak and likelihood of avoiding chinese food and products in the future there were no relationships found between cas scores and frequency thinking about or being exposed to coronavirus information and likelihood of changing future plans overall these patterns were generally consistent with the results of the original cas investigation and support the construct validity of the instrumentthe purpose of this study was to reevaluate the psychometric properties of the coronavirus anxiety scale cas which is to the best of our knowledge the first published measure of covid-19 related psychopathology lee 2020 in the original investigation of the cas the instrument was shown to be highly reliable s  93 with a stable and invariant factor structure lee 2020 moreover the diagnostic qualities of the cas were shown to be comparable to other psychiatric screening tests spitzer et al 2006 van dam et al 2013 weinstein et al 1989 the results of the present study largely confirm the findings of the original investigation of the cas which demonstrated that the cas is a scientifically valid and practical mental health screener for dysfunctional coronavirus related fear and anxietythe most robust findings in this study were the results of the confirmatory factor analyses specifically a cfa showed that the 5 physiologically-based reactions eg tonic immobility to coronavirus related thoughts or information that make up the cas cohere together into a stable unidimensional factor structure multiple group cfas also showed that the cas measures coronavirus related fear and anxiety in a similar way across age gender and race groups not only did these results replicate the findings of the original cas research they were also in keeping with other factor invariance studies of anxiety measures as well bunnell joseph  beidel 2013 kyriazos stalikas prassa  yotsidi 2018 madrigal et al 2018 mundt et al 2002the roc analyses also supported the diagnostic accuracy of the cas specifically the roc curve displayed both the desired convex shape and an auc score of 88 which are both indicative of a good test of discriminative power simundic 2009 the cut-off value of  9 proposed by the original cas investigation was also found to be an optimal score for psychiatric screening because it yielded the highest youden index among the scores this cut-off value also demonstrated a 10 false positive rate which is better than the 15 rate reported in the original cas investigation however the sensitivity rate of 76 was below the proposed guideline of 80 and much lower than the 90 found in the original cas studythis difference in sensitivity rates may be influenced by the fact that the sample in the original cas study was restricted to anxious adults while the current study was open to and received participants from the entire range of coronavirus related anxiety ie none to nearly everyday anxiety consequently the proportion of participants suffering from dysfunctional levels of coronavirus anxiety was much smaller for the current study 312 than the original cas study 548 lee 2020 despite this relative weaker detection rate it is important to note that a 76 sensitivity rate is still comparable to values reported with other mental health screenings tests such as the general health questionnaire 77 sensitivity weinstein et al 1989 the center for epidemiological studies depression scale 765 sensitivity shean  baldwin 2008 the state trait inventory for cognitive and somatic anxiety 73 sensitivity van dam et al 2013 and the distress thermometer 70 sensitivity jacobsen et al 2005because coronavirus anxiety otherwise known as coronaphobia asmundson  taylor 2020 is an emotion construct based on fear and anxiety apa 2013 barlow 1991 cosmides  tooby 2000 ekman 2003 ohman 2000 cas scores were expected to be associated with negative psychological effects and maladaptive coping with the covid-19 crisis the results supported these expectations with cas scores being positively correlated with functional impairment fear about coronavirus alcohol or drug coping negative religious coping extreme hopelessness and passive suicidal ideation the only unexpected finding was the lack of correlation between the cas scores and time spend thinking about andor watching media about coronavirus this may due to the fact that the topic of coronavirus saturated media reports when the data for this study was collected march 23rd and 24th 2020 despite this one discrepancy the findings not only support the construct validity of the cas by demonstrating clear links with indices of maladjustment and distress but replicate the findings of the original cas investigation as wellthe results of this study also revealed significant sociodemographic and background differences in cas scores specifically the participants who were younger more educated and were diagnosed with coronavirus had higher cas scores compared to their counterparts these findings replicated the original cas investigation results although the findings that women and those with a history of anxiety exhibited slightly higher cas scores compared to their counterparts was not found in the original cas investigation these findings are understandable because they are known risk factors for various anxiety disorders apa 2013another unexpected finding was that while blacks had higher cas scores than asians in this study asians had higher cas scores than blacks in the original cas investigation lee 2020 this change in coronavirus anxiety may have to do with the fact that the coronavirus spread at a much higher and lethal rate in the black community relative to other communities toward the end of march 2020 when this study was conducted johnson  buford 2020 asians on the other hand did not show elevated rates of coronavirus in their communities during this period of time and therefore did not show signs of considerable coronavirus anxiety the high coronavirus anxiety observed among asians living in the us earlier in march 2020 when the coronavirus was beginning to spread in the us may have reflected their greater sensitivity and awareness of this disease outbreak because of what they learned from their friends and relatives in asia who were already living through the pandemic crisis we anticipate that as this pandemic unfolds and affects different pockets of society so too will the impact of coronavirus anxiety and the research findings for this constructcas scores were also found to influence social attitudes in the same way as the original cas investigation specifically the positive association between cas scores and approval of president trumps responses to the coronavirus crisis was in accordance with the conservative shifts phenomenon where people tend to become more conservative in their political attitudes during existential crises jost stern rule  sterling 2017 nail  mcgregor 2009 the positive correlation between cas scores and avoidance of chinese food and products also follow a trend that occurred during the 2003 sars outbreak when the chinese disease scare led to a mass avoidance of chinese people and their businesses fang 2020 keil  ali 2006 in sum these results support the construct validity of the cas by demonstrating that this form of anxiety is not only associated with impairment and distress but it also seems to permeate all facets of ones life from coping to social attitudesthe clinical and research benefits of efficiently screening people for dysfunctional anxiety related to the coronavirus are immense given the magnitude of this growing health crisis asmundson  taylor 2020 for instance healthcare employees need to be physically and mentally healthy to work effectively at the frontlines of combating the coronavirus outbreak however many healthcare workers around the globe feel the overwhelming strain of this pandemic as the number of infections and deaths rise and the medical resources become scarcer in recent reports of hospital workers in china a considerable proportion of them experience depression anxiety and insomnia which is believed to be attributable to many factors such as a fear of being infected with the virus and spreading the disease to their friends and family lai et al 2020 liu et al 2020many american healthcare workers are also afraid of becoming infected with the virus and spreading it to their patients and loved ones because of the mass shortage of protective equipment in the us stockman  baker 2020 if these healthcare workers are not identified and treated appropriately they could put themselves and others at risk for health complications because they may be too overwhelmed by anxiety to be effective at their jobs moreover as the results of this study and the original cas investigation suggest individuals with dysfunctional coronavirus anxiety engage in high levels of drug and alcohol coping and frequently experience suicidal ideation and hopelessness all of which are extremely problematic in their own right therefore the cas could be used to alleviate this potential concern and with the proven success rate of telehealth particularly in the treatment of anxiety the delivery of online psychotherapy may be a practical solution to this growing problem khatri marziali tchernikov  shepherd 2014this research has several limitations worth noting first the results of this study may not generalize to the population at large because the sample used was not based on a probabilistic sampling method instead the sample used in this study were from mturks online labor market however systematic research on mturk has demonstrated that mturk participants are at least as diverse as typical internet and traditional methods and the data derived from this source are of high quality buhrmester kwang  gosling 2011 nonetheless researchers should seek to verify this studys results using probabilistic sampling techniques second the use of single-item scales in this study could have oversimplified the results because only one aspect of a construct was measured although single-item scales can have comparable psychometric properties as multi-item instruments bergkvist  rossiter 2007 future research should nonetheless reproduce this study using multi-item scales last the use of only one validity item may not have effectively identified all of the participants who provided invalid answers due to inattention future research should incorporate multiple validity items that are scattered throughout the survey to obtain higher quality data despite these limitations this study reports vital data

parsimony mp studies by using mega x kumar et al 2018 to understand the ancestral origin and antigenic resemblance of sars-cov-2 with other coronaviruses in addition pairwise sequence alignment of sars-cov-2 proteins with other viral strains was performed by the emboss needle online software which uses the needleman-wunsch alignment algorithm to find the optimum alignment including gaps of two sequences along their entire length chojnacki et al 2017 moreover sequence alignment was also visualized and analyzed by using jalview software httpswwwjalvieworgtargeting potential antigens from viral proteins is crucial for constructing peptide-based vaccine molecules that can interact with b lymphocytes hasan et al 2019a it was reported that peptide flexibility and proper surface accessibility are prerequisites for being a potential b cell epitope considering those parameters the immunogenic peptide sequences from four types of viral proteins were determined by using the b cell epitope prediction tools of the immune epitope database iedb vita et al 2015 which employs the bepipred linear epitope prediction method larsen et al 2006 the vaxijen v20 server httpwwwddgpharmfacnetvaxijen was used for screening out the most immunogenic peptides determined from iedb vita et al 2015 however epitope conservancy analysis is an important step to determine the degree of desired epitope distribution in its homologous protein set in this study the conservancy pattern of mostly immunogenic b cell peptide sequences of covid-19 was compared with other homologous sequences retrieved from the ncbi database by using blastp hasan et al 2019b moreover the conservancy study of immunogenic peptides predicted from the sars-cov-2 proteins was also compared against other human coronavirus strains hcov-229e hcov-oc43 sars-cov hcov-nl63 hku1 and mers-cov the epitope conservancy analysis tool httptoolsiedborgconservancy of the iedb was used to continue the conservancy analysis hasan et al 2019chomology modeling of spike glycoprotein p0dtc2 membrane proteinp0dtc5 envelope protein p0dtc4 and nucleoprotein p0dtc9 of sars-cov-2 was performed by using the i-tasser server zhang 2008 although 3d structures were generated by multiple threading alignments in the i-tasser server refinement was conducted using modrefiner xu and zhang 2011 followed by the fg-md refinement server to improve the accuracy of the predicted 3d modeled structure zhang et al 2011 modrefiner allowed for significant improvements in the physical quality of the local structure based on hydrogen bonds side-chain positioning and backbone topology of the native-state proteins again fg-md a molecular dynamics-based algorithm for structure refinement usually works at the atomic level the refined protein structure was further validated by rampage wang et al 2016 and eraat analyses gundampati et al 2012structures were visualized and analyzed by pymol l delano 2002we illustrated the number of cases and deaths of sars-cov-2 in a consecutive way through graphs to elucidate the pattern of occurrence of those outcomes we covered country-wise cases and deaths the onset of global and chinese cases by date the global death toll per day and province-wise cases and deaths in chinawe calculated the crude mortality rate and case fatality according to the formulas suggested by the cdc cdc 2020 as well as jacob and ganguli jacob 2008 here we calculated the crude mortality rate for those countries and for chinese provinces having death records per 1 crore persons for better interpretationit is already known that the sars-cov-2 can multiply even at high temperatures especially temperatures higher than 15 c chan et al 2011 kampf et al 2020 however sars-cov-2 is rapidly inactivated at 20 c kampf et al 2020 therefore temperature plays a great role in its multiplication for this purpose recent environmental temperature data from the place of first occurrence as well as bangladesh were obtained from landsat-8 satellite data this satellite provides high spatial resolution 30 m data at 15-day intervals using the brightness temperature of band number 10 tir-1 and emissivity data temperature in c of bands 4 and 5 l8 data users handbook a large area a 30-km-wide swath can be obtained for a time with minor deviation from in situ temperature data maximum 045 degree celsius sd therefore cloudless or less cloudy images less than 90 were obtained from the usgs webpage wwwearthexplorerusggov a maximum of 2 data points were available for one area in each month however neighboring path and row image borders shared some common areas which provided more frequencies for those overlapped areas level-1 tier-1 images which are radiometrically and geometrically corrected were used in this studyfirst all images fulfilling the cloud-related conditions were downloaded a total of 90 images covering the land areas of wuhan china korea italy and bangladesh were downloaded then dn of band 10 data were converted to emissivity and simultaneously converted to brightness temperature by using eq 1 cahyono et al 2017 then the emissivity was converted to temperature

nucleoproteins of sars-cov-2 hcov-229e hcov-oc43 sars-cov hcov-nl63 hku1 mers-cov hku4 hku5 and bufcov-hku26 clearly demonstrated the ancestral origin and distant evolutionary relationships of the newly epidemic novel coronavirus covid-19 it was found that sars-cov-2 was evolutionarily related to sars-cov fig 1
 in every case sars-cov-2 aligned with the same clade of sars-cov where two bat-originated coronaviruses hku4 and hku5were found to have divergent relationships with covid-19 rather hku4 and hku5 showed ancestral relationships with mers-cov moreover bufcov-hku26 of bangladesh origin always showed a phylogenetic relationship with the animal-originated coronavirus hcov-oc43 multiple sequence alignment msa of covid-19 proteins with sars-cov and bufcov-hku26 proteins is shown in fig 2
i and ii the results clearly suggested that major proteins four proteins of sars-cov-2 were more aligned with the sars-cov proteins which might strengthen the claim of evolutionary convergent relation of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov fig 2 i on the other hand the major proteins of bufcov-hku26 were also employed to msa with sars-cov and study found that there were significant dissimilarities between these two strains fig 2 ii moreover pairwise sequence alignment by emboss needle strengthened the phylogenetic relationship of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov table 1
included the similarity and identical pattern of sars-cov-2 proteins with their homologous proteins of other coronaviruses it had been raveled that sars-cov-2 proteins were highly similar and identical with sars-cov proteins for examples spike membrane envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of sars-cov-2 showed that approximately 764 905 947 and 905 nucleotide similarities with the respective protein molecules of sars-cov again in case of identity pattern results showed that spike membrane envelope and nucleoproteins of sars-cov-2 were 870 964 961 and 943 identical with the respective homologous proteins of sars-cov besides fewer level of similarity and identical patterns were found with other viral strains including bufcov-hku26 of bangladesh origin table 1four types of viral proteins supplementary file 1 of sars-cov-2 hcov-229e hcov-oc43 sars-cov hcov-nl63 hku1 mers-cov hku4 hku5 and bufcov-hku26 were employed to determine the most antigenic sites by using the b cell epitope prediction tool of iedb and vaxijen scoring the vaxijen server which gave a result well above the threshold value 040 usually reveals the immunogenic potential to stimulate a protective response in host organisms flower et al 2017 from the analysis a total of 17 epitopes from s proteins 1 epitope from m proteins 1 epitope from e proteins and 5 epitopes from n proteins were found to be mostly immunogenic in sars-cov-2 with almost 100 of peptides carrying more than the threshold value of the antigenic score of the vaxijen server table 2 similarly other coronavirus proteins also showed different lengths of immunogenic epitope candidates with values exceeding the antigenic threshold supplementary table 1 moreover homologous sequences of sars-cov-2 s m e and n proteins were retrieved from the ncbi database supplementary file 2 and were subjected to conservancy analysis with the immunogenic epitopes from sars-cov-2 proteins it was found that antigenic sites are almost conserved in all of the homologous protein sequences deposited in the ncbi database table 2 cross-checked conservancy analysis of covid-19 antigenic epitopes with sars-cov proteins showed that conservancy when cross-checked with other coronaviruses including bufcov-hku26 of bangladesh origin was not significant table 3the 3d structures of the sars-cov-2 proteins were modeled using the i-tasser server where sars-cov complex with human neutralizing s230 antibody fab fragment pdb id 6nb6 membrane protein complex pdb id 5x5y coronavirus envelope proteins pdb id 2 mm4 and sars cov nucleocapsid pdb id 1ssk acted as the top threading templates of the s m e and n proteins respectively the sars-cov-2 proteins showed 36 to 93 coverage and 40 to above 90 identity to the i-tasser template proteins supplementary table 3 as i-tasser usually deduces 5 different models for each operation refinement by modrefiner and validation by rampage and errat were performed to check the accuracy of the modeled structuresafter the refinement process ramachandran plot analysis was investigated to fix the structural accuracy from homology modeling ramachandran plot could do the placement of amino acids from modeled protein structure following the all attributes of structural biology from where comparatively better model could be screened out the present study revealed that the spike protein of sars-cov-2 showed 752 residues in the favored region 148 residues in the allowed region and only 10 residues in the outlier region fig 3 ia on the other hand membrane protein exhibited 777 residues in the favored region 15 residues in the allowed region and only 7 residues in the outlier region fig 3 ib in addition two other envelopes and nucleoproteins also showed the highest number of residues in the favored regions 74 for e and 681 for n and a lower number of residues 73 for e and 115 for n in the outlier regions fig 3 ic and id again for assuring more structural validity of the constructed models the results of errat had been analyzed it had been found that values of the highest quality factor from the modeled sars-cov-2proteins s  71 m  88 e  89 and e  73 were significant fig 3ii and supplementary table 3 in addition the probable immunogenic epitopes of major sars-cov-2 proteins were studied in the previous steps and here all of the predicted immunogenic epitopes of sars-cov-2were presented into the validated 3d structures of the s m e and e by using pymol in fig 4over two and half months from its outbreak on 31 december 2019 to 20 march

occurrence of the disease per day from 22 january 2020 to 05 february 2020 and in the same way a steady decreasing trend from 06 february 2020 to 16 february 2020 interestingly on 17 february 2020 the number of cases worldwide 19572 cases and in china 19461 cases soared suddenly however the number started declining up until 25 february 2020 and then started rising sharply and reached to an apex on 20 march 2020 with 43957 cases fascinatingly after 25 february 2020 cases outside china increased more than those in china which was an alarming signal that covid-19 became a pandemic fig 5iand supplementary fig 1the first death by covid-19 occurred on 11 january 2000 and by 19 january 2020 another three persons had died the global death toll fig 6c started to increase from 20 january 2020

the satellite-derived temperatures c for wuhan china south korea italy and bangladesh during february 2020 are shown in fig 7
 in this figure a single scale at the rightmost part of the image is used to indicate the temperature for all subimages however for the wuhan area no cloud-free clear image data were available for the western part of the image for that period therefore only the eastern part is shown here similarly during the study period in the mid-region of korea the temperature was very low which was caused by the presence of heavy and widespread clouds in that region during satellite image acquisition however very few clouds covers were found for the landsat-8 image acquisition for february 2020 for the italy areas in almost all areas temperature were lower than 20 c except a few places where the temperature did not exceeded 25 c therefore interpretations from the figures for these regions should be guarded in order to avoid errorsthe novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 became a pandemic because of its global spread jung et al 2020 coronaviruses are one of the most diverse groups of viruses and have emerged as deadly pathogens of the human race with sars-cov-2 being the latest added to the list in most cases human coronaviruses evolve from zoonotic transmission and bats are reported as the best reservoirs for zoonotic viruses graham and baric 2010 although the causative agent of covid-19 has already been declared sars-cov-2 lai et al 2020 phan 2020 we adopted a protein-based phylogenetic study to reveal the phylogenetic relationships and divergent links of sars-cov-2 with other human coronavirus strains seven coronaviruses covid-19 hcov-229e hcov-oc43 sars-cov hcov-nl63 hku1 and mers-cov two bat-originated coronaviruses hku4 and hku5 and one buffalo-originated coronavirus bufcov-hku26 reported from bangladesh were subjected to phylogenetic analysis of four types of their viral proteins s m e and n proteins it was clearly demonstrated that sars-cov-2 and sars-cov shared asimilar pattern of ancestral origin fig 1 and pairwise alignment indicated maximum similarity and identity between these two viruses table 1 and fig 2 recently after the rapid transmission of sars-cov-2 and the resulting deaths who 2020c wu et al 2020 bogoch et al 2020 chinazzi et al 2020 the who announced the genetic similarities between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov which were clearly reflected in the present study in addition hku4 and hku5 are bat-originated coronaviruses and the similar genetic makeup of the other viral strains could indicate a similar host preference desjardins et al 2010 although there were a few unclear reports regarding the possibilities of bats as reservoirs of sars-cov-2 giovanetti et al 2020 benvenuto et al 2020b however the divergent phylogenetic relationships and minor alignment patterns of sars-cov-2 with the bat-originated viruses hku4 and hku5 suggested that there was a low possibility of sars-cov-2 being connected with bats fig 1 and table 1as the ncbi database until now documented only the genome materials of a buffalo coronavirus bufcov hku26 from domestic water buffaloes bubalus bubalis in bangladesh lau et al 2016 a comparative study of bufcov-hku26 with sars-cov-2 was employed with phylogenetic analysis and pairwise alignment of the targeted viral proteins the study revealed that bufcov-hku26 showed divergent relationships and low pairwise alignment of s 295 identity and 442 similarity m 374 identity and 557 similarity e 209 identity and 442 similarity and n proteins 327 identity and 486 similarity with sars-cov-2 however as bufcov-hku26 is an animal-originated coronavirus its proteins always exhibited an ancestral relationship with the other animal-originated virus hcov-oc43 fig 1 bufcov-hku26 was detected in bangladesh which suggests that the country does provide a favorable environment for the transmission and pathogenesis of buffalo-originated coronaviruses sooryanarain and elankumaran 2015 rowe and east 1997 as the genetic architecture of sars-cov-2 was highly divergent from that of bufcov-hku26 fig 1 fig 2 and table 1 and viral transmission or pathogenesis is directly or indirectly governed by the genetic makeup of the virus it is possible that the conditions in bangladesh could be less favorable for the high occurrence of covid-19 although technical supports and policy level management could also influence the rapid transmission of any pandemicthe novel coronavirus has been making headlines since it first came to light late in 2019 covid-19 has already spread to all continents except antarctica geographically bangladesh is located in a temperate zone we performed a comparative study of the temperatures between bangladesh wuhan south korea and italy interestingly temperature could be another factor reducing the risks of covid-19 to bangladesh although the country still has as a high risk index haider et al 2020athe high temperature and high humidity can effectively reduce the transmission of the covid-19 wang et al 2020a and temperature variation and humidity may be important factors affecting the covid-19 mortality ma et al 2020 however experts cannot yet predict the trajectory of the virus covid-19 sars-cov-2 might have different persistence times on inanimate surfaces but these times should be similar to those of sars-associated viruses 34 days kramer et al 2006 human coronaviruses such as middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus and endemic human coronaviruses hcov can persist on inanimate surfaces but not for long periods of time chan et al 2011 kampf et al 2020 however at lower temperatures such as 4 c or less this virus persisted for as long as 28 days and the lowest level of inactivation occurred at 20 relative humidity inactivation was more rapid at 20 c than at 4 c at all humidity levels likewise coronaviruses were inactivated more rapidly at 40 c than at 20 c kampf et al 2020 recently the authors established that temperature significantly changed covid-19 transmission in 429 cities in which covid-19 appeared to spread fastest at 872 c wang et al 2020b moreover scientists discovered that sars-cov-2 has mutated into a more aggressive disease tang et al 2020 population genetic analyses of sars-cov-2 genomes indicate two major lineages designated l and s with a higher possibility of infection by both types the ancestral s-type is suspected to be less infectious and milder in severity 30 while the later emerging l-type is more prevalent 70 tang et al 2020 if the continuing evolution of sars-cov-2 continues countries such as bangladesh will truly be in great trouble as human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the l type which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly tang et al 2020 although according to the who this virus is unique in its continuous mutation who 2020a until now there has been no concrete evidence that the virus has already changed with regards to disease severity or infectivity however based on this brief discussion it can be presumed that this virus has a lower possibility of vertical spread and lower severity in countries or seasons with relatively higher temperatures respectively thus in affected countries covid-19 might disappear with rising temperatures when spring comes however caution should be used when interpreting these kinds of computer-based studies more comprehensive genomic data are required for further testing of this hypothesisin fig 7 the temperatures of wuhan china south korea italy and bangladesh during february 2020 are compared it can be observed that the temperature ranged from 13 to 22 c in many places of wuhan korea as well as in italy however across bangladesh the temperatures were above 25 c except for a very few small areas with temperatures of approximately 20 c which were caused by small patches of cloud cover thus the temperature is much higher in bangladesh than in wuhan korea and italy we know that during this period of modern science many people are moving from one place to another which allows for vertical spread of any severe disease from any small place to areas all over the world similarly coronavirus has spread to more than 182 countries and territories including a recent introduction into bangladesh however these temperature data indicate that if the virus has not yet undergone mutation to be able to sustain high temperatures such as 25 c which occur in bangladesh there is less possibility of this virus replication moreover currently in march the temperature may have increased considerably giving hope that the virus will not multiply much only 20 cases including 1 death of covid-19 have been confirmed in bangladesh as of march 20 2020 however more people 10929 cases and 183 deaths as of may 5 2020 documented to have been affected while visiting other countries are being treated carefully in quarantine which might result in the fast disappearance of covid-19 with little or no spread due to the higher temperatures in bangladesh the largest international airport in bangladesh is situated in dhaka and is a main entrance for people from all over the world as dhaka is an industrial and commercial zone and all the official works of bangladesh are centralized here most of the visitors or people returning to the country stay here for an extended period due to industrialization the temperature of dhaka is much higher than that of any other parts of bangladesh which is also evident from fig 7 d indicated by the black circle in the figure many of the scientists and pathologists revealed that high temperature and humidity able to restrict the spread of covid-19 and spread of disease will be suppressed as the weather warms sajadi et al 2020 zhang and zeng 2020 this also supports our hypothesis interestingly coronaviruses that cause colds do tend to subside in warmer months however it is highly uncertain whether sars-cov-2 will behave the same way current research by scientists is too early to predict how the virus will respond to changing weather national geographic 2020immunogenicity and epitope conservancy analyses of coronavirus proteins were performed to determine the potential b-cell epitopes that would interact efficiently with b lymphocytes to initiate the immune response against specific viral pathogens klingen et al 2018 the study identified a total of 24 highly immunogenic b-cell epitopes from sars-cov-2 proteins 17 epitopes of s 1 epitope of m 1 epitope of e 5 epitopes of n proteins conservancy analysis table 3 demonstrated that selected epitopes were highly conserved in other homologous strains of sars-cov-2 which suggested the possibility of peptide-based vaccine development from s m n or e proteins azim et al 2019 abdulla et al 2019 preethika nair 2020 moreover potential b-cell epitopes were also identified from hcov-229e hcov-oc43 sars-cov hcov-nl63 hku1 mers-cov hku4 hku5 and bufcov-hku26 proteins supplementary table 1 the antigenic sites of covid-19 were also crosschecked with other coronavirus-corresponding proteins table 3 higher levels of conservation among antigenic epitope sites of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov supported a similar ancestry in their pathogenicity in contrast antigenic epitopes from sars-cov-2 exhibited the minimum conservancy pattern with bufcov-hku26 which suggested a distinct pathogenicity pattern between sars-cov-2 and bufcov-hku26the national health authorities of china detected a cluster of 44 pneumonia patients of unknown etiology from 31 december 2019 to 3 january 2020 in wuhan city hubei province of china and reported this detection to the who chinese office who 2020c moreover on 7 january they identified the pathogen as a novel coronavirus world health organization who 2020 similar to covid-19 the world experienced an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 caused by a coronavirus also originating from china guangdong province which was suggested to be a potential zone of re-emergence of coronaviruses lai et al 2020 who 2020d however on 14 march 2020 who declared europe as new epicentre of covid-19 outbreak syariz et al 2015within a very short time covid-19 was transmitted globally who 2020c wu et al 2020 bogoch et al 2020 chinazzi et al 2020 world health organization who 2020 by 20 march 2020 the viruses had spread to up to 182 countries and territories and one cruise ship named diamond princess in japan worldometers covid-19 coronavirus outbreak 2020 infecting 253796 persons globally who 2020c in contrast sars infected 8450 persons and caused 810 deaths globally in 33 countries chen et al 2005 moreover mers another coronavirus associated with an epidemic started in saudi arabia in september 2012 and spread to up to 27 countries affecting a total of 2494 persons and causing 858 deaths throughout the world up to november 2019 who 2020b therefore covid-19 has already covered approximately 552 times more countries than sars and mers who 2020c chen et al 2005 in addition up to 20 march covid-19 has been attributed 3003 and 10176 times more cases and 1285 and 1213 times more deaths globally than sars and mers respectively worldometers covid-19 coronavirus outbreak 2020 chen et al 2005 who 2020b although the occurrence of cases per day was high in china at the beginning of the outbreak after 25 february 2020 the number of cases declined in china and dramatically increased outside of china for example all of italy has been placed under lockdown due to covid-19 the majority of the cases are in mainland china followed by italy spain iran germany usa france and korea and the world health organization has formally declared the covid-19 outbreak a pandemic in march 11 2020 who 2020c jung et al 2020the case fatality of covid-19 as of 19 march was 410 and 400 globally and in china respectively this calculation agrees with the report of wang et al wang et al 2020c who stated that the global case fatality was close to 3 however the global case fatalities of sars 960 and mers 3440 were higher than that of covid-19 who 2020b cameron et al 2008 by february 2020 the case fatality of china was 380 worldometers covid-19 coronavirus outbreak 2020 which supports our estimate despite the lower case fatality than the previous coronaviruses sars and mers covid-19 poses a great burden across the world in terms of geographical coverage occurrence of cases and death toll and became a pandemic causing extensive public panic the covid-19 coronavirus has spread in the neighboring countries of bangladesh as well it has also spread in the middle east a region with which bangladesh has economic relationships therefore bangladesh faces a high risk of being affected by novel coronavirus outbreaks as the virus has already spread in different parts of the globe over182 countries and territories reported covid-19 cases with more than 253796 people infected globally as of march 20 2020 who 2020c global health policycovid-19 coronavirus tracker 2020 even the

on the genomic structure and phylogenetic analysis the subfamily orthocoronavirinae consists of four genera namely alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus among these alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus infects only mammals and are responsible for respiratory infection in humans and enteritis in animals two major zoonotic pathogenic coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov belong to the genus betacoronavirus the genus betacoronavirus further distributed in five subgenus among which sarbecovirus contains sars-cov and the novel coronavirus 2019-ncov de groot et al 2012 the other subgenera under betacoronavirus are embecovirus hibecovirus merbecovirus and nobecovirusthe ncov contains at least six open reading frames orfs and many other accessory genes like other covs the 5 terminal two-thirds of the genome contains two open reading frames orfs orf1 and orf2 which encodes two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab which is further cleaved into 11 and 16 proteins respectively these 16 mature proteins are responsible for several important functions in genome maintenance and virus replication the structural proteins namely spike s an envelope protein e membrane protein m and nucleocapsid n are located at the one-third 3 terminal of the genome in addition to these genes there are several accessory proteins which help in virus replication the s gene is one of the most important genes for receptor binding and host specificity some coronaviruses have hemagglutinin-esterase he protein in their virionduring the first week of december 2019 a few cases of pneumonia appeared in the city of wuhan hubei province of china the patients exhibited a history of visiting the local nearby huanan seafood market which deals in the sale of different live animals where zoonotic animal-to-human transmission suspected as the main route of disease origin hui et al 2020 firstly the affected patients presented with pneumonia-like symptoms followed by a severe acute respiratory infection some cases showed rapid development of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards followed by serious complications in the respiratory tract on jan 7th 2020 it was confirmed by the chinese center for disease control and prevention cdc that a new coronavirus has emerged and was named 2019-ncov as on february 4th 2020 china has confirmed 20471 cases with 425 deaths and 2788 severe cases of 2019-ncov in addition to china 24 different countries from europe northern america southeast asia eastern mediterranean and western pacific asia have reported the confirmed cases of this disease making the total tally of confirmed cases to 20630 worldwide figure 2 although the mortality rate due to 2019-ncov is comparatively lesser than the earlier outbreaks of sars and mers-covs as well as this virus presents relatively mild manifestations the total number of cases are increasing speedily and are crossing the old census there is a high risk of human-to-human transmission which has also been reported in family clusters and medical workers the infected patients with ncov exhibit high fever and dyspnea with chest radiographs showing acute invasive lesions in both lungsin this study we also attempted to reveal the evolutionary perspective of the recently emerging 2019-ncov based on the complete genome analysis phylogenetic analysis was done using the mega 70 version applying the maximum likelihood method ml based general time reversible substitution model with the available whole genome sequences of 2019-ncov available in the ncbi genbank database till january 28th 2020 pairwise identity of the current 2019-ncov outbreak sequences was calculated using the megalign software of dnastar in the whole genome phylogenetic analysis the 2019-ncov strains from china and the usa clustered in a monophyletic clade figure 3 the nearest neighbors of the 2019-ncov isolates from china and usa were two batsars-like coronaviruses bat-sl-covzc45 accession no mg772933 and bat-sl-covzxc21 accession no mg772934 these two batsars-like covs shared a 100 bootstrap support with 2019-ncov strains of the current outbreak using the megalign and mega 70 software based clustal w alignments the nucleotide sequence identity of 2019-ncov strains revealed the highest similarity of greater than 882 with two batsarslike covs these findings were in accordance with report of zhu and colleagues where a nearby sequence identity of 869 with previously published batsars-like cov was reported zhu et al 2020 contrarily the genome of 2019-ncov has also been reported to be 96 identical to the bat coronavirus based on simplot analysis where it has been found closer to bat cov isolate ratg13 previously detected in rhinolophus affinis intermediate horseshoe bat from yunnan province indicating its origin from the bats zhou et al 2020 based on the available information it is rather early to predict the origin of this novel coronavirus without a comprehensive analysis of emerging ncov strains from different parts of the world to note the sequence identity based on the complete genome sequences between current outbreaks 2019-ncov isolates from china and the usa ranges 998 to 100 on the nucleotide level indicating their common origin of evolutionwe furthermore extended the analysis targeting the spike s glycoprotein gene of the covs from human sars animal-origin covs including mersv camel bovine coronavirus canine coronavirus batcoronaviruses and the current outbreak ncovs from different regions the sequences of ncov available in the ncbi genbank database till january 28th 2020 were retrieved phylogenetic analysis was done using the mega 70 version applying the maximum likelihood method ml based general time reversible substitution model with gamma distribution pairwise identity of the current 2019-ncov outbreak sequences was calculated using the megalign software of dnastar in the s-gene based phylogeny 10 chinese and 5 usa ncov isolates figure 4 revealed that all the isolates are nearly identical across the s-gene based phylogeny constituting a monophyletic clade figure 4 the two batsars-like covs bat-sl-covzc45 mg772933 and bat-sl-covzxc21 mg772934 shared 100 bootstrap support with 2019-ncov isolates of the current outbreaks based on the megalign and mega 70 software based clustal w alignments the sequence identity of 2019-ncov strains revealed bat sars-like covs bat-sl-covzc45 mg772933 and bat-sl-covzxc21 mg772934 as the nearest neighbors with 776 to 782 sequence identity on nucleotide basis in the phylogenetic tree the current outbreak ncov isolates were fairly distinct than the previously reported sars-cov or batsars-cov strains but were clustering inside a common major clade which includes strains from subgenus sarbecovirus the per cent identity with other sars-cov or batsars-cov strains was 708 to 747 supplementary data 1 the per cent similarity on nucleotide basis between ncov isolates and canine respiratory coronaviruses crcov and bovine coronaviruses bcov of subgenus embecovirus ranged between 408 to 415 furthermore the per cent identity of ncov isolates was found lower 402 with the mild respiratory human coronavirus isolate hcov-oc43 of same subgenus embecovirus containing animal-origin coronavirusesadditionally for s-gene per cent similarity range pattern was evaluated in amino acid based index where 2019-ncov isolates from china and usa were 100 identical the range varied between 812 to 818 and 770 to 781 for 2019-ncov isolates with batsars-like covs and other sars like covs respectively the per cent identity with human coronavirus isolate hcov-oc43 was also found lower 280 supplementary data 2overall the nucleotide and amino acid based per cent identities indicate toward highly diverged nature of novel coronaviruses to note in the phylogenetic tree the 2019-ncov isolates classified in subgenus sarbecovirus and the sequences from crcov bcov and hcov-oc43 isolates clustered in subgenus embecovirusin the genomic analysis the s gene of 2019-ncovs was found to exhibit lower sequence identity with other betacoronaviruses difference in spike protein encoded by 2019-ncov compared with the bat sars-like covs sars-cov and mers-cov is depicted in figure 5 the length of s protein of ncov is longer 1282 amino acids than other two viruses sars-1255 amino acid and batsl-1246 amino acids under the same sarbecovirus subgenus the s protein of ncov has been detected with three short insertions at the n-terminal region along with four changes in the receptor binding motif inside the receptor binding domain in comparison with sars-cov zhou et al 2020 several previous studies have shown the usage of different receptors for covs like human ace2 for sars-cov and cd26 for mers-cov lu et al 2020 identical motifs and residues to that of sars-covs have been identified in the ncov yet they show divergence based on phylogeny letko and munster 2020 a recent finding proves that the binding capacity of ncov s protein with human ace2 is as efficient as sars-cov which further promotes the human-to-human transmission letko and munster 2020several attempts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus infection in the past decades but the degree of cross-protection provided by such vaccines is greatly limited due to the extensive diversity in antigenic variants even within the strains of a phylogenetic sub-cluster graham et al 2013 as for mers and sars coronaviruses there is no licensed specific antiviral treatment or vaccine available till now however few of the advances made in developing vaccines and therapeutics for sars-cov and mers-cov could be exploited for the countering 2019-ncov but since the efforts to design and develop any vaccine or antiviral agent to tackle the presently emerging coronavirus pathogen would take some time therefore till then we need to rely extensively on enforcing highly effective prevention and control measures to minimize the risk of 2019-ncov transmission and spread to the best feasible extent cheng et al 2020 majority of the vaccines that are being developed for coronaviruses targets the spike glycoprotein or s protein graham et al 2013 this is mainly because of the fact that s protein is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies jiang et al 2005 several kinds of vaccines and antiviral drugs that are based on s protein have been previously evaluated among them the s protein-based vaccines include full-length s protein vaccines viral vector-based vaccine dna-based vaccine recombinant s protein-based and recombinant rbd protein-based vaccines whereas s protein based antiviral therapies include rbdace2 blockers s cleavage inhibitors fusion core blockers neutralizing antibodies protease inhibitors s protein inhibitors and small interfering rnas du et al 2009 even though such therapeutic options have proven efficacy in the in vitro studies however most of these havent undergone randomized animal or human trials and hence are of limited use in our present 2019-ncov scenario remdesivir is a novel nucleotide analog prodrug that was intended to be used for the treatment of ebola virus disease it also has anti-coronavirus activity due to its inhibitory action on the sars-cov and mers-cov replication sheahan et al 2017 at present efforts are being made to identify and develop monoclonal antibodies that are specific and effective against 2019-ncov combination therapy with 2019-ncov specific monoclonal antibodies and remdesivir can be considered as the ideal therapeutic option for 2019-ncov cohen 2020 further evaluation is required before confirming the efficacy of such combination therapy a variety of different therapeutic and vaccine designing approaches against coronaviruses are being explored and yet to be evaluated in terms of their potency efficacy and safety but hopefully the process of evaluation will be accelerated in the coming days cyranoski 2020 lu 2020 pillaiyar et al 2020 zaher et al 2020seeing the possible role of animals in 2019-ncov infection who in its advice for public recommended to avoid the unprotected contact with both farm and wild animals world health organization 2020a the live-animal markets such as in china could provide chances to animal covs to get transmitted to humans and these markets may act as critical places for the origin of novel zoonotic pathogens and pose high public health risks during an outbreakthe emergency pathogens could be counteracted by opting immediate and timely international collaborative efforts cooperative efforts between human and animal health sectors other effective measures include one health approach implementation of effective prevention and control strategies rapid communication and networking and exploring advances in science and technology for developing rapid and confirmatory diagnostics enhancing disease surveillance and monitoring implementation of strict biosecurity measures and timely efforts toward designing appropriate and effective vaccines and therapeutics cheng et al 2020 cohen 2020 cyranoski 2020 lu 2020 munjal et al 2017 singh et al 2017in the present scenario of not having any direct acting anti-viral agent and vaccines strict implementation of high vigilance for 2019-ncov and appropriate prevention and control measures are of utmost importance to check the further spread and control of this virus cheng et al 2020 researchers and authorities who cdc atlanta and others across the globe are working to combat the current ongoing 2019-ncov outbreaks identifying the possible origin of this novel virus and to design and develop effective vaccines and therapeutics cohen 2020 cyranoski 2020 lu 2020 mahase 2020 studying the virus in details its molecular biology and immunology adaptive genetic changes mutations and recombination events elucidating clinical pathology and pathogenesis identifying the route of origin role of any mixing vessels like birds pigs and mammals jumping the species barrier zoonotic potential human-to-human transmission events altogether would pave ways for designing effective prevention and control measures to counter 2019-ncovthe ncov is the most recently emerging virus after the past episodes and panics haunted by ebola zika and nipah viruses as well as earlier emergencies posed by bird flu and swine flu viruses the emerging novel coronavirus 2019-ncov has become a global concern within a short span of time since its origin from wuhan hubei province of china in the first week of december 2019 it has claimed 425 lives in china and infected 20630 in 24 countries including china additionally new cases are emerging in different countries and three confirmed cases from india also emerged till compilation of this paper february 4th 2020 as of now deaths were reported only from china but now causality in philippines reported for the first time outside china the ncov crisis has been declared as public health emergency of international concern by who the zoonotic route animal-to-human is suspected as the route of disease origin bats are considered as the natural reservoir hosts and play a crucial role in transmitting various viruses including ebola nipah coronavirus and others cui et al 2019 a high diversity among zoonotic alphacoronaviruses and sars-cov-related betacoronaviruses has been found in the circulating bats of western europe gouilh et al 2018 the genetic analyses predict bats as the most probable origin of 2019-ncov the diversity of covs in the bat population needs further investigation in details as well as the surveillance and monitoring of bats becomes critical to prevent future outbreaks in animals and the public the recent ncov outbreak highlights the hidden wild animal reservoir of the deadly viruses and possible threat of spillover zoonoses successful virus isolation attempts have made doors open for developing better diagnostics and effective vaccines a report emerged from china where the scientists claimed successful isolation of the 2019-ncov virus in vero and huh7 cell lines from infected patients subsequently in aiding the further research for designing rapid diagnostics and vaccine development for ncov scientists at the peter doherty institute for infection and immunity at melbourne australia were also successful in growing the wuhan coronavirus in cell culture further research is warranted on establishing animal models for the current 2019-ncov unrevealing viral events of replication transmission and pathogenesis in humans this could provide clues for discovering effective therapeutic regimens and vaccine testing purposessars first emerged in late 2002 in guangdong province southern china as a novel clinical severe disease termed atypical pneumonia marked by fever headache and subsequent onset of respiratory symptoms including cough dyspnea and pneumonia being highly transmissible among humans sars rapidly spread to hong kong and other provinces across china and then to other 28 countries 6 7 by july 2003 it had caused 8096 confirmed cases of infection in 29 countries 774 96  of which were fatal httpwwwwhointcsrsarscountrytable20040421en the second outbreak in 2004 only caused 4 infections with no mortality nor further transmission 8the mers epidemic emerged in the kingdom of saudi arabia ksa since june 2012 with a similar clinical syndrome to sars but seemingly less transmissible in addition to respiratory illness renal failure was identified in some severe cases 911 unlike sars which had numerous super-spreader events most mers cases were independent clusters and limited to countries in the middle east particularly in ksa limited mers cases have been reported in african and european countries and the united states of america but exclusively in individuals travelling back from the middle east some patients were reported to have a history of contact with camels while many other cases lacked this epidemiological link 911 the mers pandemic in the republic of korea in 2015 was caused by a single person who returned from travel in the middle east this made the republic of korea to be home to the second largest mers epidemic with a total of 185 confirmed cases and 36 deaths 11 12 by 18 august 2015 a total of 1413 laboratory-confirmed cases of mers have been reported worldwide with a median age of 50 years including 502 related deaths the mortality of mers approximately 35  is much higher than that of sars around 10 sars-cov and mers-cov share similar genome organization with other coronaviruses but display unique genomic structures and evolutionary lineages the coronavirus genome possesses 6-to-7 major open reading frames orfs in the characteristic gene order in the 5 to 3 direction orf1a and 1b which comprise two-thirds of the genome and encode the nonstructural polyproteins and four orfs downstream that encode structural proteins spike protein s envelope protein e membrane protein m and nucleocapsid protein n some coronaviruses have a hemagglutinin-esterase he gene between orf1b and s besides the coronavirus-conserved genes the sars-cov genome contains a number of specific accessory genes including orf3a 3b orf6 orf7a 7b orf8a 8b and 9b 1315 comparably mers-cov encodes five unique accessory genes designated orf3 orf4a orf4b orf5 and orf8b none of these genes have been shown to be related to other known coronavirus genes at the time of discovery 16 17 mers-cov was found to have 75 and 77  amino acid aa sequence identity in 7 conserved replicase genes with two previously identified bat coronaviruses btcov-hku4 and btcov-hku5 based on the classification criteria of the the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv sars-cov and mers-cov represent two novel distinct coronavirus species in the genus betacoronavirus fig 1a and table 1 10 18 19 members of betacoronaviruses are separated into four lineages a b c and d sars-cov and mers-cov are clustered in lineage b and c respectively 18the s protein of coronaviruses is a surface-located trimeric glycoprotein consisting of two subunits the n-terminal s1 subunit and the c-terminal s2 subunit the s1 subunit specializes in recognizing and binding to the host cell receptor while the s2 region is responsible for membrane fusion compared with the s2 the s1 subunit shows much higher variability 20 owing to its function of receptor binding the variation in s protein defines in large part the tissue tropism and host range of different coronaviruses 21angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 was identified to be the functional receptor of sars-cov 2224 a 193 aa fragment aa 318510 of sars-cov s protein was demonstrated to bind ace2 more efficiently than the full s1 domain and was defined as the receptor-binding domain rbd of sars-cov 25 a loop subdomain aa 424494 that directly contacts with ace2 was further identified as the receptor-binding motif rbm by crystal structure analysis 26 in the rbm several aa residues were found to be critical for receptor binding and changes in these key residues resulted in different binding efficiency among different sars-cov isolates 2628dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 also known as cd26 was identified as a functional receptor for mers-cov 29 and it is relatively conserved among mammalian species published results indicated that mers-cov can infect and replicate in most cell lines derived from human non-human primate bat swine goat horse rabbit civet and camel but not from mice hamster dog ferret and cat 2936 dpp4 from camel goat cow and sheep can be also recognized by mers-cov and can support mers-cov replication 30 35 resolved crystal structures demonstrate that dpp4-recognizing rbd is localized to the s1 c-terminal portion of s protein of mers-cov 3739 the rbd of mers-cov consists of 240 residues spanning aa 367606 which fold into a structure consisting of two subdomains the core subdomain and the external subdomain the core subdomain of mers-cov rbd is structurally similar to that of the sars-cov rbd but the external subdomain also named as rbm is different to that of the sars-cov 3739epidemiological survey showed that early cases of sars in 20022003 and all 4 cases in 20032004 had a history of animal contact through animal trade in wet markets or in restaurants where live animals were kept in guangdong province molecular detection and virus isolation studies suggested that the pandemic-causing sars-cov originated from traded civets in wet markets this was indirectly confirmed by the massive culling of market civets which was believed to play a major role in efficiently containing the sars pandemics and no further sars case was reported after 2004 4042however subsequent extensive epidemiology studies did not find sars-cov in farmed or wild-caught civets indicating that other animals was involved in sars-cov transmission in the animal market or other trading activities and civets are unlikely the natural reservoir of sars-cov 4345several years before the outbreak of sars two other zoonotic viruses nipah virus and hendra virus emerged in asia and australia and they were both known to be originated from bats 46 47 these led scientists to consider bats in the search of reservoirs of sars-cov in 2005 a breakthrough was made as two independent research groups reported almost simultaneously the discovery of novel coronaviruses related to sars-cov in horseshoe bats in the genus rhinolophus in china which were termed sars-like coronavirus sl-cov 48 49 these bat sl-covs from both mainland china and hong kong manifested genome sequence identity of 8890  among themselves and 8792  identity to human or civet sars-cov isolates the unique set of orfs exclusively found in sars-cov was also present in bat sl-covs demonstrating the close phylogenetic relationship between sars-cov and sl-cov the discovery of bat sl-cov boosted researchers interest in coronavirus surveillance studies in bats in following years sl-cov rna was detected in rhinolophus species of a wider geographic range in china the provinces or regions where sl-cov-positive bats were captured included hong kong guangxi hubei shandong guizhou shaanxi and yunnan 5053 7 conserved replicase domains in orf1ab of these sl-covs found in china were compared with those of sars-cov table 1 they all shared higher than 95  aa sequence identity with sars-cov in the concatenated domains and therefore can be considered to belong to sars-cov species 54sl-covs were also discovered in rhinolophids from slovenia bulgaria and italy in europe 5557 these european sl-covs exhibited significant genetic variation from chinese isolates the strain bm48-31 from rhinolophus blasii in bulgaria was highly divergent from chinese isolates displaying major sequence differences in several genes including orf3b and orf6 and lacking the coding region of orf8 in its genome 55 in africa novel betacoronaviruses related to sars-cov have been detected in hipposideros and chaerophon species from ghana kenya and nigeria however compared with asian and european sl-covs these viruses of non-rhinolophid origin were phylogenetically distant to sars-cov the western african isolates even formed a potential new lineage of betacoronavirus in the phylogenetic tree fig 1a 5860although the aforementioned bat sl-covs showed high sequence identity to sars-cov two deletions were present in the rbm of their s proteins 48 49 the differences in rbm substantially changed the receptor usage in a study using an hiv-based pseudovirus system and cell lines expressing human civet and horseshoe bat ace2 molecules the bat sl-cov rp3 s protein demonstrated its inability to use ace2 as cell receptor 61 however the chimeric rp3 s protein carrying the rbd of sars-cov s protein was conferred the capability of cell entry via human ace2 61 these results suggested that bat sl-covs such as rp3 were unlikely to cause human infection therefore they may not be considered as the direct progenitor of sars-cov besides the theory of bat origin of sars-cov lacked a powerful support due to the failure of direct isolation of sl-cov from bats despite numerous trials by our group as well as many others around the worldduring our longitudinal surveillance at a rhinolophus sinicus colony in yunnan province over the years a major breakthrough came in 2013 when diverse sl-covs were discovered in the single colony 53 in this colony there were at least 7 different strains related to sars-cov hku3 rs672 or rf1 based on analysis of the region corresponding to sars-cov rbd intriguingly unlike all previously described sl-covs two strains designated rs3367 and rsshc014 did not contain the deletions in this region rs3367 showed a particularly high sequence identity to sars-cov in rbd and was identical to sars-cov in several key amino acid residues known to be important for receptor binding 53 whole genome sequencing revealed that rs3367 and rsshc014 shared more than 95  genome sequence identity with human and civet sars-cov which was remarkably higher than that of any other bat sl-cov 76 to 92  regarding individual genes the amino acid sequence identity between rs3367 or rsshc014 and sars-cov was higher than 96  in orf1a 1b 3a 3b e m and n genes 53 most importantly a live sl-cov was isolated for the first time from bat fecal samples 53 this virus termed wiv1 had almost identical sequence 999  to rs3367 and was demonstrated to use ace2 molecules from humans civets and chinese horseshoe bats for cell entry it also displayed infectivity in cell lines from a broad range of species including human pig and bat furthermore the close relatedness between wiv1 and sars-cov was confirmed by neutralization effect of convalescent sars patient sera on wiv1 53 the isolation of a bat sl-cov genetically closely resembling sars-cov and having a functional s protein capable of using the same ace2 receptor as sars-cov provided robust and conclusive evidence for the bat origin of sars-covdespite the fact that rs3367 or wiv1 is unprecedently close to sars-cov in terms of rbd region and genome identity still there are gaps between them and the immediate ancestor of sars-cov orf8 is a highly variable gene and remarkable differences can be observed among sars-covs and sl-covs of different host origins isolates from civets and from early phase of the 20022003 pandemic contained a single long orf8 while in the human sars-cov isolates from the middle and late phase of the pandemic the orf8 was disrupted into two orfs orf8a and orf8b as a result of the acquisition of a 29-nt deletion after interspecies transmission to humans 8 40 62 the sl-covs from rhinolophus sinicus including rs3367 however had a single orf8 with only 3233  amino acid identities to that of civet sars-cov in contrast the orf8 of two novel sl-cov strains recently reported in yunnan from another rhinolophid species rhinolophus ferrumequinum exhibited exceptionally high 813  amino acid identity to civet sars-cov sz3 63 this is consistent with isolate rf1 a sl-cov reported earlier from r ferrumequinum in hubei province of which the orf8 shared 804  amino acid identity to sz3 48 potential recombination sites were identified around the orf8 region between sl-covs from rsinicus and rferrumequinum and it has been suggested that the ancestor of civet sars-cov probably acquired orf8 from rferrumequinum sl-covs by recombination 63as with sars-cov most early mers cases had contact history with animals eg dromedary camels 64 65 mers-cov rna was detected in camels from saudi arabia qatar and egypt and showed high similarities 99  to human mers-cov in genomic sequences 6671 serological evidence further confirmed a high prevalence of mers-cov infections in camels in the middle east 7277 africa 7880 and europe spain 73 the neutralization antibodies in camels could be traced back to 1983 73 80 these results strongly suggested that mers-cov infection in humans were transmitted through close contact with infected camels 66 76 8183prior to the emergence of mers-cov a group of bat coronaviruses had been reported including tylonycteris bat coronavirus hku4 btcov-hku4 in tylonycteris bats and pipistrellus bat coronavirus hku5 btcov-hku5 in pipistrellus bats in china 50 84 85 eisamspain2007 in eptesicus isabellinus bats in spain 86 and nnocvm3662008nld in pipistrellus pipistrellus bats in the netherlands 87 based on genomic sequence analysis these bat coronaviruses were grouped into lineage c of the genus betacoronavirus after the outbreak of mers mers-cov related coronaviruses were found in more bat species and countries 8896 among these viruses full-length or near full-length genomes of btcov-hku4 btcov-hku5 sc2013 and neocov have been characterized by genomic analysis of lineage c betacoronaviruses mers-cov derived from camels show high similarities to human mers-cov with 995  nt identities confirming that the human and camel isolates belong to the same coronavirus species bat hku4 hku5 neocov and sc2013 shared 698 70 856 and 756  nt identities with mers-cov at genomic level respectively seven conserved replicase domains in orf1ab of mers-cov related viruses were compared with mers-cov table 1 the concatenated translated domains of neocov shared 95  aa sequence identity with mers-cov and it could be classified as the same mers-cov species 54 other bat coronaviruses hku4 hku5 and sc2013 could be considered as different coronavirus species the most recent ancestor analysis speculated that mers-cov may have jumped from bats to camels approximately 20 years ago in africa with camels then being imported into the arabian peninsula 92 while hku5 and mers-cov may have diverged from their common ancestor about 400 to 500 years ago 85although neocov is closer to mers-cov than other bat coronaviruses at genomic level the phylogenetic analysis of the spike protein showed that hku4 is the most closely related to mers-cov among all currently known bat coronaviruses sharing 67  sequence identity fig 1b this is correlated with the capability of hku4 of using dpp4 as its functional receptor however hku4 preferred bat dpp4 over human dpp4 whereas mers-cov showed the opposite trend 97 it was suggested that mers-cov ancestors had been circulating in bats for very long time mers-cov has evolved to adapt to use human receptor and the dpp4-recognizing bat coronaviruses like hku4 may follow up thereby posing a serious risk to human health 97 98both sars-cov and mers-cov are emerging zoonotic pathogens that crossed the species barriers to infect humans 10 53 99 evidence showed that sars-cov and mers-cov originated from bats the nature reservoirs then transmitted to human via intermediate hosts civets and camels respectively 10 40 53 81 100 human sars-cov infection originated from the direct contact between humans and civets in markets or restaurants closing wet markets and cleaning civet cut off the spread chain of sars-cov and effectively ended the sars epidemic 40 42 101 in contrast mers-cov is believed to have existed in camels for a very long time and camels are widely distributed in middle east and african countries serving as important transport vectors and sources of meat and milk for the local population therefore it is difficult to adopt the same strategy of sars-cov control in the prevention of future mers-cov outbreaks until a comprehensive approach is found which most likely will involve the effective vaccination of camels against mers-cov among other measures it is envisaged that sporadic human infection will persist for some time in the future 11 70hcov-229e was found in the 1960s and causes comparatively mild common colds worldwide 102 a bat coronavirus detected in hipposideros caffer ruber in ghana termed hipposiderosghanakwam192008 was genetically related to hcov-229e its rdrp fragment shared 92  nucleotide sequence identity with hcov-229e and they were predicted to share a most recent common ancestor mrca only 200 years ago 58 a recent study characterized more 229e-related coronaviruses discovered in hipposiderid bats from ghana on full genome level these bat coronaviruses were more diversified and formed a single viral species with hcov-229e interestingly phylogenetic analysis revealed the intermediate position of a 229e-related alpaca virus between bat and human viruses these findings suggested the ancestral origin of hcov-229e in hipposiderid bats and the role of camelids as potential intermediate hosts was hypothesized 103hcov-nl63 was first isolated from babies suffering of pneumonia and bronchiolitis in 2004 104 to date hcov-nl63 has been found worldwide with up to 93  detection rate in hospitalized respiratory tract samples 105 in 2010 a bat coronavirus termed arcov2 appalachian ridge cov detected in north american tricolored bat perimyotis subflavus in the us showed close relationship with hcov-nl63 the mrca for hcov-nl63 and arcov2 was predicted to have existed 563 to 822 years ago 106 107 further analysis indicated that hcov-nl63 can replicate in cell lines derived from the lungs of tricolored bats 107 these results suggest that prototypes of hcov-nl63 may also exist in bats and there may also be a bat origin of this human coronavirusalthough the study of bat-borne coronaviruses has only started just about 10 years ago the scientific community has already learnt a great deal of useful lessons which will be instrumental in mitigating predicting and preventing future zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks some of these lessons are summarized belowbats harbor coronaviruses with great genetic diversity it is believed that most if not all currently circulating alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses in different mammals are evolutionally linked to ancestral coronaviruses originated from bats different species of rhinolophid bats in china carry genetically diverse sars-like coronaviruses some of which are direct ancestors of sars-cov and hence have the potential to cause direct interspecies transmission to humans meanwhile different coronavirus species closely related to mers-cov are circulating in bats bats are likely natural reservoirs of mers-cov or an ancestral mers-like cov it is hypothesized that bat mers-like cov jumped to camels or some other as yet unidentified animal several decades ago the virus evolved and adapted with accumulating mutations in camels and then was transmitted to humans very recently it took almost a decade from the first discovery of sl-cov in bats to the final isolation of the sars-cov ancestral virus from bats so continuing surveillance is vital to uncover the origin of mers-cov and bats should certainly be a priority of research besides as the spike protein and host receptor are key factors of cross-species transmission of coronaviruses characterization of the receptor and key binding sites of the spike protein will be important in estimating host tropism of bat coronaviruses and predicting spillover riskwith human activity increasingly overlapping the habitats of bats diseases outbreaks resulted from spillover of bat coronaviruses will continue to occur in the future despite the fact that direct transmission of bat coronaviruses to humans appears to be rare to better prepare ourselves in predicting and preventing the next emergence of a coronavirus disease it is necessary to maintain our vigilance in long-term coronavirus surveillance studies in bats as well as in other wildlife and livestock combined with other laboratory-based studies such as receptor specificity pathogenesis and animal infection a focus on continued surveillance will help us to improve risk assessment as well as to reveal the potential intermediate hosts that may play an important role in the interspecies transmission of various known and as yet unknown bat coronavirusescoronavirus cov belongs to the order nidovirales and can infect humans mammals and birds 1 the viral genome is composed of a positive stranded rna and its structures vary the family coronavirinae is divided into four genera    and  2 there are seven human coronaviruses 229e -cov nl63 -cov oc43 -cov hku1 -cov mers-cov -cov sars-cov -cov and sars-cov-2 -cov mers-cov sars-cov and sars-cov-2 can infect humans and induce serious pneumonia with many fatal cases 3 sars-covs induced an epidemic in the world and 774 fatal cases were reported 3 now sars-cov-2 is still circulating in china 46as considerable coronaviruses have been isolated from bats and other animals it is believed that there is a viral gene reservoir in wild animals 7 coronavirus can directly cross the species barrier and infect humans with high fatality 8 as the antigen is novel for a human host public health is being seriously challenged the infection risk of coronavirus in animals should be analyzed and a prediction model should be constructed for early warning for this purpose machine-learning methods appear to be ideal tools 9 10 the spike protein on the surface of the viral particle plays key roles in the binding of the cell receptor and membrane fusion 3 11 by which the host range is firmly determined 8 in this study we screened the features of the spike protein using three encoding algorithms and predicted the cross-species infection of coronaviruses with the random forest method moreover the optimal feature g-gap dipeptide composition ggap g  3 was used to explore the dynamic of evolution in a simple fast and massive mannerthe protein sequences of 2666 coronaviruses were collected from 2019 novel coronavirus resource

sars-cov-2 strains the information related to these strains was summarized in additional file 1 the 507 human-origin coronaviruses were regarded as positive samples whereas the 2159 non-human-origin coronaviruses were regarded as negativeamino acid composition aac is a simple but commonly used feature descriptor for sequence analysis and model construction for a total of 20 amino acid types the aac descriptor calculates the frequency of each type of amino acid for example if the amino acid type i occurs ni times in the protein sequence then the frequency of i is denoted by fi  nil where l is the protein length for a given strain we yielded a 20-dimensional feature vector by computing the frequencies of 20 different amino acidsparallel correlation-based pseudo-amino-acid composition

as robust and well performance in the field of machine learning the rf has been widely used to model biological data in this study the rf algorithm is used to construct models and make predictions for the cross-species transmission of coronavirus the rf behaves like an ensemble algorithm and proposes a set of decision trees which are grown by a subset of features the rf repeats the computing process many times and then makes a final prediction on each sample the final prediction can simply be the mean of each prediction with bootstrapping algorithm in this study the rf algorithm in the r environment was used 15 all the experiments in the study were conducted under r 350 with default parameters tree number  500 to reduce the bias of unbalanced sample number the positive samples were increased fourfold by the direct duplication of their protein sequences the 10-fold cross validation method was used to evaluate the predictive performance platt scaling was used to transform the output of the rf model into a probability over two classes and evaluated the infection risk of coronavirusesfour commonly used metrics for model performance evaluation that is sensitivity sn specificity sp accuracy acc and matthews correlation coefficient mcc were used in the study the details are listed as follows

as shown in table 2 and fig 2 the ggap g  3 had the best performance and is proposed to monitor the evolutionary dynamics of coronavirus the features of the 507 human samples in our dataset were used to show the patterns with the multidimensional scaling method seven clusters for 229e -cov nl63 -cov oc43 -cov hku1 -cov mers-cov -cov sars-cov -cov and sars-cov-2 -cov were formed obviously fig 3 the clusters for 229e and nl63 were closed and located in the upper right of the figure the cluster for sars-cov-2 was very close to that for sars-cov which suggests that both viruses have the same human receptor angiotensin converting enzyme ii ace2 the two clusters for mers and oc43 were far away from sars-cov and sars-cov-2
the optimal ggap feature performed well in terms of predicting infection risk and was used to explore the dynamic of evolution in a simple fast and massive manner based on the ggap g  3 feature we computed the euclidean distance of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov from other coronaviruses in the dataset to explore the evolution dynamic separately as shown in fig 4a the distance curve between sars-cov-2 and other coronaviruses had two gaps the big gap with values from 0 to 002 suggests that the sars-cov-2 have no close relation with other isolated coronaviruses as shown in fig 4b the distance curve between sars-cov and other coronaviruses also had a gap of value 003 which is similar to that of sars-cov-2 the two gaps at 003 suggest that coronaviruses close to sars-cov-2 s or sars-covs form a separate group we further checked the coronaviruses close to sars-cov-2 and sars-cov  003 and found that these close relatives were the same the results were similar to those from the mds method and confirmed that sars-cov-2 s and sars-covs have the same origin moreover the big gap at 002 suggests that the origin of sars-cov-2 s is not clear and further surveillance in the field should be made continuously the smooth curve for sars-covs shows that its close relatives still exist in nature and public health is challenged as usual
we used the python language to establish an easy-to-use tool that implements our predictor which is freely accessible via httpsgithubcomkouzhengcovpred-fl and can run in a simple fast and massive manner for the convenience of researchers we provide guidelines on how to use the tool to obtain the desired results 1 users need to prepare the query sequences in the fasta format examples of fasta formatted sequences can be found in the directory mentioned previously 2 users need to input the name of the query file and set the confidence parameter before running predictions the prediction confidence has a range from 00 to 05 the lower the confidence set by users the more sensitive the predictions obtained by users the predicted label for h means the phenotype of cross-species transmission while label for n means not the probability for infection risk is also listed in the result file the file for the features of the query sequence is created to facilitate further analysisat present sars-cov-2 is still circulating in china and the epidemic causes widespread social concern in the world 17 18 as considerable coronaviruses have been isolated from bats and other animals it is believed that there is a viral gene reservoir in wild animals 7 coronavirus can directly cross the species barrier and infect humans with a severe syndrome 8 as an antigen that is novel for a human host public health is being challenged seriously with the use of the viral spike protein in this study the infection risk of non-human-origin coronavirus was analyzed and a prediction model was constructed for early warning to prevent diseasethe spike protein on the surface of the viral particle plays key roles in the binding of the cell receptor and membrane fusion 3 11 by which the host range is firmly determined 8 in the study we choose the spike protein as a candidate target to predict the cross-species infection of coronaviruses using the rf method for the spike protein of coronavirus the sequence lengths were different and sequence identities were very low between remote relatives which caused the problem of alignment and challenged the algorithms used to model biology data for analysis and modeling in a simple fast and massive manner we used three different feature encoding algorithms from multiple perspectives such as compositional information and position-related information in addition to physicochemical properties the computation of protein features did not require multiple sequence alignment and reduced the computational complexitya total of 41 features were used to train the prediction models the best predictive model achieved the maximum acc of 9818 coupled with the mcc of 09638 when the feature ggap g  3 was selected which indicated that the feature ggap with parameter 3 had the optimal representation ability to distinguish coronaviruses with different phenotypes of cross-species transmission as shown in table 2 the number of false positives was 59 the reason for the false positives may be the sporadic infection of coronavirus that originated from an animal or a conflicting description of the ability of human receptor binding with the improvement of annotation in the database the false rate could be reduced 19the mds results were similar to those from traditional evolution analysis 1 3 5 which confirmed that the screening of the ggap g  3 feature was reasonable for the prediction of cross-species transmission moreover we computed the euclidean distance of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov from other coronaviruses in the dataset to explore the evolution dynamic the big gap of 002 suggests that the origin of sars-cov-2 is not clear and further surveillance in the field should be made continuously as considerable work on molecular epidemiology in the field has been conducted recently more than 2000 genome sequences of coronavirus isolated from animals have been identified in addition to various bat species other animals should be suspected as direct hosts for sars-cov-2 according to the smooth curve for sars-covs the fact should be noted that its close relatives still exist in nature and public health is challenged as usualalthough many proteins contribute to the procedure of virus production and host invasion the spike protein is the most important factor to determine host range 8 19 20 a long sequence of the viral genome should be considered in further study to increase the performance of the prediction model however applying the algorithm for about 30 000 dimensions of data and small number of samples will be a challenge in the study the infection risk of non-human-origin coronavirus was evaluated for early warning and good performance was achieved the main limitation was that only viral spike proteins were used to build the prediction model and social factors such as traffic conditions population size and citizens habits in daily life were not involved although high risk could be predicted in the view of the pathogen comprehensive judgment should be used to prevent disease in the futurein this paper we presented a predictor for the identification of the transmission phenotype of coronavirus the major contribution of this predictor is that a set of informative features of viral proteins from 41 feature descriptors such as compositional position-specific and physicochemical information were learned using a machine learning algorithm the 10-fold cross-validation results showed that good performance was achieved with the use of the ggap g  3 feature the optimal feature performed well in terms of predicting infection risk and was used to explore the dynamic of evolution in a simple fast and massive manner this study may be beneficial for coronavirus

middle east respiratory syndrome mers in saudi arabia a novel coronavirus cov epidemic recently classified as pandemic by the who is threatening the human population worldwide zhou et al 2020 the

httpswwwwhointdocsdefault-sourcecoronavirusesituation-reports20200415-sitrep-86-covid-19pdfsfvrsnc615ea202 a list of human covs is showed in table 1
 historically only two human covs hcovs had been known before the sars emergence namely hcov-229e an alphacoronavirus originated in bats and transmitted to humans through alpacas and hcov-oc43 a betacoronavirus which had passed from rodents to humans through cattle corman et al 2015 2018 after 20022003 sars epidemic the renovated interest in hcovs allowed the discovery of two additional viruses the alphacoronavirus hcov-nl63 and the betacoronavirus hcov-hku1 derived from bats and rodents respectively tao et al 2017 all these four viruses are usually responsible for mild respiratory symptoms in immunocompetent patients sars-cov and mers-cov are two unrelated betacoronaviruses originated in bats and transmitted to humans by wild carnivores and dromedary camels respectively in contrast to other hcovs these two viruses displayed an increased virulence causing severe pneumonia and even the death of affected people with mortality rates of about 10  and 30  respectively guarner 2020the occurrence of three highly pathogenic covs with a zoonotic origin in less than two decades highlights the role of animals in generating covs with increased virulence that can adapt to humans causing epidemics and eventually pandemics with high impact on human health indeed cov infections of veterinary interest have been known since almost a century cavanagh 2007 pedersen 2014 decaro et al 2020 so that animal covs are paradigmatic of how this large family of viruses evolves generating strains with different biological properties in addition the efforts done in veterinary medicine to develop effective vaccines and antiviral therapies against well-known cov infections of animals could be useful to set up prophylactic and therapeutical strategies against sars-cov-2the aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive review of the current literature on animal covs their intermingled evolution characterised by the continuous generation of strains with new pathobiological features and host rangecoronaviruses subfamily orthocoronavirinae family coronaviridae order nidovirales are enveloped single-strand positive-sense rna viruses currently four different genera exist ie alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus whose reservoirs are bats and rodents for alpha- and betacoronaviruses or birds for gamma- and deltacoronaviruses from their natural reservoirs covs may jump to other animals including humans with the transmission to humans usually requiring an intermediate host lorusso et al 2020 each cov genus is organised in subgenera that are presently 13 5 4 and 2 for alpha- beta- delta- and gammacoronaviruses respectively httpstalkictvonlineorgtaxonomyamong rna viruses covs possess the largest genome 27631 kb in size at the very 5-end of the genome is a leader sequence which plays critical roles in the gene expression of cov during its discontinuous sub-genomic replication li et al 2005 the 5-most two-thirds of the genome comprises the replicase gene which consists of two overlapping open reading frames orf 1a and 1b located downstream of orf1b are 4 orfs that code for a common set to all covs of structural proteins spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n proteins the order of the structural protein genes is always conserved in all covs the s protein mediates viral attachment to specific cell receptors and fusion between the envelope and plasma membrane and it is the main inducer of virus-neutralising antibodies the small membrane e protein plays an important role in viral envelope assembly but it is not essential for virus propagation the membrane m protein the most abundant structural component is a type iii glycoprotein consisting of a short amino-terminal ectodomain a triple-spanning transmembrane domain and a long carboxyl-terminal inner domain the nucleocapsid n protein is a highly basic phosphoprotein that in addition to its function in the virion also modulates viral rna synthesis in addition to the common set of proteins covs related to bovine coronavirus bcov recently included in the subgenus embecovirus genus betacoronavirus possess an additional structural protein the haemagglutinin-esterase he closely related to the haemagglutinin-esterase fusion protein of influenza c virus covs do also possess accessory genes coded by additional orfs located downstream of orf1b their number nucleotide sequence and order can vary remarkably among different covs the function of the accessory proteins is in most cases unknown and as a rule they are not essential for virus replication they do play an important role however in virus host interactions as they are generally maintained during natural infection and their loss -either through spontaneous mutation or reversed genetics- results in reduced virulence brian and baric 2005 decaro and buonavoglia 2008replication of the cov rna involves the synthesis of a full-length negative-strand rna that is present at low concentrations and serves as a template for the synthesis of full-length genomic rna the genes downstream of orf1b are expressed through a 3-coterminal nested set of subgenomic sg mrnas according to the generally accepted model for cov transcription sg minus-strand rnas are produced via a discontinuous 3-extension step which is regulated by transcription regulating sequences trss that are present upstream of most orfs and also at the 5-end of the genome the minus-strand rnas in turn serve as templates for the synthesis of complementary sg mrnas of which only the 5 end is generally translated brian and baric 2005covs are characterised by an exceptional genetic plasticity and evolve rapidly changing their antigenic profile tissue tropism or host range by means of two distinct mechanisms the viral replicase an rna dependent-rna polymerase does not possess a good proof reading activity therefore the incorporation of wrong nucleotides at each replication cycle and the consequent accumulation of mutations in the viral genome lead to a progressive differentiation of the viral progeny from the parental strain this mechanism which is well known for influenza viruses being responsible for the so called antigenic drift may cause the progressive adaptation of the viral surface proteins to the cell receptors of new animal species increasing the viral fitness in addition the particular replicating machinery of covs facilitates recombination events due to the presence of consensus sequences upstream each gene therefore in the case of coinfection by more than one cov strain the rna polymerase can jump from the rna of a strain to that of the other one synthetizing a hybrid rna containing sequences from both viruses recombination can occur not only with genomic sequences of other covs homologous recombination but also with rnas of different viruses and other organisms heterologous recombination luytjes et al 1988 banner and lai 1991 lai 1996 zeng et al 2008 huang et al 2016 recombination is an alternative mechanism that let covs acquire novel biological properties in terms of virulence host range and tissue tropism so that cov strains which are non-pathogenic or low-pathogenic in the original host may increase their pathogenicity in the same species or adapt to different species spreading in the new host with exceptional rapidity banner and lai 1991the occurrence of three human cov epidemics in less than 20 years along with the emergence of less pathogenic human covs arises some questions on how these viruses that have their reservoirs in bats and rodents may overcome the species barriers jumping to humans the animal-to-human transmission of viruses has been already occurred in the past but it seems that its frequency has been increased in the last decades involving in a short time span not only covs but also a plethora of genetically and biologically different viruses with zoonotic potential such as ebola virus influenza viruses flaviviruses hendra and nipah viruses mcmahon et al 2018 climate changes that are intensifying in this first quarter of the 21st century are favouring the spread of vector-borne diseases through increasing the proliferation of vectors and predisposing to their occupation of new ecological niches the emergence in temperate climate areas such as europe of vector-borne diseases caused by viruses considered exotic until few years ago west nile virus usutu virus chikungunya virus accounts for a progressive geographic expansion of tropical diseases thanks to the ongoing phenomenon of tropicalisation mcmahon et al 2018 deforestation and urbanization are other major factors that facilitate the spill-over of zoonotic agents to humans by reducing the habitat of wildlife and increasing the chances of contacts between wild animals like bats rodents and birds and human beings beena and saikumar 2019 lorusso et al 2020 this could be the case of ebola virus hendra and nipah viruses hantavirus and coronavirus infections in addition the close contact between human beings and different animal species sold at the wet markets of east asia represents the optimal situation for the host species jump and adaptation to humans of potentially zoonotic agents like covs it is not a coincidence that two of the most severe zoonoses of the last two decades highly pathogenic h5n1 avian influenza and sars have emerged in the same chinese province of guangdong where the contact between humans and animals is closer lorusso et al 2020
table 2
reports the most important avian cov species recognised so far and their associated diseases the number of avian species in which covs have been detected in the last years is humongous since the emergence of sars-cov in 2002 there has been increased interest in covs in other species including birds prior to that time our knowledge of covs in avian species was limited largely to three birds of the order galliformes ie domestic fowl gallus gallus turkeys genus meleagris and pheasants phasianidae with their infectious bronchitis virus ibv turkey coronavirus tcov and pheasant coronavirus phcov respectively these three viruses were considered for a long-time different species for several reasons such as the diverse pathotype enterotropic or respirotropic host range and genetic relatedness of the s protein cavanagh 2007 this scenario radically changed after the discovery of several novel covs with high genetic diversity from different avian species and the novel rules for species designation of the coronavirus study group csg httpstalkictvonlineorgictv-reportsictv9threportpositive-sense-rna-viruses-2011wposrnaviruses222coronaviridae all these viruses as well as analogous

the subgenus igacovirus of genus gammacoronavirusibv and ibv-like strains are commonly detected in both gallinaceous and non-gallinaceous birds also asymptomatically cavanagh 2005 this might suggest that these species would act as wild reservoirs spreading ibv strains over the world de wit et al 2011 as for the huge economic impact of the disease it causes ibv is one of the most studied covs over the last decades ibv causes the infectious bronchitis ib a term adopted in 1931 for describing the main clinical characteristics of a transmissible respiratory disease of poultry detected for the first time in north dakota usa ib has been now diagnosed worldwide and is one of the most important viral diseases of poultry characterised by respiratory signs but it can also affect the kidneys and reproductive tract following viremia with a severity that differs depending on the involved viral strain cavanagh and gelb 2008 the disease also affects wild and ornamental birds liu et al 2005 chen et al 2013ib control has been hampered by the intricate ibv evolution which has been entailed over the years by the emergence of many different antigenic or genotypic types commonly referred to as variants with divergent molecular biological and antigenic properties being a cov ibv has indeed a considerable ability to change both by mutation and by homologous recombination events which may cause along with replicase stuttering or slippage also insertions and deletions in the genome cavanagh and gelb 2008 if these mechanisms involve the hypervariable region s1 they frequently result in the emergence of new ibv variants although many new variants are not successful a few may emerge spread causing devastating disease either worldwide or in limited geographic areas currently 32 lineages have been recognized categorized into six genotypes gi to gvi valastro et al 2016 through their s protein ibv and ibv-like viruses recognise as cellular host receptor the 23-linked sialic acid glycan widely distributed in the respiratory tract and in several other host tissues factor which may explain the tropism also for several organs of the infected host winter et al 2006 2008 shahwan et al 2013 ambepitiya wickramasinghe et al 2011 extensive use of vaccines has greatly contributed to the high variability of ibv strains thorough recombination between vaccine and field viruses and viral selection pressure resulting from vaccination and presence of partially immune birds gandon and day 2008 gandon et al 2001 bande et al 2017important ibv-like strains are tcov responsible for enteritis in turkey also known as bluecomb disease guinea fowl coronavirus gfcov and quail coronavirus qcov responsible for fulminating enteric disease in guinea fowl and quail respectively brown et al 2016 cavanagh 2005 liais et al 2014tcov gfcov and qcov are evolutionarily distant from acov based on the s protein while ibv is a primarily respiratory pathogen tcov causes gastrointestinal disease liais et al 2014 guy 2008 enterotropism has also been observed for some ibv serotypes however all ibv strains infect primarily the respiratory tract resulting in mild to severe inflammation of the nasal and tracheal epithelia cavanagh 2005 2007 the s1 domain of the s protein is highly variable with the amino acid sequences of ibv and tcov from the usa sharing 25  sequence identity phylogenetic analysis of the s1 gene shows indeed grouping of ibv and ibv-like viruses on the one hand and tcov-us gfcov and qcov on the other hand ambepitiya wickramasinghe et al 2015a accordingly the emergence of covs in turkeys in the usa was proposed to have resulted from recombination events involving ibvs and an as-yet-unidentified cov donating a novel s gene this switch contributed largely to determine the in vivo tissue tropism of tcov and related viruses intriguingly the s protein of these covs requires nonsialylated type 2 poly-lacnac structures on n-glycan cores for binding this is in marked contrast to the 23-linked sialic acid glycan binding of ibv and ibv-like viruses ambepitiya wickramasinghe et al 2015bthe s1 subdomain of a tcov isolate from france in 2008 tcov-fr had only 42  sequence identity to that of the tcov-us strain maurel et al 2011 this diversity was biologically evident by the prominent tropism for the epithelium of the bursa of fabricius and only mild tropism for the small intestine of turkey tcov-fr s1 protein did not show indeed affinity for nonsialylated type 2 poly-lacnac ambepitiya wickramasinghe et al 2015a this genetic diversity between tcovs is in accordance with several recombination events involving ibvs on different continents with several unknown covs on the one hand the s genes of gfcovfr2011 isolated in france in 2011 and tcov-us share significant genetic relationships and thus these viruses must have acquired their s gene from a common ancestor on the other hand gfcovfr2011 and fr tcov have a very similar genetic background in other genes two recombination events may be responsible for the genesis of tcov-us and fr tcov a first event occurred between an ibv eu recipient strain and an unknown acov donor resulting in a virus with a new s gene whose evolution would have resulted in fr tcov and gfcovfr2011 a second recombination event involving a us ibv recipient and gfcovfr2011 would have generated us tcov viruses which share a stronger s gene similarity with gfcovfr2011 than with fr tcov brown et al 2016additional covs distinct from acovs and mainly circulating in ducks duck coronavirus dcov pigeons pigeon coronavirus pcov or geese goose coronavirus gcov have been identified cheng et al 2013 jonassen et al 2005 muradrasoli et al 2010 kim and oem 2014 zhuang et al 2015 papineau et al 2019 although their genome seems to fulfill the official ictv criteria required to distinguish a new species within the gammacoronavirus genus ictv approval is still pendinghistorically covs of birds were all included in the gammacoronavirus genus and in turn all covs belonging to this genus were identified only in birds however this suggestion was rebutted by the evidence of a cov belonging to the gammacoronavirus genus in a beluga whale first discovered in 2008 viral species beluga whale coronavirus sw1 species subgenus cegacovirus genus gammacoronavirus mihindukulasuriya et al 2008 and of three novel covs bucov hku1 thcov hku12 and mucov hku13 in birds of the order passeriformes namely bulbuls pycnonotus jocosus thrushes turdidae and munias lonchura punctulate respectively which did not cluster phylogenetically with extant covs identified in birds these latter three viruses were distinct from known covs forming a unique cluster in the phylogenetic tree which was the basis for generation of the deltacoronavirus genus woo et al 2009 importantly additional novel viruses belonging to this novel genus were detected in wild birds woo et al 2012 chu et al 2011 dures-carvalho et al 2015 torres et al 2016 these viruses cluster with previously unclassified covs detected in various asian carnivores ie the asian leopard cat prionailurus bengalensis and chines ferret badger nyctereutes procyonoides dong et al 2007 covs belonging to the betacoronavirus genus which are strictly related to mouse hepatitis virus mhv were also described in wild birds including parrots in brazil dures-carvalho et al 2015 interestingly this was not the first detection of viruses belonging to the betacoronavirus genus in birds often overlooked is the discovery over 38 years ago of a cov from the manx shearwater puffinus puffinus a bird that visits the shores of britain in summer nuttall and harrap 1982 cavanagh et al 2007 this virus was also related to mhv however at that time considering the unusual finding and that the virus was isolated by passage of shearwater material in the brains of mice it was speculated that the detected virus was an mhv strain already present in the mice before inoculation cavanagh 2007bats are an ancient and heterogeneous group of ecologically important mammals representing nearly a quarter of all mammalian diversity on earth they belong to the order chiroptera and further classified in two suborders yinpterochiroptera and yangochiroptera the first includes the non-echolocating pteropodidae family megabats and five echolocating rhinolophoidea microbat superfamilies yangochiroptera contain thirteen echolocating microbat families tsagkogeorga et al 2013 bats are thought to host a large plethora of viruses these include amongst the others lyssaviruses filoviruses henipaviruses and reoviruses calisher et al 2006before sars-cov epidemic bats were not known to host covs indeed the first evidence of a bat cov was published in 2005 poon et al 2005 after the sars epidemic there was a boost in interest regarding searching for novel covs in various animals including bats to date over 200 novel covs have been identified in bats and approximately 35  of the bat virome sequenced to date is composed of covs chen et al 2014 this data has been made available following the massive surveillance coupled with the advent of next-generation sequencing ngs technology which has been performed in wild animals woo et al 2010 banerjee et al 2019 just a small portion of these covs have been officially recognised by the ictv many others are still pending for official designation cov species detected in bats and officially recognised by the ictv are listed in table 3
and the following chapter reasonably discusses only officially recognized bat cov speciesbats can carry and transmit covs into local bat populations via migration even though little is known about the migratory patterns of these animals closely related covs can be detected in the same bat species living at locations separated by thousands of miles drexler et al 2010 and different cov species or genera can be found in different bat species living at the same roosting sites however some covs have been shown to be species-specific accordingly regional patterns of bat cov outbreaks at species level can be deduced from the population distribution of their respective bat hosts although bats seem to develop clinical diseases induced by several viruses and bacteria mhldorfer et al 2011 generally covs do not cause apparently overt disease in these mammals also experimentally this phenomenon seems to be related with peculiar characteristics of their immune system ahn et al 2019 brook et al 2020based upon genomic data available so far it is widely accepted that while birds represent the reservoir for covs belonging to genera gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus bats are the natural reservoir for alpha- and betacoronaviruses however only betacoronaviruses of subgenera sarbecovirus merbecovirus nobecovirus and hibecovirus have been detected in bats so far given that several betacoronaviruses from the subgenus embecovirus have been discovered in rodents it was speculated that rodent covs may be the ancestors of currently circulating viruses belonging to this subgenus wong et al 2019 covs have been detected at high frequency in bats in all continents with alphacoronaviruses being more widespread than betacoronaviruses wong et al 2019subgenus colacovirus genus alphacoronavirus officially comprises the viral species bat coronavirus cdphe15 so far composed by two bat covs strains named cdphe15usa2006 and myotis lucifugus cov myl-cov which share a 982  nucleotide identity across the whole genome both strains have been detected in myotis lucifugus bats vespertilionidae also known as the northern american little brown bats the former was detected in 2006 in colorado genbank acc no kf430219 while the latter was reported in 2010 in canada this virus was identified in the intestines and lungs and associated with minimal pathology or inflammation subudhi et al 2017 subgenus decacovirus genus alphacoronavirus comprises the species rhinolophus ferrumequinum alphacoronavirus hub-2013 composed so far by btms-alphacovgs2013 and btrf-alphacovhub2013 strains discovered in china in myotis spp and rhinolophus ferrumequinum bats respectively these two viruses share very high sequence identities higher than 98  which dramatically decrease in the s genes only 85 nucleotide identity wu et al 2016 the viral species bat coronavirus hku10 subgenus decacovirus genus alphacoronavirus was discovered in 2005 in china from rousettus spp and hipposideros spp bats additional strains from hipposideros spp bats were then discovered in 2006 and 2010 lau et al 2012 a viral strain related to hku10 was also identified in hipposideros pomona in 2018 genbank acc no mn611523 viral species miniopterus bat coronavirus 1 and miniopterus bat coronavirus hk8 belong to subgenus minunacovirus of genus alphacoronavirus and were discovered in 2005 immediately after sars epidemic covs belonging to miniopterus bat coronavirus 1 are commonly detected in miniopterus spp vespertilionidae including miniopterus magnater miniopterus bat coronavirus 1a and miniopterus pusillus miniopterus bat coronavirus 1b from china whereas miniopterus bat coronavirus hku8 has been detected in m magnater m pusillus and miniopterus schreibersii poon et al 2005 chu et al 2006 2008 co-infections of 1b and hku8 were detected in seven m pusillus specimens collected in 2004 and 2006 chu et al 2008 but also in miniopterus spp bats in kenya tong et al 2009 myotis ricketti alphacoronavirus sax-2011 subgenus myotacovirus genus alphacoronavirus and nyctalus velutinus alphacoronavirus sc-2013 subgenus nyctacovirus genus alphacoronavirus have been discovered in the last decade from samples collected in china from myotis ricketti and nyctalus velutinus bats vespertilionidae respectively scotophilus bat coronavirus 512 subgenus pedacovirus genus alphacoronavirus has been first discovered in 2005 from samples of scotophilus kuhliivespertilionidae antibodies specific to the n protein of scotophilus bat coronavirus 512 have been also detected in serum collected from three bat species namely scotophilus kuhlii miniopterus fuliginosus and rhinolophus monoceros chen et al 2018 btcov5122005 the representative strain of this viral species likely has a common evolutionary precursor with porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus pedv banerjee et al 2019 and this latter indeed is thought to be originated from a cross-species jump of a btcov5122005-like virus into pigs a similar scenario is thought to have occurred with bat-cov hku2 this virus identified for the first time from rhinolophus sinicus lau et al 2005 woo et al 2006 shares an 86  sequence identity with severe acute diarrhoea syndrome-coronavirus sads-cov of pigs zhou et al 2018 these two viruses are now included in the same viral species rhinolophus bat coronavirus hku2 subgenus rhinacovirus genus alphacoronavirus viral strains btkynl63-9a btkynl63-9b btkynl63-15 and btkynl63-9a identified in 2010 in triaenops afer bats from kenya form the viral species nl63-related bat coronavirus strain btkynl63-9b that is part of the subgenus setracovirus genus alphacoronavirus along with human coronavirus nl63 tao et al 2017in this regard a bat origin has been strongly suggested for two of the less-pathogenic hcovs causing mild respiratory symptoms in immunocompetent people namely hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 both belonging to the alphacoronavirus genus whereas hcov-229e subgenus duvinacovirus recognises as direct ancestor an alphacoronavirus from alpacas which in turn derives from 229e-related covs identified in hipposiderid bats corman et al 2015 hcov-nl63 is likely a recombinant virus originating from the distantly related 229e-related covs associated with hipposiderid bats and covs associated with triaenops afer bats tao et al 2017 table 1 the s protein of hcov-nl63 is more closely related to that of 229e-related covs whereas the rest of the genome with covs included in the nl63-related bat coronavirus strain btkynl63-9b species tao et al 2017 different from the bovine coronavirus bcov-like viruses that cause enteric disease in 2007 a novel alpaca cov was associated to respiratory disease in california usa full-length genome analysis showed that this respiratory alpaca cov was closely related to the alphacoronavirus hcov-229e subgenus duvinacovirus crossley et al 2012 more recently close relatives of hcov-229e were detected in african hipposiderid bats interestingly both bat and alpaca viruses displayed an intact accessory gene orf8 located at the genomic 3 end while hcov-229e retained only a conserved trs preceding remnants of this orf suggesting its loss after acquisition of a 229e-related cov by humans therefore hcov-229 is likely a descendant of the alpaca alphacoronavirus corman et al 2015strains forming the viral species bat hp-betacoronavirus zhejiang2013 subgenus hibecovirus genus betacoronavirus were discovered in hipposideros pratti bats from china in 2013 wu et al 2016 strain ro-batcov gccdc1 356 was identified from stools of rousettus leschenaultii a species of fruit bats pteropodidae of southern asia which were collected in yunnan province china in 2014 huang et al 2016 ro-batcov gccdc1 356 shows a small intact orf of 276 nucleotides embedded between the n and ns7a genes this orf has no homology to any known coronavirus and the encoded protein exhibited 549  amino acid identity with the p10 protein encoded by the first orf of segment s1 of bat fusogenic orthoreoviruses genus orthoreovirus species nelson bay orthoreovirus also known as pteropine orthoreovirus these viruses are double-stranded segmented rna viruses belonging to the family reoviridae and are able to cause severe pneumonia in humans chua et al 2007 lorusso et al 2015 ro-batcov gccdc1 356 is included in the viral species rousettus bat coronavirus gccdc1 within the subgenus nobecovirus genus betacoronavirus
rousettus bat coronavirus hku9 belonging to subgenus nobecovirus was also identified in rousettus leschenaultii and in other bat species mendenhall et al 2017 this virus was first detected in 2007 in guangdong province in china woo et al 2007 subsequent studies suggested that the virus was widely distributed and is circulating in different bat species ge et al 2012 covs from the bthku9-like cluster were also detected in hipposidereos commersoni and rousettus aegyptiacus bats in kenya tong et al 2009 being a fruit bat rousettus leschenaultii has a wider flying range than most of the insectivorous bats in china thus it may carry viruses over long distances a comparison of the reported hku9-cov sequences showed a high genetic diversity within this viral species luo et al 2018a b lau et al 2010 ge et al 2012when mers-cov was first isolated in the middle east in 2012 and its genome sequenced it was found that it was most closely related to ty-batcov hku4 discovered in tylonycteris pachypus and pi-batcov hku5 discovered in pipistrellus abramus which were the only known members of subgenus merbecovirus at that time these two viruses are now the prototype strains of tylonycteris bat coronavirus hku4 and pipistrellus bat coronavirus hku5 viral species respectively within subgenus merbecovirus genus betacoronavirus although mers related covs mers-rcovs were lately discovered mers-cov was much closer in the s1 region to hku4-cov than to mers-rcov or hku5-cov indeed dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 the receptor for mers-cov is also the receptor for hku4 but neither for hku5 nor for early discovered mers-rcovs however hku4 prefers bat dpp4 over human dpp4 whereas mers-cov shows the opposite trend yang et al 2014 so far hku4-covs are only carried by tylonycteris spp bats t pachypus and t robustula and are relatively conserved hku5-covs are found in different pipistrellus spp bats including p abramus p pipistrellus and p minus fan et al 2019due to the current sars-cov-2 pandemic attention should be given to the viral species severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus sars-rcovsubgenus sarbecovirus genus betacoronavirus and middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus mers-rcov subgenus merbecovirus genus betacoronavirus which enclose sars-cov and mers-cov the first two highly pathogenic covs that were discovered in humans in 2002 at the beginning of the sars epidemic almost all early human index patients had animal exposure in a market place in guangdong province before developing disease after sars-cov was identified its rna andor specific antibodies were found in masked palm civets paguma larvata and animal handlers in a market place however later investigations of farmed and wild- caught civets revealed that sars-cov strains found in market civets were transmitted to them by other wild animals tu et al 2004 kan et al 2005 subsequently novel covs related to human sars-cov sars-rcovs were discovered in horseshoe bats genus rhinolophus in china and hong kong li et al 2005 lau et al 2005 these sars-rcovs showed genome sequence identity of 8890  among themselves and 8792  identity to human or civet sars-cov isolates sars-rcovs were detected in rhinolophus spp bats of other regions of china tang et al 2006 woo et al 2006 yuan et al 2010 ge et al 2013 sars-rcovs with higher genetic diversity with respect to chinese strains were also detected in rhinolophid bats from slovenia bulgaria and italy in europe drexler et al 2010 rihtaric et al 2010 balboni et al 2011 covs related to sars-rcov were also detected in hipposideros spp and chaerophon spp bats from ghana kenya and nigeria hu et al 2015 these evidences suggested that bats may be the natural hosts for sars-cov and that wild carnivores were only intermediate hosts although these sars-rcovs showed high sequence identity to sars-cov they were demonstrated to be unable to bind to the human cell angiotensin converting enzyme ii ace2 receptor the receptor of sars-cov as a consequence of deletions in their s protein ren et al 2008 besides the theory of bat origin of sars-cov lacked a powerful support due to the failure of direct isolation of this virus from bats thus considering that no direct progenitor of sars-cov was found in bats and that rna recombination is the fuel for cov evolution it has been proposed that sars-cov emerged through recombination of bat sars-rcovs this hypothesis was made after the evidence of a single bat cave in yunnan china with very high covs diversity and considering that within the identified covs all genetic elements needed to form sars-cov have been identified in that single cave ge et al 2013 recombination analysis also strongly supported the hypothesis that the civet sars-cov strain sz3 originated following a recombination event of two existing bat strains wiv16 and rf4092 hu et al 2017 moreover wiv1 the closest relative to sars-cov that has been found in bats so far more than 95  nucleotide identity higher than that of any other bat sars-rcovs 7692  likely arose through recombination of two other prevalent bat sars-rcov strains the most frequent recombination breakpoints were within the s gene and upstream of orf8 which encodes an accessory protein these genes were also involved in the crucial adaptation pathways of sars-cov from bats to wild carnivores from wild carnivores to humans and from human to human cui et al 2019 wiv1 has been shown to have the capacity to bind to the human civet and bat cell ace2 receptor ge et al 2013 the isolation in cell-culture of a highly related sars-cov strain coupled with the evidence of a functional s protein capable of using the same ace2 receptor provided robust and conclusive evidence for the bat origin of sars-cov an additional sars-rcov strain has been shown by reverse genetics studies to have the capacity to bind to the human ace2 receptor menachery et al 2015quite the opposite a direct bat cov highly related to mers-cov of humans was never detected indeed the genome sequences of mers-cov in human and dromedaries possess only around 6580  nucleotide identities to those of the other members of subgenus merbecovirus from different bats human mers-covs were instead almost identical to mers-covs identified in dromedary camels camelus dromedaries lately genomic sequence analyses indicated that covs now belonging to the mers-rcov species were found in several bat species from two bat families vespertilionidae and nycteridae lelli et al 2013 de benedictis et al 2014 corman et al 2014a b anthony et al 2017 moreno et al 2017 wong et al 2019 however none of these mers-rcovs is a direct progenitor of mers-cov as their s proteins differ substantially from that of the human virus the closest relative to mers-cov of humans and dromedary camels is mers-rcov strain neoromicia5038 isolated from neoromicia capensis bats in south africa geldenhuys et al 2018 table 1 a short sequence around 200 nucleotides of viral rna identical to that of merscov was also detected in a taphozous perforates bat in saudi arabia memish et al 2013 overall although it is widely accepted that mers-cov ancestor is in bats further studies are warranted in order to discover the precise mechanisms of its emergence in dromedary camels and humans it was suggested that mers-cov ancestors had been circulating in bats for very long time mers-cov has evolved to adapt to use human receptor and the dpp4-recognising bat coronaviruses like hku4 may follow up thereby posing a serious risk to human health recent mers-rcovs were shown to have the capacity to bind to the dpp4 as entry cell receptor as they acquired the s1 through recombination with hku4-like viruses luo et al 2018a bas for the recent and threatening covid-19 outbreak in humans we certainly know that sars-cov-2 belongs to the species sars-rcov together with sars-cov from humans and sars-rcovs from wild carnivores and horseshoe bats genus rhinolophus gorbalenya et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 wu et al 2020 epidemiological investigations revealed that many initial patients were exposed to wildlife at the huanan seafood wholesale market south china seafood market which is the largest seafood market in central china lorusso et al 2020sars-cov-2 has been assigned to an existing species of hundreds of known viruses largely isolated from bats these viruses have names derived from sars-cov but only the viral isolates originating from the 20022003 outbreak have been confirmed to cause sars in humans gorbalenya et al 2020 importantly it has also been confirmed that sars-cov-2 uses the ace2 receptor through the receptor binding domain rbd of the s protein hoffmann et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 likely also sars-cov-2 has a bat origin according to genome sequences available so far the most closely related virus 962  of nucleotide sequence identity to sars-cov-2 is strain batcovratg13 identified from a bat rhinolophus affinis from yunnan province china followed by sars-rcovs identified from pangolins tang et al 2020 the receptor-binding spike protein of sars-cov-2 is highly divergent from other covs with less than 75  nucleotide sequence identity to all previously described sars-rcovs except for a 931  nucleotide identity to batcovratg13 zhou et al 2020 although sars-cov-2 uses the ace2 receptor five out six critical amino acid residues in rbd were different between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov the same residues were instead identical to those of pangolin sars-rcovs and in turn only one of these residues was identical to those of batcovratg13 tang et al 2020 although this latter shows the highest nucleotide sequence identity with sars-cov-2 along the whole genome thus it was tempting to speculate that sars-cov-2 rbd region might have originated from recent recombination event in pangolins or that sars-cov-2 and sars-rcovs of pangolins represent the result of coincidental evolution lam et al 2020 tang et al 2020 overall it remains to be solved whether also sars-cov-2 needed an intermediate and amplification host before being able to infect humans as it was the case for sars-cov and other hcovs since a mammal reservoir has not yet been identified a prudent use of specific antigens is strongly recommended for serological diagnosis of sars-cov-2 in animals as cross-reactions with viruses of the alphacoronavirus genus widespread in animals might occur sun and meng 2004analogously to bats but with a lesser extent also rodents have been recently demonstrated to play a significant role in the evolution of cov in particular of those belonging to subgenus embecovirus of genus betacoronavirus rodentia rodents is the largest order of mammals with more than 2000 species worldwide representing a major source of zoonotic infectious diseases han et al 2015 for decades only one species of coronavirus murine coronavirus subgenus embecovirus genus betacoronavirus has been associated with rodents the prototype virus which was named mouse hepatitis virus mhv was first isolated in mice in 1949 cheever et al 1949 a mhv variant was lately identified in rats in 1970 parker et al 1970 rat coronavirus rcov causes epidemics of respiratory disease in laboratory rat colonies the two prototype strains of rcov are sialodacryoadenitis virus sdav and parkers rcov rcov-p bhatt et al 1972 parker et al 1970 both strains infect the respiratory tract and sdav can also infect the eye salivary and lacrimal glands young rats are especially susceptible to rcov with the infection occurring in the lower respiratory tract and developing into interstitial pneumonia parker et al 1970together with feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv and ibv mhv has been one of the most strictly animal cov studied ever mhv is a natural pathogen of mice normally infecting the liver gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system causing a wide range of disease including hepatitis gastroenteritis and acute and chronic encephalomyelitis importantly it served as model for cov replication and pathogenesis with emphasis for neuro-invasion and neurovirulence weiss and navas-martin 2005 as for the additional structural protein he some strains such as jhm of mhv contain the he protein while others such as a59 do not shieh et al 1989 yokomori et al 1989the role of rodents in the evolution of covs belonging to embecoviruses has been recently highlighted by means of the discovery of a novel betacoronavirus in norway rats rattus norvegicus in china this virus forms a separate species named china rattus coronavirus hku24 chrcov hku24 within the embecovirus subgenus although designated as a novel species this virus possessed genome characteristics that resemble to those of both betacoronavirus-1 and murine coronavirus suggesting that chrcov hku24 represents the murine origin of betacoronavirus-1 with interspecies transmission from rodents to other mammals having occurred centuries ago lau et al 2015genus betacoronavirus consists of five subgenera with bat covs being including in all but one of subgenus embecovirus where rodent human and bovine covs are included httpstalkictvonlineorgtaxonomy this supports the hypothesis that rodent covs were the ancestors of embecoviruses of other animals while bats are the natural reservoirs for all other betacoronaviruses importantly rodent covs are not restricted to genus betacoronavirus a deep virological screening was performed in 1465 rodents sampled in zhejiang province china during 20112013 with nearly 2 of rodents testing positive for cov wang et al 2015 in particular covs were detected in 10 striped field mice apodemus agrarius 4 norway rats 14 lesser ricefield rats rattus losea 1 asian house rat rattus tanezumi and 1 chinese white-bellied rat niviventer confucianus amplicons of the replicase gene sequences were recovered from 21 70  of the cov rna positive rodent samples described above and whole genome or nearly whole genome sequences 98  were recovered from 1 and 4 cov positive samples respectively by means of whole genome sequence analysis authors were able to identify a divergent alphacoronavirus which was lately officially designated as species lucheng rn rat coronavirus lrnv within the subgenus luchacovirus and two novel betacoronaviruses termed longquan aa mouse coronavirus lamv and longquan rl rat coronavirus lrlv and assigned to the two established species betacoronavirus-1 and murine coronavirus respectively wang et al 2015 moreover lrnv seems to be a recombinant virus as its n protein gene is more closely related to those of the genus betacoronavirus overall the discovery of rodent-associated covs belonging to subgenera that are distinct from those including bat covs warrants further investigations upon the role played by rodents in the evolution and emergence of these virusessars-cov replication has been studied in mice syrian golden and chinese hamsters the most severe symptoms of sars were observed in aged animals indeed aged mouse model of sars-cov has been generated gretebeck and subbarao 2015 transgenic mice expressing human ace2 were also developed to closely mimic sars-cov infection in humans some animal models have been tested and analysed on the genomic and proteomic level to study the pathogenesis of sars-cov therefore we have reason to believe that such models would work also for sars-cov-2 quite the opposite studies have demonstrated that mice guinea pigs and hamsters are not susceptible to experimental mers-cov infection mainly because their homologous dpp4 molecules do not function as receptors for mers-cov entry cockrell et al 2014 the first mouse model of mers infection reported in 2014 involved transducing animals with recombinant adenovirus 5 encoding human dpp4 hdpp4 molecules intranasally and this resulted in replication of mers-cov in the lungs this mouse model also showed clinical symptoms of interstitial pneumonia including inflammatory cell infiltration and thickened alveolar and mild oedema song et al 2019currently six covs are circulating in swine table 4

oldest known swine cov tgev and prcov are closely related to canine coronavirus ccov and feline coronavirus fcov forming with these carnivore covs a unique species referred to as alphacoronavirus-1 based on the analysis of the accessory protein gene orf3 it has been postulated that tgev has originated from ccov type ii ccov-ii since while ccov type i ccov-i exhibits an intact gene both ccov-ii and tgev which are strictly related in the s gene have only remnants of orf3 lorusso et al 2008 prcov in turn has derived from tgev through the deletion of 600 nucleotides at the 5 end of the s gene corresponding to 200 amino acids at the n-terminus of the spike protein and consequent change of the major tissue tropism from the enteric to the respiratory epithelium this large deletion caused the loss of sialic acid binding activity that allows the attachment to mucins and mucin-type glycoproteins so that tgev but not prcov is able overcome the intestinal mucus barrier having access to the gut mucosa schwegmann-wessels and herrler 2006 prcov shares some epitopes for neutralising antibodies with tgev so that its extensive circulation in swine herds has resulted in a drastic reduction of tge outbreaks worldwidepedv was introduced in the pig population in the 1970s likely as a consequence of a spillover event from bats the virus was first described in europe and had been primarily maintained as an endemic pathogen in european and asian swine populations until its introduction into north america in 2013 pedv is more strictly related to a scotophilus bat coronavirus 512 than to other known alphacoronaviruses including tgev and human alphacoronaviruses hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 therefore pedv and btcov5122005 likely have a common evolutionary precursor and a cov cross-species transmission may have occurred between bats and pigs banerjee et al 2019 accordingly pedv contains signature motifs at the 5-untranslated region that are shared by bat covs thus providing further support of the evolutionary origin of pedv from bats and potential cross-species transmission huang et al 2013 currently different pedv genotypes are described based on the s gene i g1a pedv including classical european and asian strains with moderate virulence ii g2 pedv also called original us pedv comprising highly virulent strains that originated in asia and are now widespread in the usa iii g1b pedv which is represented by the so-called s-indel strains ie strains presenting insertions and deletions in the s gene that are associated with mild clinical outbreaks these strains are natural recombinant pedvs with a g2-like genomic backbone carrying an s1 region of g1a strains iv s1 n-terminal domain-deletion ntd-del strains that are g2-like strains containing a 194 to 216-aa deletion within the n-terminal domain of the s1 subunit also associated to mild clinical forms hou and wang 2019 recombinant strains between pedv and tgev have been also reported in europe akimkin et al 2016 belsham et al 2016 boniotti et al 2016sadv-cov now referred to as swine enteric alphacoronavirus seacov is another virulent swine enteric alphacoronavirus that originated from bats sharing an 86  sequence identity with a bat alphacoronavirus hku2-cov since viruses displaying a 9698  sequence identity to sads-cov were detected in rhinolophus spp bats sads-cov and hku2-cov likely descend from a common ancestor zhou et al 2018 accordingly both viruses now belong to the unique species rhinolophus bat coronavirus hku2in contrast phev which was first described in 1957 in nursery pigs with encephalomyelitis in ontario canada has not derived from bat covs but its evolutionary history is tightly intermingled with other two closely related betacoronavirus hcov-oc43 and the oldest known bcov with which phev may have common ancestors vijgen et al 2006 and is included in the same viral species betacoronavirus-1 corman et al 2018 most probably hcov-oc43 and phev descend from a rodent betacoronavirus through preliminary adaptation to bcov from which they may have emerged in the context of a pandemic recorded historically at the end of the 19th century corman et al 2018pdcov was recently detected in 2012 in hong kong during cov molecular surveillance in avian and mammalian species this swine deltacoronavirus seems to recognise another different ancestor likely emerging from a host-switching event between avian and mammal covs the most closely related pdcov relative has been identified in quail deltacoronavrus uae-hku30 and the virus has been proposed to be a recombinant between other two avian deltacoronaviruses sparrow cov hku15 and bulbul cov hku11 all these deltacoronavirus are now members of the same species coronavirus hku15 lau et al 2018pigs were found to be susceptible to experimental infection with the betacoronavirus mers-cov vergara-alert et al 2017 while sars-cov rna was detected in pigs and wild boars chen et al 2005 wang et al 2005 in contrast a recent experimental infection demonstrated that pigs are not susceptible to sars-cov-2 shi et al 2020few studies have been carried out to assess the circulation of covs in farmed or free-ranging wild boars sus scrofa antibodies against tgevprcov were detected in some animals in slovenia vengust et al 2006 and croatia roic et al 2012 and pedv rna was demonstrated in south korea lee et al 2016 a wild boar sold at a live animal market of guangzhou china was positive for sars-cov rna wang et al 2005the main covs infecting ruminants are reported in table 5
 the oldest known ruminant cov is bcov which is also the prototype of the species betacoronavirus-1 subgenus embecovirus genus betacoronavirus this virus is able to cause a variety of clinical forms including enteric disease with high mortality rates in neonate calves winter disease a severe enteric form in lactating cows decaro et al 2008b and a respiratory disease also known as shipping fever in cattle of all ages with a higher prevalence in 23 month-old calves decaro et al 2008a it was postulated that the presence of genetic signatures differentiates enteric and respiratory bcovs hasoksuz et al 1999 but it was ultimately evident that the same virus strain could be responsible for simultaneous appearance of enteric and respiratory disease in the same animals chouljenko et al 2001it has been postulated that bcov originated from a rodent cov corman et al 2018 very recently a novel cov representing a new viral species referred to as china rattus coronavirus hku24 chrcov-hku24 was detected in norway rats in china this virus was phylogenetically distinct from mhv and hcov-hku1 and displayed genome features that were intermediate between bcov and mhv therefore chrcov hku24 may represent the murine origin of bcov and rodents are likely an important reservoir for ancestors of subgenus embecovirus lau et al 2015bcov is paradigmatic of how covs are able to cross the interspecies barriers establishing its derivatives as separate viral lineages affecting the respiratory andor enteric tract of humans hcov-oc43 swine phev horses equine coronavirus ecov and dogs canine respiratory coronavirus crcov a number of bcov-related viruses all currently included in the unique species betacoronavirus-1 have been detected in the enteric andor respiratory tract of domestic and wild ruminants these bcov-like covs include viruses of domestic and domesticated ruminants that were reported in sheep and goats reinhardt et al 1995 yang et al 2008 water buffalo bubalus bubalis decaro et al 2008c llamas lama lama and alpacas vicugna pacos cebra et al 2003 jin et al 2007 in the wild bcov-like covs were demonstrated in six species of the cervidae family which are cariboureindeer rangifer tarandus caribou elkwapiti cervus elephus samber deer cervus unicolor white-tailed deer odocoileus virginianus sika deer cervus nippon yesoensis and water deer hydropotes inermis amer 2018 similar viruses were also found to circulate in the giraffe giraffa camelopardalis hasoksuz et al 2007 several species of antelopes alekseev et al 2008 chung et al 2011 wisent bison bonasus himalayan tahr hemitragus jemlahicus chung et al 2011 and dromedary camels camelus dromedarius woo et al 2014 the last strain detected in the united arab emirates and consequently named dromedary camel coronavirus uae-hku-23 dccov uae-hku23 was slightly divergent from other bcov-like viruses woo et al 2014dromedary camels are susceptible to mers-cov infection developing asymptomatic infections or mild upper respiratory disease so that they are considered the natural host of mers-cov with adult animals in many countries in the middle east as well as in north and east africa showing 90  seroprevalence to the virus hemida et al 2017b although human-to-human transmission has occurred outside middle east due to travelassociated patients with mers and has caused large clusters of human cases within healthcare facilities in saudi arabia jordan and united arab emirates it remains inefficient and sustained community transmission has not being documented so far thus suggesting multiple virus introduction into the human population by infected dromedaries hemida et al 2017b more recently a phylogenetic study of 173 mers-cov full-genome sequences revealed recombination signatures that defined five major phylogenetically stable lineages all of which contained human and camel mers-cov sequences sabir et al 2016 in the same study an alphacoronavirus strictly related to hcov-229e was found in the respiratory tract of dromedary camels of saudi arabia sabir et al 2016 although some studies ruled out the susceptibility of other domestic ruminants to mers-cov reusken et al 2013 adney et al 2016 a recent study detected specific antibodies and rna in sera and nasal secretions respectively of domestic ruminants raised in africa including sheep goats and cattle kandeil et al 2019 llamas were found to be susceptible to experimental infections with mers-cov vergara-alert et al 2017the only cov that has been so far known in horses is ecov which is a bcov-descendant betacoronavirus subgenus embecovirus ecov was first isolated from the faeces of a diarrhoeic foal in 1999 ecovnc99 in north carolina usa guy et al 2000 and was initially believed to only affect foals since 2010 the virus has been recognised in japan europe and the usa as a new clinically important enteric virus of adult horses pusterla et al 2018despite mers-cov was successfully adapted to the in-vitro growth in equine cell lines meyer et al 2015 serological and molecular investigations have demonstrated that horses are not naturally infected by mers-cov meyer et al 2015 hemida et al 2017a nor they are susceptible to experimental infection adney et al 2016 vergara-alert et al 2017 however surprisingly mers-cov rna was detected in respiratory specimens of three donkeys of 42 from egypt kandeil et al 2019 a finding that requires further confirmationa molecular survey aimed to assess cov circulation in horses in saudi arabia and oman has detected two dccov uae-hku23 strains in enteric samples of horses hemida et al 2017ascarce data are available about cov circulation in donkeys these equids are susceptible to ecov infection since positive rt-pcr results were obtained from a donkey in ireland nemoto et al 2019 in addition three donkeys 71  of 42 from egypt tested positive for mers-cov rna in their nasal secretions kandeil et al 2019covs of carnivores are listed in table 6
 three covs are known in dogs ie two alphacoronaviruses of the subgenus tegacovirus namely ccov-i and ccov-ii and one betacoronavirus of the subgenus embecovirus namely crcovccovs species alphacoronav-irus-1 are commonly responsible for mild self-limiting enteritis in pups decaro and buonavoglia 2008 although they are neglected viruses and vaccination is not recommended due to the absence of an effective challenge model two independent studies have demonstrated their significant involvement in the onset of acute canine enteritis duijvestijn et al 2016 dowgier et al 2017 the evolutionary history of ccovs is tightly intermingled with that of tgev and fcovs ccov-i possesses a divergent spike protein and the intact form of an additional gene orf3 whose remnants are present in ccov-ii and at a lesser extent in tgev therefore ccov-ii has likely emerged as a consequence of recombination between the original ccov-i and an unknown cov in the s gene and of progressive loss of orf3 lorusso et al 2008 a further recombination occurred in the very 5 end of the s gene between ccov-ii and tgev giving rise to back recombinant ccov-ii strains also known as tgev-like ccovs having a spike protein n-terminus of tgev in a ccov-ii backbone decaro et al 2009 2010 consequently the ccov taxonomy was revised with classical and tgev-like strains being referred to as ccov-iia and ccov-iib respectively while ccovs are usually involved in mild forms of diarrhoea there are some hypervirulent strains that are associated to severe haemorrhagic sometimes fatal gastroenteritis in addition ccov-iia strains designated pantropic ccov that are able to spread systemically and cause severe disease and the death of infected dogs have been reported in italy buonavoglia et al 2006 alfano et al 2020 other european countries decaro et al 2013 and south america pinto et al 2014 genomic sequences from pantropic ccovs were analysed but no obvious genetic signatures that may have caused the switch in pathogenicity were found decaro and buonavoglia 2011 decaro et al 2013different from ccov-i and ccov-ii the betacoronavirus crcov is associated with mild respiratory signs and has been proposed as an etiological agent of canine infectious respiratory disease cird together with other viral and bacterial agents decaro and buonavoglia 2008 the virus was first detected firstly in uk in 2003 erles et al 2003 and subsequently in other european and extra-european countries decaro et al 2007 2016 mitchell et al 2017 maboni et al 2019 piewbang et al 2019 more et al 2020 being a bcov derivative crcov possesses the same genomic organisation with some differences in accessory orfs located between the s and e protein genes in particular while some crcovs possess a unique 88 kda protein gene directly downstream of the s protein gene other canine bcov-like covs display the canonical set of bcov accessory genes but with truncated forms of the 48 kda protein gene lorusso et al 2009in cats two alphacornavirus-1 genotypes are known namely fcov type i fcov-i and fcov type ii fcov-ii the latter being generated as a consequence of recombination events between ccov-ii and fcov-i that generated viruses with a ccov-ii genomic region encompassing orf1b orf2 s gene orf3abc orf4 e gene and partial orf5 m gene in the context of an fcov-i backbone pedersen 2014 both genotypes are involved in the development of feline infectious peritonitis fip a perivascular pyogranulomatosis of cats that may occur in two clinical forms effusive and non-effusive fip which are characterised by prevalence of effusions in the body cavities and of pyogranulomatous lesion in organs respectively fip occurs as a consequence of a change in tissue tropism of an enteric fcov strain feline enteric coronavirus fecv infecting enterocytes of the intestinal villi that acquires the ability to infect monocytesmacrophages switching to the more virulent fipv which is responsible for systemic infections and dysregulation of the proinflammatory cytokines addie et al 2009 the changes responsible for the pathogenetic shift have been investigated for many decades being suggested to be variably represented by point mutations located in the s gene rottier et al 2005 deletioninsertion in the group-specific genes 3c vennema et al 1998 chang et al 2010 7b vennema et al 1998 or 7a kennedy et al 2001a however none of these differences appeared to consistently correlate with disease phenotype more recent studies have identified specific genetic signatures in the s gene of fcov-i that are implicated in monocytemacrophage tropism two amino acid substitutions m1058 l andor s1060a corresponding to nucleotide mutations a23531 tc and t23537 g respectively in the viral genome together distinguished fcovs found in the tissues of fip cats from those found in the faeces of healthy cats without fip in  95  of cases chang et al 2012 however subsequent studies concluded that these mutations are likely to be markers of systemic fcov infection rather than fip per se porter et al 2014 barker et al 2017two alphacoronaviruses both belonging to subgenus minacovirus are currently known in mustelids namely mink coronavirus 1 mcov-1 and ferret coronavirus frcov mcov-1 has been recently identified as the etiological agent of mink epizootic catarrhal gastroenteritis ecg an infectious disease of farmed american neovison vison and european mustela lutreola mink first described in 1975 larsen and gorham 1975 and later affecting several million mink in different countries vlasova et al 2011 the disease is observed at greater frequency in mink of 4 months and is characterised by seasonality high morbidity approaching 100  and low mortality 5  recent full-genome analysis demonstrated that mcov-1 is phylogenetically distant from ccovs and fcovs being closely related to frcov vlasova et al 2011 presently the two viruses are considered separate species within subgenus minacovirus httpstalkictvonlineorgtaxonomyfrcov has been recognised as the causative agent of epizootic catarrhal enteritis ece first described in 1993 in domestic ferrets mustela putorius furo in the eastern part of the usa williams et al 2000 and subsequently reported in domestic and laboratory ferrets throughout the world murray et al 2010 analogous to fcov frcov exists in two different pathotypes i ferret enteric coronavirus frecv is associated to ece a highly contagious diarrhoeal disease also known as green slime disease which affects mainly young ferrets with morbidity and mortality rates similar to those of ecg ii ferret systemic coronavirus frscv is responsible for a systemic diseases of ferrets which is characterised by pyogranulomatous perivasculitis and peritonitis resembling to those of fip murray et al 2010 similar to fip wise et al 2010 have shown that frecv and frscv differ significantly in spike protein and that deletions in frcov 3c may also correlate with the severe pathotype of frscv recombination in the s 3c and e genes between different frcov has been also reported lamers et al 2016different covs were found to circulate in wild carnivores ccovs were detected in wolves canis lupus red foxes vulpes vulpes eurasian otters lutra lutra common genets genetta genetta alfano et al 2019 rosa et al 2020 ccov-like viruses were also found in african wild carnivores including spotted hyenas crocuta crocuta and silver-backed jackals canis mesomelas goller et al 2013 fcovs have a wide circulation in non-domestic felids kennedy et al 2002 2003 with fip cases being reported in servals felis serval juan-salles et al 1997 cheetah acinonyx jubatus kennedy et al 2001b mountain lion puma concolor stephenson et al 2013 and european wildcat felis silvestris watt et al 1993divergent alphacoronavirus-1 viruses were detected in chinese ferret badger nyctereutes procyonoides and raccoon dog melogale moschata dong et al 2007 the same study reported the identification in asian leopard cat prionailurus bengalensis and chinese ferret badger of an unclassified cov which was closely related to gammacoronaviruses in most parts of the genome whereas the s gene displayed the highest sequence identity to alphacoronaviruses dong et al 2007 with the discovery of deltacoronaviruses these viruses were later included in this novel genus along with avian and porcine strains woo et al 2009 wang et al 2014some domestic and wild carnivores are also susceptible to sars-cov infection while the potential natural reservoirs are horseshoe bats sars-like cov strains were found to be widespread in masked palm civets paguma larvata and raccoon dogs which were suspected to be intermediate hosts guan et al 2003 full-genomic comparative analysis has shown that sars-like covs isolated from palm civets are under strong selective pressure and are genetically most closely related to sars-cov strains infecting humans early in the outbreaks song et al 2005 sequence analysis of the sars-cov-like virus in masked palm civets indicated that they were highly homologous to human sars-cov with nucleotide identity over 996  indicating the virus has not been circulating in the population of masked palm civets for a very long time shi and hu 2008 a chinese ferret-badger melogale moschata was found to have neutralising antibodies against sars-cov guan et al 2003 whereas sars-cov rna was detected in naturally infected cats and red foxes vulpes vulpes but not in domestic dogs wang et al 2005 there was however a single dog testing positive for sars-cov httpsappswhointirisbitstreamhandle1066570863whocdscsrgar200311engpdf among carnivores sars-cov-2 is able to infect cats ferrets and at a lesser extent dogs shi et al 2020in 2008 a highly divergent cov tentatively named sw1 was discovered a deceased beluga wale delphinapterus leucas with pneumonia and hepatic necrosis mihindukulasuriya et al 2008 the virus was only distantly related to ibv so that it now represents the prototype of the single mammalian cov species belonging to the genus gammacoronavirus namely beluga wale coronavirus sw1 bwcov-sw1 subgenus cegacovirus few years later related gammacoronaviruses were retrieved from faecal samples of three indo-pacific bottlenose dolphins tursiops aduncus which were named bottlenose dolphin cov bdcov hku22 comparative genome analysis showed that bdcov-hku22 and bwcov-sw1 have similar genome characteristics and structures displaying a 98  nucleotide sequence identity each to other woo et al 2014a novel betacoronavirus distantly related to mers-cov was detected in the faeces of european hedgehogs erinaceus europaeus an insectivorous mammal belonging to a related order of chiroptera from germany the virus was tentatively referred to as erinaceus cov ericov corman et al 2014b and covs found in hedgehogs in france england and italy had an identity from 92 to 98  with the ericov monchatre-leroy et al 2017 saldanha et al 2019 delogu et al 2020 these hedgehog covs are are now included in a unique species hedgehog coronavirus 1 subgenus merbecovirus the virus was not associated to any form of disease so that western european hedgehog is a reservoir host of ericov in the absence of apparent disease suggesting that hedgehogs in addition to bats may contribute to the evolution of merbecovirus saldanha et al 2019 a slightly divergent merbecovirus was later found in amur hedgehogs erinaceus amurensis in china and was poposed as a prototype of a separate species namely erinaceus amurensis hedgehog coronavirus hku31 ea-hedcov hku31 lau et al 2019 a novel coronavirus named wnchng shrew coronavirus wesv was detected in shrews suncus murinus in china wang et al 2017 wesv is highly divergent from other alphacoronaviruses exhibiting less than 711  amino acid similarity to any known members of the genus alphacoronavirus in the coronavirus-wide conserved domains of the replicase polyprotein pp1ab and less than 613  amino acid similarity to the other three coronavirus genera however taking into account the current ictv criteria wesv is sufficiently divergent to be considered a distinct member of the genus alphacoronavirus but not a new genus of the subfamily orthocornavirinae wang et al 2017covs have been known in veterinary medicine since many decades some of these viruses such as ibv swine enteric covs bcov and mustelid covs can cause diseases that have a great impact on the farm industry other covs namely fipv frscv and mhv cause severe disease in companion cats ferrets or laboratory mice animals animal covs are paradigmatic on how covs evolve through accumulation of point mutations and homologous and heterologous recombination generating different genotypes and pathotypes these virus variants may have different antigenic properties escaping the host immunity induced by vaccines as is the case of ibv alternatively they may have a different tissue tropism in the same host that can increase or decrease the virus pathogenicity as observed for the virus pairs fecvfipv or frecvfrscv and tgevprcov respectively in other circumstances the cov evolution may result in the switch of the host range from one animal species to another one or from animals to humans the former event is well documented in veterinary medicine with a plethora of viruses being originated from ibv and bcov that adapted to different animal species however the most interesting scenario is the jumping and further adaptation of an animal cov to humans there is increasing evidence that all hcovs currently known recognise an animal origin with bat or rodent covs being the most probable ancestors in most instances it was suggested that other mammals served as intermediate hosts prior to final adaptation to humans ie alpacas and cattle for the low-pathogenic hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 respectively and wild carnivores and dromedary camels for the high-pathogenic sars-cov and mers-cov respectively other two hcovs namely hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 were likely derived from bats and rodents respectively but whether this transmission required an intermediate mammalian host is presently unknown the origin of sars-cov-2 should be zoonotic since highly related sequences were detected in bats but a definitive intermediate host has been not identified so far what should we expect from the current pandemic when hcov-oc43 crossed the species barrier to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890 an epidemic of respiratory infection was recorded even though several years later influenza was suspected to be the cause of it in that pandemic involvement of central nervous system was more pronounced than in other influenza outbreaks this evidence is further supported by molecular studies claiming that the most recent common ancestor of bcov and hcov-oc43 emerged around 1890 vijgen et al 2005 and by the fact that hcov-oc43 can be neuroinvasive arbour et al 2000 likely hcov-oc43 crossed species to infect dogs becoming established in this species as crcov lorusso et al 2009 a similar scenario could be observed with sars-cov-2 with dogs and at a greater extent cats apparently cats represent within the domestic animals which have been experimentally infected the host together with ferrets which is able to sustain more efficiently sars-cov-2 replication shi et al 2020 furthermore based on structural studies and biochemical experiments sars-cov-2 seems to have an rbd that binds with high affinity to ace2 also from ferrets and cats andersen et al 2020 reasonably a full comprehension of the animal cov molecular evolution host range and pathobiology is beneficial to better understand the mechanism driving the emergence and adaptation to humans of zoonotic covsthe present review has highlighted that in the last 18 years also thanks to the availability of novel sequencing technologies we have witnessed a large number of novel covs being discovered in a large number of animals truth to be told it was difficult for us to summarise in this single review all covs detected in animals and the tight interaction existing between them and human covs among animals it is evident that bats are the group of mammals that harbor the largest number of covs and that many other animal covs recognise their ancestors in bat covsin an excellent review cui et al 2019 written by the group coordinated by dr zheng-li shi of the wuhan institute of virology hubei china city infamously known for being the epicenter and origin of the covid-19 outbreak authors stated that given the prevalence and great genetic diversity of bat sars-rcovs their close coexistence and the frequent recombination of covs it is expected that novel variants will emerge in the future this forecasting statement was not surprising to coronavirologists and it was not importantly surprising to those scientists that daily deal with the plethora of viruses existing at the humananimal health interface although scientists were well aware of this hazard no substantial actions were taken forward the limitations of strict and repeated contacts between humans and wildlife indeed whereas biological mechanisms underlying viral evolution are not under human control social and cultural habits can be modified accordingly through a deep and pounding informative campaigns if to the human habits we sum the impact of modern agricultural practices and urbanization and the decrease of vital space for wildlife it is quite easy to understand that if countermeasures are not taken we will face novel serious health emergencies of animal origin in the following years with tremendous social and economic impact on our lives as clearly demonstrated by the sars-cov-2 emergence covs are the main characters of this intricate puzzle characterised by the interactions of viral biological mechanisms and human habitsour review was reasonably prepared also to highlight once more how covs originate evolve jump mutate and infect their host could have the current covid-19 outbreak been avoided answering this question is not relevant now but actions to avoid the next viral spillover from animals to humans is certainly a priority this task needs to be coupled with massive genomic surveillance in wild animals not limited to covs massive sequencing of sars-cov-2 strains detected in humans and covs of wildlife will help further assess the origin of this novel human pandemic and plan future measures able to reduce the risk of emergence of new cov spillover events however additional tasks should be provisionally addressed in order to reduce the risk of future cov pandemic like the current one these include i prevention of animal-to-human infections through a ban of the wet markets and a more friendly management of the environment ii studies on cov-host interactions to be performed both in vitro cell cultures ex-vivo explants of the respiratory tract and in vivo animals susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection iii development of new anticoronaviral drugs and evaluation of their efficacy in cell cultures and animal modelscoronaviruses are large enveloped viruses with single-stranded positive-sense non-segmented rna genomes 1 based on the current nomenclature of the international committee of taxonomy of viruses ictv coronaviruses of the family coronaviridae are now classified into four genera alpha- beta- gamma- and deltacoronavirus 2 3 betacoronaviruses can be further subdivided into four phylogenetic groups 2coronaviruses employ a unique mechanism of viral genome replication and rna synthesis resulting in high frequencies of both mutation and recombination 4 recombination appears to be particularly important in coronavirus evolution 5 with a number of hotspots interspersed throughout the viral genome 6 recombination events at 3-end of the genome might impact the replication ability of coronaviruses since there are a number of regulatory sequences and accessory genes in this region 5as coronaviruses were previously known to cause only mild respiratory illnesses in humans they were not a major concern of the public health community however the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov 79 and its high infectivity and fatality generated considerable interest in the biodiversity genomics evolution natural hosts and potential inter-species transmission of coronaviruses 10 to date at least 90 types of coronavirus have been isolated or genome-identified from humans and a wide variety of animals including domestic animals wild birds and bats bats are particularly notable in this respect because they are known to harbor a diverse range of pathogens and are known to be the reservoir hosts of both human coronavirus 229e 11 and sars-cov 12 and are closely related to mers-cov 13 14 as a consequence bats have been prioritized for the surveillance of emerging zoonotic diseases 1517in the present study we report a novel coronavirus discovered from bat samples in china that has been tentatively named rousettus bat coronavirus gccdc1 ro-batcov gccdc1 multiple lines of evidence indicate that ro-batcov gccdc1 may have arisen from a recombination event between an ancestral coronavirus and a fusogenic orthoreovirusa total of 118 rectal swab samples from rousettus leschenaulti bats sampled in yunnan province china were screened for the presence of coronavirus rna of these 47 40 samples were found to be coronavirus positive the pcr products were sequenced and blast searches revealed the sequences to be authentic coronavirus genes with the strongest similarity to rousettus bat coronavirus hku9 ro-batcov hku9 18 a member of the genus betacoronavirus group d however our attempts to isolate the virus from samples using a number of cell lines including vero e6 bhk-21 mdck a549 hep-2 caco-2 and a bat cell line from myotis kidney were unsuccessful the cell lines were inoculated with positive samples and three blind passages were performed for each sample no cytopathic effect was observed in any passage and there was an absence of viral replication from the culture supernatant and cell pellet of each passagethe viral genomic sequences present in two coronavirus positive samples numbers 346 and 356 were determined with next-generation sequencing ngs analysis using a partial 816-bp fragment sequence of the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene indicated that the newly identified virus was likely to be a novel coronavirus according to previously proposed criteria 19 therefore this virus was tentatively designated as rousettus bat coronavirus gccdc1 ro-batcov gccdc1 gaps within the genome of ro-batcov gccdc1 were closed and the complete genome sequence confirmed using sanger sequencing finally the 5- and 3-ends of ro-batcov gccdc1 genome were obtained using 5 and 3 race fig 1excluding the polyadenylated tail at the 3-terminus the genome of ro-batcov gccdc1 was 30129 nt in length with a gc content of 454 comparative genomic sequence analysis indicated that ro-batcov gccdc1 was most closely related to ro-batcov hku9 strains 18 with 666 - 674 nucleotide identities similarly ro-batcov gccdc1 displayed equivalent genomic characteristics to ro-batcov hku9 except for an inserted gene at 3 end discussed in detail in the next section the major open reading frames orfs had the identical order namely 5- replicase orf1abspike sns3envelope emembrane mnucleocapsid n followed by the accessory genes encoding nonstructural proteins nsps fig 1 and table 1 although the n gene was truncated amino acid sequence analyses showed that the orf1ab s ns3 e m and n proteins of ro-batcov gccdc1 shared higher identities with ro-batcov hku9 strains than those of other betacoronaviruses table 1 also of note was that the 3-end of ro-batcov gccdc1 genome just downstream of n gene possessed a much more complicated structure than those of other members in the genus clearly there were four nsp-encoding orfs according to the convention the second-to-fourth orfs were temporarily named ns7a ns7b and ns7c respectively since they shared 29 - 53 amino acid identities with the accessory genes of ro-batcov hku9 strains and other related bat coronaviruses s1 table perhaps the most striking feature of ro-batcov gccdc1 genome was the presence of a small intact orf with 276 bases embedded between the n and ns7a genes although this orf that had no homology to any known coronavirus the encoded protein exhibited 30 - 549 amino acid identity with the p10 protein encoded by the first orf of segment s1 of avian and bat fusogenic orthoreoviruses 20 which are double-stranded segmented rna viruses belonging to the family reoviridae therefore this orf was provisionally marked as p10 according to the molar weight of protein that it encodes fig 1the putative leader and body transcription regulatory sequences trss of ro-batcov gccdc1 and their genomic localizations were predicted in accordance with consensus core sequences of the trss of betacoronaviruses table 1 the trs core sequence 5-acgaac-3 was consistent with those of sars-cov ro-batcov hku9 and other betacoronaviruses from the location of leader trs the leader sequence of the genome was then identified which spanned genome positions 1 g to 78 c fig 1 and table 1 notably in the putative trs of the p10 gene there was one nucleobase difference with the consensus core sequence table 1the putative mature nonstructural proteins nsps in the orf1ab encoding the replicase were calculated based on the cleavage and recognition pattern of the 3c-like proteinase 3clpro and papain-like proteinase plpro comprehensive information on the size and genomic locations of nsp1 to nsp16 and the putative cleavage sites of proteinases is presented in table 2 previous studies indicated that the p1 position of 3clpro specific cleavage site is exclusively occupied by a glutamine q residue 22 23 however nucleobase 12642 in the ro-batcov gccdc1 genome was a t nucleotide thereby changing glutamine q to histidine h more interestingly there were no glutamine codons in the sequence from -273 to 192 around this site as also observed in the corresponding site in the genomes of ro-batcov hku9 therefore the lhag region may represent a potential alternative cleavage site of 3clpro to cleave between nsp9 and nsp10 a similar phenomenon may occur at the cleavage site between nsp10 and nsp12 of ro-batcov gccdc1 where the cag codon has mutated to cac causing the conversion of q to h in amino acid sequence table 2following the criteria for coronavirus species demarcation defined by the ictv 1 13 seven conserved replicase domains of ro-batcov gccdc1 were selected for analysis table 3 the amino acid identities of seven concatenated domains in ro-batcov gccdc1 revealed that they shared 844 - 848 identity with those of ro-batcov hku9 which was below the 90 threshold used for species demarcation table 3 hence these data suggest that the newly identified ro-batcov gccdc1 represents a novel coronavirus species in the genus betacoronavirusto determine the evolutionary position of ro-batcov gccdc1 the rdrp s n and p10 proteins were subjected to phylogenetic analyses phylogenetic trees of the rdrp s and n proteins illustrated that ro-batcov gccdc1 eidolon bat coronaviruskenyaky242006 ei-batcov kenya rousettus bat coronaviruskenyaky062006 ro-batcov kenya and ro-batcov hku9 strains all belong to group d of the genus betacoronavirus fig 2 within this cluster the two ro-batcov gccdc1 strains 346 and 356 formed a distinct lineage that was a sister-group to ro-batcov kenya and the ro-batcov hku9 strains maximum bootstrap value of 100 however a strikingly different phylogenetic pattern was observed in the distinctive p10 protein fig 3 in which the ro-batcov gccdc1 sequences were clearly related to bat pteropine originated orthoreoviruses although the branch leading to the ro-batcov gccdc1 sequences is long these viruses are clearly more closely related to the bat-origin than avian-origin orthoreoviruses fig 3 matching the host species from which ro-batcov gccdc1 was isolatedto exclude the false amplification of dna polymerase or the inaccurate assembly of ngs data the ngs data was analyzed further read mapping determined that there were a set of reads that covered the upstream junction site ie the recombination break-point between n and p10 genes and a downstream junction site between the p10 and ns7a genes s1 fig with data in s1 file in addition the integrity and continuity of context sequence surrounding the p10 gene were confirmed with specific primers agarose gel electrophoresis showed that the pcr products were intact fragments of the expected length the amplicons were cloned for sequencing as shown in fig 4a the sequence obtained covers without interruption the partial n gene the whole p10 gene and partial ns7a gene data in the s2 file hence there is clear evidence that the recombination event that placed the reovirus p10 gene in the ro-batcov gccdc1 genome was genuinesequencing information confirmed that the trs of p10 gene is located within the encoding sequence of n gene with the core sequence of 5-acaaac-3 which exhibited a single nucleobase difference to the consensus core sequence 5-acgaac-3 fig 4b we also observed a 97 nucleobase sequence between the trs and the p10 initiation codon fig 4b which was much longer than the intervening sequences of other genes with the exception for that between the leader trs and orf1ab table 1 as shown in fig 4b and s2 fig sequence comparisons also revealed that the location of trs in the p10 gene could be discriminated from those of other genes which are adjacent and downstream to the n gene of group d betacoronavirus notably the orf of the ro-batcov gccdc1 n gene was disrupted by the insertion of the exotic p10 gene causing the truncation of eight amino acids at the 3-terminus and a two amino acid deletion fig 5according to the information provided above the relative locations of the putative leader and body trss were identified in the genome of ro-batcov gccdc1 fig 6a based on the trss and transcription mechanism of coronavirus nine potential subgenomic mrnas of ro-batcov gccdc1 including s ns3 e m n p10 ns7a ns7b and ns7c were depicted fig 6b in addition to an identical 5 leader sequence each lower subgenomic mrna shared the same 3-end structure with the upper one to comprise a 3 co-terminal nested set with the genomethe presence of subgenomic mrnas is strong evidence of coronavirus replication in the infected cells to determine if the bat which sample was collected from was likely the natural host of ro-batcov gccdc1 subgenomic mrnas in the sample were probed with a comprehensive set of primers the pcr products were confirmed on an agarose gel as displayed in fig 6c the lowest band marked with a red arrow on each lane was the specific amplicon from each subgenomic mrna as demonstrated in fig 6b however additional amplified bands were also compatible with this inference as shown as an example on the lane of the e gene the upper band indicates that subgenomic mrna ns3 was simultaneously amplified in this reaction on each lane the lowest band was cloned for sequencing while other bands were purified and sequenced directly since the specific amplicon of the subgenomic mrna ns7c failed to be cloned into the vectors the pcr product was used as template for a second round of nested pcr the product was then confirmed as shown in the lane of ns7c-2 in fig 6c and the band was cloned for sequencing the results fig 6d and s3 fig indicated that the core sequence of the leader and body trs of each gene the leader-body fusion sites and the mode of generation of subgenomic mrnas were consistent with the prediction and demonstration in fig 6b especially the p10 gene and its subgenomic mrna therefore the existence of subgenomic mrna in the samples further proved that the p10 gene was an intact authentic gene in the genome of ro-batcov gccdc1despite the orthoreovirus origin of p10 this protein exhibited 8 amino acid differences including a 2 amino acid deletion among the 28 absolutely conserved amino acids described previously fig 7 hence it is necessary to investigate whether the p10 gene of ro-batcov gccdc1 could play the same role as its reovirus homologs for this purpose the p10 gene of ro-batcov gccdc1 was transiently expressed in bhk-21 cells as well as the p10 gene of pulau virus which was used as a positive control wright-giemsa and immunofluorescence staining showed that both genes had the same function to induce the formation of cell syncytia fig 8a and 8b and s4a fig thus the alteration of certain conserved amino acids did not impair the syncytiogenesis of p10 gene of ro-batcov gccdc1the p10 subgenomic mrna identified in the samples confirmed that the p10 gene could be transcribed from the genome of ro-batcov gccdc1 however due to the failure of virus isolation despite a great effort there is no effective way to judge whether the p10 gene could be expressed during the virus replication cycle therefore an artificial plasmid was constructed containing the transcribed p10 subgenomic mrna which confirmed the functional expression of p10 fig 8c when the plasmid was transfected into bhk-21 cells once again cell syncytia were observed with wright-giemsa and immunofluorescence staining fig 8d and s4b fig thus this indirect evidence suggests that the p10 gene functions during the replication cycle of ro-batcov gccdc1immunofluorescence staining also showed that polyclonal antibodies of ro-batcov gccdc1 p10 protein reacted with the p10 protein of pulau virus fig 8b and fig 8d in addition the cross-reactivity further proved that the p10 gene of ro-batcov gccdc1 might have the same origin as those of fusogenic orthoreovirusesas the p10 protein of ro-batcov gccdc1 is the first report of fast protein in an enveloped virus the conserved amino acids of the p10 protein of ro-batcov gccdc1 were mutated to determine whether they play a vital role in cell-to-cell fusion and syncytium formation as those sites in the p10 protein of reoviruses s5a fig 24 25 notably no cell syncytia were observed for all mutant constructs of p10 which had substitutions in the previously defined key sites in the p10 protein of reoviruses s5b fig this indicates that the functionality of p10 in ro-batcov gccdc1 also depends on traditional conserved domains relevant for the function of the fast protein 24 25to confirm the expression of p10 by the ro-batcov gccdc1 virus we performed western blotting wb to detect the presence of p10 protein in the bat feces and concentrated rectal swab specimens the results revealed the expression of p10 by ro-batcov gccdc1 itself s6 figwe have identified a novel coronavirus ro-batcov gccdc1 from rousettus leschenaulti that belongs to group d of the genus betacoronavirus and which is related to ro-batcov hku9 18 according to the criteria defined by ictv 1 ro-batcov gccdc1 is sufficiently divergent to represent a novel bat coronavirus more striking was that ro-batcov gccdc1 contains a p10 protein located at the 3-end of the genome that appears to have captured from a bat-origin orthoreovirus by heterologous recombinationhomologous recombination events frequently occur during the viral rna replication of coronaviruses and are important for their evolution 10 2729 however it is also possible that coronaviruses are one of the few virus families that can experience heterologous recombination for example members of betacoronavirus group a possess an he gene 30 31 which was seemingly derived from ancestral influenza c virus a negative-stranded rna virus with a segmented genome 30 31 and which would represent another case of inter-family recombination although it has also been proposed that the he gene might be captured from host rna 32 uncommon inter-family recombination events have also been reported in chicken infectious anemia virus 33 bandicoot papillomatosis carcinomatosis virus type 1 34 and recombinant viruses between mareks disease virus fowlpox virus and various avian retroviruses 35 36 in the current study sequence phylogenetic and functional analyses demonstrated that the p10 gene of ro-batcov gccdc1 was likely derived from an ancestral orthoreovirus although that it occupies a divergent position in the phylogeny suggests that the direct ancestor of the recombination event has yet to be sampled hence these data provide clear evidence for a putative inter-family recombination between a single-stranded positive-sense rna virus and a double-stranded segmented rna virus the mechanisms that underpin such inter-family heterologous recombination clear merit further investigationthe biggest difference between fusogenic and nonfusogenic orthoreoviruses is the presenceabsence of a small protein encoded by the segment s1 of the genome termed the fusion-associated small transmembrane fast protein the fast proteins are the only known nonenveloped reovirus fusogens that can mediate cell-to-cell but not virus-cell membrane fusion to induce the formation of syncytia 20 and which might promote the dissemination of virus among cells 37 thus the fast proteins are the pathogenic determinants of fusogenic orthoreoviruses to date the fast family comprises six members including p10 proteins encoded by avian- and bat-origin orthoreoviruses p13 p14 and p15 encoded by broome virus reptilian reovirus and bush viper reovirus and baboon orthoreovirus respectively and p16 and p22 encoded by aquareoviruses intriguingly a specific p10 gene was identified in ro-batcov gccdc1 so that this is the first report of a fast protein in an enveloped virus and hence could represent the seventh member of fast familyunfortunately the isolation of ro-batcov gccdc1 failed on cell culture in the present study so it is difficult to determine the role of p10 gene during the life cycle of ro-batcov gccdc1 however functional analysis showed that the coronavirus p10 gene could induce syncytium formation in the transfected cells in the same manner as orthoreoviruses which might be beneficial for cell-to-cell virus spread it is therefore possible that the p10 protein enhances the transmission potential of ro-batcov gccdc1 previous studies of the potential recombination between coronavirus and influenza c virus revealed the pivotal role of the shared he gene for the pathogenesis of betacoronavirus group a 38 interestingly human coronavirus hku1 oc43 and bovine coronaviruses employ the he protein to mediate receptor-destroying enzyme activity late in the infection cycle to facilitate viral progeny release and achieve efficient virus dissemination 39compared to nonfusogenic orthoreoviurses fusogenic orthoreoviruses can cause severe pneumonia when infecting humans 40 41 further implying that p10 is an important pathogenic determinant thus the recombination of the reovirus-originated p10 into the ro-batcov gccdc1 may enable the novel virus to disseminate and replicate rapidly in the host in turn leading to severe infections in recent years several coronaviruses notably sars-cov and mers-cov have caused severe pneumonia among humans 42 43 because of the presence of human infected fusogenic orthoreoviruses such as melaka virus melv 44 there is obviously some risk that cross-family recombination events such as that described here may generate a novel coronavirus with altered pathogenicity our study therefore highlights the importance of investigating the mechanisms that might enable possible recombination between human coronaviruses and orthoreovirusesin the protein sequence of orf1ab encoded replicase of ro-batcov gccdc1 the regular p1 position at two 3clpro cleavage sites nsp9nsp10 and nsp10nsp12 contains a q to h mutation which may impair the proteolytic efficacy and the release of nsp9 nsp10 and nsp12 as nsp12 is a typical rna polymerase and the core of replication-transcription complexes rtc and nsp10 usually serves as a molecular switch that can interact with multiple nsps to form complexes the replication ability of ro-batcov gccdc1 might be suppressed by the decrease of release of these vital elements it is also interesting to note that a similar situation may be observed at the nsp13nsp14 cleavage sites of replicase polyprotein of human coronavirus hku1 and human coronavirus nl63 clearly further investigation will need to focus on the isolation of the virus construction of infectious clones and the virulence and replication ability of ro-batcov gccdc1 influenced by knockout of p10 gene andor reverse mutation of cleavage sitesphylogenetically distinct virus species or lineages have been reported co-circulating in certain bat populations 45 46 under this situation co-infections of single host cellsthe necessary requisite for recombinationare possible by careful sequence analysis we show that the heterologous recombination event placed the p10 gene in ro-batcov gccdc1 is genuine previous studies showed the existence of p10-harboring orthoreoviruses in bat populations 40 4749 such that co-infections with bat coronaviruses and hence recombination events are clearly possible in addition a previous study reported that mammalian orthoreovirus a type of nonfusogenic orthoreovirus was isolated from a sars-cov patient along during the in 2003 outbreak 50 we believe that future studies should investigate co-infections in specific bat cell lines using a coronavirus similar to ro-batcov gccdc1 or ro-batcov hku9 and the relevant orthoreoviruses from which it will be possible to reveal more of the underlying basis of heterologous coronavirus recombinationthe protocol in this study was approved by the committee on the ethics of animal care and use of the chinese

subjected to next generation sequencing ngs using the ion proton platform the original ngs data were filtered refined and mapped to the reference sequence of ro-batcov hku9 genbank accession number nc009021 using soap short oligonucleotide alignment program 52 any remaining gaps in the genome were closed by pcr amplification of these regions with specific primers and then sequenced complete genome sequences were confirmed with sanger sequencing on the fragments amplified with a set of primers that covered the whole genome the 5- and 3-race analyses were performed with 5- and 3- full race kit takara japan according to the manufacturers instructionsas the amplification of 5-end of the genome of ro-batcov gccdc1 strain 346 was unsuccessful we focused our genome analyses on the complete genome of ro-batcov gccdc1 strain 356 this genome was compared to those of eight complete genomes of ro-batcov hku9 genbank accession numbers nc009021 ef065514 ef065515 ef065516 hm211098 hm211099 hm211100 and hm211101 respectively to annotate the 1ab s ns3 e m and n orfs respectively as the origin of the orfs at the 3-end of the genome were uncertain they were also blasted tblastx against the genbank database the amino acid sequence of orf1ab was aligned with the reference sequences of sars-cov human coronavirus hku1 infectious bronchitis virus turkey coronavirus bovine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus genbank accession numbers nc004718 nc006577 nc001451 nc010800 nc003045 nc001846 and nc003436 respectively to determine the cleavage and recognition patterns of the c-like proteinase and papain-like proteinase of the 16 nonstructural proteins in addition the sequences of the 5 untranslated region 5-utr and 3 untranslated region 3-utr were defined and the leader sequence the leader and body trss were illustrated based on comparison with sars-covto eliminate the possibility of false amplification of dna polymerase or inaccurate assembly of ngs data the raw ngs data were further scrutinized and reads extracted for mapping to check the continuity of the p10 sequence especially the upstream junction site between n and p10 genes and the downstream junction site between the p10 and ns7a genes in addition two sets of specific primers were designed to confirm the integrity and continuity of sequence surrounding the p10 gene primer sequences shown in s5 table the amplicons were subsequently cloned into the pmd18-t vector and recombinant plasmids were subjected to sanger sequencingto determine the phylogenetic position of the newly identified coronavirus among the known diversity of coronaviruses the amino acid sequences of the rdrp s and n proteins were used for phylogenetic analyses genbank accession numbers shown in s2 table in the case of the imported p10 gene homologous sequences of orthoreoviruses were utilized as the background data set in the phylogenetic analysis genbank accession numbers listed in s3 table all amino acid sequences were aligned using muscle 53 and all poorly or ambiguously aligned regions were removed using gblocks 54 because of the short length of the p10 and n amino acid sequence alignments more relaxed gblocks parameters were used in these cases in all cases phylogenetic trees of amino acid sequence alignments were inferred using the maximum likelihood method available in the phyml package 55 with bootstrap values estimated from 1000 replicate trees each tree was inferred using the lg model of amino acid substitution with values of the gamma shape parameter inferred using prottest 56 finally all phylogenetic trees were displayed and annotated with figtreesamples positive for coronavirus were cultured in vero e6 bhk-21 mdck a549 hep-2 caco-2 cells as well as in an immortalized kidney cell line of myotis davidii the cell lines were inoculated with positive samples and three blind passages were performed for each sample the culture supernatant and cell pellet of each passage were harvested the detection of viral replication was conducted using specific primers targeting the conserved region of rdrpnested subgenomic mrnas are generated during the replication cycle of coronaviruses hence the identification of subgenomic mrnas in the samples provides strong evidence for the replication of coronavirus to analyze the possibility of replication in the newly identified bat coronavirus primers were designed to determine the presence of viral subgenomic mrnas in the coronavirus-positive bat rectal swab samples forward primers were designed targeting the leader sequence at the 5-end of the complete genome and the putative subgenomic mrnas while reverse primers were designed within the orfs or downstream of the corresponding gene primer sequences are shown in s6 table specific amplicons that matched the expected length were purified and then cloned into the pmd-18t vector for sequencing while the additional suspected bands on the agarose gels were excised purified and then subjected to direct sequencing since the specific amplicon of subgenomic mrna ns7c failed to be cloned into the vectors the pcr product was used as a template for a second round of nested pcr the product was then confirmed with agarose gel electrophoresis and the band was cloned for sequencingthe protein family of the putative p10 protein was analyzed using pfam 57 and interproscan 58 prediction of transmembrane domains was performed using tmhmm 59 tmpred and predictprotein 60 peptides corresponding to the ectodomain from amino acid positions 237 and the cytoplasmic domain the last 33 amino acids peptide sequences are described in s7 table of the putative p10 protein were synthesized xuheyuan biological technology co ltd beijing china after conjugation with keyhole limpet hemocyanin klm the synthesized peptides were used to immunize mice for antibody production the mice five mice per peptide were injected intramuscularly at their hind legs with 20 g of the conjugated peptide mixed with adjuvant followed by boosts until 14 days with the same conjugated peptides seven days after the boosts the mice were killed and their blood collected to isolate sera antibody titers were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisain the cells infected with avian- or bat-origin fusogenic orthoreoviruses the formation of cell syncytia depends on a p10 protein which is encoded by the first orf in segment s1 of the reovirus genome it was previously demonstrated that amino acid residues of p10 proteins could be sorted into absolutely highly moderately and non-conserved amino acids 26sequence and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the p10 gene of ro-batcov gccdc1 most likely originated in an orthoreovirus comparative sequence analysis revealed that although the majority of key amino acids and motifs of the ro-batcov gccdc1 p10 protein were conserved there were 8 amino acids differences including 2 deletions among the 28 so-called absolutely conserved amino acids that characterize members of the fast family fig 7 hence it is necessary to explore the potential role of the p10 gene during the life cycle of ro-batcov gccdc1to determine whether the putative p10 protein could play the same role as homologous proteins of avian and bat orthoreoviruses the p10 gene was cloned into the pcaggs vector and the recombinant plasmid fig 8a was then transfected into bhk-21 cells using polyethylimine pei polysciences inc according to the manufacturers protocol at the appropriate time post-transfection cell-to-cell fusion was observed for the syncytium formation under the light microscope using wright-giemsa staining and an indirect immunofluorescence assay employing the polyclonal antibodies prepared above the p10 gene of pulau virus a bat orthoreovirus 49 was also cloned into the pcaggs vector to serve as a positive control cells transfected with an empty pcaggs vector were used as a mock controlthe next step is to confirm that p10 can be transcribed or translated during the replication cycle of ro-batcov gccdc1 we confirmed that the p10 gene could be transcribed from the genome during the replication cycle of ro-batcov gccdc1 with the p10 subgenomic mrna representing a distinct signal further we cloned the deduced p10 subgenome into a pcdna30-derived vector to construct an artificial plasmid fig 8c which could be transcribed out of an mrna that is consistent with the p10 subgenomic mrna in the infected cells of the host the recombinant plasmid was transfected into bhk-21 cells and cell syncytia were observed as described above the recombinant plasmid of pulau virus p10 gene was still served as positive control cells transfected with empty pcdna30 vector were used as mock controlas the p10 protein of ro-batcov gccdc1 is the first reported in an enveloped virus we first tried to define the key amino acids for the p10 protein in the ro-batcov gccdc1 as described previously for p10 protein of reoviruses 24 25 for syncytial indexing of six mutant constructs each well of bhk-21 monolayer cells in a 6-well plate were transfected with 2 g of plasmid dna using polyethylimine pei polysciences inc and incubated for 5 h before replacing the transfection mixture with dmem growth media invitrogen supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum gibco transfected cells were paraformaldehyde-fixed and stained with wright-giemsa at the indicated times and syncytia were observed and pictures were taken at 100 magnification on an olympus ix51fldp70 microscopethe original specimens of bat rectal swabs and feces were used to test the expression of p10 bhk-21 cells with transient expression plasmid of p10 gene pcaggs-p10 were used as a positive control briefly bat specimens and bhk-21 cell lysates were subjected to sds-page and transferred to a pvdf membrane the membranes were blocked with a 5 non-fat dry milk solution and incubated with p10 antibody overnight at 4c followed by peroxidase-conjugated affinipure goat anti-mouse igg hl zhongshan goldenbridge beijing after washing with tbs-t buffer the membrane was treated with immobilontm western chemiluminescent hrp substrate millipore billerica and pictures were taken with chemiluminescence system microchemi 42 dnr bio-imaging systems ltd usathe complete genome sequences of ro-batcov gccdc1 strains 346 and 356 have been deposited in the genbank database and assigned accession numbers ku762337 and ku762338 respectively we also deposited the sequences of the p10 genes from the rectal swabs of 24 bats in genbank all these accession numbers are listed in s8 tablecurrently there is no specific and effective antiviral therapy for covid-19 and patients are offered only supportive therapy chen et al 2020 to curb the spread of the disease measures aimed at controlling the potential sources of infection and early diagnosis are followed while proper personal hygiene supportive treatment and the clear publication of epidemic information are also recommended from a public health perspective there is an urgent need to find antiviral therapies and to develop an effective vaccine to stop or at least limit the pandemic caused by covid-19 in this sense working on the development of antivirals that target essential elements of viral replication cycle requires an intensive researchthe main function of the endoplasmic reticulum er in eukaryotic cells is to synthesize and fold the transmembrane proteins ghavami et al 2018 iranpour et al 2016 yeganeh et al 2013 and those that are going to be secreted and regulate secretome of the cells logue et al 2018 talty et al 2019 however entry of excess amount of proteins to the er protein folding system disrupts the balance between protein synthesis demand and er folding capacity resulting in the accumulation of the unfolded proteins in the lumen of the organelle continued accumulation of the unfolded proteins in the er lumen triggers er stress response which is initiated to help the organelle return to homeostasis almanza et al 2019 the changes in the er initiate the activation of signalling pathways known collectively as the unfolded protein response upr almanza et al 2019 hombach-klonisch et al 2018 yeganeh et al 2015the upr response is mediated by three er transmembrane sensors the protein kinase r pkr-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase perk the activating transcriptional factor 6 atf6 and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha ire1 lee et al 2003 mehrbod et al 2019 shi et al 1998 szegezdi et al 2006 wang et al 2000 specifically these sensors are transmembrane proteins with an intraluminal domain that recognizes unfolded proteins inside the er and a cytosolic domain that will transmit the signal and activate the subsequent response upr resolves er stress by diverse mechanisms to improve er folding capacity by inducing the expression of molecular chaperones a reduction in the global protein synthesis to reduce their influx into

et al 2006 tabas and ron 2011the replication of coronaviruses takes place in the cytoplasm and is directly related to the er diverse studies have shown that the replication of coronavirus induces er stress and consequently upr in infected cells upr modulates a wide range of signalling pathways that are essential to the cell function such as the mitogen-activated protein map kinase pathways inflammatory responses apoptosis autophagy and innate immunity thus it is not surprising that the existence of er stressupr can significantly affect the patients antiviral response and is a key factor in virus-host interaction fung and liu 2019 ma et al 2018 shi et al 2019 zou et al 2019er stress has been evident in cells infected with various viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov murine hepatitis virus mhv avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv chan et al 2006 fung and liu 2019 liao et al 2013 shi et al 2019 versteeg et al 2007 yeung et al 2008 the likely mechanisms responsible for er stress and induction of upr response upon coronavirus infection is excessive synthesis modification and folding of viral proteins the severe restructuring of the er membrane for the formation of double membrane vesicles dmvs for viral genome replication and the exhaustion of the er membrane due to continued formation of new virions and autophagy fung et al 2014 fung and liu 2014 different coronaviruses have developed the ability to subvert or utilize certain aspects of upr and overcome protein translation shutdown to benefit their own replication and pathogenesis by ensuring the production of viral proteins fung et al 2016in one study it was analysed in sars-cov how the early secretory pathway interacts with the induction of a reticulovesicular cytoplasmic network and the viral replicationtranscription complex that is anchored to this network knoops et al 2010 treatment with brefeldin a a drug that prevents the assembly of proteins of the coatomer protein i copi complex hence disrupting the transport from the er to the golgi complex partly inhibited reticulovesicular network formation and viral rna synthesis but did not completely block viral rna synthesis the authors conclude that a reduced level of reticulovesicular cytoplasmic network formation can be maintained in the presence of brefeldin a suggesting that the early secretory pathway is unlikely to be intimately involved in coronavirus replicationanother work reported that delayed brain tumour cell line infected by mhv responded with the activation of both ire1 and atf6 pathways evidenced by an ire1-mediated splicing of xbp-1 x-box binding protein 1 mrna and the cleavage of atf6 bechill et al 2008 however a reduced induction of downstream upr target genes was observed ultimately the virus alters the upr preventing the induction of upr-responsive genes which induces the blockage of protein synthesis in the host cell and favours the translation of viral proteins this modified response would allow mhv to escape the innate defence cell signalling pathways during coronavirus replication in yet another project researchers investigated the capability of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus pedv infection to induce upr in vero cells wang et al 2014 they have shown that the presence of the virus in the cell induced a upr while the silencing of perk by shrna considerably increased virus loads in the cells the treatment with an er stress inducer 2-deoxy-d-glucose 2-dg reduced the degree of pedv infection via altering viral protein translation during the early stage of virus infection and reducing the virus assembly the antiviral effects of an small compound inhibitor named k22 z-n-3-4-4-bromophenyl-4-hydroxypiperidin-1-yl-3-oxo-1-phenylprop-1-en-2 ylbenzamide that specifically targets this membrane-bound rna replication step by blocking the formation of dmvs was assayed in primary human epithelia cultures lundin et al 2014 k22 exerted strong anti-coronavirus activities including sars-cov and merscov during the early stages of infection through severe loss of dmv formation resulting in almost complete inhibition of rna synthesisit has been reported that in severe cases of covid-19 hypoxaemia is induced by the pneumonic process and might have several adverse effects in patients rello et al 2020 there are several lines of defence mechanisms in response to hypoxia which is a consequence of hypoxaemia including responses triggers from mitochondria and er bartoszewska and collawn 2020 the main goal of these responses to hypoxia is restoring oxygen level and promoting cell survival in these conditions bartoszewska and collawn 2020 therefore in prolonged hypoxia induction via covid-19 the upr is triggered to help the cells to survive however prolonged hypoxia would possibly drive upr role from survival to death and apoptotic mode which possibly is one of the causes of cellular and organ damage in covid-19 casesrecent investigation has showed that ire1 axis of upr is involved in regulation of the secretome of the cells via production of spliced xbp xbps logue et al 2018 the investigators have developed a specific inhibitor which competitively inhibits rnaase activity of ire1 logue et al 2018 sanches et al 2014 and showed that it inhibits secretome of the breast cancer cells logue et al 2018 on the other hand recent reports indicate that sars-coronavirus induces upr through its open reading frame-8b orf-8b it also activates nlr family pyrin domain containing 3 nlrp3 inflammasomes in macrophages which is involved in regulation of il-1 and il-18 orf-8b also activates autophagy flux in the infected cells which might be indirectly involved in regulation of cytokine processing in the infected cells shi et al 2019 therefore targeting the rnaase activity of ire1 could potentially be an ideal approach to modulate covid-19 infection and pathogenesis via modulation of the secretome of macrophagesyet another study has showed that sars-cov activated perk arm of upr with subsequent increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha eif2 activation of the perk regulates innate immunity by suppression of type 1 interferon ifn signaling minakshi et al 2009 therefore it suggests a potential role for upr in attenuating ifn responses and innate immunity in coronavirus infected cells hence recently developed potent perk inhibitors gsk-perk inhibitor could also serve as potential therapeutics for controlling covid 19 infectionseveral compounds can act as metal ionophores which diffuse through lipid membranes as they transport metal ions between extracellular and intracellular spaces and between different cellular compartments ionophore-metal complexes passes across lipid vesicle membranes becoming protonated upon entry which triggers the release of the bound metal inside the cellular organelle this interferes with the acidification of the lysosomal compartment and affects autophagy leading to the release of degradative enzymes into the cytosol upon disruption of lysosomes triggering stress and subsequent apoptosis in rous sarcoma virus rsv metal ionophores 8-hydroxyquinoline and several of its derivatives can inhibit proteasome with subsequent disruption of viral replication processes through the inhibition of ribonucleic acid-dependent deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase rohde et al 1976 zinc zn ionophores can exert their effects on both autophagy rohde et al 1976 and proteasome te velthuis et al 2010 with their effects being extensively evaluated in cancer ding and lind 2009 and hiv infection lee et al 2019 the observed effects were due to the inhibition of the rna-dependent rna polymerase elongation and template binding usage of zinc and zinc ionophores may enhance the therapeutic effects of targeting autophagy and replication in covid-19 by several compounds which along pyrithione include dithiocarbamates disulfiram and quinoline derivatives such as clioquinol since zn and zn ionophores interact with both the autophagy machinery and the replicative apparatus in sars-cov such interactions likely involve er stress and upr inductionin summary sars-cov-2 can possibly activate upr and hijack this pathway for the benefit of its own infection process in scheme 1
a brief summary of the possible role of autophagy and upr in sars-cov-2 infection is summarized considering that the replication of coronaviruses causes er stress and induces upr in the infected cells additional research on coronavirus-induced upr could help identify new targets for antiviral agents and facilitate the development of effective vaccines against covid-19 interfering with or manipulating the coronavirus-induced upr may provide new therapeutic targets that contribute to infection control and the pathogenesis of this emergent coronavirushereby all authors agree the publication of the article by european journal of pharmacology

the incubation period of an infectious disease is the time between infection and symptom onset5 this period is widely reported because it is useful in infectious disease surveillance and control in which the time of symptom onset may be the only indication of the time of infection severe acute respiratory syndrome sars offers a dramatic example by rapidly determining the maximum incubation period of sars public-health officials were able to set quarantine periods and halt a potential pandemic without the aid of a vaccine or treatment6 7 8 9 the incubation period thus plays an essential part in surveillance for healthcare-associated infections10 11 and may aid in diagnosis if laboratory facilities are unavailable the incubation period is clinically relevant in the administration of antiviral medications many of which are most effective when given before or immediately after symptom onset12 epidemiological studies depend on the incubation period to identify potential sources of infection13 predictive models designed to inform policy decisions use the incubation period to evaluate the potential of surveillance programmes and interventions to confront emerging epidemics14 15 the length of the incubation period by comparison with the latent period the time between infection and becoming infectious determines the potential effectiveness of control measures that target symptomatic individuals16
statements of the incubation period are often imprecise unsourced or based on limited evidencefor example 45 days may refer to the most common range the highest and lowest incubation periods in a study or some other interval without knowing which summary measure is being stated it is hard to use this information to make clinical or infection control decisions estimates given without attribution or based on few observations do not meet the standards of evidence we demand for modern medical informationwe reviewed the literature on nine respiratory viruses selected for their clinical or public-health importance adenovirus human coronavirus sars-associated coronavirus influenza measles human metapneumovirus parainfluenza respiratory syncytial virus rsv and rhinovirus17 by systematic review and analysis of published estimates and data we aim to 1 capture the consensus in the medical literature on these incubation periods 2 characterise the evidence underlying this consensus and 3 provide improved estimates of incubation periods for these infections previous reviews show the importance of the incubation period to the epidemiology of both infectious and non-infectious disease18 19 20 however we know of no other attempt to combine published data and use a common method for estimating and reporting the incubation period for a broad range of respiratory virus infectionsfor each virus we searched pubmed google scholar and isi web of knowledge 40 with no restrictions on language although non-english documents were excluded on abstract review searches were done between may 2007 and january 2008 with no restriction on the earliest date of the articles returned on pubmed we searched for the terms incubation period and the virus name on google scholar we searched for the phrases incubation period of virus name and incubation period for virus name and on isi web of knowledge we searched for incubation period and the virus name each search was done with common variations of the virus name specifically adenovirus coronavirus human coronavirus hcov severe acute respiratory syndrome sars influenza measles human metapneumovirus hmpv parainfluenza hpiv respiratory syncytial virus rsv and rhinovirus we also reviewed four widely used infectious disease references3 12 21 22 as well as several library catalogues and the cochrane librarynon-english documents and dead links returned by google scholar were excluded from abstract review abstracts were reviewed by a single reviewer and excluded from full-text review if they were definitively about a different disease a non-human study or a non-respiratory manifestation of the disease otherwise all other articles returned by the searches were included in full-text reviewdocuments in the full-text review were classified as containing 1 an incubation period estimate based on original data or analysis 2 a sourced statement of the incubation period ie citation given 3 an unsourced statement of the incubation period ie no citation given andor 4 no statement of the incubation period relevant citations were similarly reviewed documents were further classified based on whether they contained individual-level data appropriate for analysis each paper potentially containing original data was examined independently by two reviewers for figures tables or text describing individual-level incubation period data discrepancies between reviewers were resolved by discussion and consensusvariance or sds are rarely reported for incubation periods which makes standard meta-analytic techniques ineffective to confront this issue we separately summarised the statements in the literature and reanalysed published individual-level data via a pooled analysis the pooled analysis allows standard treatment of censored observations ie those cases when the incubation period is not exactly observed across studieswe classified all statements of the incubation period categories 13 into two types statements of the interval of the incubation period including maxima and minima and statements of central tendency ie median mode or mean observations in tables figures or text that gave an exact incubation period a range of possible times for exposure and symptom onset or a range of potential incubation periods were included if the incubation period was not measured exactly data were represented as single interval-censored observations covering the range of possible incubation periods for example if an individual was infected between 0600 h on march 12 and 0600 h on march 14 and then developed symptoms between 0600 h on march 16 and 0600 h on march 17 we represent this as an interval-censored observation of an incubation period of between 2 and 5 days we report the range of incubation periods such that an incubation period within that range would be consistent with the predictions of most investigators ie consistent with over 50 of published estimates and the modal statement of central tendencyin his classic paper sartwell19 showed that for most acute infectious diseases the log-incubation periods follow a normal distribution hence the incubation period follows a log-normal distribution specified by the median incubation period and a dispersion factor19 23 in a normal distribution approximately two-thirds of the data fall within one sd of the mean similarly in a log-normal distribution approximately two-thirds of cases develop symptoms between mediandispersion and mediandispersionfor each disease all observations were pooled together as a single set of singly interval-censored observations and maximum-likelihood estimates for the median and dispersion were found by use of standard techniques estimates of the 5th 25th 75th and 95th percentiles were calculated and cis were obtained by use of the delta method24 for one virus human coronavirus standard methods for maximum likelihood estimation did not converge and an estimate obtained by use of bayesian methods is reported to account for the potential effect of differences between studies hierarchical models allowing for study-specific medians were fit to the data in most cases these models produced estimates nearly identical to the pooled estimates results not shown technical details are available in the webappendix all analysis was done using the r statistical package version 26

15 papers stated the incubation period of respiratory disease due to adenovirus of 13 articles without original data none cited an original source two original studies were found an experimental study of adenovirus infection in 1947 reported the incubation period to be 56 days25 and an observational study of secondary infections in families found the mean incubation period to be 10 days64 statements varied from a few days to over a week but most were consistent with an incubation period of 48 days table 1based on 14 observations from a single experimental study25 we estimate the median incubation period of respiratory illness due to adenovirus to be 56 days 95 ci 4863 with a dispersion of 126 95 ci 113138 25 of cases will develop symptoms by 48 days 95 ci 4055 and 75 by 65 days 95 ci 5674 after infection because of limited data the 5th and 95th percentiles were not estimatedof nine papers providing an incubation period for human coronavirus two were based on original data and four were sourced all sourced estimates cited a 1967 experimental study which found the incubation period to range from 2 days to 4 days with a mean of 33 days26 an experimental study by tyrell and colleagues65 found similar results most published estimates for human coronavirus are consistent with an incubation period of 25 days table 1based on 13 observations from one experimental study26 we estimate the median incubation period of human coronavirus to be 32 days 95 ci 2837 and the dispersion to be 115 95 ci 107134 25 of cases will develop symptoms by 29 days 95 ci 2533 and 75 by 35 days 95 ci 3142 after infection there were insufficient data to confidently estimate the 5th or 95th percentileswe found many studies on the incubation of sars-associated coronavirus including a comprehensive review66 sophisticated statistical analyses23 67 68 and attempts to synthesise available data7 however reporting of these results has not been previously standardisedwe found 168 sources with estimates for the incubation period of sars-associated coronavirus public concern and the importance of quarantine for controlling sars-associated coronavirus contribute to frequent statements of the incubation period8 9 69 most n81 of the published estimates were sourced with 65 unsourced and 30 original estimates the most cited sources are donnelly and colleagues67 early analysis of the hong kong outbreak and the consensus estimate published by who7 most estimates for sars-associated coronavirus are consistent with an incubation period of 210 days table 1based on 157 observations from nine observational studies6 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 we estimate the median incubation period of sars-associated coronavirus to be 40 days 95 ci 3644 and the dispersion to be 181 95 ci 167195 5 of sars-associated coronavirus cases will develop symptoms by 15 days 95 ci 1217 and 95 by 106 days 95 ci 89122 after infectioninfluenza causes 250 000 to 500 000 deaths worldwide each year70 illness often has an abrupt onset and ranges from asymptomatic infection to primary viral pneumonia that progresses to death3 symptoms include fever chills cough headache diffuse myalgia and upper respiratory-tract infection gastrointestinal symptoms are common in children3
we identified 107 documents that stated an incubation period for influenza 54 provided no source and 16 were based on original data the earliest data comes from 189171 and the most recent from 200672 most sourced estimates derive from a 1979 observational study by moser and colleagues42 in which 37 airline passengers developed influenza after exposure to a single case all became symptomatic 1284 h after exposure median 38 h in a highly cited 1998 paper cox and fukuda73 summarised these results codifying the estimate as 14 days with which most estimates for influenza are consistent table 1 many original studies of influenzas incubation period remain uncited several pre-1918 reports a series of papers on the 1918 pandemic and a flurry of experimental studies published in the 1930s and 1940s after discovery of the virus remain underusedwe extracted 85 observations of the incubation period of influenza a from six experimental studies37 38 39 40 41 43 78 observations of the incubation period of influenza b from two experimental studies41 44 and 66 observations of the incubation period of influenza a or an unknown strain from three observational studies42 45 46 unknown strains were presumed to be influenza a due to their occurrence during influenza a pandemicswe estimate the median incubation period of influenza a to be 14 days 95 ci 1315 and the dispersion to be 151 95 ci 143160 5 of influenza a cases will develop symptoms by 07 days 95 ci 0608 and 95 by 28 days 95 ci 2532 after infection incubation period estimates for influenza a were sensitive to a single study with substantially different findings from other studies41 excluding this study resulted in a median incubation period of influenza a of 19 days 95 ci 1820 with dispersion of 122 95 ci 117129we estimate the median incubation period of influenza b to be 06 days 95 ci 0506 and the dispersion to be 151 95 ci 137164 5 of influenza b cases will develop symptoms by 03 days 95 ci 0203 and 95 by 11 days 95 ci 0913 after infection both studies of influenza b define symptom onset as the first instance of fever potentially shortening the incubation period estimate compared with that seen in clinical practiceglobally measles causes an estimated 500 000 deaths each year in children aged under 5 years74 the first symptoms include fever malaise cough conjunctivitis coryza and kopliks spots12 these symptoms are followed by an erythematous maculopapular rash complications include otitis media pneumonia convulsions and encephalitisof 52 documents with statements of the measles incubation period 31 were unsourced 16 provided a source and five were based on observational data the distinctive clinical presentation of measles allowed observations of the incubation period as early as 184749 most estimates for measles are consistent with an incubation period of 814 days table 1 some of the variability in estimates stems from the use of two clinical definitions of symptom onset the appearance of rash and the first symptoms of illness we have excluded those studies that reported just the time to rash as our interest was the time until first symptoms however not all the reports stated the specific symptom used by the authors to mark the end of the incubation periodbased on 55 observations from eight observational studies47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 we estimate the median incubation period of measles to be 125 days 95 ci 118132 and the dispersion to be 123 95 ci 118128 5 of measles cases will develop symptoms before 89 days 95 ci 8198 and 95 by 177 days 95 ci 161192 after infectionhuman metapneumovirus first described in 2001 contributes to morbidity and hospital admission in all age-groups12 clinically human metapneumovirus causes illness ranging from upper respiratory-tract symptoms to bronchiolitis and pneumonia requiring ventilation12 clinical examination of the lungs is abnormal in a quarter to a third of adults febrile seizures are reported in up to 16 of children75
little is known about the incubation period of human metapneumovirus we found only two reported observations of serial transmissions suggesting incubation periods of 56 days36 and 46 days35 the incubation period of human metapneumovirus may be similar to that of rsv due to similarities between these viruses22
parainfluenza viruses cause upper respiratory-tract infection pneumonia and bronchiolitis and are a major cause of croup12 initial symptoms include coryza sore throat hoarseness and dry cough4 four antigenically distinct serotypes exist each with characteristic seasonal and age-specific pattern of infection most children are infected by multiple serotypes by age 5 years76
we found 14 documents with statements of the incubation period for parainfluenza that provided six original estimates four sourced estimates and six unsourced estimates four experimental and two observational studies include one exceptional observation not included in the pooled analysis of respiratory illness with virological evidence of parainfluenza infection with an incubation period of 1029 weeks77 these cases occurred during a period of winter isolation of antarctic researchers and may indicate sustained asymptomatic transmission or the ability of the virus to viably persist in exceptionally cold conditions most estimates for parainfluenza are consistent with an incubation period of 26 days table 1based on 11 observations from two experimental studies55 56 we estimate the median incubation period for parainfluenza to be 26 days 95 ci 2131 with a dispersion of 135 95 ci 116155 25 of cases develop symptoms by 21 days 95 ci 1626 and 75 by 32 days 95 ci 2538 after infection there were insufficient data to confidently estimate the 5th or 95th percentilesrsv is an important cause of morbidity among children and mortality among elderly and immunocompromised people prospective studies have found that 40 of all lower respiratory-tract infections in the first year of life involve rsv22 rsv usually causes a upper respiratory-tract infection and is then cleared but in 2540 of cases infection progresses to the lower respiratory tract often manifesting as pneumonia or bronchiolitis3
in 40 documents with statements of the incubation period of rsv 20 48 estimates were unsourced 16 38 were sourced and six 14 were based on original data two estimates based on original data refer to the same experimental study57 78 this study and three observational studies make up the data supporting most statements of the incubation period58 59 79 most estimates for rsv are consistent with an incubation period of 37 days table 1based on 17 observations from one experimental study57 and seven observations from two observational studies58 59 we estimate the median incubation period of rsv to be 44 days 95 ci 3949 with a dispersion of 124 95 ci 113135 5 of cases will develop symptoms before 31 days 95 ci 2538 and 95 by 63 days 95 ci 5273 after infectionrhinovirus causes an estimated 50 of colds symptoms include rhinorrhoea nasal congestion headache sore throat and cough4 complications include sinusitis otitis media and exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease3
we found 15 articles on the incubation period of rhinovirus there were twice as many original eight as sourced four or unsourced four estimates low estimates of the incubation period are less than half a day3 80 81 many experimental studies of rhinovirus infection report the time to peak mean symptom score of participants as a measure of the incubation period82 83 this method may bias estimates of the incubation period to be longer because the time of most severe symptoms will usually follow the time of first symptoms most estimates are consistent with an incubation period of 24 days table 1based on 28 observations from two experimental studies60 61 we estimate the median incubation period of rhinovirus to be 19 days 95 ci 1424 and the dispersion to be 168 95 ci 136201 5 of cases will develop symptoms by 08 days 95 ci 0412 and 95 by 45 days 95 ci 2962 after infectionof the 82 of incubation period estimates not based on original data most were given without citation this suggests that the incubation period for many diseases may be considered common knowledge in the medical community however our review found that the evidence supporting the reported incubation period was minimal for many diseases for some diseases eg influenza estimates and data produced using sound methods exist although they are rarely referencedseveral sources of uncertainty exist in the measuring of incubation period estimates depend on the time of infection which cannot be observed directly the time of exposure bounds the time of infection but is rarely available observational studies may not include all infected cases thus the methods by which cases are identified are themselves a potential source of bias experimental infection and natural experiments eg aeroplane infections42 may differ from normal exposure in ways that affect the incubation period routes of administration changes in infectious dose or differing periods of exposure to infectious individuals may modify the time to symptom onset most experimental studies use healthy adult volunteers yet severe disease is concentrated in children and the elderly variation between studies in the definition of symptom onset and inclusion criteria may thus affect our estimates precise guidelines on the start of the symptomatic period for each disease would remove some of this variationdespite potential sources of between-study variation when we checked our pooled analysis against a hierarchical model we found nearly identical estimates for the median and dispersion of most diseases for those that were shifted influenza a and b estimates of the median 5th and 95th percentiles were no more than a third of a day longer this suggests that study effects may be less than one would assume however the small number of studies and their relatively small size leave open the possibility that factors specific to the included studies may have affected our resultsthe results presented here are limited by our reviews focus on published data for some diseases adenovirus human coronavirus influenza b parainfluenza and rhinovirus estimates are still based on one or two studies and fewer than 100 observations this necessarily leaves uncertainty in our results and perhaps bias if these studies were atypical we found eight instances excluding sars for which there is ample evidence in which a study that might contain data on the incubation period was done but the information necessary to estimate the incubation period was not published these studies were mostly done over 30 years ago and we felt it unlikely that the original data could be easily obtained a motivated researcher who could obtain this or other unpublished data would add much to our results more data is clearly needed if we are to understand how factors such as virus morphology host status climate and infectious dose influence the incubation periodwe have combined published empirical data to provide estimates of the incubation period for nine important respiratory viruses previously published estimates generally only provide estimates of the centre of the incubation period distribution however the aspect of the distribution that is of interest varies by application the right tail eg 95th percentile is important in bounding the time of symptom onset for quarantine the central region eg 25th to 75th percentiles helps to identify the most likely time and source of infection and the full distribution informs models for use in pandemic planning our comprehensive systematic review pools published data to characterise the entire incubation period distribution including the left and right tails which makes the incubation period more useful in research clinical practice and public-health policy
these are described in detail in the methods section
in the coming months virology journal will publish a thematic series of reviews and original articles on emerging and re-emerging coronavirusesseveral coronaviruses have caused serious problems in humans and animals in the past two decades the best known examples are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv urbanization and the increasingly frequent mixing of different animals in densely populated areas may have facilitated the emergence and re-emergence of some of these viruses on the other hand coronaviruses are known to have high mutation and recombination rates which may allow them to cross species barriers and adapt to new hoststhe sars epidemic in 2003 has awakened scientists and the world on the ability of coronaviruses for animal-to-human transmission it was one of the worst epidemics in our citys history with 1755 people infected and 299 died from the dreadful infection the animal sources of sars-cov was later traced back to civets in wild life markets in china as the intermediate host and ultimately to horseshoe bats as the primary reservoir 1 2 although sars-related coronaviruses are continuously found in bats from china and worldwide it is believed that the immediate ancestor of human sars-cov has disappeared nevertheless we still have to be vigilant about the possibility of re-emergence of sars and uphold measures to avoid mixing of wild animals especially bats and civets in marketsthe sars epidemic has boosted interests in hunting for other novel coronaviruses before the sars epidemic only two coronaviruses were known to infect humans namely human coronavirus hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 two additional human coronaviruses hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 were discovered soon after the sars epidemic although these viruses have likely been circulating in humans for a long time prior to their discovery on 23 september 2012 the world health organization who announced the discovery of a new coronavirus mers-cov in two patients who died from a mysterious rapidly-fatal disease in the middle east 3 the virus was at that time found to be most closely related to the prototype lineage c betacoronaviruses tylonycteris bat coronavirus hku4 and pipistrellus bat coronavirus hku5 previously identified in hong kong 35 subsequently dromedary camels were identified as the source of some human cases 6apparently mers has an even higher mortality rate 35  than sars 96  which may be partly explained by the high prevalence of medical comorbidities among infected patients 7 fortunately in the past three years mers has not been transmitted from person to person as efficiently as sars was however a number of large healthcare-associated outbreaks in the middle east and the recent epidemic in the republic of korea have highlighted the possibility of sustained person-to-person transmission of mers-cov in the recent outbreak in korea more than 180 people were infected as a result of second- third- or fourth generation infection from a single index case who acquired mers after traveling to qatar although these large-scale outbreaks of mers were eventually controlled with enhanced infection control measures they have highlighted the importance of rapid diagnosis and coordinated public health response a lot more research efforts on mers-cov are needed especially at the epicenter the middle east where continuous animal-to-human transmissions of mers-cov are still being regularly reported this is in contrast to sars which was rapidly contained after removal of civets from wild life markets in southern china in particular more research on the pathogenesis treatment and prevention of this new coronavirus with pandemic potential are urgently needed 7besides humans coronaviruses also cause various diseases in animals with some resulting in significant economic losses pedv a member of the genus alphacoronavirus is the etiological agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea in swine populations the disease was endemic in asia and european countries in the past decades in 2013 the virus has emerged or re-emerged to cause large-scale epidemics in the americas and asia causing millions of fatal cases among piglets and representing one of the most serious concerns among the global pig industries 8 9 the ability of epidemic pedv strains to emerge despite current vaccination schemes suggests that the virus is able to evolve and escape from immune protectionthe special issue to be published in virology journal will emphasize advances and key discoveries in the animal origin viral evolution epidemiology diagnostics and pathogenesis of different emerging and re-emerging coronavirusestwo reviews in this thematic series will focus on the evolution and pathogenesis of mers-cov while both sars and mers can cause similar severe respiratory illnesses considerable differences exist in terms of patient demographics clinical outcomes as well as transmission dynamics the review mers coronavirus epidemiology transmission and diagnostics by i mackay et al discusses the current understandings on the epidemiology and transmission of mers and highlights the keys to rapid diagnosis 10 while intensive research has been conducted on this virus histopathological and immunopathogenesis studies using clinical samples are scarce and autopsy findings are lacking partly due to cultural reasons as a result current understandings on the pathogenesis and immune response of mers rely mainly on in vitro or in vivo studies the review by j zhou et al mers coronavirus infection in human cells virus-host interaction and implication for pathogenesis summarizes the most up-to-date findings on virus-host interaction of mers-cov based on cellular and animal studies and their implications on disease pathogenesis 11bats are important reservoir for many emerging viruses similar to sars-cov the finding of mers-cov-related bat coronaviruses suggests that bats may also be the ultimate animal origin of mers-cov with camels being the intermediate hosts before the virus crossed species barriers to infect humans 7 it is now known that bats are important reservoirs of diverse alphacoronaviruses and lineage b c and d betacoronaviruses 12 while horseshoe bats in china are the natural reservoir of sars-cov-like viruses the bat species that may harbor the ultimate origin of mers-cov is yet to be identified in a review entitled bat origin of coronaviruses z shi et al summarize the role of bats as the origin of emerging coronaviruses in humans with special focus on sars-cov and mers-cov 13 the review will also emphasize the importance of field studies to elucidate the animal origins of coronaviruses in predicting and preventing future pandemicsbeside sars-cov and mers-cov which have only emerged recently the other four human-pathogenic coronaviruses namely hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 have been continuously circulating in human for at least decades or centuries although they are often thought to be associated with mild respiratory illnesses increasing reports have suggested that they may cause severe infections especially in people at the extremes of age or those with comorbidities however pathogenesis studies are often limited by the difficulties in isolating these coronaviruses in cell cultures the human airway serves as the first entry point for these respiratory viruses we also plan to include a review that discusses the establishment of human airway epithelial cells for isolation of human coronaviruses and latest understandings on virus-host interactions based on cell culture studiesapart from humans animals are also susceptible to different coronaviruses and pedv represents a notable example how coronaviruses can cause serious epidemics in animal population worldwide in the review entitled emergence and re-emergence of pedv c lee et al discuss the latest advances in understanding the epidemiology pathogenesis and control measures of pedv focusing especially on the recent epidemics affecting america and asia 14virology journal is taking a leading role in facilitating the dissemination of new information in various emerging infectious diseases including coronaviruses it is hoped that the present series will stimulate more research and collaborative efforts to control the ongoing and prevent future epidemics caused by coronaviruses we are grateful to linfa wang phd editor in chief of virology journal and professor at duke-national university of singapore for his guidance during the preparation of this thematic seriescoronaviruses are non-segmented positive-sense rna viruses which are part of the family coronaviridae distributed in humans richman et al 2016 and the subfamily orthocoronaviridae there are four genera of coronaviruses betacoronavirus alpha coronavirus gamma coronavirus and deltacorona virus schwartz  graham 2020in humans especially common colds affecting children and adults are called mild illnesses however there are two zoonotic coronaviruses which are cited the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov which can especially affect the respiratory system through serious infections in addition the latter have the same characteristics production factors nosocomial transmission replication in the lower respiratory tract and viral immunopathology mers-cov and sars-cov result from serious public health problems which ultimately lead to epidemics resulting in significant loss of life hui 2017 perlman 2020 hui  zumla 2019 when these two zoonotic coronaviruses infect pregnant women they can lead to poor obstetric outcomes including maternal morbidity and death there is currently no specific vaccine or treatment approved for coronavirus infection hui  zumla 2019 song et al 2019in late december 2019 an outbreak of a new disease the coronavirus covid-19 previously known as 2019-ncov wu et al 2020 huang et al 2020 was reported in wuhan the capital from hubei province and a large city of around 11 million people in the central region of the peoples republic of china zhu 2020 which subsequently affected 26 countries around the world china immediately declared the epidemic to the world health organization who and also shared the sequence information with the international community after the discovery of the causative agent who has done its part by coordinating the development of the diagnosis issue guidelines for patient monitoring sample collection and treatment and provide up-to-date information on the epidemic munster et al 2020 to date the primary source of infection has been pneumonia patients infected with covid-19 transmission of respiratory droplets is the main route of transmission which can also be transmitted by contact g o of n h committee  office of state administration of traditional chinese medicine 2020 the source of the virus and its ability to spread between people remains unknown with an increasing number of cases showing signs of human-to-human transmission zhu 2020 chan et al 2020currently there are still no effective treatments that target the coronavirus and the development of these treatments requires months and years so we must be oriented towards treatments of natural origin based on aromatic and medicinal plants to have the compounds having the ability to inhibit covid-19 chen  nakamura 2004 the appearance of sars pushes a category of researchers to find anti-coronavirus agents including certain natural compounds that exist in morocco herbal medicinesin our study we made a selection of plants based on two principles the first one is oral efficacy this means that the majority of moroccan plants should be absorbable by the oral route the second one is the compatibility of traditional use then we have used molecular docking study to selected potential compounds that could have an anti-coronavirus effect by fighting their energy and type of interactions in studied enzymefor this study we have selected 67 compounds extracted from different aromatic and medicinal plants table 1 shows the origin for each studied compound and the percentage present in each plant these molecules were considered to molecular docking studymolecular docking analysis was used to study the binding affinity and the type of interactions between all compounds 67 molecules and the target coronavirus 2019-ncov main proteasethe steps for preparing ligands and proteins for docking protocol were done in the autodock 154 tools from mgl tools package employing default settings morris et al 1998 a grid box x  26283 y  12599 z  58965 at 1 angstrom spacing the bioactive conformations were simulated employing autodock vina trott  olson 2010 for autodock vina study an extended pdb format termed pdbqt is used for cordonnante files which includes atomic partial charges and atom types torsion angles were calculated to assign the flexible and non-bonded rotation of molecules the results were subsequently analyzed using discovery studio 2016 pilot 2016 and pymol delano 2002the crystal structure of coronavirus2019-ncov main protease pdb entry code 6lu7 was downloaded from the protein databank httpwwwrcsborg and its original ligand and water were eliminated then all compounds from our data set were docked in the active site of the studied protein the preparation of the pdb file was done using discovery studio 2016 pilot 2016totally we have docked 67 components table 2 shows the binding affinity of natural compounds toward main protease and table 3 mentioned the 11 top flavor agent docking result based on binding energytable 2 shows the obtained results from the molecular docking study carried out on all the molecules present in different medicinal plants 67 molecules by giving the interaction energy for each compound there is a difference in energy between each ligand and ncov-19 main proteaseby comparing all studied molecules with chloroquine on the basis of the interaction energy criterion knowing that the energy value of interaction of the molecule referred chloroquine is -6 kcalmol 11 molecules which have a good interaction with the studied enzyme are mentioned in table 2 for example the crocin at interaction energy equal to -82 kcalmol digitoxigenin at a value of -72 kcalmol and -eudesmol at a value of -71 kcalmol the 3 d binding mode of these compounds is shown in figures 1 and 2from a biological or pharmacological point of view these first three molecules which are proposed as inhibitors of coronavirus main protease are molecules having a significant antiviral power and according to bibliographical research and experiments which have already done the results found for each molecule of natural origin is as followingcrocin is an important compound in crocus sativus l it has the capacity to inhibit the replication of hsv before and after the entry of virions in vero cells crocin could be a promising anti-hsv and anti-hiv agent for herbal medicine against viral infections soleymani et al 2018digitoxigenin represents 1125 of the quantity present in nerium oleander the derivatives of these molecules are used as antiviral and anti-cancer inhibitors boff et al 2019eudesmol despite its low amount of lauris nobilis l which contains only 239 but this compound has a good interaction with the target and it has significant antibacterial and antiviral power astani et al 2011in our study we took into account the interaction energies so the interactions of the 1st level concern the hydrogen bonds those of the 2nd level concerning the interactions between  systems and cation - interactions while the interactions of the 3rd level are hydrophobic contacts and non-specific van der waals interactions between aliphatic or aromatic carbon atoms these interactions are generally spherical with a radius of 4  and cover most of the ligand so for the displacement of ligand in the binding site of our enzyme the first level of interactions was considerate as the most important the presence of hydrogen bond interaction in selected complex explains that we have a good interaction between the three molecules and the studied protein table 4 figure 3 and 4 adnan 2019today the search for new molecules with a preservative power of natural origin is based on ethnobotanical studies which make it possible to carry out inventories of plants in a zone or a country then on phytochemical and pharmacological studies and well other scientific aspects so the importance of the use of these medicinal plants which pushed us to seek and find the molecules which can prevent sars-cov-2 infection based on molecular docking the results is very satisfactory we have found three molecules among 67 which are very interesting either on the chemical side or on the biological side and therefore we propose these three molecules as inhibitor of sars-cov-2 main protease the synthesis of the these molecules and the evaluation of their in vitro and in vivo activity against sars-cov-2 main protease could be interesting before clinical essaycoronavirus the members of coronaviridae family are the diverse group of virus which infects domestic animals birds as well as human coronaviruses are enveloped rna viruses which are classified into four genera alpha coronavirus beta coronavirus gamma coronavirus and delta coronavirus 1 hcov-229e hcov-oc43 sars-cov hcov-nl63 hcov-hku1 and mers-cov are the six types of human coronaviruses evolved in between 1960 and 2015 whereas mers-cov is newly emerged strain this newly emerged mers-cov which is highly fatal belongs to lineage c of the genus beta coronavirus 2 human coronaviruses have been tracked down to zoonotic origin among the six strains of human corona-viruses the first hcov-229e has structural similarity with bat coronaviruses this phenomenon resemble to other members that are also have originated from different animal corona-virus like hcov-oc43 from bovine corona-virus sars-cov and hcov-nl63 from bat or palm civet corona-virus and hcov-hku1 from mouse hepatitis virus mhv like other human coronaviruses it is assumed that mers-cov has been evolved from zoonotic origin but the zoonotic source of mers-cov remains unknown 35some studies identified some close amino acid similarity between mers-cov and nycteris and pipistrellus bat species 6 but recent reports identified that mers-cov is more closely related to tylonycteris bat cov hku4 ty-batcov hku4 and pipistrellus bat cov hku5 pi-batcov hku5 7 mers-cov and bat-cov hku5 bat corona-viruses shared high degree of amino acid similarity in their rna polymerase 921 to 923  3c-like protease 82  polymerase 92  and proofreading exonuclease 91  and nucleocapsid n protein 68  8 9 but it is more closely related to ty-batcov hku4 in s and n the major difference between mers-cov and these bat corona-viruses is in the region between the spike and the envelop genes the mers-cov has five orfs while the bat viruses have four in this region 35 10though the mers-cov is structurally related to the bat-cov but there is no report of the sharing of antigenic sites among those corona-viruses to better understand the evolutionary origin of mers-cov pathogenicity it is really needed to know in which extent they are conserved in their immunogenicityin this study we identify the conserved antigenic site among mers and bat corona-virus for this bioinformatics analyses of their spike s membrane m enveloped e and nucleocapsid n proteins were done for finding the conserved antigenic sites and for mapping the evolutionary conserved antigenic sites on their 3d structures which were determined by threading modeling techniquea total of available five spike s membrane m enveloped e and nucleocapsid n protein sequence of hku4 hku5 bat-cov and 62 s 64 e m and 72 n protein sequences of mers-cov were retrieved from ncbi genbank sequence database 11 additional file 1 table s1retrieved sequences were aligned using ebi-clustalw program 12 to find the conserved region this multiple sequence alignment msa was done with gonnet matrix 12 and predicted their phylogenetic relationship mmaximum parsimony mp by using mega 50 13 to understand the conserved regions among them from the multiple sequence alignment the highest number of identical and similar amino acid containing region was selected as a conserved region that selected conserved region was then used for antigenic site predictionimmunogenicity of the conserved peptides was determined by using the b cell epitope prediction tools of the immune epitope database iedb 14 among b cell epitope prediction tools of iedb bepipred linear epitope prediction method 15 and ellipro-structural based discontinuous epitope prediction methods were applied 14 the antigenic sites of mers coronavirus spike envelope membrane and nucleocapsid proteins were also determined by using bepipred and ellipro analysis among bepipred and ellipro predicted epitopes fully or at least 90  overlapping epitopes were chosen as the desired epitopesto check the conservancy of the predicted epitopes the epitope conservancy analysis tool from the iedb analysis resource 16 was used this tool calculates the conservancy level by searching for identities in the given protein sequenceas the experimental structure of spike s membrane m enveloped e and nucleocapsid n proteins of any mers coronavirus isolate were not found in protein data bank pdb their 3d structures were predicted by using i-tasser server 17 i-tasser server gives protein 3d structure by multiple threading alignments 17 i-tasser provided top models quality were then verified by procheck analysis 18 the model in which maximum numbers of amino acid residues were found to be in the most favorable region was selected as the best model this model was then used to locate the epitope by using ucsf chimera 19 visualization toolin case of envelope protein mers coronaviruses are found to be highly conserved with hku4 and hku5 bat coronaviruses figs 1 2 respectively compared to the other proteins data not shown from the maximum parsimony phylogenetic analysis of mega 50 it is found that spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleo-capsid n protein mers-cov has relationship with bat hku4 and hku5 coronavirus additional file 2 figure s1 additional file 3 figure s2 additional file 4 figure s3 and additional file 5 figure s4 respectivelythe msa derived conserved region were used to determine the antigenic sites by using iedb resource analysis b cell epitope prediction tool 14 from this analysis a total of 3 epitope from s protein 1 epitope from e protein 4 epitope from m protein and 5 epitope from n protein were found from the hku4 bat and mers coronavirus conserved region table 1 similarly 7 epitope from s protein 1 epitope from e protein 4 epitope from m protein and 5 epitope from n protein were found from the hku5 bat and mers coronavirus conserved region table 2the conservancies of all epitopes were determined by iedb conservancy analysis tools 16 among the iedb predicted epitopes most of the epitopes are found to be 90  conserved among mers and bat hku4 hku5 coronaviruses tables 1 2 among these epitopes one epitope of s m n proteins are found to be 100  conservedfrom the iedb predicted epitopes of mers coronavirus s e m and n proteins table 3 it is found that most of the epitopes are common between mers and bat coronavirus they shared approximately 100  of e m and n proteins epitope in case of s protein hku5 shared around 70  epitope with mers-cov while hku4 shared only 30  epitope fig 3as the experimental tertiary structure of the s e m n proteins is not available we modeled a 3d structure by i-tasser server 17 by multiple threading alignments i-tasser analysis deduced 5 different models data not shown for this protein the quality of prediction of all the protein models was checked by procheck analysis 18 the model in which maximum numbers of amino acid residues were found to be in the most favorable region was selected as the best model using ucsf chimera visualization tool 19 all the conserved 90  epitopes are mapped on the predicted s e m and n protein structures fig 4coronaviruses are the most diverse groups of virus which have emerged as deadly viruses in course of time most of the human coronaviruses are evolved from zoonotic origin in most cases bats are served as a reservoir for zoonotic viruses 20 sars-cov has originated from animals with horseshoe bats as the natural reservoir and palm civet as the intermediate host allowing animal to-human transmission the hcov-229e has structural similarity with bat corona-viruses 21 similarly sars-cov hcov-229e hcov-nl63 have originated from the bat but the zoonotic source of mers-cov is still not clear 3 though the mers-cov is found to be structurally related to the bat corona-viruses hku4 and hku5 but there is no report of the sharing of antigenic sites among them to better understand the evolutionary origin of mers-cov pathogenicity we need to know in which extent they are conserved in their immunogenicityto address pathogeneic relationship we have constructed a phylogenetic tree and analyzed the relationship of mers and bat coronaviruses using the spike s envelope e membrane m nucleocapsid n proteins sequences it is found that mers-cov has phylogenetic relationship with hku4 and hku5 bat-cov we also predicted conserved antigenic sites and found that mers and hku4 bat corona-viruses shared 30  of s protein epitope and 100  of e m and n proteins epitope and mers and hku5 bat coronaviruses shared 70  of s protein epitope and 100  of e m and n proteins epitope in most cases conservation level found 90  these findings suggested that in case of antigenicity mers-cov is more closely related to hku5 bat-cov than the hku4 bat-cov this study showed how pathogenically hku4 and hku5 bat-covare closely related to the mers-cov therefore the level of conservation among antigenic sites provides evidence in support of their ancestry of pathogenicitythis study reveals that mers and bat coronaviruses shared some common antigenic sites in their spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleo-capsid n protein the shared epitopes are over 90  conserved throughout their evolutionary process this shared epitopes also show that in case of antigenic sites mers-cov is more closely related to hku5 bat coronaviruses than hku4 bat coronaviruses the conserved antigenic sites strongly support their ancestry relationshipsgenomic alignments suggest that the covid-19 virus sars-cov-2 from the genus betacoronavirus may be the result of recombination of genetic material from two different viruses one similar to the chinese horseshoe bat virus 1 and the other closer to the pangolin virus two divergent viruses could have infected the same organism simultaneously to date aside from bat coronavirus ratg13 962 similarity the pangolin-cov 9102 similarity is the coronavirus most closely related to sars-cov-2 2 even though the exact origin of the virus remains unclear it is possible to infect a chinese horseshoe bat or a pangolin with the sars-cov-2 and evaluate the success of the infection to determine the origin of the new virus responsible for the pandemic did it come from animals or from a laboratory while the absence of disease symptoms in these animals may be due to the effectiveness of their immune systems the intensity of viral proliferation can be easily detected using the real-time pcr technique however the genie has already escaped from the bottle and now we need to deal with the result not the cause moreover a hand-made virus is likely to be effective against both animals and humans investigations suggest that sars-cov-2 may bind human ace2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor with high affinity but computational analyses predict that the interaction is not ideal and that the rbd receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of sars-cov-2 is optimized for binding to human ace2 receptor with an efficient solution different from those previously predicted 3 4 this evidence is strongly arguing against culture-based scenarios thus the high-affinity binding of the sars-cov-2 spike protein to human ace2 receptor is most likely the result of natural selection on a human or human-like ace2 receptor that permits another optimal binding solution to arise however more scientific facts are needed to answer the question about the origin of the virus obtaining related viral sequences from animal sources would be the most definitive way of revealing viral origins 1 the possibility of the existence of a potential intermediate host of sars-cov-2 a missing link between a bat and human or a pangolin and human can also shed light on the current pandemic to date however there is no credible evidence to support the claim that sars-cov-2 originated from a laboratory-engineered coronavirus 5in early december 2019 the first cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were identified in wuhan the capital city of hubei province in china 6 the pathogen has since been identified as a novel enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna betacoronavirus 7 this virus which has a phylogenetic similarity to sars-cov 8 has been given the name severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 also covid-19 virus to date among the total number of patients with covid-19 globally the case-fatality rate ratio between the dead and total number of infected ranges from 51 to 52 and is constantly increasing this is ten times more than from the usual seasonal flu also sars-cov-2 is supposed to be more contagious and environmentally stable than seasonal flu viruses since seasonal flu usually ends by april in northern hemisphere in addition it seems that the virus is also more likely to affect the heart than any other similar viruses so although pneumonia is often the main cause of death cardiologists and infectionists for example in russia are seeing infected patients whose worst symptoms are not respiratory but cardiac and many people infected with covid-19 are dying from heart attacks as a possible complication of sars-cov-2 infection high expression of the ace2 receptor via which covid-19 virus enters cells using its spike glycoprotein was identified in type ii alveolar cells at2 of the lung 911 esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells absorptive enterocytes from the ileum and colon 11 cholangiocytes 12 myocardial cells kidney proximal tubule cells and bladder urothelial cells these findings indicate that those organs with high ace2 expressing cells should be considered as a potential high risk for sars-cov-2 infection 9investigations suggest that the spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 is the result of the combination of a bat sars-cov with an unknown beta-cov 13 probably a coronavirus of pangolin origin the s1 subunit containing the receptor-binding domain region of the spike protein of pangolin-cov is much more closely related to that of sars-cov-2 than to that of the bat coronavirus ratg13 moreover while five key amino acid residues involved in the interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 mainly expressed in a small subset of cells in the lung called type 2 alveolar cells 8 are completely consistent between pangolin cov and sars-cov-2 four amino acid mutations are present in ratg13 2 the spike protein of sars-cov-2 contains a 3-d structure in the receptor-binding domain region to maintain the van der waals forces 14 the 394 glutamine residue in the receptor-binding domain region of sars-cov-2 is recognized by the critical lysine 31 residue on the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as a key receptor for virus penetration it is also believed that the single n501t mutation in the sars-cov-2 spike protein corresponding to the s487t mutation in sars-cov may have significantly enhanced its binding affinity for human ace2 and subsequent penetration 3for the human population this is the third significant coronavirus infection to occur in the twenty-first century following severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 20022003 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers in 2011 both sars-cov and mers-cov were newly identified coronaviruses of zoonotic origin in the genus betacoronavirus with a much lower incidence than sars-cov-2 8096 cases for sars since 2002 mortality rate  10 and 2494 cases for mers since 2012 mortality rate  35 oddly enough sars-cov-2 is not very similar to the genomes of sars-cov about 79 or mers-cov about 50 7 15 despite the initial reports stating that most of the laboratory-confirmed infected patients 27 of 41 cases had links to the wuhan seafood market where different animals including bats snakes birds pangolins and other small mammals are normally traded within the market 6 it is now obvious that the newly identified coronavirus sars-cov-2 is transmitted with enormous efficacy from human to human via respiratory droplets or close contact the highly contagious nature of sars-cov-2 is probably due in large part to the virus spreading via asymptomatic infected individuals 16 which is exacerbated by an un-usually long incubation period of up to 1114 days based on data from hospitalized patients the majority of covid-19 cases about 80 presented as asymptomatic or with mild symptoms while the remainder were severe or critical 6 17most covid-19 patients developed lymphopenia and pneumonia with characteristic pulmonary ground-glass opacity changes seen on chest computed tomography 6 17 18 sars-cov-2 is believed to dampen anti-viral interferon responses resulting in uncontrolled viral replication for sars-cov and mers-cov the response to viral infection by type i ifn is suppressed the influx of neutrophils and monocytesmacrophages results in hyperproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines 19 the study of 41 hospitalized patients revealed high-levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-2 il-7 g-csf ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1a and tnf in the most severe cases of covid-19 6 this so-called cytokine storm can initiate viral sepsis and inflammatory-induced lung injury which lead to other complications including pneumonitis acute respiratory distress syndrome ards respiratory failure shock organ failure and potentially death 19 individuals particularly susceptible to covid-19 are elderly people with underlying diseases including diabetes hypertension and cardiovascular disease 6 since sars-cov-2 mutates constantly and more frequently than other rna viruses coronaviruses possess the longest genomes of all known rna viruses so more errors are made when they are copied also viral rna-dependent rna polymerases do not have a proofreading nuclease activity it is likely that strains of the virus will appear whose host preference will change for instance by reducing the average age of patients with a severe course of the disease as global infection has progressed we are now more frequently seeing young patients dying from covid-19tang et al found single nucleotide polymorphisms snps in sars-cov-2 at location 8782 orf1ab polyprotein t8517c synonymous and 28144 orf8 protein c251t s84l non-synonymous among the 103 sars-cov-2 virus strains in genbank 101 of them exhibited complete linkage between the two snps 72 strains  71 exhibited a ct haplotype defined as l type because t28144 is in the codon of leucine and 29 strains  29 exhibited a tc haplotype defined as s type because c28144 is in the codon of serine at these two sites although the l type  71 was more prevalent than the s type  29 in the sars-cov-2 viruses examined the s type is actually the ancestral version of sars-cov-2 nucleotides of the s type at sites 8782 and 28144 were identical to the orthologous sites in the most closely related viruses the ratio observed 7129 suggests that the l type has a higher transmission rate than the s type or was more prevalent at the start of the pandemic interestingly while the l type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in wuhan 963l37s the frequency of the l type decreased after early january 2020 possibly because human intervention efforts may have caused severe selective pressure against the l type 20what about reinfection earlier a pivotal role for virus-specific memory t-cells in broad and long-term protection against sars-cov infection was elucidated 21 22 indeed the crucial protective role of t-cell immune responses in coronavirus infections has been clearly documented in several animal models eg feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv mouse hepatitis virus mhv and avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv 2325 moreover reinfection did not occur in sars-cov-2 infected rhesus macaques with the same strain 26 what about reinfection with other possible strains of people who recovered from initial infection with one strain at present it remains unclear whether convalescing patients are at risk for relapse or reinfection it is also worth noting the theory that coronavirus infections might play a part in multiple sclerosis it is known that mouse hepatitis virus a murine coronavirus is a close relative of common human coronavirus hcov-oc43 which causes a multiple sclerosis-like demyelinating disease in the central nervous system of rodents 27 some studies have suggested that human coronaviruses in particular hcov-oc43 may be involved in gastrointestinal disease coronaviruses can be detected in stool samples and antibodies directed to hcov-oc43 have been observed more frequently in children with gastroenteritis 28 thus the future health of people who have recovered from covid-19 may be accompanied by complicationsit should be noted that in nature the number of host organisms is regulated by parasites including viruses outbreaks are eventually replaced by a population decline lotkavolterra system of equations as an example of a kolmogorov model it is necessary to consider the r-strategy of virus survival in which a large number of descendants as well as mutants are formed based on the lotkavolterra equations when the human population declines as the result of the action of a virus following a delay the overall population of the virus also decreases thus in the human population during the decline phase the majority of individuals have genotypes adapted for the virus strains prevailing at the moment under these circumstances the human population will start to grow until the virus genotypes capable of suppressing the human population significantly appear again the same line of reasoning can be applied to a medical drug-virus system except that a drug cannot change by itself therefore it is necessary to control viruses constantly with new drugs developed for use against both new strains of viruses and new species of viruses to save the lives of virus-sensitive people taking into consideration the natural genetic mechanisms of mutations and recombination it is impossible to imagine how to deprive a virus of the opportunity to generate new strains and time to time threaten our world with new pandemicsit must be understood that the short-term relationship between the virus and the host is always the result of darwins microevolution individuals who do not die in the fight against the virus will form a generation that is more resistant to the virus over time the virus will continue to reproduce in these individuals but will not pose a great danger to them on the other hand humanity is capable of inventing drugs against viruses and slowing down the progress of darwins microevolution saving the lives of those who otherwise might die without treatment would covid-19 patients after successful treatment or recovery again become severely infected with other strains of this virus there are no guarantees at the moment but it is clear that the virus will continue to circulate and kill the people who are most susceptible to itthus based on the facts accumulated so far it is clear that while the new coronavirus is more aggressive it does not have mortality rates as high as those seen with sars-cov and mers-cov humanity will definitely survive drugs and vaccines will save the lives of some virus-sensitive people deaths among people of reproductive age will gradually lead to a human population in which the next generations will be more resistant to this virus fig 1 this is one of the primary reasons why pandemics of spanish flu h1n1 subtype did not last for many years because the overwhelming majority of people who died were aged 1845 individuals genetically resistant to the virus survived it and formed the next virus-resistant generation published studies indicate that 2040 of populations in some areas have been infected by the h1n1 virus and thus have some level of protective immunity 29the origin of sars-cov-2 is not completely understood if this virus is man-made then it is necessary to go back 45 years and rethink the results of the asilomar conference on recombinant dna held in 1975 when scientists met to discuss the potential biohazards and regulation of biotechnology and banned some potentially dangerous experiments including cloning of recombinant dnas derived from highly pathogenic organisms if the virus is of natural origin then it is necessary to understand how new coronaviruses are transferred from animal reservoirs to humans and reduce the likelihood of a person coming into contact with them in addition it is imperative to develop new vaccines and drugs against coronavirus infection in case of emergencyis it important today to stop the spread of infection as quickly as possible yes if possible it must be stopped however is it in our power to do so when the official number of diagnosed cases has already exceeded 1 million people worldwide probably not in some cases the human population has been able to completely obliterate a viral disease by enacting successful anti-epidemiological measures as happened with the smallpox virus 30 but smallpox virus had no animal reservoir apparently covid-19 is not one of these cases in our opinion the high contagiousness of sars-cov-2 and the ability of coronaviruses to persist for a long time in host organisms 31 32 will allow the covid-19 virus to continue to circulate in the human population until the fall of 2020 when a new pandemic wave seems to occur again the most likely outcome is that this new coronavirus as occurred with the four other well-known non-severe acute respiratory syndrome nonsars-related human coronaviruses hcovs including hcov-229e -oc43 -hku1 and -nl63 will take its place next to the seasonal flu viruses where the infection rate is high and the mortality rate is very low in the near future your doctor will routinely prescribe you something like covidol and say that in the coming days you are likely to recover interestingly after the discovery of non-sars hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 several groups reported infections by these viruses in different countries illustrating that these viruses have spread worldwide 3339 the viruses can be detected in 110 of patients with acute respiratory tract infections and double infections with other respiratory viruses are common 37 of note for sars-cov a close relative of sars-cov-2 there is evidence of at least seven potential regions of recombination in the sars-cov genome in the replicase- and spike-coding regions with possible recombination partners that include porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev bovine coronavirus bcov hcov-229e mhv and ibv 40 a similar study involving the human coronavirus hcov-nl63 likewise demonstrated that hcov-nl63 exhibited signs of having arisen from multiple recombination events from its nearest relative over the course of hundreds of years 41 thus it is possible that sars-cov-2 through multiple recombination events can trigger an outbreak of respiratory diseases caused by new strains of nonsars-related human hcovsnow as a century ago during the spanish flu pandemic the emphasis on washing hands frequently avoiding crowds and wearing masks are recurrent in newspaper records and on websites as is disdain for people flouting the rules in the meantime when we wash our hands with soap we should thank providence that the sars-cov-2 does not have the same mortality rate as mers-cov as the situation stands right now it is better to become infected with covid-19 as late as possible to allow vaccines and drugs to be developed and tested as there are no guarantees yet concerning who is at risk of a severe course of the disease and who is not apparently the bitter and unpopular truth is that most of the worlds inhabitants need to make contact with the sars-cov-2 before we can all return to normal life quarantine slows down this process gaining time for doctors and scientists who through their professional activities can save virus-sensitive individuals so often we have to choose quickly but painfully or gently but slowly today we find ourselves in a zugzwang situation a greater number of deaths or the collapse of the global economy we are on the second path so far but soon we will need to reach a compromise because sars-cov-2 will continue to circulate in the human population this coronavirus is with us forever perhaps we can learn from the seasonal flu viruses that kill hundreds of thousands of people every year since we are used to these viruses they do not scare us anymore so we have reached the compromise that lets us all move forwardthe novel coronavirus 2019-ncov as well severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 sars-cov-2 was first detected from patients with pneumonia of an unknown reason in wuhan city of hubei territory of china to the worldwide in december 20191 since it has been confirmed as the pathogen for the novel coronavirus recently named as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the world health organization globally until april 5 2020 there have been reported 1203485 confirmed cases and 62000 deaths23 india has reported 3577 cases till date the coronavirus may cause various respiratory infection such as coughing sneezing pneumonia fever breathlessness and lung infection the disease is transmitted by direct contact with infected droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 days covid 19 is mild in most peoples in some elderly peoples having underlying medical problem such as diabetes chronic respiratory disorders and cardiovascular disease are more possible to develop severe illness such as pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan dysfunction45coronavirus is first observed in the mid-19306 and first human coronavirus found in 1960 as a cold7 around 500 patients were recognized as flu-like system according the study was done by canada in 2001 a total of 1718 cases were confirmed as infected with coronavirus by polymerase chain reaction pcr and were treated as uncomplicated non-fatal virus till 2002 later 2003 -genera species of coronavirus were originated from bats and transmitted to human through mediator host of palm civet cats in the guangdong territory of china and designated as sars 8422 people get affected from coronavirus and 916 caused death before being controlled in china and hong kong8 nearly in 2012 the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers- cov as well bat origin emerged in saudi arabia with camel as the mediator host and affected 2494 people and caused 858 deaths9 novel coronavirus covid-19 was first recognized and isolated from pneumonia patient belongs to wuhan china1011coronavirus is spherical single stranded enveloped rna viruses from 60 to 140 nm in diameter and covered with club shaped glycoprotein when observed in electron microscope12 as shown in figure 1 according to the international committee on taxonomy of viruses coronavirus is belonging to order nidovirales family coronaviridae and subfamily coronavirinae based on serological evidences coronavirinae is divided into four genera alphacoronavirus  betacoronavirus  gammacoronavirus  and deltacoronavirus 13 some of them were affected human and causes respiratory infection as well as other affected to animal such as cats mice pigs and dog classification of coronavirus according to their class and subclass is as shown in table 1person to person contact is major way of transmission of covid 19 according to centers for disease control and prevention cdc human can get infected through close contact with a person has respiratory symptoms eg coughing or sneezing spreads primarily through airborne droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose and transmission route represent in figure 2 communication may also occur through object in the direct environment around the infectious people14 therefore spread of the sars-cov-2 virus can happens by direct contact with infectious person and indirect contact with objects in the immediate environment some evidence shows that it may also transmit through intestinal infection and are present in feces15according to recently publish research sars-cov attaches to the target cell with the help of spike protein host cell protein interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 and mers-cov to dipeptidyl peptidase-416-18 later receptor identification the virus genome with its nucleocapsid is released into the cytoplasm of the host cells in addition seven major targets such as membrane protein envelope protein spike protein nucleocapsid protein hemagglutinin esterase and helicase10 for designing of lead can considered moreover 16 non-structural proteins may also consider for the development of cov-specific drugsat present few laboratory tests are available that can recognize the virus that causes covid-19 in respiratory specimens state and local public health departments have received tests from cdc while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers for suspected infection person performing real-time pcr fluorescence use to detect the positive nucleic acid of sars-cov-2 in the lower respiratory tract samples such as throat swab nasopharyngeal swab sputum endotracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage22-23 coronavirus may also be detected in the stool and in severe cases the blood as the epidemic progresses commercial tests will also become available for diagnosis of covid-19at present there is no prescribe treatment for covid 19 some guidelines were present by the world health organization who and european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc there is so many evidences published in studies about person to person transmission of corona virus some characteristics of this coronavirus make precaution difficult particularly non-specific features of the disease transmission from asymptomatic person elongated incubation period prolonged duration of the illness and transmission even after clinical recovery separation of infected patient to other family member with mild illness at home quarantine is recommended according to ecdc some general guidelines were published such as avoid direct contact with sick person in particular those having cough avoid visiting places were alive or dead animals are handled maintaining overall good personal hygiene wash your hand with soap or alcohol base sanitizer after using toilet and before eating avoiding touching the eyes nose or mouth with unwashed hands and coughing or sneezing into a tissue and putting the tissue directly into a waste container those who may already have infection have been advised to wear a surgical mask and avoid visiting to public places health-care providers taking care of infected person are recommended to use standard precautions contact precautions and eye protection24-27there is no vaccinedrug have yet been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of covid-19 at present the treatments of patients with sars-cov-2 infection are mainly symptomatic treatments and supportive management strategy followed by health professionals however a number of medicines have been suggested as potential investigational therapies many of which are now being or will soon be studied in clinical trials supportive treatment may include administration of antipyretic and analgesic for fever and cough maintenance of hydration and nutrition and mechanical ventilation and even extra corporeal membrane oxygen as respiratory support may be needed renal replacement therapy may be needed in some instant and use of antibiotics and antifungal is necessary if coinfections are proven28-32 antiviral drugs such as ribavirin lopinavir ritonavir have been used based on the experience with sars and mers in a historical control study in patients with sars patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir with ribavirin had better outcomes as compared to those given ribavirin alone33 apart from this remdesivir3435 chloroquine hydroxychloroquine nucleoside derivatives neuraminidase inhibitors and peptide ek1 can also be the choices of antiviral drugs for covid-19 treatment36 still health professionals were not fully satisfied with any therapy so further clinical research neededthe first case of the new coronavirus covid-19 outbreak in india was reported on january 30 2020 originating from china till april 5 2020 there have been 3577 confirmed 275 recoveries and 83 deaths as per ministry of health and family welfare according to the research and health-care professional the infection rate of coronavirus in india is reported to be 17 significantly lower than as compared to affected countries the coronavirus epidemic in india as confirmed recoveries and death according to state and union territories cases till date as show in table 3 and date wise graphical representation of covid-19 confirmed cases up to april 5 2020 as represented in figure 337this birds eye reviews spotlight on a current research progress in response to the pandemic of covid-19 recently several studies have been published exploring the origin taxonomy microbiology causes clinical look and diagnosis and prevention and control of the novel coronavirus thus far most studies have focused on the epidemiology and potential causes thus most of studies were focus on epidemiology and potential causes researches in this area are urgently required to reduce the impact of the epidemic coronavirus mainly transmitted through airborne droplets of infected person having sneezing and coughing hence avoid contact and separate them if observed symptoms as per the who and ecdc guidelines stay away from with sick person potential research needed to prevent future outbreaks of zoonotic origin till only social distancing is best vaccine against cocid-19coronaviruses cause respiratory and intestinal infections in animals and humans1 they were not considered to be highly pathogenic to humans until the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2002 and 2003 in guangdong province china25 as the coronaviruses that circulated before that time in humans mostly caused mild infections in immunocompetent people ten years after sars another highly pathogenic coronavirus middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov emerged in middle eastern countries6 sars coronavirus sars-cov uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a receptor and primarily infects ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type ii pneumocytes78 whereas mers-cov uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 also known as cd26 as a receptor and infects unciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type ii pneumocytes911 sars-cov and mers-cov were transmitted directly to humans from market civets and dromedary camels respectively1214 and both viruses are thought to have originated in bats1521 extensive studies of these two important coronaviruses have not only led to a better understanding of coronavirus biology but have also been driving coronavirus discovery in bats globally2131 in this review we focus on the origin and evolution of sars-cov and mers-cov specifically we emphasize the ecological distribution genetic diversity interspecies transmission and potential for pathogenesis of sars-related coronaviruses sarsr-covs and mers-related coronaviruses mersr-covs found in bats as this information can help prepare countermeasures against future spillover and pathogenic infections in humans with novel coronavirusescoronaviruses are members of the subfamily coronavirinae in the family coronaviridae and the order nidovirales international committee on taxonomy of viruses this subfamily consists of four genera  alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus  on the basis of their phylogenetic relationships and genomic structures fig 1 the alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses infect only mammals the gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses infect birds but some of them can also infect mammals24 alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses usually cause respiratory illness in humans and gastroenteritis in animals the two highly pathogenic viruses sars-cov and mers-cov cause severe respiratory syndrome in humans and the other four human coronaviruses hcov-nl63 hcov-229e hcov-oc43 and hku1 induce only mild upper respiratory diseases in immunocompetent hosts although some of them can cause severe infections in infants young children and elderly individuals12829 alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses can pose a heavy disease burden on livestock these viruses include porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus32 porcine enteric diarrhoea virus pedv33 and the recently emerged swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus sads-cov34 on the basis of current sequence databases all human coronaviruses have animal origins sars-cov mers-cov hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e are considered to have originated in bats hcov-oc43 and hku1 likely originated from rodents2829 domestic animals may have important roles as intermediate hosts that enable virus transmission from natural hosts to humans in addition domestic animals themselves can suffer disease caused by bat-borne or closely related coronaviruses genomic sequences highly similar to pedv were detected in bats3538 and sads-cov is a recent spillover from bats to pigs34 fig 2 currently 7 of 11 ictv-assigned alphacoronavirus species and 4 of 9 betacoronavirus species were identified only in bats fig 3 thus bats are likely the major natural reservoirs of alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses24at the beginning of the sars epidemic almost all early index patients had animal exposure before developing disease after the causative agent of sars was identified sars-cov andor anti-sars-cov antibodies were found in masked palm civets paguma larvata and animal handlers in a market place12163942 however later wide-reaching investigations of farmed and wild-caught civets revealed that the sars-cov strains found in market civets were transmitted to them by other animals1639 in 2005 two teams independently reported the discovery of novel coronaviruses related to human sars-cov which were named sars-cov-related viruses or sars-like coronaviruses in horseshoe bats genus rhinolophus1543 these discoveries suggested that bats may be the natural hosts for sars-cov and that civets were only intermediate hosts subsequently many coronaviruses phylogenetically related to sars-cov sarsr-covs were discovered in bats from different provinces in china and also from european african and southeast asian countries1520384354 fig 4 supplementary fig s1a according to the ictv criteria only the strains found in rhinolophus bats in european countries southeast asian countries and china are sarsr-cov variants those from hipposideros bats in africa are less closely related to sars-cov and should be classified as a new coronavirus species54 these data indicate that sarsr-covs have wide geographical spread and might have been prevalent in bats for a very long time a 5-year longitudinal study revealed the coexistence of highly diverse sarsr-covs in bat populations in one cave of yunnan province china182055 this location is a diversity hot spot and the sarsr-covs in this location contain all the genetic diversity found in other locations of china furthermore the viral strains that exist in this one location contain all genetic elements that are needed to form sars-cov fig 5 as no direct progenitor of sars-cov was found in bat populations despite 15 years of searching and as rna recombination is frequent within coronaviruses56 it is highly likely that sars-cov newly emerged through recombination of bat sarsr-covs in this or other yet-to-be-identified bat caves this hypothesis is consistent with previous data showing that a direct progenitor of sars-cov emerged before 2002 refs425758 recombination analysis also strongly supported the hypothesis that the civet sars-cov strain sz3 arose through recombination of two existing bat strains wiv16 and rf4092 ref20 furthermore wiv16 the closest relative to sars-cov found in bats likely arose through recombination of two other prevalent bat sarsr-cov strains20 the most frequent recombination breakpoints are within the s gene which encodes the spike s protein that contains the receptor-binding domain rbd and upstream of orf8 which encodes an accessory protein205859 given the prevalence and great genetic diversity of bat sarsr-covs their close coexistence and the frequent recombination of the coronaviruses it is expected that novel variants will emerge in the future6061 because there were no sars cases in yunnan province during the sars outbreak we hypothesize that the direct progenitor of sars-cov was produced by recombination within bats and then transmitted to farmed civets or another mammal which then transmitted the virus to civets by faecaloral transmission when the virus-infected civets were transported to guangdong market the virus spread in market civets and acquired further mutations before spillover to humansthe genome sequences of sars-covs from market civets are almost identical to the genomes of human sars-covs4262 however two genes show major variation the first variable region is located in the s gene the sars-cov s protein is functionally divided into two subunits denoted s1 and s2 which are responsible for receptor binding and fusion with the cellular membrane respectively1 s1 is further divided into the amino-terminal domain s1-ntd and the carboxy-terminal domain s1-ctd the s1-ctd functions as the rbd and is responsible for binding ace2 and entering cells76364 two amino acid residues in the rbd 479 and 487 were identified to be essential for ace2-mediated sars-cov infection and critical for virus transmission from civets to humans7678the second major location of variation is the accessory gene orf8 fig 5 on the basis of sars spread the sars 20022003 outbreak could be divided into three phases with the early phase characterized by a limited number of localized cases followed by a middle phase during which a superspreader event occurred in a hospital and finally the late phase of international spread62 the viral genomes from early-phase patients contain two genotypes of orf8 one with a complete orf8 369 nucleotides and the other containing an 82-nucleotide deletion by contrast viral genomes from late-phase patients and most of the genomes from middle-phase patients contain a split orf8 orf8a and orf8b owing to a 29-nucleotide deletion two exceptions were found in middle-phase genomes one containing an 82-nucleotide deletion in orf8 and the other with the whole orf8 deleted the human isolates from 2004 and all civet sars-cov genomes have a complete orf8 except one civet strain with an 82-nucleotide deletion62 these data indicate that orf8 genes underwent adaptations during transmission from animals to humans during the sars epidemic a limited functional analysis suggested that the orf8a protein is dispensable for sars-cov replication in vero e6 cells but may have a role in modulating endoplasmic reticulum stress inducing apoptosis and inhibiting interferon responses in host cells206569 whether and how these adaptations were involved in sars-cov virulence are not fully clarifiedsars-covs and bat sarsr-covs mainly vary in three regions s orf8 and orf3 fig 5 bat sarsr-covs share high sequence identity with sars-cov in the s2 region but are highly variable in the s1 region compared with human and civet sars-cov bat sarsr-cov s1 can be divided into two clades clade 1 which is found only in yunnan province has the same size s protein as human and civet isolates182051 whereas clade 2 which is found in many locations has a shorter size s protein owing to deletions of 5 12 or 13 amino acids in length1543454850 among the sequenced bat sarsr-covs those with deletions in their rbds show 782802 amino acid sequence identity with sars-cov in the s protein whereas those without deletions are much more closely related to sars-cov with 900972 amino acid sequence identitythe second variable region is located in orf8 most of bat sarsr-covs retain an intact orf8 366 or 369 nucleotides and share 477100 sequence identity among themselves and 506984 with sars-cov in civets and early-phase patients a split orf8 364 nucleotides owing to a 5-nucleotide deletion was found in one bat sarsr-cov strain similar to that of sars-covs from middle-phase and late-phase patients20 the european bat sarsr-cov has completely lost orf8 ref45 these data show that the orf8 genes in bat sarsr-covs are constantly evolving in their natural reservoirs considering the variability of orf8 in bats civets and humans investigating the function of orf8 is a priority particularly the contribution of these different variants to viral pathogenesisthe third variable region is in orf3 the sars-cov genome encodes a 154-amino acid orf3b which is an interferon antagonist bat sarsr-covs and sars-cov are highly similar in orf3a 964989 amino acid identity but bat sarsr-covs have different sizes of orf3b 54154 amino acids a large part of the region encoding orf3b overlaps with the orf3a coding region2070 orf3b retains the anti-interferon function in some bat sarsr-covs but has lost the function in other bat sarsr-covs70a novel accessory gene named orfx and located between orf6 and orf7 was identified in the genomes of several bat sarsr-covs from yunnan province1820 fig 5 a preliminary study indicated that orfx is involved in an anti-interferon response71crystal structures of the sars-cov rbd complexed with human ace2 revealed that the sars-cov rbd contains a core structure and a receptor-binding motif rbm82141 fig 6a two virus-binding hot spots have been identified at the interface of the rbd and human ace2 centring on ace2 residues lys31 hot spot 31 and lys353 hot spot 3538384 fig 6b they both consist of a salt bridge between lys31 and glu35 for hot spot 31 and between lys353 and asp38 for hot spot 353 both salt bridges are buried in hydrophobic pockets and contribute a substantial amount of energy to rbdace2 binding as well as filling voids at the rbdace2 interface naturally selected rbm mutations all interact with the hot spots fig 6b table 1 and affect rbdace2 bindingmutations in rbm residue 479 had an important role in the civet-to-human transmission of sars-cov42767885 residue 479 is an asparagine in strains htor02 hcgd03 and hhae08 but is a lysine in strain csz02 and an arginine in strain chb05 table 1 asn479 is located near hot spot 31 without interfering with the structure of hot spot 31 ref85 fig 6b c however a change to lys479 leads to steric and electrostatic interference with hot spot 31 reducing the binding affinity between the sars-cov rbd and human ace2 by contrast arg479 reaches the vicinity of hot spot 353 and forms a salt bridge with ace2 residue asp38 ref83 fig 6d hence strains htor02 hcgd03 and hhae08 all of which contain asn479 and strain chb05 which contains arg479 recognize human ace2 and infect human cells efficiently whereas strain csz02 which contains lys479 recognizes human ace2 inefficiently and infects human cells inefficiently the above structural analyses are supported by biochemical functional and epidemiological data4276788385 because of residue differences between human ace2 and civet ace2 both asn479 and lys479 fit well into the interface between the rbd and civet ace2 although arg479 fits even better8385 consequently strains htor02 csz02 hcgd03 and chb05 which contain either asn479 lys479 or arg479 recognize civet ace2 and infect civet cells efficiently79 in sum asn479 and arg479 are viral adaptations to human ace2 whereas lys479 is incompatible with human ace2 arg479 is a viral adaptation to civet ace2 whereas asn479 and lys479 are also compatible with civet ace2mutations in rbm residue 487 had an important role in the human-to-human transmission of sars-cov residue 487 is a threonine in strain htor02 but is a serine in the other strains isolated from humans and civets the methyl group of thr487 interacts with hot spot 353 in human ace2 by providing stacking support for the formation of the salt bridge between lys353 and asp38 consequently strain htor02 recognizes human ace2 efficiently and was transmitted between humans during the 20022003 sars epidemic by contrast ser487 cannot provide support to hot spot 353 and hence the other strains isolated from humans and civets recognize human ace2 inefficiently consequently neither csz02 nor hcgd03 was transmitted between humans the above structural analyses are supported by biochemical functional and epidemiological data4276788385 because of residue differences between human ace2 and civet ace2 ser487 fits well into the rbdcivet ace2 interface although still not as well as thr487 refs8385 consequently strains ssz02 hcgd03 and chb05 which contain ser487 recognize civet ace2 and infect civet cells efficiently79 in sum thr487 is a viral adaptation to both human and civet ace2 and ser487 is much more compatible with civet ace2 than with human ace2 fig 6brbm residues 442 472 and 480 also contribute to receptor recognition and host range of sars-cov although not as much as residues 479 and 487 detailed structural biochemical and functional analyses showed that phe442 phe472 and asp480 are viral adaptations to human ace2 whereas tyr442 leu472 or pro472 and gly480 are viral adaptations to civet ace2 refs7283 to corroborate the importance of these residues for sars-cov binding to either human or civet ace2 two sars-cov s proteins hoptimize and coptimize were rationally designed the former contains all of the human ace2-adapted residues phe442 phe472 asn479 asp480 and thr487 whereas the latter contains the civet ace2-adapted residues tyr442 pro472 arg479 gly480 and thr487 these two s proteins demonstrate exceptionally high affinity for human ace2 and civet ace2 confirming that the human ace2-adapted and civet ace2-adapted rbm residues help determine sars-cov host range7283 in addition to receptor binding proteolytic cleavage of s and potentially other mutations that affect virion and trimer stability may also be important for virus transmissibility in different hosts and these factors need to be studied furtherto date numerous sarsr-cov strains have been identified from bats15161820 these bat sarsr-covs are the likely progenitors of sars-cov that infected humans and civets and hence understanding their interactions with human or civet ace2 is critical for tracing the origins of sars-cov and for preventing and controlling future sars-cov outbreaks in humans the rbd sequences of these bat sarsr-covs fall into three major groups the representative strains from each group are bhku3 isolated in 2005 bwiv1 isolated in 2013 and brsshc014 isolated in 2013 table 1 strains bwiv1 and brsshc014 but not strain bhku3 use both human and civet ace2 and hence can infect both human and civet cells1618208687 strain bhku3 has a truncated rbm table 1 which distorts the structure of the rbm and abolishes its binding to human and civet ace2 neither strain bwiv1 nor strain brsshc014 contains truncations in its rbm and hence their rbms likely retain the same structure as sars-cov rbms here we analysed the potential interactions between these two strains bwiv1 and brsshc014 and human ace2 by building homology structural models of their rbds complexed with human ace2 focusing on residues 479 and 487 fig 6c d strain bwiv1 contains asn479 and asn487 in its rbm whereas asn479 is a viral adaptation to human ace2 the polar side chain of asn487 may have unfavourable interactions with the aliphatic portion of residue lys353 in human ace2 which is part of hot spot 353 fig 6c strain brsshc014 contains arg479 and ala487 in its rbm whereas arg479 is a viral adaptation to human ace2 the small side chain of ala487 does not provide support to the structure of hot spot 353 fig 6d therefore although both bwiv1 and brsshc014 can infect human airway cells they bind human ace2 less well than htor02 and produce less severe symptoms than the epidemic strain of sars-cov in vivo8889 similarly both bwiv1 and brsshc014 can infect civet cells but they bind civet ace2 less well than csz02 thus it is predicted that both strains will be attenuated compared with early-phase or late-phase human sars epidemic viruses future evolution of bat sarsr-cov strains bwiv1 and brsshc014 in crucial rbm residues may allow them to cross the species barriers between bats civets and humans posing potential health threatswhereas the emergence of sars involved palm civets most of the early mers index cases had contact with dromedary camels indeed mers-cov strains isolated from camels were almost identical to those isolated from humans9095 moreover mers-cov-specific antibodies were highly prevalent in camels from the middle east africa and asia131496103 mers-cov infections were detected in camel serum samples collected in 1983 ref100 suggesting that mers-cov was present in camels at least 30 years ago genomic sequence analysis indicated that mers-cov tylonycteris bat coronavirus hku4 and pipistrellus bat coronavirus hku5 are phylogenetically related denoted as betacoronavirus lineage c21 the viruses in this lineage have identical genomic structures and are highly conserved in their polyproteins and most structural proteins but their s proteins and accessory proteins are highly variable mersr-covs were found in at least 14 bat species from two bat families vespertilionidae and nycteridae however none of these mersr-covs is a direct progenitor of mers-cov as their s proteins differ substantially from that of mers-cov98104106to understand the evolutionary relationships between mers-cov and mersr-covs we constructed a phylogenetic tree on the basis of the alignment of all the coding regions fig 4b supplementary fig s1b the phylogenetic tree contains two main clusters and several small clades or strains overall the genetic diversity within the l1 and l2 viral lineages is low indicating that humans and camels have been infected by viruses from the same source within a short time period the l1 viruses include human and camel mers-covs mainly from the middle east the united arab emirates the kingdom of saudi arabia oman and jordan and two asian countries south korea and thailand that had caused outbreaks in human populations it is worth noting that the cases reported in south korea and thailand were related to those in the middle east the l2 viruses include camel mers-covs from africa nigeria burkina faso and ethiopia and one middle east country morocco these viruses have not caused any human infection clearly these two viral lineages share a common ancestor but have diverged in their potential to cause human infections the mersr-cov strain neoromicia5038 genbank no mf593268 isolated in south africa was the closest relative to mers-covs in the phylogenetic tree overall all the mersr-covs isolated from bats support the hypothesis that mers-cov originated from bats however given the phylogenetic gap between the bat mersr-covs and human and camel mers-covs there should be other yet-to-be-identified viruses that are circulating in nature and directly contributed to the emergence of mers-cov in humans and camels hopefully such viruses will be found in bats in the futurenot surprisingly recombination events have taken place in the evolution and emergence of mers-cov94105107109 phylogenetic trees constructed using genes encoding orf1ab and s were incongruent with the tree topology of the complete genome suggesting potential recombination in these genes108 numerous recombinations imply that mers-cov originated from the exchange of genetic elements between different viral ancestors including those isolated from camels and the assumed natural host bats94105107110111the full-length genomic sequences of mers-covs isolated from humans and camels are almost identical 99 identity the major variations are located in s orf4b and orf3 particularly in african camel mers-covs94 substitutions of a few amino acid residues were found in the s protein of some camel mers-covs but none of them was located in the rbd94112 neutralization assays indicated that camel sera that are positive for mers-cov can completely neutralize the human mers-cov strains suggesting that mers-covs isolated from humans and camels are antigenically similar to each other94 mers-covs from both humans and camels contain variable orf3 and orf4 proteins with different lengths owing to either terminal truncations or internal deletions94 orf4b is known to be an interferon antagonist113114 mers-cov isolates from west african camels with a truncated orf4b gene replicate less efficiently in human cell culture and are less pathogenic in human dpp4 transgenic mice94 curiously deletion of the orf4 gene in the human mers-cov strain emc did not substantially reduce virus replication although it induced a stronger interferon response94 another study demonstrated that the deletion of orf3orf5 dramatically attenuated mers-cov virulence primarily through increased host responses including disrupted cellular processes increased activation of the interferon pathway and robust inflammation115to date bat mersr-covs and human and camel mers-covs share the same genomic structures but differ substantially in their genomic sequences105106110111116 the highest overall genomic sequence identity between bat mersr-cov and human and camel mers-cov is 85 on the basis of their genomic sequences several bat mersr-cov strains discovered in china such as ii-mersr-cov ve-mersr-cov and hy-mersr-cov have just reached the taxonomic threshold to be considered the same species as mers-cov106110111compared with human and camel mers-cov bat mersr-covs vary most in s and accessory genes the sequence identity of the s protein between bat mersr-covs and human and camel mers-covs is approximately 4565 with even lower sequence identity in the rbd region110111 the size of these s proteins differs in these strains mainly because of deletions in their rbd region andor the s1 and s2 boundary these deletions are considered to be related to the differences in receptor binding and cell entry111116 the accessory genes including those encoding orf3 orf4a orf4b and orf5 are also highly variable in length and sequence between bat mersr-covs and human and camel mers-covs suggesting substantial evolution of these genes in their natural hosts105106110111116in contrast to sars-cov which uses ace2 as its receptor mers-cov uses dpp4 similar to sars-cov s1-ctd mers-cov s1-ctd functions as the viral rbd10117 like the sars-cov s1-ctd the mers-cov s1-ctd also contains two subdomains a core structure and an rbm9118120 fig 6e the core structures of these two s1-ctds are similar to each other with both containing a five-stranded -sheet as the main scaffold however their rbms differ substantially whereas the sars-cov rbm mainly contains loops the mers-cov rbm mainly contains a four-stranded -sheet the structural differences between mers-cov and sars-cov rbms account for the different receptor specificities of the two viruses121like the interactions between sars-cov and ace2 the interactions between mers-cov and dpp4 have been extensively examined dpp4 from humans camels horses and bats can function as a receptor for mers-cov whereas dpp4 from mice hamsters and ferrets cannot112122125 key residue differences between human dpp4 and the dpp4 from other species affect the species specificities of mers-cov for example two residues 288 and 330 in mouse dpp4 and five residues 291 295 336 341 and 346 in hamster dpp4 are largely responsible for the incompatibility of mouse and hamster dpp4s with mers-cov112123 mutating these residues to the corresponding residues in human dpp4 makes mouse and hamster dpp4 functional receptors for mers-cov on the other hand mers-cov and mersr-covs have been isolated from camels and bats respectively mers-cov strains isolated from humans and camels are highly similar to each other and they both use human dpp4 efficiently112 mersr-covs from bats in general share only 6070 sequence identity with mers-cov in the rbd and only some of these bat viruses including hku4 recognize dpp4 as the receptor110111126 however they bind dpp4 less efficiently than mers-cov mutating three residues in the hku4 rbd 540 547 and 558 substantially increased its affinity for human dpp4 ref127 overall as in the case of sars-cov receptor recognition is a crucial determinant of the host range of mers-covfrom 28 october 2016 to 2 may 2017 swine acute diarrhoea syndrome sads was observed in four pig breeding farms in guangdong province with a mortality up to 90 for piglets 5 days or younger a novel hku2-related bat coronavirus named sads-cov was identified as the causative agent34128129 the sads-cov isolates from piglets of the four farms were almost identical and shared 95 identity with rhinolophus bat coronavirus hku2 ref130 indicating the bat origin of this pig virus immediately after the sads outbreak sads-related covs sadsr-covs with 9698 sequence identity to sads-cov were detected in 98 of anal swabs collected from different rhinolophus species in guangdong province during 20132016 although genetically highly similar bat sadsr-covs show high genetic diversity in the s gene with 7292 nucleotide and 8098 amino acid identity to sads-cov receptor analysis indicated that none of the known coronavirus receptors ace2 dpp4 and aminopeptidase n are essential for sads-cov entry34 the mechanism of transmission of sads-cov from bats to pigs and the pathogenesis of bat-originated sadsr-covs in pigs need further exploration this is the first documented spillover of a bat coronavirus that caused severe diseases in domestic animals although molecular evolution data suggested pedv probably originated in bats3738the collected data on genetic evolution receptor binding and pathogenesis demonstrated that sars-cov most likely originated in bats through sequential recombination of bat sarsr-covs recombination likely occurred in bats before sars-cov was introduced into guangdong province through infected civets or other infected mammals from yunnan the introduced sars-cov underwent rapid mutations in s and orf8 and successfully spread in market civets after several independent spillovers to humans some of the strains underwent further mutations in s and became epidemic during the sars outbreak in 20022003 however a recent serological investigation revealed the presence of antibodies against the sarsr-cov nucleocapsid in humans living around a bat cave but who had not shown clinical signs of disease suggesting that the virus can infect humans through frequent contact131a similar scenario might have happened for mers-cov since its outbreak in 2012 mersr-covs and related viruses hku4 and hku5 have been found in different bat species in five continents1721106110111116126127132 the orf1ab of these viruses is highly similar to mers-cov orf1ab but they are highly diverse in their s proteins surprisingly some bat mersr-covs and hku can use the same receptor dpp4 as mers-cov110111126127 given the massive number of coronaviruses carried by different bat species the high plasticity in receptor usage and other features such as adaptive mutation and recombination frequent interspecies transmission from bats to animals and humans is expectedcurrently no clinical treatments or prevention strategies are available for any human coronavirus given the conserved rbds of sars-cov and bat sarsr-covs some anti-sars-cov strategies in development such as anti-rbd antibodies or rbd-based vaccines should be tested against bat sarsr-covs recent studies demonstrated that anti-sars-cov strategies worked against only wiv1 and not shc014 refs718889 in addition little information is available on hku3-related strains that have much wider geographical distribution and bear truncations in their rbd similarly anti-s antibodies against mers-cov could not protect from infection with a pseudovirus bearing the bat mersr-cov s 111 furthermore little is known about the replication and pathogenesis of these bat viruses thus future work should be focused on the biological properties of these viruses using virus isolation reverse genetics and in vitro and in vivo infection assays the resulting data would help the prevention and control of emerging sars-like or mers-like diseases in the futureit is widely accepted that many viruses have existed in their natural reservoirs for a very long time the constant spillover of viruses from natural hosts to humans and other animals is largely due to human activities including modern agricultural practices and urbanization therefore the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to maintain the barriers between natural reservoirs and human society in mind of the one health conceptnovel coronavirus diseases outbreak or coronavirus disease2019 covid19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 is probably the biggest threat for mankind today most of the countries as many as 225 countries have become victims of this pandemic viral infection
1
 hitherto more than 247 lacs death have been recorded alongside 35 lacs individuals are infected with covid19 throughout the globe
1
 the first evidence on the recent outbreak of covid19 has been diagnosed for causing pneumonia amongst the infected individuals from wuhan china at the end of 2019
2
 covid19 is considered as a  coronavirus of 2b group and phylogenetic studies revealed that covid19 belongs to the family coronaviridae and order nidovirales
3
 alike other flucausing viruses covid19 is also an rna containing virus having a protein corecapsid surrounding its rna genome comprising a positivesense singlestranded rna
4
 
5
 
6
 the virus transmits from humantohuman via sneeze cough and respiratory droplets

7

the actual mechanistic insight of the pathogenesis of sarscov2 is yet unclear this is due to the dearth of knowledge that why the virus has selected human as a principal host and how the virus escapes the human innate immune system especially the interaction between the viral antigens and human tolllike receptors tlrs as well as the mechanistic insights of cytokine storm affecting multiple human organs are particularly unknown however the pathophysiology of covid19 typically involves entry of the virus through respiratory droplets into the respiratory system principally the alveoli of lungs through the airways
8
 the viral glycoprotein on its capsid typically termed as spike protein binds to the angiotensinconverting enzyme2 ace2 receptor and the rna genome enters the host cell mostly the alveolar cells via receptormediated endocytosis
8
 after entering the host cell the viral rna replicase is formed from the messenger rna results in rapid replication of the viral rna and other necessary structural proteins
9
 on the other hand the interaction between the viral antigens and host immune cells results in the induction of proinflammatory responses which trigger vasodilation an increase of vascular permeability and accumulation of humoral factors all these factors cumulatively cause fever and majorly interrupts gaseous exchange to cause breathing difficulty
9
 lack of complete understanding about the pathogenesis and immunological peculiarity of the virus made the situation more alarming to mankind currently no specific drug or vaccine is available to challenge this myriad threat recent studies have suggested a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin or drugs used for conventional antiretroviral therapy remdesivir could be effective for treating patients with covid

11
 several studies have attempted to present epitopebased vaccine candidates for the speedy emergence of an effective vaccine against covid19

considering the current scenario of covid19 pandemic the present study aims to add a novel dimension to the existing knowledge of covid19 biology we have presented a comparative picture on the phylogeny antigenicity and structural insights on the major infective protein that is spike glycoprotein of sarscov2 sarscov and middle east respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus merscov as well as their cognate receptor ace2 from different animals through in silico analyses in addition we have also explored the involvement of the possible pattern recognition receptors that most likely recognize the viral spike protein and involved in the hostpathogen interaction in sarscov2 infection in human though biocomputational approachfulllength amino acid sequences of spike glycoprotein of bat coronavirus ratg13 accession number qhr633002 bat sarslike cov accession number avp780421 bat sarslike cov rsshc014 accession number agz488061 bovine cov accession number cce893411 infectious bronchitis cov accession number qdm392391 merscov accession number aum600241 murine hepatitis cov accession number aaw472401 palm civet sourced sars cov accession number aau046611 sars cov bj302 accession number aar076301 sars 2003related cov accession number abd729851 and sarscov2 or nhcovid19 accession number qic532131 were separately retrieved from the ncbi protein database httpwwwncbinlmnihgov similarly the complete amino acid sequences of transmembrane ace2 protein receptors of rhinolophus sinicus horseshoe bat accession number adn934751 manis javanica malayan pangolin accession number xp0175057521 and homo sapiens accession number aat450831 were also retrieved from the same databaseto study the proteinprotein interaction the 3d structure of the wildtype sarscov2 spike glycoprotein pdb id 6vyb was retrieved from the rcsb protein data bank which was actually determined de novo by using cryoelectron microscopic technique with a resolution of 320 
14
 similarly amino acid sequences of tlr1 accession number aac341371 tlr2 accession number aay856501 tlr4 accession number aai174231 and tlr5 accession number aaz174711 were obtained from ncbi protein database httpwwwncbinlmnihgov 3d structures of each tlr were generated by homology modeling and used in further studiesthe spike glycoprotein sequences from all the selected organisms were first subjected to multiple sequence alignment using clustalw algorithm using the mega x software suite ver 101 64bit windows thereafter the alignments were used for constructing the phylogenetic tree by neighborjoining method in the mega platform furthermore phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using bootstrapping analyses with 1000 replications to assess the confidence of the developed phylogenetic treeto study spike proteinace interaction homology modeling was used to model the structure of the ace2 receptors using the retrieved amino acid sequences using the software modeller 9 the stereochemical quality of the so built models was evaluated by plotting ramachandran plots using the structural assessment tool provided by the swissmodel web server httpsswissmodelexpasyorgmolecular docking approach was employed to perform a comparative evaluation of the binding affinities of spike protein from sarscov2 with its cognate ace2 receptor protein of human as well as other most suspected zoonotic hosts like horseshoe bat and the malayan pangolin the study was conducted for each combination of ace2spike complex while using shape and electrostatic field correlations and was subjected to optimized potentials for liquid simulations minimization postprocessing the docking was performed by employing hex docking software ver 800 which proves to be a very popular software application for docking molecules even of higher molecular weights the resultant complex conformations were visualized by through visual molecular dynamics software suite ver 193the retrieved sequences of the ace2 receptors of the organisms horseshoe bat malayan pangolin and human were used to determine the hydrophobicity based on kytedoolittle algorithm by using protscale web server httpswebexpasyorgprotscale the server was also employed to construct plots of percent accessible residues for each ace2 receptor protein furthermore the antigenic propensity of the proteins was also predicted and plotted through kolaskar and tongaonkar algorithm antigenic peptides finder tool from the immunomedicine group server httpimedmeducmes vadar volume area dihedral angle reporter server was also used to assess the structural contents of ace2 proteinthe relative mutability values for spike proteins of sarscov2 sarscov and merscov were determined from their corresponding amino acid sequences employing protscale web server httpswebexpasyorgprotscalethe phylogenetic relationship amongst spike protein of sarscov2 and its homologs is described in figure 1a the phylogenetic reconstruction generated an unrooted phylogenetic tree that resembles a close phylogenetic relation between sarscov2 and bat cov ratg13 and were found to share a monophyletic group figure 1a supported by a high bootstrap value bv value of 100 we have also found that spike protein of sarscov does not share the same clade with mers cov and therefore are phylogenetically distantly related viruses figure 1aafter studying the phylogenetic distance among the major strains of coronavirus we studied the sequence divergence of ace2 receptor protein the major receptor of sarscov2 herein the phylogenetic relationship revealed that ace2 protein is distinct in character amongst the different genus of the animal kingdom figure 1a for example human and gorilla are closely related mammals with minimum change in the genome and phylogeny of ace2 receptor also supports the same figure 1a since this clade is supported by a low bv 50 it is inferred that the receptor protein in human could have followed a different ancestor than that of the gorilla interestingly ace2 of the bat was found to be comparatively closer to human ace2 while pangolin m javanica was found to be a distantly related oneour phylogenetic analysis revealed a close relationship amongst the spike proteins of sarscov2 infecting human and bat coronavirus on the other side the ace2 receptor found to have distinct characteristics we have studied the molecular characteristics of ace2 from human bat and pangolin separately figure 2 analyses of the homology model corresponding to pangolin bat and human ace2 suggested that both human and bat possess similar content 55 of alphahelices in the native structure of ace2 while pangolinace2 contains 53 the proportion of betasheet in the 3d structures ace2 of bat human and pangolin was 7 8 and 9 respectively relative proportions of random coils in the ace2 structures were found to be 23 35 and 37 respectively for ace2 protein from bat human and pangolin origin figure 2athe assumption of any biochemical or biophysical characteristic from the theoretically designed protein structure is dependent on its stereochemical quality herein the ramachandran plot of ace2 for each organism demonstrated that most of the residues are present in the favored region and hence possess good stereochemical stability figure 2b the percentage of accessible residues of human ace2 was found to be close to bat but different from pangolin figure 2c while considering the plots for percentage accessible residues figure 2c it is clear that the ace2 receptor of r sinicus has much more accessible residues near the ligandbinding region as compared to those of the other two hydrophobicity is also considered as an important property of the receptor protein and we have presented the pattern of hydrophobicity of ace2 from the three different organisms we studied figure 2d the pattern of hydrophobicity of ace2 of human was also found to follow a similar trend to that of the bat but not to that of the pangolin in fact the hydrophobicity plot of bat r sinicus showed deeper peaks below the 00 midline as compared with the plots of the other two organismsthe current debate on the origin of the pathogenic transformation of coronavirus is the origin of the virus which may have a connection with bat or pangolin to investigate this postulation we conducted molecular docking of the spike protein of sarscov2 with the ace2 receptor of human bat and pangolin figure 3 we have observed different degrees of binding interactions between spike protein and its receptor ace2 from human and two of the most suspected zoonotic hostsreservoirs figure 3 the order of strength of binding was spike proteinbat ace2  spike proteinhuman ace2  spike proteinpangolin ace2 table 1 interaction between spike protein of sarscov2 and bat ace2 was found to be the strongest table 1 the interacting surface between spike protein and ace2 majorly consisting of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction as depicted in table 1 interestingly the interacting surface of ace2 of human was also found to be similar to bat figure 3 and table 1 upon close examination it was observed that the receptorbinding domain of the sarscov2 spike protein majorly comprises leu glu ser asn phe pro and asp while the ligandbinding region of the ace2 receptors of bat and human are consisted of glu pro asn ala and val figure 3 and table 1 the binding potential of spike protein is also supported by the antigenicity of sarscov2 that reveals increasing abundance antigenic peptides in sarscov2 in comparison to the two other strains of coronavirus that is sarscov and merscov table s1sarscov2 pathogenesis principally involves disruption of physiochemical barriers while the immunopathological consequences in human majorly involve respiratory inflammation
15
 considering this background we investigated the interaction of the spike protein with the innate immune receptors of human especially the cell surface tlrs molecular docking studies have demonstrated significant binding of the native spike protein of sarscov2 to tlr1 tlr4 and tlr6 with a respective binding energy value of 573 1202 and 684 interestingly tlr4spike protein interaction has been found to display the strongest proteinprotein interaction the extracellular domains of the surface tlrs were found to interact with the spike protein in the docked protein complexes figure 4 the binding interfaces between the tlrs and the spike protein were consisted of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions table 2 interestingly more fine and high valued antigenic peaks found in the antigenicity plot for spike protein were majorly detected at the interacting face of the spike protein that is tlrbinding region figure s1 and table s1in addition to the aforementioned studies we have analyzed the relative mutability in the ectodomain of the spike protein of three major strains of the coronavirus we have found that the peptide segment corresponding to s1 subunit of sarscov2 possesses greater mutability potential as compared with the equivalent peptides present in merscov and the sarscov this increased mutability of the spike protein in sarscov2 most likely to be involved in enhancing its coevolutionary velocity and thus enabling it to conform to various novel microenvironments encountered by it moreover this property may also promote the prevalence of sarscov2 across wide racial population distributions of human and also letting it penetrate the speciesspecies barrier with greater easecoronavirus has established its name in biology through the three pandemic outbreaks namely merscov sarscov and the sarscov2 out of these the recent outbreak of covid19 pandemic by sarscov2 has proved to be significantly virulent due its tremendous ability of infection transmission and producing fatal outcomes
8
 there are considerable debates currently going on among the scientific communities regarding the emergence of covid19 in this regard postulations on the emergence of the virus from bat or pangolin possibilities of emergence of covid19 through genetic modifications and adaptive mutations and reemergence of the previously emerged sarscovmers all are open questions to answer in this context a recent wholegenome analysis by zhang et al
16
 revealed that pangolincov and batcov ratg13 are 9055 and 9102 homologous to sarscov2 respectively these experimental evidence indicated that pangolin and bat could be the possible originsource for sarscov2 and covid19 outbreak intriguingly a further report by andersen et al
17
 demonstrated that sarscov2 is not a laboratorymade or intentionally manipulated virus rather it may have originated through natural selection both of these studies have indicated the involvement of zoonotic reservoirin the present study our data suggest that spike protein of sarscov2 is phylogenetically closer to bat sarscov than that of pangolin sarscov but distantly related to mers as described in figure 1 previous studies in this direction indicated that sarscov2 genome rna shares 96 homology with bat coronavirus and 795 with sarscov
18
 the present study is corroborated with this and indicated a close relationship between bat sarscov and human sarscov2 a higher bv of 70 indicated a wellestablished monophyletic group
19
 
20
 moreover the spike protein of sarscov2 contains more antigenic peptides than that of the sarscov and mers supplementary table 1 the present study is therefore suggesting that spike protein expression in the virome of sarscov2 is closely related to that of the bat cov ratg13 and both forms of the virus might have originated from a common ancestor moreover our data also hypothesized that human sarscov2 is a naturally modified version of bat sarscov interestingly we have also observed that the cognate receptor of spike protein that is ace2 is phylogenetically close between human and bat this inference was also verified through determining the relative structural content and binding efficacy of the spike protein to human bat and pangolin ace2 receptor figures 2 and 3 the structural contents hydrophobicity and proportion of accessible residues of ace2 were very close in bat and human while the molecular docking studies revealed that spike protein of sarscov2 binds more strongly to bat and human than pangolin moreover the interaction zone in spike proteinace2 complex of both bat and human was also found comprising similar residues this could be the possible reason behind choosing human as a host for sarscov2 moreover an abundance of human than that of bat might have promoted the pathogenic transformation to select human for speedy transmission we therefore studied the involvement of the human innate immune receptors that is the tlrs to understand the rationale of choosing the human as a host by sarscov2 from an immunological point of viewimmunopathology of covid infection has been reported to be caused due to the elevated inflammatory response that constitutes an abundant expression of proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin6 and tumor necrosis factoralpha
9
 these two cytokines are the products of the tlr signaling pathway
21
 and therefore we have investigated the role of tlrs in this study since sarscov2 is an rna virus one might ask about the functional role of the tlr3 7 8 and 9 but the immunopathological outcomes are most likely induced at the point of hostvirus interaction that is interaction between spike protein of sarscov2 and immune cells present in the alveoli of human
8
 therefore we examined the possible involvement of the surface tlrs present in the human cells and their interaction with the spike protein of sarscov2 our data indicated that tlr4 possesses a strong binding affinity to spike protein following tlr6 and tlr1 figure 4 and table 2 tlr4 being the most efficient innate immune receptor that induces proinflammatory responses after binding with the pathogenic ligand
22
 therefore the interaction between tlr4 and spike protein could be one the reasons behind the immunopathological manifestation of covid19 this interaction could be useful for developing drugs against the same or using tlr4 antagonists as anticorona therapeutics since we have used the native conformations of spike protein and tlrs we have computed the most likely interactions however actual proteinprotein interaction study using surface plasmon resonance can reveal the actual strength of binding and the binding constant intriguingly we have seen positive energy values for tlr 3 5 and 6 which indicate a complex interaction that needs to be examined in future however a recent study by bhattacharya et al
12
 revealed a vaccine candidate from sarscov2 spike protein that interacts with tlr5 since the vaccine is a peptide with much shorter than the actual protein in length and of helical structure it is much more exposed to the tlr than that of the whole protein complex in its native configuration aimed in this study finally our data on mutability indicated the strongest mutability of sarscov2 than that of sarscov and merscov all these evidence collectively support the earlier studies
16
 
17
 
23
 that have indicated the origin of sarscov2 from animals and further strengthen the view on the origin of this viral strain from bat however more experimental validations are particularly needed to establish these inferencesthe present in silico studies indicated a close relationship between bat sarscov and sarscov2 at the level of phylogeny of the major infective protein that is spike protein and its receptor ace2 as well as proteinprotein interaction between these two zoonotic origin of sarscov2 from bat is therefore supported in this study spike protein of sarscov2 has been found to bind with surface tlrs tlr1 4 and 6 especially strongly with tlr4 therefore selective targeting of tlr4spike protein interaction by designing competitive tlr4antagonists could pave a new way to treat covid19 taken together this study is expected to improve our understanding of the biology of sarscov2 and the findings contribute to the fundamental knowledge which could be useful in adopting an accurate intervention strategy in near futurethe authors declare that there are no conflict of interestsac performed all the experiments analyzed the data and assisted in manuscript writing sm

esterase he which is functionally similar to the s protein 4since the early 1970s a variety of pathological conditions in domestic animals have been attributed to cov infections 5 with the exception of infectious bronchitis virus ibv which causes avian infectious bronchitis in chickens 6 canine respiratory coronavirus crcov which causes respiratory disease in dogs 7 and mouse hepatitis virus mhv which can cause a progressive demyelinating encephalitis in mice 3 8 other cov infections typically result in gastrointestinal symptoms for instance transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus tgev 9 10 bovine coronavirus bcv 11 feline coronavirus fcov 12 canine coronavirus ccov 13 and turkey coronavirus tcv 14 are known to cause enteritis in their respective hosts 1in humans cov infections primarily involve the upper respiratory tract and the gastrointestinal tract and vary from mild self-limiting disease such as the common cold to more severe manifestations such as bronchitis and pneumonia with renal involvement 15 the first human coronavirus hcov was isolated during 1965 from the nasal discharge of patients with the common cold and termed b814 16 currently six different cov strains are known to infect humans these include hcov-229e 229e hcov-oc43 oc43 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov hcov-nl63 nl63 hcov-hku1 hku1 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 17 229e and oc43 are the prototype viruses from the two main hcov lineages alpha and beta respectively that cause 1529 of all common colds and are the best characterized 18 sars-cov is the aetiological agent that was behind an outbreak of severe respiratory disease through china during 20022003 19 and mers-cov is the pathogen responsible for an ongoing outbreak of severe respiratory disease centered in the middle east since 2012 20 in this review we first compare and contrast the epidemiology and pathogenesis of the known covs infecting humans in which covs that cause mild to severe disease in humans are newly emerged from a zoonotic source second we describe the ecology of covs and highlight evidence for viral recombination between the different covs within animal populations which may result in the generation of novel covs that are transmissible and lethal to humans finally we summarize the phylogeny evolution and genetic recombination of covs in detailstrain 229e was discovered during 1966 when researchers were characterizing five novel agents that were isolated from the respiratory tract of humans who had contracted the common cold 23 229e was adapted to grow in wi-38 lung fibroblast cell lines and was later shown to be morphologically identical to ibv and mhv 24 symptoms of 229e infection include general malaise headache nasal discharge sneezing and a sore throat 25 a small portion of patients 1020 will also exhibit fever and cough the incubation time is approximately 25 days followed by illness lasting between 2 and 18 days and clinically indistinguishable from respiratory tract infections caused by other pathogens such as rhinovirus and influenza a 18 229e is distributed globally figure 1astrain oc43 was discovered during 1967 in the nasopharyngeal wash of a patient with the common cold and is adapted to grow in organ cultures containing suckling mouse brains similar to 229e oc43 is morphologically indistinguishable from ibv and mhv 24 and patients infected with oc43 present the same clinical symptoms as that of 229e 24 however there is no serological cross-reactivity between 229e and oc43 24 oc43 is also distributed globally

which may result in death httpwwwwhointcsrsarsenwhoconsensuspdfua1 other notable features in some cases include infection of the gastrointestinal tract liver kidney and brain diffuse alveolar damage epithelial cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages is seen in sars-cov infection of the lung lymphopenia hemophagocytosis in the lung in addition to white-pulp atrophy of the spleen observed

the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory illnesses 26 nl63 was a novel hcov isolated from a 7-month-old child with coryza conjunctivitis fever and bronchiolitis in the netherlands during late 2004 26 and an independent investigation described the isolation of virtually the same virus from a nasal sample collected from an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the netherlands 27 nl63 was also detected in new haven usa during 2005 amongst 79 of 895 children and was initially called hcov-nh nh but genetic and phylogenetic analyses showed that nh and hku1 likely are the same species 26 28 infections with nl63 typically result in mild respiratory disease similar to the common cold characterized by cough rhinorrhea tachypnea fever and hypoxia and resolve on their own 29 obstructive laryngitis also known as croup is frequently observed with nl63 infections a study estimated that nl63 accounts for an estimated 47 of common respiratory diseases 26 nl63 is distributed globally figure 1ahku1 was first discovered during january 2005 in a 71-year-old patient from hong kong who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis 30 the symptoms of hku1 respiratory tract infections are not able to be separated from those caused by other respiratory viruses most patients present with fever running nose and cough for infections in the upper respiratory tract whereas a fever productive cough and dyspnea are the common symptoms presenting for infections in the lower respiratory tract 31 most hku1 infections are self-limiting with only two deaths reported in patients with pneumonia due to hku1 32 although hku1 is clinically relatively mild in children hku1 infection is associated with a high incidence of seizures and was found in a patient with meningitis 33 34 hku1 cases outside asia were detected in new haven usa in 2 out of 851 children 35 and also in australia 36 france 37 and brazil 38 indicating a global distribution for the virus figure 1amers-cov was first isolated from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had died from a severe respiratory illness in jeddah saudi arabia 2012 39 clinical manifestations of mers-cov infection range from asymptomatic to severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress septic shock and renal failure resulting in death 40 a typical disease course begins with fever cough chills sore throat myalgia and arthralgia followed by dyspnea and rapid progression to pneumonia 40 41 42 43 approximately one-third of patients present with gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting acute renal impairment was the most striking feature of disease caused by mers-cov which is thus far unique for human cov infections 40 44 seventy-five percent of patients with mers disease also had at least one other comorbidity and patients who died were more likely to have a pre-existingunderlying condition 40 countries around the arabian peninsula are known to be endemic for mers-cov and saudi arabia has reported the most cases but since its discovery in 2012 cases have been occasionally exported to other countries through travel sometimes causing clusters of secondary outbreaks figure 1b 45 as of december 31 2015 a total of 1621 laboratory-confirmed infections have been reported with 584 deaths cfr  360 over 26 countries httpwwwwhointcsrdiseasecoronavirusinfectionsen making mers-cov one of the most dangerous viruses known to humansbased on currently available evidence 229e oc43 nl63 and hku1 are well adapted to humans and the viruses widely circulate in the human population figure 2
 with most cases causing mild disease in immunocompetent adults and none of these viruses have been found to be maintained within an animal reservoir however in the case of sars-cov and mers-cov the viruses are not as well adapted to being maintained in humans and thus are likely spread mainly in zoonotic reservoirs with occasional spillover into the susceptible human population possibly via an intermediate host speciesregarding sars-cov epidemiology data implicated masked palm civets paguma larvata from live animal markets lam in guangdong province china as a route of exposure to sars-cov 46 however masked palm civets from the wild or from farms without lam exposure were largely negative for sars-cov 47 this suggests that palm civets were an intermediate host but not a reservoir for sars-cov 48 subsequent studies have shown that wild horseshoe bats rhinolophidae family which can also be found in lam in china and served in some chinese restaurants in guangdong china have detectable levels of antibodies against sars-cov and a sars-cov-like virus sarsr-rh-bat cov 49 50 suggesting a bat origin for sars-cov an evolutionary relationship between coronaviruses and bats was proposed in which the ancestor for sars-cov first spread to bats of the hipposideridae family then rhinolophidae then masked palm civets and eventually humans 51 recently two new sars-like covs were isolated in horseshoe bats and these viruses showed the highest relationship to sars-cov from all known bat coronaviruses 52 orf8 analysis of the sars-like covs in bats suggests that chinese horseshoe bats are the natural reservoirs of sars-cov 52 53 and that intermediate hosts might not be needed for direct human infection particularly for some bat sars-cov-like viruses 52in the case of mers-cov studies in oman saudi arabia qatar united arab emirates and jordan have shown that dromedary camels are seropositive for neutralizing antibodies against mers-cov 54 as well as camels of middle east origin in africa including egypt kenya nigeria ethiopia tunisia somalia and sudan 55 subsequent studies on dromedary camels in saudi arabia 56 qatar 57 and egypt 58 show that live mers-cov can be isolated primarily from the nasal swabs of camels showing that camels are potential source of mers-cov infection however many confirmed cases lack contact history with camels 59 suggesting direct human-to-human transmission or through contact with a yet-to-be-identified animal species that is maintaining mers-cov studies on hku4 a coronavirus of bat origin and the most phylogenically closely related to mers-cov had shown that hku4 is able to utilize the cd26 receptor for virus entry 60 as cd26 is a known receptor for mers-cov 61 the similarity in receptor specificity of these two covs supports the hypothesis that mers-covs is also a bat-originated cov however live mers-cov has not been isolated from wild bats nor have viral sequences been detecteda recent investigation discovered that multiple hcov species including mers-cov beta-cov group a and a 229e-like virus circulate amongst dromedary camels in saudi arabia 62 furthermore multiple lineages of circulating mers-cov in these camels had resulted in a dominant recombinant mers-cov strain that was responsible for the mers-cov outbreaks during 2015 62 these results show that various covs of human and animal origin are currently circulating in the wild providing ample opportunity for covs to undergo evolution and genetic recombination thereby resulting in recombinant covs that may potentially be more deadly to humans in the following sections we summarize the evolution and genetic recombination of the current hcovsthe phylogenetic tree for the covs of zoonotic and human origin was constructed based on the full genome it can be observed that 229e and nl63 belong to the alpha-cov genus and are grouped together with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv tgev porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv and some bat-derived coronaviruses figure 3
 the topology of the phylogeny is similar to the tree constructed based on the rna-dependent rna polymerase gene 55oc43 hku1 sars-cov and mers-cov belong to the beta-cov genus lineage a includes oc43 and hku1 mhv porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus phev in addition to equine rabbit camel bovine antelope-derived animal coronaviruses lineage b includes sars-cov sars-like viruses of bat and palm civet origin and some bat-derived covs lineage c includes mers-cov and some bat-derived viruses lineage d contains only bat-derived coronavirus figure 3 in contrast to alpha- and beta-covs gamma-covs consist mainly of avian coronaviruses such as ibv as well as covs isolated from aquatic animals whales and dolphins covs of wild-bird origin are clustered into the delta-cov which also contains some swine-derived covs figure 3in general alpha- and beta-covs primarily include covs from mammals whereas gamma- and delta-covs mostly include covs of avian origin notably all currently known hcovs belong to either the alpha- or betacoronavirus genera which also contain covs of mainly bat originthe estimated mutation rates in cov are moderate to high compared to other single-stranded rna ssrna viruses and the average substitution rate for covs was 104 substitutions per year per site 63 the nucleotide mutation rate of ibv for the hypervariable region in the s gene was estimated to be 0306  102 per site per year 64 the s gene of oc43 possessed an average rate of 641058  104 substitution rates per site per year 65 additionally the s gene of 229e possessed a rate of 3  10 4 substitutions per site per year 63 for sars-cov the mutation rate in the whole genome was estimated to be 080238  13 nucleotide substitutions per site per year and the nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates were estimated to be 116330  103 and 167467  103 per site per year respectively which is similar to other rna viruses 66 the evolutionary rate for mers-cov genomes was estimated as 112  103 substitutions per site per year 95 credible interval 95 ci 876  104 137  103 67 furthermore the large rna genome in cov allows for extra plasticity in genome modification by mutations and recombinations thereby increasing the probability for intraspecies variability interspecies host jump and novel covs to emerge under the right conditions 68 69 70the major reason for recombination may be at the replication step in the virus life cycle during replication a set of subgenomic rnas is generated increasing the homologous recombination rate among closely related genes from different lineages of covs or other viruses by template switching 33 concurrently circulating covs in multiple host species likely contribute to increases in the rate of recombination events however the exact mechanism of genetic recombination in covs remains unclear recombination site breakpoints in the viral genome  the crossing point of the recombinant genes between two distinct viral strains or genotypes  appear to be random as different recombinant strains have different breakpointsgenetic recombination has been previously documented for animal covs for instance mhv 71 tgev 72 as well as feline and canine coronaviruses 73 74 genetic recombination for other hcovs including oc43 nl63 hku1 sars-cov 51 and mers-cov have also been documented and are discussed in detail belowoc43 has diverged into five distinct genotypes a to e genotype a is typified by the prototype vr759 strain that was isolated in 1967 75 genotypes b and c are two naturally circulating viruses genotype d emerged via recombination between genotypes b and c viruses at the breakpoint of 25005000 bp in the nsp2nsp3 gene and 15500 bp-3end in nsp12-n genes 75 figure 4
 key figure genotype e identified in 2014 emerged by recombination amongst the genotype b c and d viruses with different breakpoints in the genes compared to the generation of genotype d 76 figure 4 a study in france between 2001 and 2013 demonstrated that oc43 strains have more recombination patterns in lower normandy and circulating oc43 viruses have a high genetic diversity 17nl63 also has the potential for genetic recombination and one such example is between the amsterdam 1 and 496 strains recombination site breakpoints were identified in two parts of the s gene 63 figure 4recombination events have been observed for different genotypes of hku1 in which recombination breakpoints were found on genotypes b and c in the nsp6-nsp7 and nsp16-he genes respectively 70 figure 4 hku1 was also shown to be able to recombine with other animal beta-covs such as mhv at the nsp3 nsp4 nsp6 nsp7 nps9 and nsp10 genes 77 figure 4sars-cov has a possible recombinant history with lineages of alpha- and gamma-cov 78 many specific breakpoints and a large number of smaller recombinant regions had been identified in the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp nsp12 gene at the following locations nucleotides 13 39213 610 15 25915 342 and 15 97416 108 based on the sequence of the sars-cov tor2 strain 78 recombination locations were also identified in the nsp9 and most of nsp10 gene located at 12 61313 344 and parts of nsp14 18 11718 980 78 another study analyzing the genome of the sars-cov cv7 strain had shown that seven putative recombination locations were found between sars-cov and six other coronaviruses pedv tgev bcv 229e mhv and ibv figure 4 this further suggests that sars-cov emerged via serial horizontal transmission and by genetic recombination enhancing the adaptation process to its new host 79recombination was also detected between the sars-related bat-associated cov sarsr-bat covs in which recombination between the rp3 strain from guangxi province and rf1 strain from hubei province china generated a new strain sarsr-civet cov sz3 in civets with a breakpoint at the nsp16spike and s2 region 51 figure 4 furthermore the sars-cov rf12004 strain is itself a recombinant from the bat cov 2792004 bat cov rm12004 and civet cov sz32003 51 figure 4a recent study showed that the epidemic mers-cov experienced recombination events between the different lineages which occurred in dromedary camels in saudi arabia 62 lineages 3 and 5 viruses were predominant during july and december 2014 however lineage 5 became dominant within the camel population by 2015 lineage 5 which is closely associated with the mers-cov causing the outbreak in south korea in 2015 as well as recent human infections in riyadh saudi arabia is a recombinant virus between lineages 3 and 4 or groups 3 and 5 of clade b figure 4 62 80the result from a high frequency of recombination events in covs is the generation of novel viruses with a high genetic diversity with unpredictable changes in virulence during human infections with multiple species of covs circulating in the wild amongst different animal species that may constantly interact with one another it is likely not a matter of if but when the next recombinant cov will emerge and cause another outbreak in the human population as such some crucial future areas of investigation include i the prevalence of hcovs already circulating within the animal population ii the commonality of coronavirus recombination in animals iii animals which may potentially serve as mixing vessels for the generation of novel recombinant covs and iv a surveillance network to monitor and predict the potential emergence of a highly virulent recombinant cov from animals see outstanding questions furthermore lessons from the sars-cov and mers-cov outbreaks must be urgently learned in advance to effectively prepare for the next cov outbreakoutstanding questionshow common is coronavirus recombination in animalscan coronavirus undergo recombination in animal hosts other than camelsis there a way to predict the potential emergence of a novel recombinant coronavirus in the human population
shuo su and gary wong contributed equally to this manuscriptthe ongoing pandemic of a coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease called coronavirus disease 19 covid-19 is the third documented spillover of an animal coronavirus to humans in only two decades 1 in 2011 weiss and leibovitz 2 concluded their chapter on coronavirus pathogenesis by asking will sars or another hcov emerge from its reservoir it seems like this could happen again given the identification of numerous bat sars-like viruses and the finding of sars-like virus in animal such as the civet this sentence sounded prophetic especially now during the covid-19 pandemic globally covid-19 is highlighting that preparedness toward pandemics is still not adequate to effectively deal with what is unknown however asian countries that previously experienced similar epidemics eg sars demonstrated a prompt and appropriate response aimed at containing viral spread and reducing disease impactindeed the rapid spreading of the virus across the world has exposed major gaps in the abilities of most countries to respond to a virulent new pathogen the who-china joint mission report 3 concludes that it is imperative to timely fill the knowledge gaps in the natural history of the disease to put in place effective control strategies 4 such as effective diagnostic tools vaccines and antiviralssars-cov- 2 is only the seventh coronavirus known to infect human in spite of the large coronavirus diversity already explored in animals it is largely established that coronaviruses cause a large variety of diseases in wild and domestic species both in livestock and companion animals and in wildlife leading to significant research in the last half of the twentieth century 5 given that sars-cov-2 has undoubtedly a zoonotic origin 6 a one health approach is suggested in order to understand the origin and the causes of the pandemic 7this paper aims at analyzing some of the current unknowns on sars-cov-2 using recently published data and the available knowledge on coronaviruses infecting animals based on current scientific evidence we elaborate the environmental change and infectious disease envid framework analysis 8 to facilitate the identification of relevant environmental and socio-economic factors that may affect disease burden and to provide links to interventions strategies in a one health perspectivesars-cov-2 belongs to the coronaviridae family that comprises enveloped non-segmented positive-sense rna viruses group 4 in baltimore classification named after their corona crown like surface appreciable by electron microscopy and formed by their largely protruding spike proteinsaccording to the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv coronaviridae study group csg this family comprises 2 subfamilies table s1 letovirinae including the single species microhyla letovirus 1 infecting the ornate chorus frog microhyla fissipes 9 and orthocoronavirinae including 4 genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus deltacoronavirus and 38 species while all alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus species infect mammals deltacoronavirus infects exclusively birds gammacoronavirus a less diverse genus includes 2 viral species the beluga whale coronavirus sw1 and avian coronavirus infecting respectively the beluga whale and birds to date there is no evidence of coronavirus infection in reptiles even if the presence of a letovirinae coronavirus in amphibians encourage more coronavirus investigation in reptiles coronaviruses infecting human can cause mild respiratory symptoms and conjunctivitis 10 11 such as human coronavirus 229e and human coronavirus nl63 alphacoronavirus or mild enteric and respiratory disease such as betacoronavirus 1 oc43 and human coronavirus hku1 betacoronavirus whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus sars and middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus mers both belonging to betacoronavirus can cause severe disease and are example of spillover of animal viruses to human covid-19 associated virus was recognized by csg as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses sars-covs of the species severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and it was designated as sars-cov-2 12the considerable diversity of coronaviruses is driven by their genetic and evolutionary features specifically mutation and recombination appear to be particularly important in coronavirus evolution 1316 as rna viruses covs tend to accumulate random mutations at a far higher rate than their hosts in spite of the proofreading-repair activity of their polymerase increasing copying accuracy up to 14-fold 17 coronaviruses form mutant spectra mutant clouds quasispecies viral populations consisting of dynamic and complex mutant distributions rather than unique genomic sequences 18 quasispecies correlate to enhanced virulence and evolvability and render difficult to prevent and control viral diseases the ability to exist as mutant clouds in an individual host have been described both in animal covs such as the bovine enteric and respiratory coronaviruses 19 and in human sars-cov 20 21 furthermore during cov replication template switching favors homologous recombination among different covs lineages or with less related viruses cooperatively covs circulation in multiple host species may increase recombination events 15 among others genetic recombination was demonstrated in animal viruses such as rodents covs 13 22 porcine pedv 23 cat and dogs covs 24 25 hedgehog covs 26 and bats 16 27 notably recombination between coronavirus and orthoreovirus has been postulated in the case of rousettus bat coronavirus gccdc1 28 genetic recombination in human covs including nl63 hku1 oc43 sars-cov and merscov has also been documented 15 16 additionally the large genome in cov and the presence of key mutational and recombination hotspots 15 26 29 account for extra plasticity in genome modifications promoting intraspecies variability host shifts and novel covs to emerge 14 15 evidence for a rapid evolution of sars-cov-2 was recently shown by comparing 86 complete or near complete genomes from different parts of the world depicting the great diversity in viral coding and non-coding regions 30it has been postulated that coronavirus evolution and dissemination is nourished by warm blooded flying vertebrates bats and birds ideal hosts for the coronavirus gene source bats for alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus such as sars-cov and mers-cov and birds for gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus 31 32 also a rodent origin has been proposed for hcov- oc43 and hku1 16sars-cov emerged in 2002 in southern china guangdong province as a novel clinical severe disease and rapidly spread to other 28 countries 31 33 all early cases had a history of contact with living animals in wet markets or restaurants molecular and serological data and isolation demonstrated that sars-cov originated from civet cats figure 1a family viverridae in guangdong market and also that farmed civets did not play a role as reservoirs 31 34 35horseshoe bats family rhinophidae host genetically diverse sars-like coronaviruses including ancestors of sars-cov and are considered the original source of sars 31 moreover sars and mers related covs have been identified in vespertilionidae and molossidae bats 36early cases of mers in saudi arabia in 2012 37 had contact with animals in particular with dromedary camels figure 1b molecular and serological data indicated the presence of mers viruses in dromedaries with high sequence similarities 99 to human mers-cov 38 and antibodies in camels could be traced back to the eighties 31 39 more molecular data support that human and camel mers-cov isolates belong to the same coronavirus species and that mers-cov originated from the bat gene pool 31 ancestor analysis suggests that mers-cov could have spilled from bats to camels some 30 years ago in africa and it was subsequently introduced in the arabian peninsula by importing camels from the african continent 40evidence suggests that the sars-cov-2 emerged in late 2019 in a wet market in wuhan hubei province china 41 42 however retrospective analyses indicate that sars-cov-2 might have spilled somewhere else prior to december 2019 6 origin of this virus rapidly became one of the greatest concerns figure 1c the idea of a laboratory-based origin is not plausible as there is no evidence showing that sars-cov-2 is a purposefully manipulated virus 11 also a snake origin of sars-cov-2 can be ruled out as no other coronaviruses have been found in reptiles and there are not receptor signatures or other strongly indicative molecular evidence 43 supporting this it is now recognized that bats such as rhinolophus affinis are natural viral reservoirs and that the malayan pangolin manis javanica might be the sars-cov-2 intermediate host that brought the bat coronavirus to human hosts even if some studies have proposed that the pangolin illegally imported into southern china may be a natural host rather than an intermediate host 4446 sars-cov-2 infection has been demonstrated in two pet dogs in hong kong and two pet cats in hong kong and in belgium 47 48 the pet cases were in close contact with a confirmed covid-19 human case also a malayan tiger in bronx zoo in new york city developed covid-19 after exposure to an asymptomatically infected worker 49person-to-person transmission of sars-cov-2 has been documented as for the previously discovered sars-cov and mers-cov all these coronaviruses seem predominantly transmitted by respiratory droplets that people cough sneeze or exhale over a relatively close distancea study conducted by setti et al 50 has shown that pollution may have played a role in the propagation of sars-cov-2 researchers evidenced an association between the exceedances of the legal limits of the pm10 concentrations recorded during the 2 weeks preceding the first peak of covid-19 cases in northern italy this lead could be related to the conditions of airborne particulate matter pollution that may have exerted a boost action on transmission animal coronaviruses can replicate in the epithelial cells of both the respiratory and the enteric tracts 51 enteric tropism was also reported for sars-cov-2 causing diarrhea in 1673 of patients in addition to respiratory symptoms 52 the transmission of sars through water droplets from feces via air ventilation systems in hong kong was reported 53 diarrhea and enteric symptoms were also reported in a significant proportion of covid-19 patients recent reports show that sars-cov-2 has been detected in stool samples of covid-19 cases 5457according to who and food safety authorities network infosan 58 more information on the potential for persistence of sars-cov-2 on foods traded internationally as well as the potential role of food in the transmission of the virus are needed who suggests that the consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided raw meat raw milk or raw animal organs should be handled with care to avoid cross- contamination with uncooked foods results obtained with sars-cov surrogate bovine coronavirus bcov of the genus betacoronavirus showed that contaminated vegetables may serve as a vehicle for transmission through consumption as an example mullis et al 59 showed that bcov on lettuce retained infectivity for at least 14 days under household refrigeration conditions the ability of enteric coronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv to survive in specific feed ingredients under modeled conditions simulating shipment was shown suggesting that contaminated feed ingredients for pigs could serve as transboundary risk factors 60 extended survival in soybean meal has been confirmed also for swine alphacoronavirus tgev and deltacoronavirus pdcov 61 these data lead to speculate that contaminated ready-to-consume produce may be a potential vehicle for zoonotic transmission of coronaviruses to humans awareness regarding the possible roles of water fresh products and fecal contamination in coronavirus transmission is required at times of human coronavirus outbreaks the role of animals in sars-cov-2 transmission is still debated and need to be clarified experimental infection tests conducted in laboratory animals suggest that sars-cov-2 replicates poorly in dogs pigs chickens and ducks but efficiently in ferrets and cats with cats transmitting the virus via respiratory droplets 62 for these reasons a possible role of animal hosts as reservoir and a further source of virus for humans cannot be ruled out especially in hotspots of biodiversity and in many developing countries characterized by close proximity among human wild and domestic animalsurbanization can be considered an important distal environmental factor acting on covid-19 transmission according to fao 63 cities with their high population density are vulnerable to the covid-19 pandemic the spread of the virus in crowded cities could have extensive morbidity and mortality consequences for urban populations the very poor and those living in slums have extremely limited access to essential health and sanitation facilities nutritious food and adequate infrastructure such as piped clean water and electricity as during the sars-cov pandemic 64 sars-cov-2 was detected in wastewater collected at a major urban treatment facility in massachusetts 65 sars-cov-2 was detected in sewage of 7 cities and the airport during the emergence of covid-19 in the netherlands sewage surveillance could be used to monitor the circulation of sars-cov-2 complementing current clinical surveillance 66climate is a further distal environmental factor that might indirectly influence sars-cov-2 transmission the who assumption is that covid-19 spread will not ameliorate during summer period the effect of seasons on transmission of covid-19 is still unknown a negative correlation between warmer climate and covid-19 spread has been suggested by a number of pre-print sources 6769 and news however caspi and collaborators conclude that their findings on possible reduced spread during warm season should be cautiously interpreted and need to be validated as an association between warmer climate and reduced covid-19 spread might be due to local patterns of transmission rather than by climateit has been speculated that the warm months of summer in the northern hemisphere might not necessarily reduce transmission below the value of unity as they do for influenza a given the fact that sars-cov-2 r0 was estimated 23 1 sars-cov-2 spreads in countries characterized by tropical climates such as singapore for this reason winter is not considered a necessary condition for sars-cov-2 diffusion and persistence 70 the independence of viral spread from high temperature has been already proved for other coronaviruses such as the sars- cov surrogate animal virus transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev a diarrheal pathogen of swine and mouse hepatitis virus mhv a respiratory and enteric pathogen of mice that showed the ability to survive on surfaces for days at 20c and wide range of relative humidity rh levels 2060 the animal surrogates showed to be more resistant to inactivation on surfaces than previously studied human coronaviruses such as 229e several studies demonstrated that sars-cov and mers-cov have the capacity to survive on dry surfaces for a sufficient duration to facilitate onward transmission sars-cov and mers-cov were shown to be able to contaminate the environment and fomites promoting viral access to mucous membranes of the nose eyes or mouth through individual self-inoculation by hands 71 in fact sars-cov related mathematical and animal models and intervention studies suggested that contact with contaminated environment is the most important route in some scenarios such as in health care facilities 72sars-cov and its surrogates can also survive in environmental reservoirs such as water foods and in sewage for extended periods 71 7375 sars-cov and probably mers-cov are shed into the environment at concentrations exceeding the infective dose and they can survive for considerable time on surfaces the surface survival of sarsmers-cov was shown to be greater than that of other respiratory viruses such as influenza virus in particular infective mers-cov could still be recovered after 48 h at the 20c40 rh condition whereas the virus remained viable for 8 and 24 h at 30c80 rh and 30c 30 rh respectively instead h1n1 influenza virus known to have a seasonal spread pattern cannot be recovered after 4 h at the same environmental conditions 73economic development should be considered as a further distal factor fao 63 stated that there is a particularly high risk of infection for the 12 billion people living in the congested and overcrowded informal urban settlements where conditions are already unsafe and unhealthy for human livingclimate change urbanization and subsequent loss of natural habitats changes in human habits and behavior collectively leading to human and animals living in close proximity have been identified as the main drivers for the emergence of viral diseases 76to some extent covid-19 outbreak may be considered as an indirect consequence of global environmental changes 77 in fact multiscale environmental changes encompassing social processes such as over-crowded urban settings where human and wildlife can come into close contact eg wet markets trading of exotic animals 6 large-scale population migration such as those linked to the chinese new year celebration 78 were identified as possible causes of the emergence of covid-19 and of its pandemic spreadto develop plans and policies for intervention strategies a preliminary knowledge of disease determinants is necessary 79 covid-19 was immediately defined as a contact-transmissible infectious disease spread via direct contact between individuals outbreak control measures were thus aimed at reducing the amount of mixing in the population to delay the peak and reduce the final size of the epidemic 80 however the course of the covid-19 epidemic is defined by a series of further key factors some of which are still poorly understood 1 the amount of scientific data produced during the covid-19 pandemic is amazingly huge and this can be crucial to translate research into effective public health policies and practicesaccording to recent data covid-19 is not only linked to person to person transmission as indirect transmission may also occur recent scientific evidence seems to suggest that environmental factors and changes may act as extrinsic determinants in the epidemiology of covid-19 and of other human and animal coronavirusesbased on the available scientific literature we applied the envid framework 8 to facilitate the identification of the environment-disease relationships and connections that may impact on disease burden figure 2 the envid framework encompasses 3 interlocking components including environment transmission and disease and it defines three transmission groups group i including directly transmitted diseases group ii including vector-borne diseases and group iii including environmentally mediated diseases with non-human host at first based on the available data we attempted to attribute covid-19 to one of these three groupsin agreement with the prevalent scientific evidence covid-19 might be classified as group i as it can be transmitted person to person being mainly affected by social processes such as over-crowding social distancing has in fact shown to prevent transmission from symptomatic and non-symptomatic cases hence flattening the epidemic and delaying the peakhowever sars-cov-2 is also quite resistant in the environment and the role of non-human hosts as reservoir in infected areas cannot be overlooked for this reason it may be also attributed to group iii including those diseases for which transmission can be affected by the modification of human exposure to contaminated environment media including water and possibly food and infected animals besides indirect contact with contaminated environment a direct transmission from human to animals and vice-versa cannot be ruled outin figure 2 we represented this transmission dynamic with dashed arrows as it requires to be better investigated to provide more scientific evidence in a true one health approach where human and veterinary medicine need to collaborate thoroughly to clearly define the whole causal relationships of disease transmissionaccording to brierley et al 81 transmission routes with environmental components eg fecaloral or food borne transmission would be associated with higher virulence than direct contact-based transmission envid analysis shows that distal environmental changes such as those related to urbanization and climate need to be considered as they may act through multiple intermediate steps on covid-19 transmission as an example pollution linked either to urbanization and to climate factors may play a role it is known in fact that a prolonged exposure to air pollution leads to a chronic inflammatory stimulus even in young and healthy subjects 82 for this reason a contribute of air pollution and particulate cannot be neglected as an environmental factor that may directly or indirectly influence the transmission cycle of sars-cov-2 regarding climate it has been shown that sars-cov and mers-cov are quite resistant even at a temperature of 30c when rh is not exceeding 30 it has been shown for influenza virus that at low rh evaporation of water from exhaled bioaerosols would occur rapidly leading to the formation of droplet nuclei conversely at high rh small respiratory droplets would take on water increase in size and settle more quickly out of the air 83 if sars-cov-2 will also show similar resistance patterns as the other covs and its transmission is not impaired at 30c this may suggest that contact-based spread may predominate in the tropics where rh is generally high whereas aerosol transmission may play a larger role in temperate climates even if person to person transmission is considered the main transmission pathway our proposed transmission pattern underlines that human environment and animal might all play a role in the potential spread and persistence of sars-cov-2 with a different weight in different geographical and social contexts in particular environmental contamination and humananimal habitat overlapping cannot be overlooked especially in developing countries coronaviruses exist and can maintain their viability in sewage and wastewater originating from the fecal discharge of infected patients highlighting the importance of sanitation to protect public health 84 in developing countries where water and sanitation systems are often insufficient or ineffective it is necessary to consider that sars-cov-2 transmission might be amplified through water contamination in citiesattribution of the burden of disease to environmental risks highlights in fact the importance of environmental protection for peoples health and can inform priority setting for targeted management of environmental determinants 85 the public health measures to contain covid-19 spreading are being based on the scientific data currently available that mainly derive from studies on the infections dynamics observed in industrialized countries an important bias on the large amount of data produced in china and other asian countries and the lower contributions from europe and north america is evident this is clearly due to the timing and geographic spread of the epidemic as suggested by the envid framework distal and proximal environmental factors transmission dynamics and consequent morbidity and lethality may differ in different socio-economic contexts it is thus essential to collect data on the determinants of infection even in developing countries where the capacities of the healthcare infrastructures diagnostic and research capacities are very limited in fact country socio-economic profiles were shown to have an influence on the growth rate of epidemics so that r0 might differ in different geographic areas 70 as an example fao warns that the policies to limit the

outbreak of respiratory illnesses starting in mid-december of 2019 in wuhan the capital of hubei province china 13 due to the similarity of its symptoms to those induced by the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and genome organization similarity the causal virus was named sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses 4 as of 3162020 167515 cases of sars-cov-2 infection have been confirmed in 114 countries causing 6606 fatalities as a result who declared the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus on 3112020 httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019situation-reports as the virus continues to spread numerous strains have been isolated and sequenced on 3182020 more than 500 complete or nearly complete genomes have been sequenced and made publicly availablesars-cov-2 is the seventh coronavirus found to infect humans among the other six sars-cov and mers-cov can cause severe respiratory illness whereas 229e hku1 nl63 and oc43 produce mild symptoms 5 current evidence strongly suggests that all human associated coronaviruses originated from other animals such as bats and rodents 5 6 while sars-cov-2 shares similar genomic structure with other coronaviruses 710 its sequence differs substantially from some of the betacoronaviruses that infect humans such as sars-cov approximately 76 identity mers-cov 43 identity and hku-1 33 identity but exhibits 96 similarity to a coronavirus collected in yunnan province china from a bat rhinolophus affinis therefore sars-cov-2 most likely originated from bats 2 11several issues concerning the origin time of virus introduction to humans evolutionary patterns and the underlying driving force of the sars-cov-2 outbreak remain to be clarified 12 13 here we analyzed genetic variation of sars-cov-2 and its related coronaviruses we discuss how mutational bias influences genetic diversity of the virus and attempt to infer forces that shape sars-cov-2 evolution137 complete sars-cov-2 genomes were downloaded from the global initiative on sharing avian influenza data gisaid httpswwwgisaidorg supplementary table 1 related coronavirus

httpswwwncbinlmnihgovnucleotide nucleotide positions and coding sequences cdss of sars-cov-2 were anchored to the reference genome nc045512 cds annotations of other coronaviruses were downloaded from genbankcdss were aligned based on translated amino acid sequences using muscle v3831 14 and back-translated to their corresponding dna sequences using tranalign software from the emboss package httpembossopen-bioorg 15 nucleotide diversity including number of segregating sites wattersons estimator of  16 and nucleotide diversity  17 was estimated using mega-x 18 mega-x was also used for phylogenetic construction phylogenetic relationships were constructed using the neighbor-joining method based on kimuras two-parameter model implemented in mega-x number of nonsynonymous changes per nonsynonymous site dn and synonymous changes per synonymous site ds among genomes were estimated based li-wu-luos method 19 implemented in mega-x and paml 4 20 the rdp file for the haplotype network analyses was generated using dnasp 60 21 and input into network 10 httpswwwfluxus-engineeringcom to construct the haplotype network using the median joining algorithm four haplotype test implemented in dnasp was applied to test for possible recombination eventthe mutation rate of sars-cov-2 and the time to the most recent common ancestor tmrca of virus isolates were estimated by an established bayesian mcmc approach implemented in beast version 1104 22 the sampling dates were incorporated into tmrca estimation the analysis was performed using the hky model of nucleotide substitution assuming an uncorrelated lognormal molecular clock 23 we linked substitution rates for the first and second codon positions and allowed independent rates in the third codon position we performed two independent runs with 3  108 mcmc steps and the results were combined log files were checked using tracer httpbeastbgioedacuktracer effective sample sizes were  300 for all parametersthe resulting phylogeny reveals that ratg13 is the closest relative of sars-cov-2 followed by pangolin2019 and pangolin2017 then covzc45 and covzxc21 and other sars-related sequences as outgroups supplementary fig 1 according to general time reversible model transition occurred more frequent than transversion with c-t and a-g changes account for 45 and 28 respectively of all six types of nucleotide changes we next estimated the strength of selection for each coding region using the dn and ds while purifying selection tends to remove amino acid-altering mutations thus reducing dn and dnds positive selection has the opposite effect increasing dn and dnds 24 between sars-cov-2 and ratg13 orf8 gene exhibits the highest dn 0032 highlighted in bold in table 1 followed by spike 0013 and orf7 0011 all above the genome average of 0007 table 1 ds varies greatly among cdss with the highest of 0313 in spike and the lowest of 0018 in envelope genome average 0168 finally dnds is the highest in orf8 0105 followed by orf7 0061 and orf3 0060 with the genome average of 0042 since spike shows both high ds and dn its protein evolution rate dnds is only 0040 thus while the coronavirus evolved very rapidly it has actually been under tremendous selective constraint 13
spike protein similarity between sars-cov-2 and pangolin2019 led to the idea that the receptor binding domain rbd within the sars-cov-2 spike protein originated from pangolin2019 via recombination 2528 if that were the case we would expect the divergence at synonymous sites ds to also be reduced in the rbd region however while dn in the rbd region is 0023 approximately one third of the estimate for the rest of the spike gene 0068 ds in the rbd 0710 is actually slightly higher than in the rest of the spike sequence 0651 this argues against the recombination scenario we noticed that the ds of the whole spike and the rbd are 2- and 3-fold respectively higher than the genome average since synonymous sites are typically less influenced by selection the increased divergence in ds may require further investigationwe downloaded 137 sars-cov-2 genomes available from gisaid as of 2232019 the coding regions were aligned and 223 mutations were identified with 68 synonymous and 155 nonsynonymous changes the directionality of changes was inferred based on the ratg13 sequence frequency spectra of both synonymous and nonsynonymous changes are skewed while the former shows excess of both high and low frequency mutations the latter mainly exhibits an excess of low frequency changes fig 1a the excess of low frequency mutations is consistent with the recent origin of sars-cov-2 29 both population reduction and positive selection can increase high frequency mutations 30 31 however the first scenario is contradicted by the recent origin of the virus if positive selection has been operating we would expect an excess of high frequency non-synonymous as well as synonymous changes furthermore the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous ns changes is 246 13856 among singleton variants but only 123 1613 among non-singletons both the nonsynonymous frequency spectrum and ns ratio demonstrate that the majority of amino acid-altering mutations did not reach to high frequency thus evidence for positive selection is limited
the skew of synonymous variants toward high frequency deserves further discussion as it relates to the underlying force driving the sars-cov-2 outbreak the puzzle is probably rooted in how high and low frequency mutations are inferred the results shown in the fig 1a are based on an outgroup comparison the divergence at synonymous sites between sars-cov-2 and ratg13 is 17 approximately 3-fold greater than between humans and rhesus macaques 32 with such high level of divergence the possibility of multiple substitutions cannot be ignored especially since substitutions in coronavirus genomes are strongly biased toward transitions see above indeed among all non-singleton mutations listed in table 2 62 of the changes are c-t transitions
to get around the potential problem caused by multiple substitutions we cross-referenced the course of changes using the sars-cov-2 haplotype network fig 2 and phylogeny supplementary fig 2 supplementary table 2 the two analyses yield very different pictures for example the highest frequency derived mutation in table 2 is a c-t synonymous change at 10138 marked  in fig 2 and table 2 all three sequences from singapore share the t nucleotide also found in the ratg13 outgroup using the outgroup comparison the c found in the rest of the human sars-cov-2 sequences is a derived mutation however the t at this position is restricted to genomes collected from singapore on 24 and 262020 and not found in earlier samples it is thus more sensible to infer that this t is a back mutation derived from c rather than an ancestral nucleotide another synonymous change at position 24034 occurred twice c24034t on different genomic backgrounds marked  in fig 2 although the outgroup sequence at this position is t it is more likely that the c at this position is the ancestral nucleotide we observed a number of such back or repeated mutations an a-t nonsynonymous change at 29019 d249h in nucleocapsid protein marked o in fig 2 also occurred twice
repeated mutations may be caused by intergenomic recombination indeed the result of four haplotype test suggested that at least two recombination events may have occurred between positions 8782 and 11083 and between 11083 and 28854 we noticed that a sequence isolated on 1212020 from a patient in the united states epiisl404253 exhibited y c or t at both positions 8782 and 28144 although the possibility that two novel mutations might have occurred within this patient cannot be 100 ruled out the alternative explanation that this patient may have been co-infected by two viral strains seems more plausible after cross-referencing with the haplotype network and the phylogeny all mutations listed as high frequency in table 2 and fig 1a were re-assigned to the other side of the frequency spectra we only see an excess of singleton mutations consistent with a recent origin of sars-cov-2 fig 1b and suggesting that the virus has mainly evolved under constraintperhaps the most controversial case is the t-c change at position 28814 which alters leucine l to serine s in orf8 protein l84s since both pangolin and ratg13 have a c at this position table 2 tang et al suggested that 84 l is derived from 84s in the human virus 13 the 84s was not discovered until 152020 by which time 23 sars-cov-2 genomes have been sampled after the first appearance its frequency gradually increased reaching approximately 30 by 1232020 suggesting that 84s may exhibit some advantage over 84 l if genomes carrying 84s were ancestral it would be a challenge to explain its absence in early samplings in addition as mentioned above c-t transitions are dominant in coronavirus evolution and multiple hits were observed in sars-cov-2 fig 2 it is therefore possible that 28814c mutated to t after ancestral sars-cov-2 diverged from the common ancestor with ratg13 and recently changed back to c finally if 84 l is indeed a derived haplotype and has rapidly increased in its frequency by positive selection we would expect haplotypes carrying 84 l to have accumulated more derived mutations than haplotypes with 84s however after correcting for mutational direction the two haplotypes exhibited similar mutation frequency spectra supplementary fig 3 the alternative hypothesis that 84s is a back mutation from 84 l is more plausiblein addition to l84s a g-t transversion at 26144 which caused an amino acid change in orf3 protein g251v is also at intermediate frequency table 2 251 v was first seen on 1222020 and gradually increased its frequency to 13 by our sampling date fig 3 we note that the emergence of 84s in orf8 and 251 v in orf3 proteins are consistent with the lockdown of wuhan on 1232020 the former first appeared in early january gradually increased its frequency and reached a plateau around 1232020 the latter showed up on 1222020 and rapidly increased its frequency within 2 weeks
based on fig 3 we divided the sampling course into two epidemic episodes from the first sampled sequence 12242019 to before the lockdown of wuhan 1212020 and from 1222020 to the date of the last sequence sampling 2232020 the dnds of coding regions within the two episodes were estimated as roughly 87 of mutations were singletons many of these are probably sequencing errors affecting synonymous and nonsynonymous sites equally and inflating our dnds estimates in addition since dnds is already extremely small in sars-cov-2 table 1 such inflation would have a large effect on dnds estimates we therefore estimated dn and ds with supplementary table 3 and without singletons table 3
the dnds of orf8 gene in episode i and ii and orf3 gene in episode ii show strong signatures of positive selection consistent with increase of 84s and 251 v frequency during these periods and may suggest a role of adaptation table 3 the overall dnds within each episode was 510 times higher than dnds between coronavirus genomes derived from different species table 1 the elevated dnds of sars-cov-2 is either due to its adaptation to human hosts or relaxation of selection for a recently emerged virus it is reasonable to expect operation of positive selection at the early stage in that case the dnds during episode i should be greater than during episode ii 33 34when singletons were included dnds in episode i was approximately 20 higher than that in episode ii across the genome supplementary table 3 in contrast we observed the opposite result after removing singletonsie dnds in episode i was approximately 50 lower than that in episode ii table 3 therefore the elevation of dnds was most probably due to a relaxation in selection we further divided episode i into ia and ib according to the appearance of 84s in orf8 protein on 162020 the genome-wide dnds values were 027 and 023 for episode 1a and 1b respectively supplementary table 4 therefore as shown in the frequency spectra the signature of positive selection is weak at the early stage of the epidemicthe estimated mutation rate of sars-cov-2 is 24  10 3siteyear with 95 highest posterior density hpd of 1533  10 3siteyear the mutation rate at the third codon position is 29  10 3siteyear 95 hpd 1840  10 3siteyear which is in a good agreement with synonymous mutation rate of sars-cov 167467  10 3 siteyear 34 sars-cov-2 is estimated to have originated on 12112019 95 hpd 1113201912232019 the initial effective population size of the virus was small which is consistent with the recent origin of sars-cov-2 the population size showed approximately 20-fold increase from the onset of the outbreak to the lockdown of wuhan 1232020 and ceased to increase afterwards demonstrating the effectiveness of social distancing on preventing virus spread fig 4 we have to point out that the tmrca and epidemic growth curve estimation are strongly influenced by the sampling scheme for example since the earliest available genome was sampled on 12242019 almost 1 month after the outbreak the real origin of the current outbreak may actually be earlier than our estimation in addition all sequences from wuhan were sampled before 01052020 which would have an influence on demographic estimation
we estimated genetic variation including the number of segregating sites wattersons estimator of  and nucleotide diversity  of the sars-cov-2 since both  and  are estimators of 4nu n and u are the effective population size and mutation rate respectively they should be close to each other at the mutation-drift equilibrium 35 because  is strongly influenced by rare mutations which are common during recent population expansion 24 it is a better estimator of genetic diversity for sars-cov-2 for example when all samples are considered  1392  10 4 is approximately eight times higher than  181  10 4 table 4 among samples collected from different locations sequences from china exhibited higher genetic variation in terms of the number of segregating sites  and  than the rest of the world combined consistent with the observation that the outbreak originated in china as the source populations are expected to exhibit higher genetic variation than derived populations 35
the haplotype network also supports this notion fig 2 usually ancestral haplotypes have a greater probability of being in the interior have more mutational connections and are geographically more widely distributed the h1 haplotype is at the center of the network and is found in four countries and many places in china in addition a large portion of haplotypes is directly connected to h1 therefore it is likely that h1 is the ancestral haplotype as 45 of h1 are found in wuhan this location is the most plausible origin of the ongoing pandemica close relationship between sars-cov-2 and pangolin2019 at the amino acid level in the rbd region of the spike protein might be due to recent recombination 25 26 data contamination or convergent evolution since recent recombination and dna contamination should affect synonymous and nonsynonymous sites equally they can be convincingly rejected as great divergence at synonymous sites was observed in spite of similar amino acid sequences between the two genomes while genotypic convergence may be observed in viruses repeatedly evolving under particular conditions such as drug resistance and immune escape 3639 it is otherwise rare for adaptations that do not involve highly specialized conditions divergent molecular pathways may develop and genotypic convergence would not be expected 40 for example sars-cov and sars-cov-2 both use the spike protein to bind human ace2 2 but five out of six critical amino acids within the rbd are different between these two viruses 27 since the sars-cov-2 and pangolin2019 have diverged at about 47 of synonymous sites and infect different hosts the idea that they share five out of six critical amino acids within rbd through convergent evolution seems far-fetchedwe therefore hypothesize that instead of convergent evolution the similarity of rbd between sars-cov-2 and pangolin2019 was caused by an ancient inter-genomic recombination assuming a synonymous substitution rate of 29  10 3siteyear the recombination was estimated to have occurred approximately 40 years ago 95 hpd 3169 years divergence time t  divergence dssubstitution rate  2  3 considering ds in rbd is 3-fold of genome average the amino acids in the rbd region of the two genomes have been maintained by natural selection ever since while synonymous substitutions have been accumulated if this is true sars-cov-2 may have circulated cryptically among humans for years before being recently noticedthe ancient origin of sars-cov-2 is supported by its lack of a signature of adaptive evolution as shown by frequency spectra and dnds in samples from the recent epidemic for a recently acquired virus rapid evolution and a strong signature of positive selection are expected for example during its short epidemic in 20022003 several rounds of adaptive changes have been documented in sars-cov genomes 33 34 after adapting to its host the virus may evolve under purifying or relaxed selection exactly as we see in sars-cov-2 therefore it is important to sequence samples from the early outbreak and to examine hospital archives for the trace of sars-cov-2 ancestors this information not only can help us to understand the evolutionary path of this virus but also unravel the critical steps for it to achieve effective spreading in humansin addition to the rbd the sars-cov-2 spike protein also contains a small insertion of a polybasic cleavage site which was thought to be unique within the b lineage of betacoronaviruses 27 however a recent analysis of bats collected from yunnan china identified a similar insertion in a sequence rmyn02 closely related to sars-cov-2 providing strong evidence that such seemingly sorcerous site insertions can occur in nature 11 both the polybasic cleavage site in rmyn02 and rbd in pangolin2019 suggest that like with sars-cov 6 all genetic elements required to form sars-cov-2 may have existed in the environment more importantly they can be brought together by frequent intergenomic recombination see result nature never runs out of material to create new pathogens it is not whether but when and where the next epidemic will occurthere is a heated debate about the evolutionary forces influencing the trajectory of the l84s mutation in orf8 protein httpvirologicalorgtresponse-to-on-the-origin-and-continuing-evolution-of-sars-cov-2418 while tang et al considered serine is the ancestral amino acid 13 we present evidence that it is a back mutation the majority of sequences in wuhan were sampled before early january 2020 and most genomes carrying 84s were found outside wuhan after middle to late january 2020 the discrepancy in time and space impedes the effort to resolve the debate it would require more sequences from the early stage of the epidemic to settle this issue regardless of its ancestral or derived status we hypothesize that 84s may confer some selective advantage unless the sampling scheme is deliberately skewed it is difficult to explain such dramatic frequency gain of 84s from 0 to  30 in 2 weeks oddly its frequency ceased to increase after 1232020 when wuhan was locked down this coincidence prompts us to consider the effect of social distancing on virus transmission another line of evidence comes from the frequency increase of 215 v in orf3 protein the 215 v first appeared on 1222020 and rapidly increased its frequency within 2 weeksseveral studies suggested that the orf8 protein may function in viral replication modulating endoplasmic reticulum stress inducing apoptosis and inhibiting interferon responses in host cells 4145 4145 during the sars spread frequency of several orf8 mutations fluctuated in accordance with different phases of the outbreak suggesting that orf8 underwent adaptation during the sars epidemic 34 it is suggested that 84s may induce structural disorder in the c-terminus of the protein and may generate a novel phosphorylation target for serinethreonine kinases of the mammalian hosts 46sars-cov orf3 protein has been shown to activate nf-b and the nlrp3 inflammasome and causes necrotic cell death lysosomal damage and caspase-1 activation in addition orf3 is required for maximal sars-cov replication and virulence all of the above likely contributes to the clinical manifestations of sars-cov infection 4749 therefore these two mutations may have some functional consequences and be worth investigating further by the time we prepared this manuscript the 215 v frequency ceased to increase however a parallel mutation has occurred in a different genomic background further supporting the idea that this mutation may require further studyin contrast to adaptive evolution previously reported for sars-cov in its brief epidemic our analysis of sars-cov-2 genomes shows signs of relaxation of selection which in combination with an ancient intergenomic introgression in rbd of spike protein suggests that sars-cov-2 might have cryptically circulated within humans for years before being recently noticed data from the early outbreak and hospital archives are needed to trace its evolutionary path and reveal critical steps required for effective spreading we found that the lockdown of wuhan is strongly associated with frequency fluctuations of 84s in orf8 and 215 v in orf3 proteins and population size of the virus suggesting the effectiveness of human intervention such as social distancing on preventing virus spreadon december 31 2019 the world health organization who china country office was informed by the chinese authorities of a series of pneumonia cases with unknown etiology unknown cause in wuhan hubei china with clinical presentations that greatly resembled viral pneumonia the chinese authorities have isolated a causal agent on 7 january 2020 which was identified as a new type of coronavirus novel coronavirus ncov 1 titled severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and the disease it causes coronavirus disease covid-19 2after emerging in china the virus has spread rapidly throughout the world on april 29 2020 there were 3162438 confirmed cases throughout the world with 219287 deaths due to covid-19 3 these numbers were escalating rapidly day by daythe research community has responded rapidly to this new threat to humanity on march 19 2020 a simple search of pubmed using the most common terms associated with the new virus and disease coronavirus or covid-19 or covid 19 or sars-cov-2 revealed that almost 2000 such articles were published since december 1 2019 however cursory browsing of those articles indicated that the majority of them appeared to be editorials news and opinionsthis is the third coronavirus epidemic in the third millennium after severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2002 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers in 2012 it is highly pathogenic and requires urgent action in the research community 4 mapping research methodology of published original studies and registered clinical trials since the outbreak of pandemic will help researchers in getting a better overview of relevant studies published thus far and how fast the research community has responded to the new health threat immediately following the outbreakthis study aimed to identify and classify published original research studies preprint articles and registered clinical trials regarding the sars-cov-2 and covid-19 from december 1 2019 until marchapril 2020 the period which would correspond to the first months following the outbreak we did not

participants was specified in the majority the minimal age of participants was 18 years n  532 72 table 3 in 663 trials information about the maximum age of participants was provided in about a third of them n  197 30 it was specified that there was no upper age limit table 3 in 921 protocols there was information about the inclusion of participants based on sex the majority n  892 97 reported they will include both men and women table 3the majority of registered trials were described as interventional n  535 58 followed by descriptor observational n  322 35 table 3 among registered trials there were even 7 that were described as basic science table 3the median number of planned study participants was 140 range above zero 1 to 15000000 for eight protocols the planned number of participants in the who ictrp data was zero we checked web sites of all those protocols and found that five of them were from clinicaltrialsgov where they were labeled as withdrawn the remaining three were from chictr whereas one had information about the number of patients in the wrong field but the remaining two did not have any explanation for zero number of patientsfive protocols did not have any information about the number of participants two were canceled protocols from chictr two were protocols labeled as expanded access status in clinicaltrialsgov and we were unable to verify the fifth because the web link was not functional in interventional studies the median number of planned participants was 108 range from 1 to 55000 while in the observational median was 200 range from 8 to 15000000 three protocols reported that the planned number of participants was higher than one millionin 825 registrations the location where the trial will be conducted was reported only 20 24 reported that the trial will be conducted in more than one country most of the trials for which it was reported they will be conducted in a single location were located in china n  522 63 followed by the united states n  33 4 table 3in 535 trial protocols described as interventional 532 99 provided information about the primary outcome most of the protocols n  260 49 had multiple primary outcomes that were not described as composite in studies with a single or composite primary outcome n  272 highly heterogeneous primary outcomes were used details about registered trials are available on osf httpsosfiodzvxc few outcomes were used more commonly the most commonly used outcome was time to recovery used in 40 15 protocols and phrased differently such as time to clinical recovery time to clinical improvement time to disease recovery time to remission clinical recovery time etc the second most common outcome was mortality found in 23 84 protocols with a single or composite primary outcome described variously as mortality all-cause mortality in-hospital mortality or mortality at certain time points 28 days 30 days 60 daysin registered trials of interventions various heterogeneous interventions were tested the most frequently studied interventions were hydroxychloroquine n  39 72 and chloroquine n  16 3 table 3the research community has responded swiftly to covid-19 in terms of scholarly dissemination output the earliest date of onset of covid-19 symptoms was reported as december 1 2020 10 and december 8 2019 11 our study shows that within about 3 months since the earliest reported date of onset of symptoms more than two thousand articles were published in scholarly journals a quarter of which had original data within 4 months from the public announcement 11 about the new disease 1100 preprint articles were published and almost 1000 clinical trials registeredthe majority of studies came from china which is understandable as the disease originated there thus chinese scientists had a head start in exploring the disease the majority of the first studies with original data that were published in scholarly journals had observational study design which is understandable as interventional studies usually take more time to be completed however the research community has responded rapidly with designing and registering clinical trials on covid-19even though the majority of journal articles with original data were published in english a quarter was published in the chinese language this is concerning because those manuscripts may likely have valuable data but they will be difficult to read and access by an audience that does not speak chinese furthermore this may prove challenging for conducting evidence syntheses if the authors conducting systematic reviews and similar studies are unable to access or translate studies published in chinese those studies may not be included in evidence syntheses thus contributing to biased evidence syntheses some authors of evidence syntheses deliberately upfront exclude articles published in languages other than english 12 our results indicate that this may not be advisable in the evidence syntheses about covid-19the median jif of published articles was 5099 which is rather high it indicates that early articles were published in many high-impact journals even if they described case reports or case series because of the novelty of the disease it is likely that those journals were also able to accommodate submissions about covid-19 quickly and organize rapid peer-review and that those were journals with short turnaround times journals with professional staff would be in a better position to adapt quickly to publishing novel topic of interest compared to journals depending on volunteer staffwhile the majority of early articles about covid-19 in scholarly journals were observational mostly case reports the predominant type of early articles about covid-19 articles published on preprint servers included modeling studies this might be early view of studies that will be soon published in peer-reviewed journals but it remains to be seen how many of those preprint articles will actually pass the scrutiny of peer-review it is possible that the massive production of modeling studies is leading to difficulties with publishing them and that authors post those studies on a preprint server to make their work publicly available a large number of articles on preprint servers that we analyzed could be due to calls for authors to make their work publicly available in preprint servers along with submitting articles to peer-reviewed scholarly journals there were even suggestions that submission to a preprint should be the default for all submissions 13the majority of registered trials we analyzed were registered in the chinese registry of clinical trials which is contrary to the report that clinicaltrialsgov contains most of the global trial registrations 14 also the overwhelming majority of registered trials we analyzed were conducted in chinaalthough the aim of this study was not an in-depth analysis of outcomes and interventions that were used in registered trials about covid-19 our analysis of those trials indicates both the novelty of the disease as well as methodological shortcomings for example the majority of registered trials of interventions specified more than one primary outcome a clinical trial should have one primary outcome or a combination of co-primary outcomes but not multiple primary outcomes because primary outcomes are the basis for a sample size estimation primary outcomes and outcome measures were very different outcomes used in these trials should be used for informing the development of a core outcome set cos for covid-19 it is possible that trialists used multiple primary outcomes that were treated as exploratory due to the early phase of the pandemicvarious initiatives were already set up to start defining a cos for covid-19 at least one article about cos-covid has already been published 15 and multiple initiatives for developing cos for covid-19 were registered on the web site of the comet core outcome measures in effectiveness trials initiative 16many trials mentioned standard therapy or conventional therapy and it would be interesting to further investigate what is considered a standard or conventional therapy for a completely new disease with no approved interventions by regulatory agencies furthermore more than 10 of analyzed registered intervention trials were testing hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine therapies that have been suggested as effective for covid-19 and that have raised controversies 17accumulation of evidence on covid-19 is not without challenges there are particular methodological challenges related to analyzing covid-19 data during the pandemic 18 a major challenge is also timely evidence synthesis of the rapidly accumulating data and methodological sacrifices that are being made along the way multiple evidence synthesis organizations are now offering evidence collections investing duplicate effort into similar activities 19 overview of systematic reviews published until march 24 indicated that the majority of systematic reviews on covid-19 available by that date were of critically low methodological quality 20 hopefully research collaborations will be set up to reduce the multiplication of effort in terms of synthesizing and appraising covid-19 evidence 19early initiatives are evolving and improving along the way we used who collection of evidence on covid-19 and among the excluded studies there were 4 that were not published in scholarly journals instead they were published on a preprint server chemrxiv similarly we have used classification of eppi-centre for categorizing analyzed articles into thematic areas along the way we noticed that the number of articles in their collection had decreased indicating that they are likely better in curating their content in the living map of evidence 6in future studies it would be worthwhile to continue exploring the growth and characteristics of further studies regarding covid-19 to analyze how many of the preprint articles will be published in peer-reviewed journals and how many registered trials will be completed the resolution of the covid-19 pandemic is difficult to predict and this may hinder plans for clinical trials for countries that may be very successful in their lockdown and quarantine efforts reduction of the number of infected and diseased patients may prevent the completion of registered clinical trials thus it would be interesting to monitor how many of the registered trials will be terminated prematurely or will not even beginhowever in comparison to the past coronavirus epidemics sars-cov and mers-cov the scientific community appears to be much more involved we were unable to find bibliometric studies comparable to ours about the volume of research considering sars and mers but the simple pubmed search reveals that researchers were much less productive even in the first year after sars-cov and mers-cov first emerged namely the number of articles from november 1 2002 to november 1 2003 and from april 1 2012 to april 1 2013 was 611 and 561 respectivelya limitation of our study is a different search date for the three sources of information we analyzed however these sources have major differences in the export functionalities and amounttype of data they provide and that need to be screened or analyzed our analysis of articles published in journal articles took longer time compared to the analysis of preprint articles and registered trials because we needed to conduct screening and analysis about whether those articles contained original data a quarter of those articles were published in chinese and many of those articles were difficult to retrieve from chinese journals we are aware that with the ongoing covid-19 pandemic research output is fast increasing but we aimed to analyze early research output published between 3 and 4 months from the emergence of the new diseasefurthermore we did not analyse whether perhaps multiple publications referred to the same dataset also for the translation of non-english articles we used google translate as it has been shown in 2019 that this tool can be trusted for data extraction in evidence synthesis 7 one persian article was additionally clarified through consultation with a native speaker other languages that are not english were easily translated using google translateearly articles on covid-19 were predominantly retrospective case reports and modelling studies many clinical trials about covid-19 were registered but it remains to be seen whether they will be completed due to unpredictable development of the pandemic and changes in the number of infected individuals diversity of outcomes used in intervention trial protocols indicates the urgent need for defining a core outcome set for covid-19 research chinese scholars had a head start in reporting about the new disease but publishing articles in chinese may limit their global reach mapping publications with original data can help finding gaps that will help us respond better to the new public health emergencycoronaviruses covs are enveloped viruses with a single-stranded positive-sense rna genome they belong to the family coronaviridae and they are found in a wide variety of animals in which they can cause respiratory hepatic enteric and neurological diseases of varying severity weiss and navas-martin 2005 woo et al 2006 covs are separated into four distinct genera based on genotypic and serological characterization alpha-cov beta-cov gamma-cov and delta-cov su et al 2016 to date several enteric covs that are attributed to diarrhea in swine have been identified and have caused substantial economic losses transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv belong to alpha-cov and both of them cause life-threatening acute enteric disease in suckling piglets pensaert and de bouck 1978 zhang et al 2017 porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus phev is a beta-cov that primarily affects pigs under 3 weeks of age pensaert and callebaut 1974 rho et al 2011 porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov is a newly identified enteric coronavirus in swine and belongs to delta-cov wang et al 2014a the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and the identification of sars-cov-like viruses from wild animals in china have boosted interest in the discovery of novel covs in both humans and animals for example human coronaviruses nl63 and hku1 were discovered in 2004 and 2005 respectively and mers-cov emerged in 2012 fouchier et al 2004 woo et al 2005 zaki et al 2012 for animal covs sars-cov-like viruses and bat-cov-hku2 were discovered in horseshoe bats novel delta-covs in birds and swine and additional novel covs in bats and other animals chu et al 2008 dong et al 2007 lau et al 2005 2007 wang et al 2014b woo et al 2012 recently a novel bat-hku2-like coronavirus that can cause diarrhea in suckling piglets was discovered in swine by two research groups in china gong et al 2017 pan et al 2017 this novel enteric coronavirus shares high nucleotide identities approximately 95 with the reported bat-hku2 strains at the full genome level and is tentatively named porcine enteric alphacoronavirus peav gong et al 2017in this retrospective study we report the identification of this newly emerged peav from a pig farm in guangdong province china which outbreaks of severe diarrhea in suckling piglets in march 2017 we analyzed and described the genome characteristic of this novel peav systematically and the phylogenetic relationship of this virus with other groups of covs bayesian analysis was also conducted to address the origin and evolutionary history of peav and our results indicate that peav emerged approximately 91 years ago and may have circulated in swine herds for several decadesin march 2017 an acute diarrheal outbreak of newborn-piglet diarrhea occurred in a commercial pig farm in guangdong province china the clinical manifestations included vomiting acute watery diarrhea and dehydration in ill suckling piglets small intestinal and fecal samples were collected from ill pigs and submitted to the animal disease detection diagnosis center of southern china agricultural university for pathogen detection the small intestinal samples were homogenized with phosphate-buffered saline pbs 01 m ph 74 and subsequently centrifuged at 10000 g for 10 min at 4 c the fecal samples were resuspended with pbs and centrifuged as described above both supernatants were collected for rna extraction using a takara minibest universal rna extraction kit takara dalian china and first-strand cdna was synthesized using a primescript 1st strand cdna synthesis kit takara dalian china following the manufacturers instructions pcr was used for the detection of common enteric viral pathogens as previously described including pedv tgev pdcov and porcine group a rotaviruses rvas amimo et al 2013 kim et al 2000 liu and wang 2016 song et al 2015 however all samples were negative for pedv tgev pdcov and rvas subsequently we suspected peav infection and conducted a retrospective study of these samples after the report of peav in guangdong gong et al 2017a pair of primers forward 5-ttttggttcttacgggctgtt-3 reverse 5-caaactgtacgctggtcaact-3 based on rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene of a known bat-hku2 strain ef203065 was designed for peav detection after peav was detected 18 pairs of primers were designed based on the bat-hku2 genome to amplify the full genome these primer sequences are available on request and the pcr-amplified products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 15 agarose gels and purified using a minibest dna extraction kit takara dalian china the purified pcr product was cloned into the pmd18-t takara dalian china vector for sequencing sequences of fragments were assembled using the dnastar program to produce the final viral genome sequence and used for further analysisthe complete genome sequence of peav and the deduced amino acid sequences of the open reading frames orfs were compared to those of other known covs as previously reported woo et al 2012 multiple sequence alignments were performed by mafft and a phylogenetic tree based on the full-length genome nucleotide sequences of peav and of other representative covs was constructed using the neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates in mega 50 tamura et al 2011 consideration the extensive divergence between the nucleotide sequences of different coronavirus genera phylogenetic trees for the orf1ab rdrp s m and n proteins were also constructed based on the corresponding amino acid sequences bootscan analysis was also performed to detect if a potential recombination event occurred for peav using simplot 351 with the genome sequence of peav as the query prediction of transmembrane domains was performed using tmhmm httpwwwcbsdtudkservicestmhmmthe bayesian markov chain monte carlo mcmc method was used to infer the divergence time of peav with other members of covs in beast 183 as described previously drummond and rambaut 2007 fu et al 2018 woo et al 2012 specifically analyses were performed under the gtr  i   nucleotide substitution model for the rdrp gene 2781 bp and using an unrelaxed lognormal distribution molecular clock with a constant size model the mcmc algorithm was run for a 100 million step chain and sampled every 10000 states and 10 of the chain was removed as burn-in the maximum clade credibility mcc tree was inferred by the tree annotator program included in the beast package the mean time of the most recent common ancestor tmrca and the highest posterior density hpd regions at 95 were calculated in tracer 16 and posterior probability values provided an assessment of the degree of support for the key node of the tree the nucleotide substitution rate per site per year for coronaviruses was also estimated in this analysisall samples were negative for rt-pcr detection of common enteric viruses including pedv tgev pdcov and rvas subsequently a newly emerged peav that can cause diarrhea in suckling piglets was reported in guangdong china gong et al 2017 we suspected peav infection and conducted a retrospective study of these samples considering the high nucleotide identities approximately 95 of peav with reported bat-hku2 strains gong et al 2017 we designed a pair of primers based on rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene of a known bat-hku2 strain for peav detection to our surprise an expected 750 bp fragment was amplified from all samples and the pcr products were further sequenced the sequences of the pcr products were subjected to blast searches in the genbank database showed the highest identity to bat-hku2 strains approximately 97 and corresponded to nucleotide positions 1283713570 in the bat-hku2 genome the full-length genome of peav was finally obtained by segment amplification and named peav-gd-ch2017 mg742313the genomic structure of peav is organized with the same gene order as that of bat-hku2 namely 5-orf1a1b orf1ab-s-orf3-e-m-n-ns7a-3 fig 1
 and the genome sequence length of peav-gd-ch2017 is 27155 nt excluding the poly a tail which is similar to previous reports gong et al 2017 pan et al 2017 the g  c content of peav ranges from 3934 to 3941 table 1
 and the genome nucleotide identities of peav-gd-ch2017 with peav-gds04 mf167434 and peav-gd-01mf370205 are 997 and 998 respectively all three known peav strains are most identical to bat-hku2 and btrf-alphacovyn2012 with approximately 950 and 875 nucleotide identities respectively in addition comparison of the genomic features of peav and of other coronaviruses and the amino acid identities between the predicted orf1ab rdrp s e m and n proteins of peav and the corresponding proteins of other coronaviruses are summarized in table 1 notably most of these peav proteins share higher identities to alpha-covs group b than the other three groups of coronaviruses except the s protein which shares only approximately 25 amino acid identity to that of alpha-covs table 1 the putative transcription regulatory sequence trs motif 5-aacuaaa-3 precedes each orf of peav table 2
 and has the same trs sequence as bat-hku2 and hcov-nl63 lau et al 2007 pyrc et al 2004 the coding potential and putative trs sequence for each orf of peav are summarized in table 2 similar to bat-hku2 one orf was observed between the s and e genes which encodes a putative 229-amino acid nonstructural protein ns3 lau et al 2007 the ns3 protein of peav shares 94 amino acid identity to that of bat-hku2 but only 42 and 35 identities to those of hcov-nl63 and pedv respectivelythe s protein is the main determinant during coronavirus infection as it possesses both receptor-binding and fusion functions it is also the crucial determinant of tissue tropism and host range millet and whittaker 2015 however the s protein of peav is very unique similar to that of bat-hku2 because the amino acid identities to the s proteins of all known coronaviruses are lower than 28 we systematically analyzed the s protein of peav and compared it with those of other coronaviruses the s protein of peav contains 1130 amino acid residues and the insertion of two amino acid residues serine and isoleucine at positions 12 and 13 was observed compared to that of bat-hku2 two putative cleavage sites s1s2 vrrmtfe and s2 esrsaiedllf were found at positions 546 and 673 in the s protein of peav respectively fig 1 interestingly the arginine at cleavage site s2 is conserved in the s proteins of almost all four genera of coronaviruses and this cleavage site have a remarkably conserved motif e-d-l-l-f in contrast the arginine position 545 at cleavage sites s1s2 is conserved in s proteins from several beta-covs table s1 the peav s protein is predicted to have a transmembrane domain from positions 1069 to 1091 followed by a short cytoplasmic tail endodomain which contains conserved cysteine residues fig 1 pairwise comparison of the amino acid sequences of s proteins of peav and bat-hku2 revealed more mutations at the s1 subunit 122 mutations than the s2 subunit 26 mutations particularly in the ntd amino-terminal domain which may be related to tissue tropism and host range changes and may result in interspecies transmission from bat to swinephylogenetic analysis was conducted to address the evolutionary relationship and the potential recombination of peav with other coronaviruses based on the nucleotide sequences of the whole genome and the amino acid sequences of orf1ab rdrp s m and n proteins respectively fig 2 fig 3 obviously all peav strains cluster with bat-hku2 and btrf-alphacovyn2012 and form a distinct lineage defined as hku2-like not shown in the tree closely related to other alpha-covs that belong to group 1b based on the whole genome level fig 2 the same result can also be observed from the phylogenetic tree that was constructed based on the amino acid sequences of orf1ab rdrp m and n proteins fig 3 however the evolutionary relationship of peav exhibited a uniform feature when phylogenetic analysis was conducted based on the s protein all peav strains cluster with bat-hku2 and btrf-alphacovyn2012 along with a newly identified rat-cov lrnv these strains form a distinct lineage and cluster with beta-cov but are separate from all four known subgroups of beta-covs we defined this distinct lineage as the beta-like group fig 3 these results are consistent with identical amino acid analysis and with those of a previous report pan et al 2017 we also conducted recombination analysis to evaluate if recombination has occurred in the peav genome especially in the s gene but no significant single recombination event was observed when the genome sequence of peav was used as the query fig s1 additionally recombination was not observed in bat-hku2 and lrnv genomes in previous studies lau et al 2007 wang et al 2015 noteworthy another large difference between peav and bat-hku2 is in n protein it shows distant phylogenetic relationship comparing with analysis of orf1ab rdrp e and m protein fig 3 which is consistent with analysis of amino acid identity table 1 22 amino acid mutations were found during pairwise comparison of the amino acid sequences of n proteins of peav and bat-hku2 and most mutations located in carboxyl terminal however n protein is highly conserved among different peav strains
because the rdrp gene is the most conserved gene between all coronaviruses the rdrp gene was used for bayesian analysis to address the divergence time and evolutionary history of peav in this study the mcc tree constructed based on the rdrp gene has a topology similar to that of the phylogenetic tree that was constructed based on the whole genome and the rdrp protein with high posterior probability values supporting each key node and the mean tmrca was estimated with 95 hpd values fig 4
 based on our analysis the mean tmrca of bovine-cov and hcov-oc43 was estimated at 1914 95 hpd 1841 to 1981 and the mean tmrca of human and civet sarsr-cov was estimated at 2001 95 hpd 1998 to 2003 in addition the divergence time between hku15 and pdcov was estimated at 1986 95 hpd 1970 to 1994 all of these results are highly consistent with those of previous studies lau et al 2010 vijgen et al 2005 woo et al 2017 and indicate that our bayesian analysis is unbiased the mean tmrca of peav and bat-hku2 was estimated at 1926 95 hpd 1864 to 1984 approximately 91 years ago which indicates that peav is not newly emerged and may have circulated in swine herds for several decades since its interspecies transmission from bat to swine peav clusters with bat-hku2 these coronaviruses have a common ancestor with another bat-cov btrf-alphacovyn2012 and the divergence time between them was estimated at 1783 95 hpd 1620 to 1943 all of these bat-hku2-like coronaviruses are closely related to hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 and emerged at approximately 277 95 hpd 931 bc to 1434 in addition the tmrca for alpha-cov beta-cov and gamma-cov were also estimated in our analysis at approximately 827 bc 95 hpd 2626 bc to 1042 1419 bc 95 hpd 3561 bc to 867 and 977 bc 95 hpd 3313 bc to 1090 respectively in addition the tmrca for all coronaviruses was estimated at 3914 bc 95 hpd 8637 bc to 45 bc approximately 6000 years ago which indicates that coronaviruses have had a very long evolutionary history since their emergence the mean evolutionary rate of covs was estimated to be 193  104 95 hpd 127  104 to 357  104 nucleotide substitutions per site per year for the rdrp gene based on bayesian analysis which is consistent with the results of a previous report woo et al 2012for the origin of peav we conjecture that the interspecies transmission of bat-hku2 from bat to swine occurred approximately 90 years ago as wild boars have been reported as reservoirs for various pathogens and can transmit these pathogens into domestic swine such as porcine circovirus type 2 pcv2 classical swine fever virus csfv and hepatitis e virus hev adlhoch et al 2009 firth et al 2009 goller et al 2016 but whether wild boars plays an important role during the interspecies transmission of bat-hku2 needs to further investigatecoronaviruses are important pathogens that have a wide host range and cause different kinds of diseases in a variety of animals many novel coronaviruses have been identified in both humans and animals since the outbreak of sars in 2003 fouchier et al 2004 lau et al 2005 2007 wang et al 2014b woo et al 2005 2012 zaki et al 2012 several enteric coronaviruses that can cause diarrhea in swine have been identified and have circulated in swine herds for a long time pedv tgev and phev are examples of these viruses pensaert and de bouck 1978 rho et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 in particular large-scale outbreaks of pedv in china and the usa with high rates of illness and death in suckling piglets caused substantial economic losses in late 2010 and 2013 respectively huang et al 2013 wang et al 2013a newly enteric coronavirus pdcov was identified in the usa in 2014 and this coronavirus caused clinical signs in swine similar to those of pedv wang et al 2014a in this study a novel peav peav-gd-ch2017 strain was identified from suckling piglets with diarrhea and this strain shares high identities with the other two peav strains that were previously reported gong et al 2017 pan et al 2017 these novel peavs are most identical to bat-hku2 with 95 nucleotide identity and have the same genome organization and trs motif for each orf the greatest difference between peav and bat-hku2 is their s proteins which share 85 amino acid identity each other a value much lower compared with those of other proteins table 1 this difference is caused by amino acid mutations in the s protein particularly in the ntd in the s1 subunit which has been proven to be the key factor determining issue tropism and the host range of coronaviruses lu et al 2015 in addition to its low amino acid identity with the s protein of hku2-like coronavirus it shares low amino acid identity lower than 28 with s proteins of all known coronaviruses thus clarifying the origin of the s proteins of peav and hku2-like coronavirus is important for determining the origin and evolutionary history of these coronaviruses a previous study showed that the extreme ntd in the s1 subunit of peav is structurally similar to that of nl63 while the rest of the s1 subunit is structurally similar to that of mhv pan et al 2017 in addition a short peptide in the s protein of bat-hku2 was found to be homologous to a corresponding peptide within the receptor-binding motif rbm in the s1 subunit of sars-cov lau et al 2007 we also analyzed the arginine position 545 at cleavage sites s1s2 of peav and found that it is conserved in several beta-covs in this study moreover the phylogenetic tree based on the s protein presents a uniform evolutionary relationship these bat-hku2-like coronaviruses cluster with a newly identified rat-cov lrnv which represents a novel species of coronaviruses all of these strains form a distinct lineage and cluster with beta-covs but are separate from all four known subgroups of beta-covs fig 3 which may indicate that these strains are part of a novel subgroup of beta-covs these results suggest that peav and hku2-like coronaviruses may have some relations with beta-covs and most likely resulted from recombination with the backbone of alpha-cov and the s gene from an unrecognized beta-cov another large difference between peav and bat-hku2 is n protein which share about 939 amino acid identity as n protein is a multifunctional protein for coronaviruses which is involving in virus replication budding and pathogenesis et al mcbride et al 2014 while the role of these mutations in n protein between peav and bat-hku2 should further investigatethe origin and emergence time of a newly emerged pathogen are important issues to answer to determine the evolutionary history and plan methods of prevention for these new pathogens for example previous sars research reported that the interspecies transfer of sars-like coronaviruses from bats to the amplifying host eg civet occurred in 1998 and that interspecies transfer from civet to humans occurred in 2002 chinese 2004 hon et al 2008 lau et al 2010 song et al 2005 these results provide insight into the origin and evolutionary history of sars coronavirus the origin and divergence time of other coronaviruses have also been estimated previously the divergence time of bovine-cov and hcov-oc43 could be dated back to the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century and was estimated at 1910 vijgen et al 2006 the tmrca for all pdcov strains was reported at 1991 approximately 24 years before pdcov was identified woo et al 2017 in this study we also addressed the emergence time and evolutionary history of peav and of the other coronaviruses based on the rdrp gene by bayesian analysis in anticipation the mean divergence time of bovine-cov and hcov-oc43 was estimated at 1914 and the mean tmrca of human and civet sarsr-cov was estimated at 2001 in our analysis fig 4 these results are highly consistent with those of a previous report discussed above and further indicate that our analysis is unbiased the emergence time of peav was estimated at 1926 95 hpd 1864 to 1984 based on our analysis which indicates that peav is not newly emerged and may have circulated in swine herds for several decades since interspecies transmission from bat to swine occurred in addition these hku2-like coronaviruses have a common ancestor with hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e and the divergence time was estimated at 277 which indicates that these hku2-like coronaviruses have a long evolutionary history the mean tmrca for alpha-cov beta-cov and gamma-cov as well as those of all coronaviruses estimated in this study were later compared with those of a previous report woo et al 2012 nevertheless the mean tmrca coincides with the regions with 95 hpd to each other the evolutionary rate of different coronaviruses was estimated previously 43  104 substitutions per site per year was estimated for hcov-oc43 vijgen et al 2005 and the mean evolutionary rate for group 1b coronaviruses was estimated to be 3  104 substitutions per site per year pyrc et al 2006 in addition the evolutionary rate for all coronaviruses was estimated to be 13  104 substitutions per site per year woo et al 2012 which is estimated to be 193  104 95 hpd 127  104 to 357  104 nucleotide substitutions per site per year for the rdrp gene in this study and all of these results are comparable to each otherbats and birds are supposed to be the reservoir hosts for coronaviruses in particular bats are the reservoir hosts and gene pools of alpha-covs and beta-covs while birds are the reservoir hosts and gene pools of gamma-covs and delta-covs woo et al 2012 however whether the first coronaviruses occurred in bats or birds is still unknown to date the generally acknowledged evolutionary model for coronaviruses is as follows the ancestor of bat-cov was transmitted to another species of bat and generated alpha-cov and beta-cov interspecies transmission of these bat-covs to other bat species and other mammals then occurred and these coronaviruses are circulating in these hosts similarly the ancestor of bird-cov was transmitted to another species of birds and generated gamma-cov and delta-cov interspecies transmission of these bird-covs to other bird species and accidentally to some mammalian species eg pig and whale then occurred woo et al 2012 bat is also supposed to be the origin of other swine pathogens such as porcine circovirus type 3 pcv3 which was suspected to be generated from the interspecies transmission of bat-associated circovirus from bat to swine fu et al 2018 based on the evolutionary relationship and molecular features of peav and bat-hku2-cov as well as the important role of bat in the ecology of coronaviruses we conjecture that the origin of peav is the result of the interspecies transmission of bat-hku2-cov from bat to swine approximately 90 years agoin summary the novel peav was identified from suckling piglets with diarrhea in southern china and the full-length genome of peav-gd-ch2017 was obtained in this study the genome and s protein features of peav was systematic analyzed as well as the evolutionary relationship of peav with other coronaviruses which indicated peav may recombination with unrecognized beta-cov peav emerged approximately 90 years ago and origin from the interspecies transmission of bat-hku2 from bat to swine and wild boars may plays an important role in this process thus epidemiological investigations of peav should be further conducted in both swine and wild boars to better understand and clarify the origin and evolutionary history of peav importantly considering this infectious coronavirus and its serious clinical implications for suckling piglets pan et al 2017 the development of an effective vaccine for peav is urgently needed for the prevention of this diseasethe following are the supplementary data related to this article

the knowledge around the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is still evolving with the cases increasing globally this novel pathogen is known to cause respiratory infection a spectrum of presentations have been reported ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe lower respiratory tract illness presenting with fever cough and dyspnea that may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and death 1 however this novel coronavirus appears to cause extrapulmonary manifestations and here we report the first case of symmetric polyneuropathy in a patient diagnosed with this novel infectiona 68-year-old woman presented to the emergency department of a referral hospital in tehran iran complaining of persistent non-productive cough fever and myalgia of three-day duration she denied any history of rhinorrhea sore throat dyspnea abdominal pain vomiting or diarrhea she had a medical history of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus end-stage renal disease for which she received hemodialysis three times a week and rheumatoid arthritis she had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting 13 years ago her medications included rosuvastatin 10 mg daily prednisolone 5 mg daily hydroxychloroquine 200 mg daily aspirin 80 mg daily and losartan 50 mg twice a day she was also on a single daily injection of 18 units of lantus insulin glargine for diabetes mellitusvital signs were as follows body temperature 399 celsius blood pressure 14060 mmhg pulse 105 beats per minute respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation 90 on room air lung auscultation revealed mild bilateral rales the remainder of the examination was unremarkable and no weakness or sensory disturbance was noted at that time a chest ct scan was performed which revealed mild bilateral patchy high-density shadows in both lungs fig 1
a considering the clinical presentation of viral pneumonia in a patient at the time of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak she was admitted to the hospital with a high suspicion for sars-cov-2 infection an upper respiratory tract swab tested positive for sars-cov-2 on real-time rt-pcr assays within 48 hours laboratory investigation on admission reflected white blood cells 85  103ul with lymphopenia hemoglobin 115 gdl platelets 175  10 3ul potassium 53 meql sodium 133 meql creatinine 12 mgdl esr 15 and crp 121 mgl her blood sugar level was 400 mgdl at the time of admission hepatic transaminases and bilirubin were within the normal rangeafter admission the patient received supportive care and management of symptoms including oxygen supplementation and compassionate therapy consisting of lopinavirritonavir 400100 twice a day and oseltamivir 30 mg daily as per the iranian interim guidelines for the management of covid-19 at that time 2 other than her routine medications novarapid insulin aspart 4 units three times a day was added to her regimenon day 3 of hospitalization while the patients vital signs remained stable and o2 saturation was 94  breathing room air she started to develop generalized hypotonia in lower extremities there was bilateral weakness on motor examinations and deep tendon reflexes were absent her cranial nerves were normal and other neurological examinations were unremarkable lumbar puncture was performed by a neurologist which failed to yield any csf in two repeated attempts mri of the whole spine nerve conduction velocity ncv and electromyographic emg studies were requested after discussion the neurologist decided to proceed with the administration of methylprednisolone 250 mg iv for possible virus-related immune reaction provided that her blood sugar and electrolytes were controlledon day 6 she started having difficulty breathing and her o2 saturation dropped to 78 as her respiratory status deteriorated gradually a chest ct scan taken at the time demonstrated severe bilateral ground-glass opacities consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards fig 1b she was intubated and mechanically ventilated in response to respiratory distress however she developed cardiac arrest and unfortunately died on the same day after multiple resuscitations attemptsseveral human coronaviruses have been identified and the recent emergence of the sars-cov-2 was announced as being responsible for an ongoing pandemic of covid-19 3 evidence shows that many respiratory viruses including human coronaviruses exhibit extrapulmonary symptoms and remarkably may involve the nervous system and consequently cause a variety of neurological signs and symptoms damage to the nervous system may be the result of direct neural invasion or replication by the virus or indirect virus-induced host immune responses 4the neurotropic tendency of the common human coronavirus has been confirmed with the presence of the virus in csf samples of patients with multiple sclerosis ms through several methods in different studies 5 6 7 8 in addition there have been reports of neurologic manifestations as polyneuropathies caused by emerging human coronaviruses of the twenty-first century a case series presented data of four severe acute respiratory syndrome sars patients who developed polyneuropathy myopathy or both approximately three weeks after the onset of sars with a probable diagnosis of critical-illness polyneuropathy cip andor critical-illness myopathy cim 9 a case of the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov was reported with developing weakness and numbness in lower limbs and inability to walk with a likely diagnosis of critical illness polyneuropathy cip 10 another report of four patients with mers diagnosis exhibited neurological manifestations of encephalitis overlapping with guillain-barr syndrome gbs weakness resulting from extended icu stay or gbs and acute polyneuropathy that resulted from a toxin or infection 11here we present the case of a patient with pneumonia due to sars-cov-2 complicated by symmetric polyneuropathy in such a situation the diagnosis could be suspected by a judicious combination of the clinical and paraclinical findings unfortunately the patient died before a detailed neurologic investigation could be performed and given the lack of such information in our case we considered a few differential diagnoses since no symptoms were present before the development of covid-19 and toxic neuropathy was excluded after a review of all her medications critical illness polyneuropathy cip and guillainbarr syndrome gbs were considered to be the most likely diagnosis cip develops as an acute complication of severe illness and presents with limb and respiratory muscle weakness 12 due to the progressive symmetric muscle weakness and the absence of deep tendon reflexes gbs was also a possible diagnosis although there was a lack of upper limbs involvement it would have developed if the patient lived longer 13a recent review suggested sars-cov-2 neuroinvasive properties to be partially accountable for respiratory failure development 14 further investigation needs to be done regarding the polyneuropathies associated with human coronaviruses and whether the virus directly damages peripheral nerves or factors mediating inflammatory response are responsible for the neural damage awareness of this complication will have an impact on the treatment of the sars-cov-2 related respiratory failure presenting with neuropathythe authors

curation writing - original draft writing - review  editing supervisionin december 2019 there was an outbreak of pneumonia with an unknown cause in wuhan hubei province china with an epidemiological link to the huanan seafood wholesale market a local live animal and seafood market clinical presentations of this disease greatly resembled viral pneumonia through deep sequencing on the lower respiratory tract samples of patients a novel coronavirus named the 2019 novel coronavirus was identified 1 the name of which was then determined as sars-cov-2 this virus has spread to all provinces across china and more than 200 additional countries as of april 11 2020 the epidemic has resulted in 83400 laboratory confirmed cases 3349 of which were fatal in china while there were 1643047 laboratory confirmed cases and 101507 deaths in other countries the global toll of new cases and deaths is still increasing sharplyto effectively control the disease and prevent new spillovers it is critical to identify the animal origin of this newly emerging coronavirus in the wuhan wet market high viral loads were reported in environmental samples however a variety of animals including wildlife were sold in this market and the daily number and species of animals were very dynamic therefore it remains unclear which animals initiated the first infectionscoronaviruses usually cause respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections and are genetically classified into four major genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus the former two genera primarily infect mammals whereas the latter two predominantly infect birds 2 in addition to sars-cov-2 other members of the betacoronavirus genus caused the 2003 sars severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks and the 2012 mers middle east respiratory syndrome outbreaks in humans 3 4 sars-cov and mers-cov are of bat origin but both coronaviruses had an intermediate host palm civets for sars-cov 5 and dromedary camels for mers-cov 6approximately 30000 base pairs in the coronavirus genome code for up to 11 proteins including the surface glycoprotein spike s protein binds to receptors on the host cell which initiates virus infection different coronaviruses can use distinct host receptors due to structural variations in the receptor binding domains of their virus s protein sars-cov uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as one of the main receptors 7 with cd209l as an alternative receptor 8 whereas mers-cov uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 also known as cd26 as the primary receptor a recent study demonstrated that sars-cov-2 uses the sars-cov receptor ace2 for entry and the serine protease tmprss2 for s protein priming 9soon after the release of the sars-cov-2 genome a scientist released a full genome of a coronavirus bat-cov-ratg13 from the bat species rhinolophus affinis which was colonized in yunan province nearly 2000 km away from wuhan bat-cov-ratg13 was 96 identical at the whole genome level to the sars-cov-2 suggesting the sars-cov-2 could be of bat origin 1 however because direct human-bat contact is rare it seems to be more likely that the spillover of sars-cov-2 to humans from an intermediate host rather than directly from bats as was the cases with both sars-cov and mers-covthe goal of this study was to determine the genetic relationship between a coronavirus from two groups of sick pangolins and sars-cov-2 and to assess whether pangolins could be potential intermediate hosts of sars-cov-2in march and july of 2019 we detected betacoronaviruses in three individuals from two sets of smuggled malayan pangolins manis javanica n  27 that were intercepted by guangdong customs 10 all three animals suffered from serious respiratory disease and failed to be rescued by the guangdong wildlife rescue center 10 s1 table through metagenomic sequencing and de novo assembling we recovered 38 contigs ranging from 380 to 3377 nucleotides and the nucleotide sequence identity among the contigs from these three samples were 9954 thus we pooled sequences from three samples and assembled the draft genome of this pangolin origin coronavirus after that gap filling with amplicon sequencing was conducted to obtain a nearly full genome sequence this pangolin-cov-2020 genome genbank no mt121216 was found to be comprised of 29521 nucleotidesstrikingly genomic analyses suggested the pangolin-cov-2020 has a high identity with both sars-cov-2 and bat-cov-ratg13 the proposed origin of sars-cov-2 fig 1a s2 table the nucleotide sequence identity between pangolin-cov-2020 and sars-cov-2 was 9032 whereas the protein sequence identity for individual proteins can be up to 100 table 1 table 2 the nucleotide sequence identity between pangolin-cov-2020 and bat-cov-ratg13 was 9024 while that for the corresponding regions between sars-cov-2 and bat-cov-ratg13 was 9618 table 1 s1 tablethe nucleotide sequence identities among the s protein genes were 9315 between the bat-cov-ratg13 and sars-cov-2 8452 between pangolin-cov-2020 and sars-cov-2 as well as 7343 between pangolin-cov-2020 and sars-cov respectively table 1 further analyses suggested the s gene was relatively more genetically diverse in the s1 region than the s2 region fig 2a s3 table compared with their nucleotide sequences the s proteins of pangolin-cov-2020 and sars-cov-2 were more conserved with a sequence identity of 9018 table 2the receptor binding domains rbd of the s protein were highly conserved between pangolin-cov-2020 and sars-cov-2 the nucleotide and amino acid sequences identity of rbd of s gene between them was highest in comparison with those between pangolin-cov-2020 and other sars-like conronaviruses of 8664 and 9680 table 1 table 2 pangolin-cov-2020 and sars-cov-2 also shared a very conserved receptor binding motif rbm 986 which was more conserved than in bat-cov-ratg13 764 fig 3 these results support that pangolin-cov-2020 and sars-cov-2 share the same angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor further analyses suggested that there was one variation gln498 between the rbm of pangolin-cov-2020 and that of sars-cov-2 but conserved in all other key residues being associated with receptor binding gly482 val483 glu484 gly485 phe486 gln493 leu455 asn501 suggesting a potential binding affinity between pangolin-cov-2020 and human ace2 receptor fig 3on the other hand unlike rbd the nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity of ntd n-terminal domain were only 662 and 631 identical between pangolin-cov-2020 and sars-cov-2 however a loci arg408 from the rbd core of sars-cov-2 could form a hydrogen bond with human ace2 was conserved in pangolin-cov-2020 fig 3 both pangolin-cov-2020 and bat-cov-ratg13 lack an s1s2 cleavage site 680690 aa whereas sars-cov-2 possesses fig 3genomic analyses suggested sequence similarities were not homogeneous across the s genes of pangolin-cov-2020 sars-cov-2 bat-cov-zxc21 and bat-cov-zc45 for example the first s region ie nucleotides 11200 of pangolin-cov-2020 has a higher nucleotide identity to two bat viruses bat-cov-zxc21 and bat-cov-zc45 than sars-cov-2 and bat-cov-ratg13 whereas the remaining s gene of pangolin-cov-2020 is opposite fig 2a these results suggest that a recombination event could have occurred during the evolution of these coronavirusesphylogenetic analyses suggested that the s genes of pangolin-cov-2020 sars-cov-2 and three bat origin coronaviruses bat-cov-ratg13 bat-cov-zxc21 and bat-cov-zc45 were genetically more similar to each other than other viruses in the same family fig 2b the s gene of bat-cov-ratg13 was genetically closer to pangolin-cov-2020 than bat-cov-zxc21 and bat-cov-zc45 similar tree topologies were observed for the encoding orfs of rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene and other genes s1s3 figs at the genomic level sars-cov-2 was also genetically closer to bat-cov-ratg13 than pangolin-cov-2020 fig 1bin this study we assembled the genomes of coronaviruses identified in sick pangolins and our results showed that pangolin-cov-2020 is genetically associated with both sars-cov-2 and a group of bat coronaviruses there is a high sequence identity between pangolin-cov-2020 and sars-cov-2 however phylogenetic analyses and a special amino acid sequence in the s gene of sars-cov-2 did not support the hypothesis of sars-cov-2 arising directly from the pangolin-cov-2020it is of interest that the genomic sequences of coronaviruses detected from two batches of smuggled pangolins intercepted by different customs at different dates were all be associated with bat coronaviruses in addition the genetic identity of coronavirus contigs assembled in each animal was extremely high 9954 the reads from the third pangolin acquired in july 2019 were relatively less abundant than those from the two pangolin samples acquired in march 2019 although it is unclear whether coronaviruses in these two batches of smuggled pangolins had the same origin our results indicated that the pangolins can be a natural host for betacoronaviruses which could be enzootic in pangolinsall three exotic pangolins detected with betacoronaviruses were sick with serious respiratory diseases and failed to be rescued however these pangolins were very stressful in the transportation freight when being intercepted by the customs it is unclear whether this coronavirus is a common virus flora in the respiratory tract of pangolins nevertheless the pathogenesis of this coronavirus in pangolins remains to be elucidatedphylogenetic trees suggested that bat-cov-ratg13 was more genetically close to sars-cov-2 at both individual gene and genomic sequence level compared with the genomic sequence of pangolin-cov-2020 assembled in this study recombination analysis showed that s gene of pangolin-cov-2020 might be constructed by fragment from bat-cov-zc45 or bat-cov-zxc21 and fragment from bat-cov-ratg13 interestingly the cleavage site between s1 and s2 in sars-cov-2 had multiple insertions ie prra compared with those of bat-cov-ratg13 and pangolin-cov-2020 which may result from an additional recombination event a new study reported a novel bat-derived coronavirus rmyn02 identified from a metagenomics analysis of samples from 227 bats collected from the yunnan province in china between may and october of 2019 although rmyn02 showed a relatively low nucleotide sequence identity 933 to sars-cov-2 it had a similar manner of the insertion of multiple amino acids at the junction site of the s1 and s2 subunits of the s protein as sars-cov-2 providing strong evidence that such insertion events can occur in nature 11 thus these data suggest that sars-cov-2 originated from multiple naturally occurring recombination events among viruses present in bats and other wildlife speciesthe s protein of coronaviruses binds to host receptors via rbds and plays an essential role in initiating viral infection and determining host tropism 2 a prior study suggested that sars-cov-2 and sars-cov bind to the same ace2 receptor 9 our analyses showed that pangolin-cov-2020 has a much conserved rbd to these viruses compared to mers-cov suggesting that pangolin-cov is very likely to use ace2 as its receptor as well a comparative analysis of the interaction of the s proteins of coronaviruses with ace2 proteins of humans and pangolins showed that the s proteins of sars-cov-2 and pangolin-cov can potentially recognize ace2 in both humans and pangolins 12 a recent study found that a human ace2-binding ridge in sars-cov-2 rbd takes a more compact conformation compared with the sars-cov rbd moreover several residue changes in sars-cov-2 rbd may also enhance its human ace2-binding affinity 13 the core residues in rbm which may related to higher human ace2-binding affinity than sars-cov are 100 identical between sars-cov-2 and cov-pangolin-2020 therefore pangolin-cov-2020 cov-pangolingd potentially recognizes human ace2 better than the sars-covin addition to rbd ntd is also important in recognizing acetylated sialic acids on glycosylated cell-surface receptors 14 it is reported that sars-cov-2 can bind to human ace2 via the viral ctd the same as rbd but not ntd and that the glycan attached to asn90 from human ace2 forms a hydrogen bond with arg408 from the rbd core 15 this glycan interacting arginine is conserved between sars-cov-2 and pangolin-cov-2 therefore there is structural similarity in glycan binding between sars-cov-2 and pangolin-cov-2020 on the other hand ace2 receptor is present in pangolins with a high sequence conservation with those in the gene homolog in humans however the zoonosis of pangolin-cov-2020 remains unclearthe coronaviruses are shown to have a wide range of hosts and some of them can infect humans 16 thus it is critical to determine the natural reservoir and the host tropisms of these coronaviruses especially their potential of causing zoonosis in the last two decades apart from sars-cov-2 sars and mers have caused serious outbreaks in humans leading to thousands of deaths 3 4 17 18 although these three zoonotic coronaviruses were shown to be of bat origin they seemed to use different intermediate hosts for example farmed palm civets were suggested to be an intermediate host for sars-cov although the details of the link from bats to farmed palm civets remain unclear 1921 most recently dromedary camels in saudi arabia were shown to harbor three different coronaviruses including the dominant mers-cov lineage that was responsible for the outbreaks in the middle east and south korea during 2015 22 although this present study does not support that pangolins would be intermediate hosts for the emergence of sars-cov-2 our results do not exclude the possibility that other covs could be circulating in pangolins thus surveillance of coronaviruses in pangolins could improve our understanding of the spectrum of coronaviruses in pangolins in addition to conservation of wildlife minimizing the exposures of humans to wildlife will be important to reduce the spillover risks coronaviruses from wild animals to humansin summary we suggest that pangolins could be natural hosts of betacoronaviruses with an unknown potential to infect humans however our study does not support that sars-cov-2 evolved directly from the pangolin-covthe study design was approved by the ethics committee for animal experiments at the guangdong institute of applied biological resources reference number giabr20170720 20 july 2017 and followed basic principles outlined by this committeeduring our routine wildlife rescue efforts one of the goals was to identify pathogens causing wildlife diseases in 2019 we were involved in two events of pangolin rescues one involved with 21 smuggling pangolins in march and the second with 6 smuggling pangolins in july although extensive rescue efforts were made the majority of thse pangolins were dead most of the dead pangolins had a swollen lung which contained a frothy liquid and symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis in the minority of these dead ones we observed hepatomegaly and splenomegaly from 11 pangolins failed to be rescued we collected samples from their lung lymph and spleen tissues and subjected for metagenomic analyses coronaviruses were detected in three individuals by mapping clean reads without ribosomes and host sequences to an in-house virus reference dataset separated from the genbank non-redundant nucleotide database using the burrows-wheeler aligner bwa ver 0717 10 23 two of these animals were from the first batch of smuggled malayan pangolins intercepted by meizhou yangjiang and jiangmen customs in march 2019 and the third one was from the second batch in a freight being transported from qingyuan to heyuan in july 2019 the rna samples from these three individuals were subjected to deep sequencingclean reads from each of the three coronavirus positive animals were de novo assembled using megahit v129 24 after examining the high similarity of 9954 among the samples from three animals to maximize the coverage of the virus genome we pooled clean reads and de novo assembled them the assembled contigs were used as references for extracting unmapped reads using salmon v0141 25 and multiple rounds were implemented to maximize the mappinga total of 38 contigs were identified to be highly similar to the sars-cov-2 genome using blastn and tblastx gapfiller v110

breakpoints in coronavirus genomes were detected using simplot v351 30in 1972 a veterinary surgeon in england oldham 1972 wrote a letter to the editor of pig farming supplement entitled how it all began he described the appearance of a new disease on some english swine farms characterized by acute watery diarrhea in feeder pigs fatteners and sows while suckling pigs were not affected the syndrome was called too standing for the other one or also tge2 and both these denominations referred to its clinical similarity to tge a common cause of viral diarrhea in pigs in europe at that time an important difference with tge was however that neonatal pigs were not affected since these denominations were considered unsatisfactory from a scientific point of view the name of the new syndrome was quickly changed to epidemic diarrhea-edthe first ed outbreak occurred on a farm in the spring of 1971 and the second 6 months later at a distance of 2 miles from the former suckling piglets were not affected but pigs of 10 weeks and older and also adults showed an acute diarrhea lasting one week the outbreak lasted 34 weeks on the farm during the autumn of 1971 and also the following winter several new outbreaks were reported a clinical diagnosis and possibility for differentiation from tge was thus based on the high morbidity in fatteners and adult animals in the absence of disease in neonatal and freshly weaned pigs in most of these diarrheal cases tgev was excluded by laboratory examination the fact that ed was observed on farms with a recent history of a tge outbreak and thus in tgev immune animals increased the conviction that tgev was not involved during 1972 ed spread rapidly between pig farms particulary fattening herds mortality was rare and the effect of an outbreak was estimated at about 2 weeks feed costa similar disease pattern was observed during the early seventies in belgium and a rapid spread occurred to neighbouring countries in western europe here also suckling pigs were not affected and remained free of diarrhea even when their mothers suffered from a watery diarrhea during several days some neonatal pig mortality could occur by starvation because the sick mothers often suffered from agalactiaan additional sign observed in belgium and later also reported in gemany but not mentioned in england was that some fatteners were found dead particularly towards the end of the fattening period and this occurred repeatedly in some farms but not in others a mortality rate as high as 3 could be encountered this was not due to dehydration accompanying the diarrhea but animals suddenly died from acute back muscle necrosis while the clinical link with an ed infection was clear the pathogenetic background has never been revealed belgian pigs were highly stress positive at that time and a severe belly ache often observed in adult animals during an outbreak of ed may have been a triggerin general as no baby pig mortality occurred due to the ed agent not very much attention was given to this new diarrheal syndrome and the etiology was not intensively investigated however it was assumed that a viral agent was involved since bacteriological examination of faecal material did not reveal a specific bacterial cause none of the known porcine viruses could be associated and a new virus was therefore suspectedmuch changed in 1976 when wood 1977 from the veterinary investigation centre in norwich england described a new diarrheic syndrome it differed from ed in that it now affected pigs of all ages including neonatal and suckling pigs mortality was variable restricted to young piglets and averaged around 30 this new disease now resembled tge more closely than ed did but tgev was again excluded using direct immunofluorescence on intestines and applying established serological techniques available for detection of anti-tgev antibodies now a differentiation with tge on a clinical basis only became difficult often impossible this new syndrome was called ed2 to differentiate it from the 1971 ed1 where no baby pigs were involved ed2 was economically much more important than ed1ed2 also quickly spread to the european continent and was recognised in belgium in 1977 reports from other countries including the netherlands germany france bulgaria hungary and switzerland followed soon in belgium mortality rates in neonates on breeding farms varied considerably they could be as high as 80 large variation from 30 to 80 and the average was 50 variation in mortality in neonatal pigs was litter bound not explained at that time but also farm bound where it appeared to be associated with farm size still many small family farms at that time farm structure one or several farrowing units number of neonatal pig litters present at the start of the outbreak number of pregnant sows due to farrow within one week of the appearance of disease signs and possibly other factors differences in virulence of virus isolates was not given any attentionthis new evolution to ed2 with the involvement of baby pigs and its larger economic impact yielded better opportunities for collecting material for etiological studies for experimental reproduction of the disease and for the development of virological and serological techniques in 1978 chasey and cartwright 1978 reported the detection of virus like particles and pensaert and debouck 1978 described the isolation of a new coronavirus-like agent cvla from diarrheic pigs with both research groups succeeding in reproducing diarrhea in experimental pigs soon after the isolation of this new coronavirus extensive pathogenesis studies were performed in colostrum deprived pigs with one of the belgian isolates designated coronavirus cv777 isolated in month 7 of 1977 which became the prototype strain for pedv in europe debouck and pensaert 1980 debouck et al 1981 ed2 was soon named porcine epidemic diarrhea ped caused by ped virus pedv a denomination which still stands at presentfrom the early studies with pedv in neonates debouck and pensaert 1980 debouck et al 1981 it was soon clear that the pathogenesis resembled very much that of tgev experience gathered from research with tgev helped much in the approach to study this new enteric disease lack of success to cultivate the virus in cell cultures forced to produce clean virus stocks by oral inoculation of colostrum deprived pigs performing surgery 18 h later and rinsing the in vivo produced virus from the lumen of the infected small intestines during 12 h while keeping the pig in the incubator debouck and pensaert 1980 such clean pig adapted virus stocks served for experimental pig inoculation experiments and to produce an hyperimmune serum for the preparation of a conjugate for an immunofluorescence if conjugate to detect the virus in tissues serological tests were developed to detect antibodies by elisa callebaut et al 1982 and to study possible relationship with other coronaviruses by immuno-electron microscopy pensaert et al 1981 genome analysis of the ped isolates was not available at that timeby immuno-electron microscopy and if pedv was not related to any of the known porcine coronaviruses tgev haemagglutinating encephalo-myelitis virus pensaert et al 1981 some discrete relationship with members of the genus alpha-coronavirus was later demonstrated using other and more sensitive tests the origin of pedv was thus unknown and no potential parent coronavirus could be indicatedan elisa test was soon used for routine serology callebaut et al 1982 a crucial question was whether or not the ed1 agent and ed2pedv were related or whether ed2pedv was totally new infectious material containing the ed1 agent from earlier outbreaks was not available a retrospective serological survey was carried out on sow sera that had been collected in slaughterhouses in belgium starting in 1969 and thus prior to the emergence of ed1 in 1972 on the european continent antibodies to pedv were not found in sera collected in 1969 but were present in 7 of the sows collected in 1971 in 42 of the sows in 1975 and in 32 of the sows in 1980 these results indicated that the coronavirus ped had been responsible for first ed1 outbreaks for the ed2 outbreaks and thus it can be accepted that pedv emerged in 1971 but later widened its host tropism from growing and adult swine towards neonatal pigs this finding was interesting from an evolutionary point of viewthus pedv that presumably started as a cause of diarrhea in 1971 in feeders fatteners and adult swine had suddenly acquired tropism for neonatal pigs and now became a rather devastating disease but even after the emergence of ed2pedv some outbreaks on breeding-finishing farms still did not involve neonatal pigs while it was assumed that both ed1 and pedv were co-circulating in the swine population it is also possible that some farms had experienced an earlier ed1 infection and that immune sows protected their offspring against pedv by lactogenic immunity while groups of fattening pigs had become susceptible it must however be mentioned that cross-protection between ed1 and pedv has never been studied also after a first epidemic phase of the new pedv the virus often persisted on breeding-finishing farms in weaned and feeder pigs endemic ped the sow population was immune protecting its offspring while feeder pigs became susceptible after loosing their maternal protection the highly variable and mixed clinical picture was at that time ascribed to the possible co-circulation of the original ed1 agent and its presumed variant pedv in the population genome analysis was not available and ed1 infectious material is also now no longer available to retrospectively examine this issueed2pedv is likely a variant of ed1 that variants of pedv relatively easy emerge is not unusual as animal coronaviruses are known to easily undergo genetic alterationsrecombination and insertions and deletions have repeatedly been demonstrated in pedv by genome analyses of isolates during more recent outbreaks in asia and in the usa fan et al 2012 li et al 2016 jarvis et al 2016 vlasova et al 2014 oka et al 2014even now 2016 in recent cases of ped in europe varying types of clinical manifestations either with or without affection of neonatal pigs are observed see laterthe question on the origin of pedv and thus of its presumed ancestor ed1 agent in 1971 is unanswered there are no indications for a possible evolution from another known so called parental coronavirus even after comparative studies with the known coronaviruses using detailed genome analyses of different genes including the s gene so far only discrete antigenic relationship involving the n protein but without any cross protection was detected with some of the other animal members of the genus alphacoronavirus such as feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv tgev porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv canine coronavirus ccov and mink coronavirus mcv by the use of monoclonal antibodies to the n proteins of the human alphacoronaviruses nl63 and 229e no cross reactivity was detected with pedv sastre et al 2011 the only alphacoronavirus in which also the m proteins cross reacts with pedv is mcv have et al 1992the nucleotide sequence of the pedv nucleocapsid gene and of typical coronavirus motifs show that pedv within the region of the genome sequenced shows indeed greatest homology to the human 229e tgev prcv fipv ccov and feline enteric coronavirus fecv bridgen et al 1993 it is interesting to mention that similar to pedv several of the other alphacoronaviruses including the human 229e tgev prcv ccov fecv and fipv use the cellular receptor aminopeptidase n apn for virus entry into cells in their host weiss and navas-martin 2005 and this seems to be a common evolutionary characteristic still the genetic and antigenic diversity between pedv and the other alphacoronaviruses is very largealso no cross-reactivity has been reported between pedv and the coronaviruses belonging to the beta gamma or delta generathe genomic data presented above and the use of the same cellular receptor suggest a common origin of some of some of these alphacoronaviruses a carrier-wild animal species as source of the virus as often described with other coronaviruses cannot be excludedsoon after its detection experimental studies in neonatal pigs revealed that target cells of pedv were limited to the epithelium covering the intestinal villi and the pathogenesis was thus highly similar to that of tgev debouck and pensaert 1980 debouck et al 1981 cv777 virus infection in the villous enterocytes in neonatal pigs caused rapid cell desquamation throughout the small intestine within 2436 h after inoculation which was somewhat slower than observed with tgev still the villous atrophy induced by pedv was so abrupt and extensive that rapid and severe dehydration occurred leading to death in neonatal pigs due to this similarity in pathogenesis with tgev much of the scientific knowledge acquired on tge diagnosis immunity prevention could be almost invariably applied to ped an apparent difference with tgev probably of minor importance from a clinical point of view was that epithelial cells on colonic villi were also infected but desquamation was not observed still now it is a question if this colonic site of replication contributes to disease severity ped diarrhea in fatteners and sows is often accompanied by an apparent belly ache a clinical sign not seen with tge and the question arises if the colon infection may contribute to this clinical manifestationresults of pathogenesis studies obtained in caesarean derived colostrum deprived neonatal pigs upon inoculation with the european prototype strain cv777 of the seventies were practically identical to those observed more recently in asia and in the usa epidemics with the so-called original us pedv strains jung et al 2014 stevenson et al 2013 kim and chae 2003a point of debate in the pedv evolution particularly since its occurrence in asia and its emergence the usa is the arising of pedv genetic variants influencing virulence the history in europe here presented allows to assume that ed2pedv was a variant of ed1 which had acquired tropism for intestinal enterocytes in neonatal pigs this new tropism expanded and increased the virus virulence since a vulnerable age became affected and piglets mortality became an important economic aspect of the disease currently two major pedv variants are described in the usa upon routine genome analyses of usa isolates the first also called original us pedv  appears to be highly virulent while the second the so called s-indel strains standing for insertions and deletions in the s gene of the virus are associated with milder clinical outbreaks similar genotypic variants have been detected in asia the s-indels already before 2010 and the highly virulent since 2010 when adopting this genomic identification it appears that cv777 is classified as a s-indel isolate apparently belonging to a different cluster compared to the us indels carvajal et al 2015 considering the pathogenesis and virulence of the european prototype strain cv777 of the seventies as evaluated by the sites and degree of replication and the degree of villous atrophy no real difference exists with the more recent highly virulent original us pedv isolates from the usa for example the pig adapted c777 when experimentally inoculated in neonatal piglets caused villous atrophy with villous length reduction from the normal value of 700900 m to as low as 200300 m throughout the small intestine and within 636 h after the start of the diarrhea debouck et al 1981 coussement et al 1982much depends on how virulence of pedv is determined if virulence of a pedv isolate is considered merely from the point of view of virus-neonatal pig interaction with parameters such as duration of incubation period rapidity and severity of enterocyte desquamation degree and extent of atrophy of villi production of virulent virus quantities and severity of diarrhea then cv777 can be classified as highly virulent despite its identification with s-indel isolatesthat s-indels isolates do not systematically mean low virulence was recently shown in a us study chun-ming et al 2015 in which 4 litters of 34 days old suckling pigs were inoculated with the s-indel iowa 106 strain in the presence of their ped negative mothers the severity of clinical signs and the mortality of the pigs varied between the 4 liters from 0 to 75 severe clinical signs were observed in 2 of the 4 litters two of the 4 sows developed diarrhea it was observed that despite similar background of sows and environment in this experiment the severity of disease was rather variable it appeared that the pigs body weight at birth and the sows health conditions and lactation were influential factors in the same experiment mentioned above chun-ming et al 2015 one litter was also inoculated with an original us pedv strain of high virulence it was concluded that virulence of the s-indel isolate was generally lower based on the longer incubation period the shorter duration of diarrhea more limited regions of virus infection overall lower pig mortality 18 vs 55 for original and some other additional parametersthe sites and extent of the deletions or insertions and the seqence differences in the s gene may play an important role in a recent publication chen et al 2016 the pathogenicity differences between 3 uspedv prototype strains and a s-indel-variant stain were compared in conventional neonatal pigs under experimental infections and enteric disease as evidenced by clinical signsfecal virus shedding gross and histopathological intestinal lesions were significantly lower for the s-indel strainhoweverthe molecular basis for the virulence differences were not elucidatedsince the early beginning in europe it was clear that ped disease can show much variability even in different litters of pigs particularly when suckling their mother such differences and the high variation in pig mortality in different litters from 30 to 80 was an observation also made in the seventies in europe when the first epidemic occurred and the reason was never unravelledeven more variability is experienced when virulence and severity of ped disease is related to the interaction virus-farm population and thus in field outbreaks the result of a ped outbreak will be much more difficult to predict to evaluate and to define since next to possible virulence differences of the isolates and next to variation among litters in suckling pigs many additional factors play a role in determining the clinical outcome of the infection they include immune status of sows dose of virus exposure on the farm herd size and pig farming management and others all of which may be interacting in a different way moreover the procedures applied for intentional infection feed back of the sow population to speed up the induction of immunity to be passively transfered to the litter could be considered as a potential cause of worsening of the clinical status of the suckling pigs in fact that practice can also be a source of other pathogens for giltssows andor for newborn piglets it is thus possible that particularly in a fully susceptible pig population and even with pedv strains of similar virulence the mortality rates and losses are much higher in some continents or regions or farms with extensive and highly industrialised pig farming the overall health status of the population apparently also plays an important rolewhile genomic changes surely will occur in ped virus isolates it is advised to be careful when associating them with virulence changes when a different clinical picture is observed on farms it is often too hastily concluded that variants with varying virulence have arisen based on genome analysis only and without testing for virulence factors in experimental pigswhile genome analysis is certainly useful and may be directional repeated comparative animal inoculation experiments with so called new isolates clinically denominated as candidate virulence-variants need to be carried out in a standardized way before solid conclusions about virulence are made this is indicated by the large variations very often observed with one and the same isolate the neonatal non suckling pig preferably colostrum deprived is reliable and even essential for this purpose parameters as duration of incubation period a timewise follow up of site and degree of villous affection in the small intestine are needed and must be repeated before calling a pedv isolate a variant with impact on virulence it should be stressed that pig adapted virus strains should be used as it is known that major genomic modifications can arise when pedv is cell culture passaged as well in porcine as in non-porcine cells such as in vero cellsthe epidemiology of ped in europe has been and still is quite puzzling pedv outbreaks in the late seventies and early eighties occurred both on breeding and fattening swine farms acute outbreaks with neonatal pig mortality were encountered in the breeding-fattening farms which became infected for the first time pedv often became endemic in farrowing-finishing farms successive groups of pigs became infected upon weaning and after losing their lactogenic protection from their immune mothers so that the virus could persist whether the virus persisted or not after the original outbreak was somewhat unpredictable as it could also disappear from the farm the farm size number of sows and its structure number of units played a role also ped persistence regularly occurred in fattening farms using the system of continuous introduction of feeder pigs originating from numerous and different breeders a typical case of persistent diarrhea caused by pedv lasting 10 months on a breeding-finishing farm was described in the netherlands pijpers et al1993 and this was a feature regularly observed in europe in the eighties recent experience in the usa 20132015 has shown that management practices adopted in the epidemic phase of the infection can turn ped to a endemicenzootic and long lasting form jung and saif 2015pedv infections were a regular cause associated with viral diarrheal picture in weaned and feeder pigs in a serological study in belgium in 1986 pedv was associated with diarrhea in 13 out of 16 groups of feeder pigs after arrival in fattening farms callebaut et al 1986but the virus remained prevalent in the swine populations of western europe during the eighties a serosurvey in belgian sows using sera collected in slaughterhouses and thus mostly originating from different farms showed pedv antibodies 32 in 1980 and 19 in 1984 similar percentages of sows were positive in germany on 3 regional locations france spain the netherlands and bulgaria while no antibodies were found in scandinavia northern ireland usa or australia debouck et al 1982 in 1982 antibodies were detected in sera received from taiwan the first evidence of the presence of pedv in asiaas the eighties advanced fewer outbreaks on breeding farms were seen even though the virus was still detected but the general economic impact of ped had become lower in belgium in 1992 17 groups of feeder pigs from 15 commercial finishing herds using the all in-all out production system were examined for serocoversion to pedv and tgev none of the groups seroconverted to tgev while 7 seroconverted to pedv with diarrhea observed in all 7 van reeth and pensaert 1994 in an hungarian study published in 1996 55 of 92 faecal samples from weaned pigs with diarrhea tested positively for pedv nagy et al 1996during the nineties an acute ped outbreak which was described in spain involving a fattening unit of 5000 pigs with diarrhea starting in 79 weeks old pigs in one barn affecting pigs from 20 to 90 kg and subsequently spreading to the other barns carvajal et al 1995 an isolated outbreak was described in 1998 in england in a large finishing herd where weaners were brought in over a 2 month period and positive sows were found in the breeding herds supplying the weaners pritchard et al 1999 but no further epidemic of ped occurred despite a very low pedv seroprevalence as only 19 of fatteners from 64 different finishing units were positive for antibodies to pedvmay 1996january 1997interest from a disease and economic point of view became very low in europe and no further research was performed on ped practically no serosurveys were carried out a serological survey in sows from farrow to finish herds carried out in belgium in 1996 revealed that gilts were positive for pedv antibodies in only 2 of the 144 considered farms and in 1997 72 fattening farms were examined for pev antibodies and none were positive pensaert unpublishedit appeared that pedv except for a focal case was disappearing from the european swine population towards the turn of the century for this reason no attention or follow up was given anymore to this viral infection while its field of interest had fully moved to asiahowever a somewhat atypical ped outbreak occurred unexpectedly in the po valley in northern italy in 2006 martelli et al 2008 it occurred between may 2005 and june 2006 in an area densely populated with pigs the outbreak started with four cases occurring in fattening farms from may to july no clinical cases were detected during august and september in october two new cases appeared the first in a fattening unit and the second in the nursery of a three-site production unit the disease spread during the winter of 20052006 affecting more than 60 farms including fattening units as well as farrow-to-finish or farrow-to-weaner farms some pedv positive farms were still detected between mid-2006 and the end of 2007 but the disease progressively disappeared sozzi et al 2014 from 20082014 only sporadic outbreaks were observed in grower and finisher herds efsa 2014 this epidemic in italy in 20062007 inclined us to forecast a new episode of ped epidemics in europe but it did not occurrecently and due to an increased attention following the 2013 epidemic in the usa single or limited ped outbreaks have sporadically been diagnosed in europe one case in ukraine dastjerdi et al 2015 occurred in a 5000-sow farm 240 farrowings a week and mortality in pigs less than 10 days old approached 100 the virus was closely related to original us strains reported form north america sequence identity of 998isolates from other cases reported from belgium theuns et al 2015 holland van der wolf et al 2015 france grasland et al 2015 germany stadler et al 2015 hanke et al 2015 and portugal mesquita et al 2015 and italy alborali et al 2014 were on the basis of genetic sequence closely related to each other when sequenced they were classified as s-indel strains and the german isolate showed 994 identity to the oh851 strain isolated in the usa in january 2014 vlasova et al 2014 the size and clinical disease in these outbreaks were very variable the outbreak involved in belgium 1 fattening farm no mortality in france 1 farrow to finish farm mortality 12 in pigs at one week and 25 at weaning in germany 4 farms 2 fattening with 15 and 2 mortality 2 breeding with 70 and no mortality respectively and in portugal where it started in one farm with pig mortality but not further defined and where the virus spread to 43 other pig farms during a period of 3 months from these data it can be seen that again there was much and unexplained variation in ped clinical disease and outcome except for the possibility of the outbreak in ukraine it is very doubtful that the other european isolates have anything to do with those involved in the us epidemic similar focal cases must have occurred in europe before the us outbreak but were most likely neither recognized nor diagnosed nor reported as ped s-indel strains have been present in europe as cv777 appears to be the earliest known representative carvajal et al 2015it is remarkable that in many european countries no large epidemic occurred despite several indications that the breeding population in their densely populated swine raising regions is negative for antibodies to pedv and thus presumably fully susceptibleit is difficult to understand why a virus such as pedv has gradually regressed in the swine population in europe in the absence of any special control measures vaccination has not been applied and no control programmes have been installed the puzzling aspect is that during the last decennia pedv was and still is focally present in europe and did not cause an epidemic despite the high numbers of susceptible-seronegative farms and despite the very dense swine populations in some regionsone would expect that a virus such as pedv which replicates to very high titers in swine and which can easily and rapidly spread from one swine farm to another would be able to maintain itself in the swine population as previously explained once an outbreak has occurred on a breeding farm pedv virus could persist easily when successive litters of pigs after losing their lactogenic protection at weaning become a susceptible target for infection in fact persistence for a virus such as pedv would be almost as a natural feature similar to the endemic character observed with other porcine enzootic enteric viruses such as swine rotaviruses swine enteroviruses and others tgev cannot serve as an example here because in europe it has largely been eliminated from the swine population due to the emergence in the early eighties of the closely related porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv prcv is a tgev deletion mutant which has acquired respiratory tropism and shows an epidemiological advantage of rapid aerogenic spreading while causing a protective immunity to tgev endemic prcv has thus replaced tgev in europeit would be interesting to study the mechanisms behind the regressionwaning of pedv in europe could it be that the virus has a non swine ancestor which has temporarily become adapted to swine but which is not really swine-borne such evolution would not be unique for animal coronaviruses could it be that the virus can maintain itself in the population only when present at a sufficient high dose allowing it to continue the infection chain but once reaching a low level quantityeg on a farm basis is not longer able to do so the waning of pedv has apparently not occurred in parts of asia within its 23 decennia of presence on that continent to the same degree as it did in europe and it will be intriguing to closely follow the epidemiological course and evolution of pedv in the usa once the epidemic phase has passeda novel coronavirus outbreak took place in wuhan hubei province china in december 2019 wang et al 2020 this novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 causes pneumonia in patients zhu et al 2020 and it has rapidly spread to other provinces in china and other countries who 2020 this novel coronavirus outbreak had raised global concern but current knowledge on the origin and transmission route of the pathogen is still limited the sars-cov-2 belongs to the genus betacoronavirus which also includes two highly virulent human coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov apart from human many animal species such as bat rat camel swine and hedgehog can be infected by different types of coronaviruses further sequence analyses of this novel and other betacoronaviruses might provide additional information to better understand the evolution of sars-cov-2preferential codon usage is commonly seen in different organisms and it has been evident that the uneven codon usage is not neutral but related to gene expression or other selection pressures akashi and eyre-walker 1998 percudani and ottonello 1999 pepin domsic and mckenna 2008 there are two levels of codon usage biases one is at amino acid level and the other is at synonymous codon level the first one mainly originates from preferential usage of certain amino acids for example integral membrane proteins maybe enriched in hydrophobic amino acids and respective codons perriere 2002 the synonymous codon usage bias in viruses can be driven by selective pressures from the host cells wong et al 2010 fan et al 2015gu et al 2019 and studies on different viruses have shown that selection pressures can be dominant in the evolution of codon usage patterns of the virus liu et al 2011 fan et al 2015 kumar et al 2016 wang et al 2016 correspondence analysis ca is a tool for visualization high dimension discrete-state data which has been applied in many codon usage studies perriere 2002 charif et al 2005 wong et al 2010 lobry 2018 the recently developed within-group ca wca and between-group ca bca are derivatives to the conventional ca lobry 2018 and the application of block structure in these methods allows separating the codon usage bias at amino acid and synonymous codon levels as the natural history of the sars-cov-2 remains largely unknown an in-depth codon usage analysis of this newly emerging virus might provide some novel insightsin this study we used both ca bca and wca to analyses codon usage patterns of 3076 betacoronavirus sequences we found sars-cov-2 and bat sarsr-cov have similar amino acid usage however our analyses suggested that the spike and membrane genes of

membrane and nucleocapsid genes of studied viral sequences were distributed in unimodal pattern fig 1athe overall amino acid and codon usage of the dataset are plotted in an ascending order fig 2 we observed that leucine and valine were the two most frequently used amino acids in the four studied genes while tryptophan histidine and methionine were the three least used ones we also found that codons ending with cytosine or guanine were generally less frequent than the codons ending with adenine or thymine this pattern of uneven usage in synonymous codons is in accordance with the g  c content distribution results codons ending with guanine or cytosine were less frequently observedwe found a substantial bias in amino acid usage among these four genes and this bias is well explained by the hydropathy of the encoded proteins collectively results from global ca on all the four genes data not shown we discovered that the nucleocapsid protein sequences had significantly lower gravy scores when compared with those from other genes while the membrane protein sequences had highest gravy scores fig 1bof all the four global correspondence analyses for the four genes the extracted

factors we could extract 70 per cent of the variability of the overall codon usage for each studied gene these levels of representations were higher than or similar to those deduced from other codon

sars-cov have similar overall codon usage we also found that sars-cov codon usage processed more similarity to sars-cov-2 compared with the other three types of human coronaviruses ie yellow point always closest to sars-cov-2 in supplementary fig s3acompared with human coronavirus sequences the bat coronavirus sequences have more scattered codon usage even within the same viral species supplementary fig s3b some viral species in bats formed their own clusters in all four genes eg sarsr-cov sarsr-cov is a group of coronavirus that can be found in both humans and bats the codon usage of sars-cov-2 in orf1ab spike and membrane were slightly different from the sars-cov clusters and these data points are located in between sarsr-cov and other coronavirus species eg mersr-cov and bat coronavirus hku9 etcthe global codon usages of bat ratg13 virus were found most similar to sars-cov-2 in orf1ab spike and nucleocapsid genes but not in membrane gene fig 3 in membrane protein pangolin p1e virus had a more similar codon usage to sars-cov-2 than all the other viruses we found the similarity in codon usage between pangolin p1e and sars-cov-2 were also high in orf1ab where p1e was the second closest data point to sars-cov-2 but this is not the case for spike and nucleocapsid geneswe also observed that the codon usage pattern in spike gene was more complex than in other genes for example we found that the p1e virus was in different k-means cluster with sars-cov-2 which was not observed in the other three genes moreover data points adjacent to the spike gene of sars-cov-2 were coronaviruses not only from bat and human but also from rodent hosts which is unseen in the other three genes fig 3 supplementary fig s4b although the ca results suggested relatively novel codon usage pattern it captured a large proportion of the variance between hosts or virus species this was supported by significant differences between the ca distances in both host anosim statistic r 0085 p  0001 and virus species groups anosim statistic r 0506 p  0001the codon usage from camel swine and other coronaviruses were found to be well clustered and relatively distant to sars-cov-2 see supplementary fig s4a c and dwca and bca were used to further differentiate codon usage of these betacoronaviruses at synonymous codon usage and amino acid usage levels respectively we found that most of the variability in codon usage can be explained at synonymous codon usage level 9036 for orf1ab gene 8529 for spike gene 8371 for member gene and 8407 for nucleocapsid gene table 1results from the bca suggested that the amino acid usage of sars-cov-2 is closely related to bat and human sarsr-covs in all four genes figs 4b and 5b specifically we discovered that the sars-cov-2 had amino acid usage pattern most similar to bat ratg13 virus followed by pangolin p1e bat covvzc45 and bat covzxc21 the sequences of btky72 and bm48-31 were from a more phylogenetically distant clade and accordingly they had relatively distinct amino acid usage to sars-cov-2 as expected in all four studied genes this result agrees with the result in the full-genome phylogenetic analysis supplementary fig s5the difference between sars-cov-2 and ratg13 at synonymous codon usage level was marginal in orf1ab and nucleocapsid sequences however our results suggest the synonymous codon usage patterns in the spike and membrane gene of sars-cov-2 are different from those of its genetically related viruses ie ratg13 and other reference relatives for example the pangolin p1e virus was not grouped in the same k-means cluster with sars-cov-2 in spike and the synonymous codon usage pattern of sars-cov-2 was found to be closer to a cluster of rodent murine coronaviruses at the first two factorial levels figs 4a and 5afurther analysis on spike gene however suggested that the codon usage of sars-cov-2 and rodent murine coronaviruses were distinct at the third factorial level supplementary fig s6a the results show that although ratg13 became the most adjacent to sars-cov-2 when adding the third dimension wca values our results suggest a complex genomic background in the spike gene of sars-cov-2 which made its synonymous codon usage harder to differentiate from other genomic sequences in our wca analysis the distances between k-means clusters are smaller despite the relative proximity between ratg13 and sars-cov-2 at three-dimensional level they were still at significantly different positions supplementary fig s6a it is evident that the synonymous codon usage pattern of sars-cov-2 is distinct from other bat origin coronaviruses the difference in synonymous codon usage is largely explained by the first factor more than 50 and our analysis on codon usages suggest that the first factor maybe highly related to the preferential usage of codons ending with cytosine supplementary fig s7 we also had similar observation for the membrane gene our three-dimensional analysis revealed that the synonymous codon usage of sars-cov-2 in membrane was most similar to p1e and covzxc21 supplementary fig s6b it is worth noting that comparing to ratg13 p1e and covzxc21 had lower synonymous codon usage similarity to sars-cov-2 in the other three genesoverall our wca results support a more complex synonymous codon usage background on spike and membrane genes though we identified unique codon usage patterns of sars-cov-2 on these two genescodon usage can be affected by many sequence features including nucleotide composition dinucleotide composition amino acid preference host adaption etc hershberg and petrov 2008 suzuki et al 2008 gu et al 2019 the codon usages of viral sequences can vary by genes and host origins jenkins and holmes 2003 wong et al 2010 cristina et al 2015 the bias in codon usage is a unique and distinctive characteristic that can reflect the signature of a genomic sequence codon usage analyses are often complementary to ordinary sequence alignment-based analyses that focus on the genetic distance at nucleotide level whereas codon usage analyses enable capturing signals at different sequence parameters therefore codon usage bias can be another good proxy for identifying unique traits eg virus origin host origin or some functions of proteins of a genome the goal of this study was to investigate the codon usage bias of betacoronaviruses by studying the codon usages of these viruses in a systematic manner we identified viral sequences carrying traits similar to those of sars-cov-2 which provided useful information for studying the host origin and evolutionary history of sars-cov-2the codon usage of different genes in betacoronaviruses is very different the g  c content especially the gc3 content is known to be influential to the codon usage of some bacteria and viruses perriere 2002 gu et al 2004 woo et al 2010 the gc3 content has pronounced effects on our wca analysis of the orf1ab and spike genes the gc3 content was found correlated with high wca values on the first factor of orf1ab in contrast codons ending with cytosine had lower factorial values in the spike gene analysis supplementary fig s7 the g  c contents in membrane and nucleocapsid genes were less suppressed fig 1a this can be partly explained by the fact that membrane and nucleocapsid are two genes with shorter lengths which may limit the flexibilities for mutation or codon usage adaptation in addition to global ca analysis the application of wca and bca can eliminate the effects caused by amino acid compositions and synonymous codon usage respectively these alternative analytical tools were important because the amino acid sequences are expected to be more conserved such that they can preserve biological functions of the translated genes in contrast mutations at synonymous level tend to be more frequent as most of these codon alternatives do not affect the biological function of a proteinof all the existing genomes in the dataset ratg13 best matched the overall codon usage pattern of the sars-cov-2 although the sars-cov-2 had amino acid usage similar to bat and human sarsr-covs the synonymous codon usages between them were relatively different which indicates similar protein characteristics but maybe different evolutionary histories the codon usage of bat coronaviruses is more scattered than coronaviruses of other hosts this result agrees with the fact that bat is a major host reservoir of coronavirus calisher et al 2006 thus it harbours coronaviruses with more complex genomic backgroundssars-cov-2 was first identified in human but its codon usage pattern is very different from those of other human betacoroanviruses supplementary fig s3a in fact the codon usage at both the amino acid level and synonymous level denote that the orf1ab gene in sars-cov-2 had closest relationship to sarsr-cov especially ratg13 the covzx45 and covzxc21 had similar amino acid usage but relatively different synonymous codon usage to sars-cov-2 fig 4 besides bat-origin sarsr-cov the pangolin p1e also had similar codon usage to sars-cov-2 both at amino acid and synonymous codon levels the result in orf1ab is in accordance with the full-genome phylogenetic analysis supplementary fig s5 showing a close relationship between sars-cov-2 and ratg13 by the overall backbone of the genomethe s protein is responsible for receptor binding which is important for viral entry the genetic variability is extreme in spike gene gallagher and buchmeier 2001 and this highly mutable gene may possess more information about recent evolution history in our results the synonymous codon usage of sars-cov-2 in spike gene was distinct from those of p1e and other phylogenetic relatives fig 4a which was not observed in orf1ab or nucleocapsid gene although the codon usage in spike of sars-cov-2 ratg13 and p1e were similar at amino acid level the difference at synonymous codon usage level indicates that they are unlikely to share a very recent common ancestor it is more likely that sars-cov-2 ratg13 and p1e might have undergone different evolution pathways for a certain period of time the amino acid usage of sars-cov-2 in membrane was clustered with bat sarsr-cov however the synonymous codon usage of sars-cov-2 was still distinct to these bat coronaviruses notably in membrane gene pangolin p1e had a more similar synonymous codon usage to sars-cov-2 than ratg13 these findings suggest that there may be different selection forces between genes our result supports different evolutionary background or currently unknown host adaption history in sars-cov-2 the codon usage of sars-cov-2 in nucleocapsid gene was similar to bat sarsr-cov both at amino acid level and synonymous level suggesting that no highly significant mutation happened in this genecodon usage can be shaped by many different selection forces including the influence from host factors some researchers have hypothesized that the codon usage in sars-cov-2 maybe directly correlated to the codon usage of its host ji et al 2020 however our recent study on influenza a viruses implied that these may not be the most influential factors shaping the codon usage of a viral genome gu et al 2019 our analysis took advantage of the existing genomes of betacoronavirus to study the complex host effect on codon usage which warrants more accurate but relatively conserved estimation however we also understand that the results from codon usage analysis cannot be deterministic or direct evidence revealing the origin of the virus as the number of available genomic data is currently limited and virus with high 99 genetic similarity to sars-cov-2 was yet to be identified we cannot draw a conclusion on the origin of sars-cov-2 at this stage another potential limitation of the study maybe from the ca method itself although ca have been widely applied in codon usage studies in many different organisms the codon usage data are usually not independent observations the phylogenetic relationship among observations make it hard to differentiate source of the codon usage bias as the codon usage bias may both affected by selective pressures and descent relationships unfortunately there is currently no established method for adjusting phylogenetic relationships in ca analysis in codon usage data an alternative method addressing the above concern is neededon march 11 2020 the world health organization recognized novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 infection as a global pandemic1 although a large emphasis has rightfully been placed on the high transmissibility and lethality of this disease the pandemic has also wrought psychiatric sequelae and rapid change to the delivery of mental health care1

what is currently known about the coronavirus impact on psychiatric care popular media has spoken to anxiety stress grief and depression associated with coronavirus its resultant disease covid-19 and the public health response to the pandemic this review aims to provide a critical synthesis of the scientific literature on coronavirus and its relationship to psychiatric practicewe identified literature describing the psychiatric implications of coronavirus and covid-19 our approach was consistent with a rapid review of a quickly evolving topic3 a rapid review is a type of knowledge synthesis in which components of the systematic review process are simplified or omitted to produce information in a short period of time4 the search terms and strategy using a single database pubmed is described in table 1
 that database was chosen for its high scientific standard and global reach inclusion criteria were publications in english from december 2019 to april 13 2020 articles were screened for content by the authors independently and included in the review by consensus references from included articles were reviewed to identify additional literature the quality of original quantitative research was assessed using the quality assessment tool5 the heterogeneous nature of these studies precluded a meta-analytic approachseventy-one articles were identified in an initial search from which fifty full-text articles were included the prisma flow diagram for article selection is shown in figure 1
6 most articles 3850 76 were narrative reports without original data figure 2
 a quality assessment on articles with original data is shown in table 2
 all but one 1112 of the papers were rated as poor quality articles were found from 9 countries largely from china 1950 38 and the united states us 1450 28figure 3
there were two major categories of literature 1 the risk of psychiatric symptoms and 2 changes in psychiatric practice consequent of coronavirus covi19 and their related public health responsespopulation-based surveys in china have demonstrated increases in distress and post-traumatic stress anxiety and depression symptoms over the course of the pandemic7

8 in addition posttraumatic stress symptoms ptss were prevalent in 7 of wuhan residents and visitors to wuhan during the initial outbreak these rates were higher than in surrounding cities and did not correlative with a history of infection9 a nationwide survey in china with 52730 citizens from 36 provinces and three large cities showed 35 of respondents having mild psychological distress from the coronavirus pandemic 5 reported more severe distress10
these findings were consistent with data from the united states a month prior to the peak of the outbreak in the us a national survey found that 40 of americans were anxious about contracting or dying from covid-19 psychiatric symptoms included more frequent insomnia among 19 of respondents alcohol consumption 8 and interpersonal conflict 1211 the long-term impact of chronic stress due to the pandemic is widely feared in the literature if yet unproven pandemic adjustment disorder has been proposed to describe the totality of these persisting symptoms12 editorialists have expressed concern about the potential for incident mental illness perhaps in part due to inflammatory dysregulation in the context of increased stress and decreased social connection13

14 while survey studies have pointed to an increase in anxiety one analysis of electronic medical records found decreasing mention of anxiety and depressive systems across multi-site health systems compared to before the pandemic15 these contrasting findings suggest that surveillance of coronavirus mental health impacts may be nuanced and dependent on methodologyother articles suggest the psychiatric risks of coronavirus among at-risk populationssome cases of coronavirus and covid-19 appear to be correlated with neurological symptoms such as anosmia and delirium16 it is thus reasonable to hypothesize that coronavirus may put patients at risk for other psychiatric syndromes a survey among stabilized covid-19 patients prior to discharge from quarantine facilities found that 96 of survivors endorsed ptss17 the extreme environmental modifications of hospital environments for infection control may increase the risk of delirium among at-risk patients18
the mental health consequences of coronavirus have been most studied among healthcare clinicians and administrators1 19-22in a cross-sectional survey of 5062 healthcare workers in wuhan china providers who were female had more than 10 years of experience or worked with acutely ill patients emergency intensive care respiratory care and infectious disease clinicians were at heightened risk of stress depression and anxiety23 other studies describe increased rates of insomnia up to 38 anxiety 13 depression 49 somatization 2 and obsessive-compulsive 5 symptoms among providers24

25 a survey of clinical staff found that 71 felt significant fear working with coronavirus patients26 staff with direct patient care responsibilities experienced significantly higher psychological sequelae than staff who did not27 specific components exacerbating these responses from healthcare staff were suggested concerns included fear of infecting family limited amounts of personal protective equipment ppe and other resources exhaustion from longer working hours and dealing with patients who do not want to cooperate with current guidelines28

29
supportive interventions have been described to ameliorate these negative effects among healthcare staff one chinese hospital provided medical staff supplementary space to rest outside of their homes prepared meals pre-job training on how to address psychological problems in patients suffering from covid-19 and explicit rules on the management of limited ppe29 this intervention builds on factors described as protective against psychological stress feelings of preparedness and institutional support but was not rigorously evaluated for effectiveness28
anecdotally persons who have pre-existing mental health conditions may be at risk for worse outcomes as a result of the pandemic these risks derive from barriers in accessing timely health services and being more emotionally susceptible to stressors30 these patients limited access to care may result in relapse of disease31 access to care may be particularly problematic for individuals in substance treatment programs such as on medication-assisted treatments32 psychiatrists have been asked to proactively engage patients who might not seek care out of fear of infection14 no evidence described specific risks by psychiatric diagnosiselderly persons were postulated to be among the groups at highest risk for mental health sequelae of coronavirus33 this population was predicted to not only suffer from a greater physical risk due to coronavirus but also be more susceptible to the negative psychological impacts of social isolation14

33 an increased incidence of death by suicide was observed among elder persons during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic elder persons may be at similar risk yet again33 a narrative report from china portrayed elders as disproportionately struggling with technological utilization and decreased access to public transportation34 patients with dementia who struggle to follow infection control guidelines increase the risk of burnout among nursing facility staff while also increasing patients risk of covid-1935 interventions to mitigate potential psychological effects among the elder population were not described33
less literature described psychiatric risks of coronavirus among other populations correctional facilities reported difficulty maintaining social distance regulations among inmates and promoting adequate hygiene36 students adolescents and children experienced disruptions to daily routines and academic schedules37 international chinese college students reported experiencing discrimination given the coronavirus origins and anxiety related to family members contracting this disease in their home country38 patients involved in research studies were suggested to be negatively impacted by unexpected study discontinuations or protocol changes39
the pandemics impact extends to the delivery of psychiatric care as well psychiatrists have been asked to adopt several roles in response to the pandemic psychiatrists have skills in general practice and may be required to refresh their medical knowledge in order to support their patients collaborate with primary providers and direct patients to appropriate treatment12

40 mental health professionals are positioned to support resilience among medical providers and volunteer for crisis support hotlines these contributions have been compared to fighting a war against the pandemic with psychiatrists role being to not only direct clinical care but also engage in research on the pandemics effects41
public health interventions have altered the standard of care in both hospital and outpatient settings psychiatric hospitals have accommodated enhanced infection control by reducing patient visitors and shortening inpatient stays42

43 published protocols provide specific guidance to enhance infection control in inpatient behavioral health units44
the rapid and widespread adoption of telepsychiatry has been the most appreciable change in psychiatric practice during the pandemic a change predicted to have lasting implications on the accessibility and quality of mental health care after the pandemic43

45

46 telepsychiatry is being used not only between physicians and patients but also between consulting psychiatrists and primary teams47 a physician in france detailed the quick implementation of telepsychiatry in her hospital which was necessary to accommodate increased patient volumes 10 days after social isolation orders were implemented48
limitations of telepsychiatry have also been described electroconvulsive therapy is a life-saving procedure that cannot be performed remotely and places practitioners at high risk of contracting coronavirus49 some opioid assisted therapy particularly with methadone requires in-person treatment and patients who cannot remain in treatment are at risk of relapse32additionally telepsychiatry may not be accessible for all patients including those who are homeless severely cognitively impaired technologically uncomfortable eg the elderly or young children45 12
the pandemic has implications for psychiatric prescribing several psychiatric drugs impact the efficacy and tolerability of antiviral therapy through p450 metabolism interactions agents with fewer drug-drug interactions should be used preferentially eg citalopram olanzapine or valproic acid50 new guidelines have been published for assessing clozapine patients who presented with flu-like illness or suspected covid-19 given those patients risk for neutropenia51
these systemic changes emphasize the advantages of building adaptable healthcare delivery models and strong community support for mental health service prior to a crisis52

53 the global nature of the pandemic has prompted international collaboration in spite of prior conflicts54 the common challenges of the pandemic proffer opportunity for unified global advocacy that can lay the groundwork for improving access to and quality of mental health carewhile much literature is being produced on coronavirus even at this early stage most papers are editorials and narrative descriptions devoid of original research the long-term sequelae of coronavirus on psychiatric symptoms remain uncertain and the data reported so far of the impact of coronavirus on psychiatric care is of generally poor quality the initial pandemic has induced widespread psychological unease but no epidemiological studies apply diagnostic or functional impairment criteria to populations of interest indeed the ubiquity of distress calls into question whether an individualized psychiatric treatment approach is preferable to a broader public health and political interventions no studies have demonstrated biological relationships between coronavirus and psychiatric symptomsthe rapid expansion of telepsychiatry has been widely noted but largely unstudied there were no descriptions of adapting telepsychiatry to at-risk populations including for the use of highly agitated patients or providing access to those without internet or phone access the effectiveness of telepsychiatry among these populations remains untested no quality measures to assess the effectiveness of this new modality have been proposedthis review is limited by the novelty of its subject while the search was limited to english-language peer-reviewed scientific literature many of these findings are yet to be fully vetted by the medical community this rapid review was limited to one medical database which may limit access to articles published ahead of print or in the gray literatureas covid-19 and its related public health responses transform life around the globe the psychiatric sequelae of the pandemic among individuals and societies remain uncertain at this early stage of the pandemic original research remains scarce and of poor quality high levels of distress and potentially revolutionary changes in psychiatric practice are being described but there remains a poor understanding of the pandemics impact on the incidence prevalence and prognosis of psychiatric disease and implications for access to and quality of care several small interventions on reducing psychological symptoms among at-risk populations suggest the potential for psychiatry to adopt an assertive and positive response equal to a monumental task
19 20 21 22severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease of 2019 covid-19 first identified in wuhan hubei china in december of 2019 it has since been declared a pandemic by the world health organization who in march of 2020 1-2first discovered in the 1960s coronaviruses coronaviridae are a family of enveloped positive-sense single-stranded ribonucleic acid rna viruses 3 the genome size of this viral group ranges between 27 and 34 kilobases which is larger than most other rna viruses 4 the name coronavirus originates from the latin word corona meaning crown or halo due to its characteristic appearance under two-dimensional transmission electron microscopy coronaviruses have club-shaped spike peplomers covering their surfaces figure 1 5since their discovery seven human pathogenic strains have been identified within the coronaviridae family and orthocoronavirinae subfamily the alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus are transmissible to humans the alpha- and betacoronavirus strains are thought to have originated from the bat species rousettus leschenaultii 6-8 clinical presentation can vary widely ranging from mild cold-like symptoms to severe respiratory distress and death the alphacoronavirus strains 229e and nl63 along with the betacoronavirus strains oc43 and hku1 tend to cause only mild symptoms the betacoronavirus strains mers-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and sars-cov-2 are known for causing severe respiratory distress in recent history several outbreaks have occurred related to these betacoronavirus strains figure 2 depicts the genomes and structures for sars-cov and mers-cov 9human-to-human transmission primarily occurs through close contact and through respiratory droplets 2 similar to many other viral particles transmission is increased at lower temperatures viral-laden droplets are more effectively produced due to increased evaporation at lower relative humidity allowing for viral particles to remain airborne for longer 10 once viral particles enter the respiratory tract the virus attaches to pulmonary cells followed by endocytosisboth sars-cov and mers-cov enter cells through an endocytosis pathway using surface spike s proteins to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace-2 and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 receptors on the ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type ii pneumocytes respectively 11 once the virus enters the host cell the viral rna is exposed open reading frames 1a and 1ab orf1a and orf1ab are translated producing polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab these polyproteins are later cleaved to form structural proteins for the rna replicase-transcriptase complex which is responsible for the replication and transcription of viral rna viral nucleocapsids are assembled and bud from the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum golgi intermediate compartment ergic as viral nucleocapsids encase viral rna to produce new coronavirus virions they are exocytosed completing the replication cycle viral replication is summarized in figure 3 11-13here we will present a brief review of viral origin identification symptoms transmission diagnosis and potential treatment strategies for the newly identified sars-cov-2 strainoriginin december of 2019 a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases were reported in wuhan china with the first known case recorded on december 1 14 the majority of patients diagnosed with this atypical pneumonia had links to the huanan seafood market suggesting a zoonotic origin 15-17 some reports indicate early rapid spread with cases doubling every 75 days 18 on january 30 2020 the who declared a public health emergency of international concern as cases began to spread around the world 1 on march 11 2020 the who declared the outbreak of sars-cov-2 a pandemic 1identificationshortly after investigations began it was determined that a betacoronavirus was responsible which was identified as sars-cov-2 figure 4prior to its identification the virus was called the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov some are suggesting a change of name to human coronavirus 2019 hcov-19 to avoid confusion with the recent strain sars-cov from 2002 here we will refer to the new strain as sars-cov-2 as accepted by the who and the centers for disease control and prevention cdc 1-2 this newly identified human strain is thought to be related to the bat and pangolin coronavirus as well as sars-cov 19-22 genetic analysis has placed the virus in the genus betacoronavirus and subgenus sarbecovirus lineage b which confirms its likely origin to the bat coronavirus batcov ratg13 22 further analysis has revealed only one amino acid difference between sars-cov and the pangolin coronavirus pangolin-cov suggesting a possible intermediate host 23symptomspatients who test positive for sars-cov-2 and are symptomatic are diagnosed with covid-19 symptoms can vary drastically they include fever 99 chills dry cough 59 sputum production 27 fatigue 70 lethargy arthralgias myalgias 35 headache dyspnea 31 nausea vomiting anorexia 40 and diarrhea 2224 some carriers may be asymptomatic whereas others can experience acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and death 2224 severity seems to also vary with age disproportionately affecting those of advanced age and those with pre-existing chronic medical conditions table 1 25transmissiontransmission occurs primarily through respiratory droplets but it can also occur through contact with contaminated surfaces 2 viable viral particles may remain on stainless steel and plastics for up to 72 hours after application 26 currently the cdc recommends airborne and droplet precautions for all healthcare providers who come in contact with potential covid-19 patients 2 several public measures have been taken at the local and federal government level in the united states to reduce the rates of transmission including social distancing and self-isolationincubation periods may vary but have been known to be between 1 and 14 days for other coronaviruses to date the median observed incubation period for sars-cov-2 appears to be 51 days 95 confidence interval ci 45-58 days with 975 of those who develop symptoms doing so within 115 days 95 ci 82-156 days of infection 27 although the risk of transmission from an asymptomatic individual may be low it is still possible the basic reproduction number r0 or the number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible has been reported to be between 213 and 482 which is similar to sars-cov 28 at the cellular level once viral particles enter the respiratory tract like sars-cov sars-cov-2 uses the ace-2 receptors for pulmonary cell entry 29 ace-2 is a type 1 transmembrane metallocarboxypeptidase which under normal physiological circumstances functions in the degradation of angiotensin ii to modulate the renin-angiotensin system ras 30 the viral s protein binds to the ace-2 receptor prompting cellular membrane fusion and endocytosis this process is dependent on s protein priming by a serine protease tmprss2 in many coronavirus models potentially identifying a future treatment modality 31-32diagnosisdiagnosis is ultimately confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr on respiratory or blood samples 33 note that rrt-pcr positive-to-negative conversion has been reported at 69  23 days 33 some reports detail imaging findings suggestive of covid-19 although these findings can be nonspecific and reliability has not yet been established 33-34 computed tomography ct findings include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with peripheral posterior distribution mainly in the lower lung lobes 35 less commonly septal thickening bronchiectasis pleural thickening and subpleural involvement have been reported as disease progression occurs repeat ct scan may show multifocal consolidations with a paving pattern figure 5 36treatmentthere are currently no definitive therapies or vaccines for the sars-cov-2 virus management is supportive and in severe cases aimed at improving ards which we will not discuss here trials are currently underway to identify therapeutic optionsremdesivir is a nucleotide analog inhibitor of rna-dependent rna polymerases which has previously been shown to have antiviral activity against mers-cov and sars-cov 36-38 studies are currently available that show inhibition of viral replication of sars-cov-2 in vitro 36chloroquine typically used in the context of malarial or autoimmune disease has also shown promising results chloroquine affects glycosylation of the ace-2 pulmonary cell receptors impairing viral cell entry 3639 medication-induced ph changes within pulmonary cells alkalinization also delays viral replication as key steps in endosome function are impaired 39 similarly hydroxychloroquine is another less toxic and potentially effective therapy 40 trials are currently underway to further evaluate the effectiveness of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquinecamostat mesylate a serine protease inhibitor has been identified by some as a potential treatment option camostat mesylate partially blocks sars-cov-2 entry into the pulmonary cells by inhibiting s protein priming and endocytosis 29 follow-up studies on treatment with camostat mesylate are currently pendingtocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-6 receptor il-6r ab commonly used as an immunosuppressive in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis it is currently postulated that patients with severe manifestations of covid-19 experience some degree of cytokine storm which results in ards and death 3841 small studies in china have found some success with the treatment of severe cases of covid-19 with tocilizumab the small study found decreased fever oxygen requirements and c-reactive protein crp along with improved ct findings 42 medication dosing was not providedlopinavir and ritonavir protease inhibitors are commonly used in the treatment and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus hiv and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids randomized controlled open-label trials on confirmed positive covid-19 adult patients with ards have been performed using a 14-day course of lopinavir and ritonavir 400-100mg twice daily no benefit has been observed beyond the standard of care 43 some postulate that the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir may become more effective with the addition of interferon-beta infb 38 further studies are required to confirm this findingnitazoxanide is a broad-spectrum antiparasitic and antiviral agent used in the treatment of various helminthic protozoal and viral infections nitazoxanide was found to inhibit sars-cov-2 at low micromolar concentrations in vitro 36 further studies are required to prove in vivo efficacymedication advisorycaution should be used when using corticosteroids in covid-19 patients previous data suggest decreased viral clearance of both mers-cov and sars-cov potentially prolonging the course of illness 44-45 no mortality benefit has been appreciated in non-ards covid-19 patients 46there has been some speculation regarding non-steroidal anti-inflammatories nsaids specifically ibuprofen causing up-regulation of ace-2 receptors although no studies are available at this time to suggest an increased risk of sars-cov-2 47 similarly groups have voiced concern over ace inhibitor acei and angiotensin receptor blocker arb therapy this concern is due to their mechanism of action and up-regulation of the ace-2 receptor which is used by sars-cov-2 in cell entry 47 no studies have been performed to evaluate this theoretical risk currently the expert opinion recommendation for patients on acei or arb therapy is to continue their current drug regimen many societies have made statements regarding this matter and are detailed in table 2 48outcomescase fatality varies geographically and final mortality estimates vary weekly as many cases are currently ongoing recent data suggest a case fatality between 025 and 30 49-50 slightly increased rates have been documented in china 35 49 case fatality also varies by age 148 in patients aged 80 years 80 in patients aged 70-79 years and 490 in critical cases 50 it is uncertain whether these figures can predict disease case fatality in the united states as progression throughout the united states is currently ongoingsars-cov-2 is the coronavirus responsible for the covid-19 pandemic of 2020 it is one of seven human transmissible coronaviruses and is thought to have originated from the bat coronavirus the first human cases were documented in wuhan china in december of 2019 and are thought to be a result of transmission through an intermediate host likely the pangolin human-to-human disease transmission primarily occurs through respiratory droplets once in the respiratory tract sars-cov-2 enters the pulmonary cells through endocytosis via the ace-2 receptor the mean incubation time is 51 days 95 ci 45-58 days with 975 of those who develop symptoms doing so within 115 days 95 ci 82-156 days symptoms may vary from mild to severe but are typical of other viral illnesses including influenza the basic reproduction number is reported to be between 213 and 482 those most affected by covid-19 are those of advanced age and those with pre-existing chronic medical conditions final mortality rates are currently unknown as a large portion of cases have not yet resolved but estimated case fatality is between 025 and 30 treatment options are limited to supportive care and management of ards in severe cases ongoing studies are evaluating the efficacy of remdesivir chloroquine hydroxychloroquine camostat mesylate and tocilizumab as potential therapies lopinavir and ritonavir do not appear to be effective currently no vaccine is available although efforts are in progress to developing a vaccine over the coming year caution should be used when using corticosteroids in non-ards covid-19 patients as no mortality benefit has been observed and viral clearance can be prolonged the use of aceis and arbs should not be discontinued in efforts to prevent or reduce the transmission of sars-cov-2 per current society statementthe novelist paulo coelho once wrote that everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time while our memory of the fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov has not faded a third novel coronavirus 2019-ncov is coming into the spotlight 2019-ncov was first detected in wuhan china in december 2019 and quickly spread across the country figure 1a as of 8 february 2020 34 800 confirmed 2019-ncov cases and 724 deaths have been reported in china and 24 other countries 1 who declared 2019-ncov a public health emergency of international concern on 30 january 2020 several recent studies have provided critical and timely insights into the origin and human-to-human transmission of this virus 2 3 4a group of chinese scientists investigated the epidemiological data of the first 41 2019-ncov patients admitted to a hospital in wuhan before 2 january 2020 2 twenty-seven 66 of the patients had a direct contact history with the local huanan seafood market where live and slaughtered wild animals were sold for food consumption the huanan market and its wild animals were suspected of being the source of human infection by 2019-ncov zhou et al retrieved five complete genomes from samples collected from 2019-ncov patients and through genome analysis they found that the virus is a betacoronavirus that shares a sequence identity of 96 with a coronavirus found in bats 4 the spike gene of coronavirus has been shown to play a critical role in interspecies transmission zhou and colleagues found that 2019-ncov can use ace2 as a cell entry receptor in this way 2019-ncov resembles sars-cov 56sars-cov and mers-cov originated from bats both jumping species to infect humans through different intermediate hosts 7 figure 1b it is suspected that palm civets sold in live animal markets were the intermediate host for sars-cov 78 mers-cov was transmitted through dromedary camels 78 identification of the intermediate host for a novel virus is not a trivial investigation and it is not yet clear whether 2019-ncov infected humans via direct transmission from a bat or through intermediate hostschan et al conducted an epidemiological and genomic investigation of a household cluster of six patients in shenzhen a major city located 1000 km from wuhan this provided evidence for human-to-human transmission and intercity spread of 2019-ncov 3 among the six patients five were found to be infected with 2019-ncov after visiting wuhan and the remaining patient who had not recently traveled to wuhan acquired the infection through close contact with family members in shenzhen none of the family members had been in contact with the huanan market or with wild animals but two of them had been to a hospital in wuhan during their visit suggesting that these patients had acquired the infection in the wuhan hospital and had brought the virus back to shenzhen subsequently transmitting it to the family memberalthough the huanan market in wuhan was highly relevant to the emergence and spread of 2019-ncov and the virus has been detected in environmental samples from the market the origin of this virus has not been determined conclusively analysis of available 2019-ncov genomes has shown very limited genetic diversity indicating that these genomes share a very recent common ancestor examination of the epidemiological data in 2 found that the first known patient and the other 13 out of the 41 initial patients had no contact history with the huanan wet market moreover the first patient shared no epidemiological link with any patient in the cohort thus it is possible that there was more than one source of infection for example a homogeneous virus may have existed in the supply chain of wild animals and in huanan and other markets in the city regardless of its initial source it is likely that 2019-ncov was introduced into a small cluster of humans from a cluster of infected animals and from there the virus acquired the capacity for human-to-human transmission spreading in the city before the cluster of patients from the huanan market was identifiedclinical data have shown that the date of symptom onset of the first known patient was 1 december 2019 2 given the known incubation period  between 1 and 14 days  the interspecies transmission could have occurred as late as november 2019 because none of the family members of the first known patient have developed fever or any common respiratory symptoms it is reasonable to speculate as to whether more than one introduction of 2019-ncov occurred with the hypothesis that some strains cannot transmit between humans while others have acquired the capacity for human-to-human transmission causing the current outbreakthe origin of 2019-ncov merits in-depth investigations with a few key questions that also need to be addressed thoroughly i what is the molecular mechanism underlying the interspecies transmission of 2019-ncov how is this mechanism similar to or distinct from that associated with the emergence of sars-cov and mers-cov ii what is the role played by point mutation and recombination in the evolution of 2019-ncov since coronaviruses can experience rapid mutation and frequent recombination will these activities generate novel strains with heightened transmissibility and pathogenicity iii how prevalent is the virus in its natural host and does it possess the ability to infect other animals this question is relevant because coronavirus originating in the bat has been found to cross the species barrier and infect pigs 9 which are hypothesized to serve as the mixing vessels for the generation of genetically novel viruses the introduction of 2019-ncov into livestock animals could pose a potential threat to both agriculture and public healthfollowing the emergence of sars-cov and mers-cov 2019-ncov represents a third major emergence of a novel coronavirus it is now time to learn from the lessons of these two previous outbreaks to prevent the spread of further disease from 2019-ncovduring the past decade serious outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases have occurred in many parts of the world including the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov in saudi arabia 2012present ebola in west africa 20142016 ajisegiri chughtai  macintyre 2018 zika virus in brazil 20152016 campos bandeira  sardi 2015 and the plague in madagascar in 2017 european centre for disease prevention and control 2017 the default assumption of most outbreaks and epidemics is that they are naturally caused macintyre  engells 2016 and public health culture and practice do not routinely consider unnatural causes such as bioterrorism or biowarfare macintyre 2015a all category a bioterrorism agents except smallpox also occur in nature therefore epidemics caused by bioterrorism including by new or engineered pathogens may not be recognized as unnatural macintyre et al 2017 bioterrorismassociated outbreaks cannot be identified unless specifically considered and even so may be difficult to detect macintyre 2015b macintyre  engells 2016 treadwell koo kuker  khan 2003 therefore in an era of accessible and expanding technology in genetic engineering and synthetic biology macintyre et al 2017 it is important to discern unnatural from natural outbreaks during outbreak investigationthe original grunowfinke epidemiology assessment tool gft grunow  finke 2002 is a scoring system developed in 2002 for the identification of bioterrorism events and is the most widely used tool chen chughtai  macintyre 2017 when applied to 11 historically natural and unnatural disease outbreaks by the united states us army dembek pavlin  kortepeter 2007 it had high specificity 100 but relatively low sensitivity 38 for detecting bioterrorism macintyre  engells 2016 the gft was recalibrated in 2017 by changing criteria weights and threshold to achieve 100 sensitivity in detection of unnatural outbreaks and the modified gft mgft was validated against historical data chen chughtai  macintyre 2018 however it has not been applied to newly emerged or ongoing epidemicsthe ongoing merscov outbreak has persisted in the world for seven years since 2012 when it was first isolated in bisha zaki van boheemen bestebroer osterhaus  fouchier 2012 despite having a much lower basic reproduction number r

including 732 deaths case fatality rate 39 have been reported in saudi arabia by the world health organization who who 2018a accounting for more than 80 of global cases flutrackers 2018 there have been unanswered questions and various explanations of the source of merscov transmission modes and unusual epidemic pattern while camels have been identified as a host of the virus azhar et al 2014 dudas carvalho rambaut  bedford 2018 mohd altawfiq  memish 2016 over 50 of human cases have no identified exposure to animals let alone camels chen chughtai dyda  macintyre 2017 no drug is currently available against merscov modjarrad 2016 several vaccine candidates are in development of which the gls5300 vaccine candidate was in human clinical trial modjarrad et al 2019 the aim of this study was to apply the mgft to merscov outbreak in saudi arabia for risk analysis and to evaluate the mgft in comparison with original gftfor this study a data set of human cases of merscov infection reported from 2012 to 2018 in saudi arabia was first created the publicly available data were sourced from the case list of saudi ministry of health mohwho novel coronavirus mers announced cases on flutrackers flutrackers 2018 including demographic data age gender and occupation and location data city each human case on flutrackers list has the linked original reports from the who who 2019a and saudi moh saudi moh 2015 where data of multiple risk factors including date of notification date of symptoms onset date of hospitalization laboratory confirmation date complications death and specified contact history camellinked sheeplinked communitylinked hospitallinked unknown exposure were collected to enhance the data set cases on the list would be excluded from the data set if there were no data of any risk factor in addition the published literature associated with mers outbreaks investigations were reviewed for rationales to inform scoring the gftthe merscov outbreak in saudi arabia was scored using original gft and mgft and assessment points were determined by three researchers xc aac and crm independently to minimize the subjectivity the original gft grunow  finke 2002 contains 11 nonconclusive criteria table i which indirectly indicate the likelihood of biological warfare for each criterion a value between 0 and 3 is given based on the available data it is then multiplied by a set weighting factor between 1 and 3 points the sum of points is divided by the maximum number of points 54 points for a probability which indicates the likelihood of bioterrorism 033 unlikely 3466 doubtful 6794 likely and 95100 highly likelythe mgft table ii contains 11 modified criteria biorisk unusual strain geographic distribution environmental concentration epidemic intensity transmission mode time unusually rapid spread population limitation clinical and special insights each criterion is assessed according to the available evidence it is then multiplied by a fixed weighting factor 13 points based on the total points of all the criteria the outbreak is classified as naturally caused if the result is less than 30 points otherwise it points to an unnatural cause with varying likelihood depending on the scorebiological risk is defined as the presence of a political or terrorist environment from which a biological attack could originate a biological risk arises for example if states groups or individuals have access to biological warfare agents and the necessary means of distributing them and are willing to use them in addition a biological risk is to be assumed if in the area concerned biological warfare agents are developed produced or stored and could be released as a result of poor plant security or if the plant itself is destroyedgrunow  finke 2002the middle east region has been a wartorn region with conflicts and disputes over politics culture religion and land during the past decade at least 10 terrorist attacks against middle eastern civilians and soldiers have been documented johnston 2017 including two suspicious bioterrorism events with cholera and poison involved in yemen global research 2017 and iraq johnston 2017 in addition merscov was within scope for the us government for dualuse research or gainoffunction of concern and was included in the pause on new government funding on gainoffunction research which also involved influenza and sarscov in 2014 public health emergency 2014 therefore the biological risk of merscov may be significant given the geopolitical history and context in the middle eastern region this criterion was assessed as 2 pointsit is defined as if in the environment of a biological risk individual states groups or persons openly threaten to use biological warfare agents or if a specific interest in their use can be assumedgrunow  finke 2002there was no openly biological threat to saudi arabia but it is regarded that some countries have offensive biological warfare capabilities its neighboring countries such as israel refused to sign the biological warfare convention bwc and might have maintained biological weapons stocks since 1998 the washington post 2017 syria and egypt have not ratified the bwc arms control association 2018 either during a 2014 raid on the islamic state it is alleged that some syrian rebels recovered a laptop which contained instructions for the islamic state on the usage of biological weapons and the way to protect themselves from exposure hummel 2016 as the biological risk of merscov may be significant 2 points it is likely for terrorist groups to produce and use biological warfare agents especially when the tensions between saudi arabia and neighbors became serious for this reason a value of 2 was allocated to this criterionit is defined as given the current state of research and technology it cannot be ruled out that a potential aggressor has genetically manipulated certain characteristics of pathogens or toxins prior to their use as biological warfare agents this can include measures which make detection and identification more difficult or which increase the virulence environmental stability and resistance to prophylactic and therapeutic measures grunow  finke 2002 
the merscov is classified as a bioterrorism category c agent by the center of disease control cdc 2018 which includes newly emerged infections and is the third highest priority agent that could be engineered for mass dissemination because of availability ease of production and dissemination and potential for high morbidity and mortality rates and major health impact cdc 2018the origin of merscov is unknown it was first documented in humans in the middle east in 2012 flutrackers 2012 resulting in 1903 laboratoryconfirmed human cases worldwide as of december 31 2018 flutrackers 2018 it is now known that merscov strains have circulated in animal hosts such as bats and dromedary camels in the middle east and east africa for decades cui eden holmes  wang 2013 mohd et al 2016 before the first human case that was identified in 2012 chen chughtai dyda et al 2017 if naturally occurring presumably a genetic mutation enabled the species jump to humans in 2012 the phylogenetic evolution of merscov prior to and after the species jump from animal to human shows the high rate of evolution 142  103 substitutionssite per year kim park bae  park 2019 however the exact routes of transmission of merscov in animals and humans are still puzzlingin a nosocomial outbreak in al ahsa aprilmay 2013 a total of 23 cases with a classic epidemic curve were confirmed a single branching chain of persontoperson transmission was assumed however the phylogenetic analysis assiri et al 2013 cotten et al 2013 demonstrated that multiple genetic strains were infecting patients during this outbreak at least five of 13 transmissions within the hospital could not be explained by persontoperson transmission macintyre 2014 this evidence of multiple independent introductions of infection and several genetically related but distinct strains in a single hospital outbreak is unusual whether multiple people had the same animal exposure in the community prior to presenting to hospital no evidence of this was found or described
taking the peculiarities described above into consideration 3 points have been allocated to this criterionthis criterion is defined as it is unusual from an epidemiologic perspective if the disease is identified in a region concerned for the first time ever or again after a long period of time chen et al 2018the middle east country particularly the kingdom of saudi arabia has the greatest disease burden of merscov since it was first identified in the middle east in 2012 it has continued to cause human infection for seven years saudi arabia where all 20 cities have been affected has more than 80 of global merscov cases while the disease has spread to other 26 countries most of these are isolated cases of merscov imported through travel to saudi arabia or the middle east flutrackers 2018 south korea was the only country that had an merscov outbreak outside of the arabian peninsula with the index patient presenting to multiple health facilities who failed to diagnose merscov macintyre 2014comparing this pattern to sarscov a similar novel coronavirus which also spread globally the epidemiology is different after the importation of sars cases satellite epidemics occurred in a consistent epidemic pattern in a number of countries macintyre 2014 including the mainland china hong kong taiwan singapore vietnam and canada who 2018b however merscov has been limited largely to the middle east with a notable absence of satellite epidemics except for south korea macintyre 2014 a modeling study also showed that with the estimated r
0 of merscov satellite epidemics should have occurred in other countries following mass gatherings such as the hajj pilgrimage in mecca gardner et al 2014 yet no such satellite epidemics have arisen following hajj or umrah pilgrimages in addition based on frequency of air travel to saudi arabia the country at the highest risk of an importation of merscov india has not seen a case yet a country which is not in the top 10 atrisk countries south korea has seen a large epidemic gardner chughtai  macintyre 2016 given the narrow geographic distribution of merscov in saudi arabia and the other factors above this criterion was assessed as 3 pointsit is defined as if a biological agent is released artificially eg as an aerosol we can expect to find it in unusually high concentrations in the air soil and drinking or surface water over a large area high concentrations of pathogens predominantly exist in selected areas although the pathogens might also be found in the case of natural contamination chen et al 2018in saudi arabia no environmental investigation for merscov has been conducted or if it has been conducted no public data are available according to the environmental investigation in the merscov outbreak units in south korea kim et al 2016 virus was found from ambient air samples obtained from each patients room and its affiliated restroom furthermore swabs from patients pillows telephone buttons televisions and the floor were positive for the virus in the rest rooms after daily cleaning and disinfection of the rooms while there is no publicly available environmental data from saudi arabia the possibility of environmental concentration of merscov there could not be ruled out given this uncertainty only 1 point was allocated to this criterionthe intensity and dynamics of an epidemic are characterized by the percentage of cases of a disease per unit of time or the total number of cases chen et al 2018the epidemic pattern of merscov is not as intensive as sarscov which is also caused by a coronavirus and had sickened over 8000 people in 2003 lu wang  gao 2015 in saudi arabia merscov has resulted in a total of 1901 human cases between 2012 and 2018 who 2018a in addition merscov did not feature a classic epidemic peak in the first year after emergence as did sars wallinga  teunis 2004 while there has been a large surge in cases in saudi arabia in some years with some clustered cases and nosocomial outbreaks the pattern remains largely sporadic rather than epidemic macintyre 2014 taking the above into consideration 2 points were allocated to this criterionthis criterion is defined as different pathogens prefer different paths of infection in general natural epidemics will feature paths of transmission which are typical for the pathogen and its natural hosts deviations from natural paths of infection could indicate that biological agents have been deliberately disseminated chen et al 2018there are two presumed transmission routes of merscov 
zoonotic transmission exposure to animals such as close contact with camels and consumption with camel milk or meat is a risk factor of merscov infection the exact routes of zoonotic transmission of merscov remain unknown although camels appear to be the host it is found that only 136 of cases had confirmed contact history with animals table iii serosurveys of camels and humans also show low risk of infection in humans with close camel contact hemida et al 2015humantohuman transmission humantohuman transmission is documented in nosocomial and household outbreaks in saudi arabia around 30 of merscov infections were acquired in healthcare facilities and the community after contact with confirmed cases table iii
in saudi arabia the merscov shows unusual transmission patterns of the laboratoryconfirmed human cases in saudi arabia over 50 did not report any exposure before illness table iii in al ahsa nosocomial outbreak in 2013 five of 13 transmissions within the hospitals could not be explained by persontoperson transmission and the evidence of animal exposure before presenting to hospital was not found macintyre 2014 given these unusual aspects of the transmission epidemiology this criterion was given 3 pointsthe criterion is defined as epidemics of certain infectious diseases occur in increased numbers during certain seasons either because they are dependent on the weather or they occur after certain intervals in time if the temporal context of an epidemic is not typical and an epidemic does not conform with accepted temporal patterns then there is some basis to the claim that an epidemic has artificial causes chen et al 2018the epidemic curve of merscov cases in saudi arabia was generated using the available data fig 1 it shows that the number of cases was substantially different each year from 2012 to 2018 and the lack of seasonality was striking with inconsistent timing and size of the peak each year and a mixture of sporadic and epidemic patterns apart from that merscov with r
0 reproductive number close to 1 the epidemic threshold macintyre 2014 has paradoxically persisted over seven years much longer than sars which had a r
0  2 and was controlled within eight months macintyre 2014 in south korea the merscov outbreak ended in two months after the first cases reported the ongoing introduction of infection to humans in saudi arabia without evidence of camel contact in most cases is unusual for these reasons 3 points were allocated to this criterionit is defined as the speed at which some epidemic spreads is determined by the virulence resistance and concentration of the pathogen the contagiousness of the disease and the intensity of the transmission process on the one hand and on the susceptibility and disposition of the exposed population on the other chen et al 2018in saudi arabia sporadic merscov cases have been reported consistently since 2012 chen chughtai dyda et al 2017 but there were some instances of rapid spread such as nosocomial outbreaks assiri et al 2013 oboho et al 2015 generally the spread of merscov in saudi arabia has not occurred as rapidly as the sarscov outbreak of 2003 which had 8098 human cases within eight months lu et al 2015 thus the criterion was assessed as 1 pointthis criterion is defined as biological attacks can be directed against large heterogeneous population groups and military contingents or against selected target groups chen et al 2018merscov from saudi arabia has spread to 26 countries however none had longterm seeding of the disease at the destination country south korea has been the only country which had a nosocomial outbreak resulting in 186 human cases but ended within eight weeks with no further cases since chen chughtai dyda et al 2017 merscov has primarily circulated in the population of saudi arabia for a period of seven years around 80 of global merscov human cases occurred in saudi arabia where the epidemic is still ongoing the majority of saudi cases 77 were local residents and 23 were expatriates merscov infection occurred in any age group but middleaged adults 50s were most commonly affected particularly males malefemale ratio  21 table iiigiven the high prevalence and apparent limitation of merscov in saudi arabia population it could be concluded that the disease is largely limited to a specific population therefore this criterion was assessed as 3 pointsthe assessment is based on if the clinical manifestations of the disease are to be expected if a pathogen is to be efficiently ingested biological agents would most likely to be released as aerosols or be used to contaminate food and water as a result we could expect primarily pulmonary manifestations or typhoidal types of symptoms if an aerosol attack had occurred and mainly intestinal manifestations if the foodborne pathogen had been ingested chen et al 2018the disease spectrum of merscov infection ranges from asymptomatic or mild respiratory symptoms to rapidly progressive severe respiratory failure and death typical symptoms include fever cough and shortness of breath pneumonia is common and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea have been reported occasionally complications such as pneumonia and kidney failure are common in severe merscov cases who 2017 in saudi arabia most cases have severe disease who 2017 the case fatality rate is 39 substantially higher than sars 12 gardner  macintyre 2014 macintyre 2014 and 645 of cases have comorbidities table iii such as chronic heart lung and kidney diseases diabetes and cancer this criterion was assigned with 1 point because there was no striking abnormality in the expected clinical manifestation except for a high case fatality rateassessment points were the same as the original gft criterion which had the same definitionthis is a revised criterion of special aspects of the biological agent the updated definition is in unnatural outbreaks the strains may be atypical rare antiquated new emerging with mutations or different origins genetically edited created by synthetic biotechnology it may demonstrate increased virulence unusual environmental stability resistance to prophylactic and therapeutic measures or difficulty in detection and identification chen et al 2018 the assessment was also 3 points given the same rationales of the criterion special aspects of the biological agent in the original gftthe seven criteria were assessed as the same points as the original gft because of no changes made on these criteria and definitionsthe criterion is defined as any suspicious circumstances identified prior to the outbreak during the period of outbreak or postoutbreak which would point to an unnatural outbreak examples could be a suspicion raised by someone or an anonymous message or mail or other intelligence not included in the criteria above chen et al 2018merscov may trigger an epidemic through a single traveller as seen in the large outbreak in south korea in 2015 however in mass gatherings such as the annual hajj pilgrimage in saudi arabia week 43 in 2012 week 41 in 2013 week 40 in 2014 and week 39 in 2015 no significant increase of incidence has been documented fig 1 which is an unusual phenomenon in the presence of sustained ongoing human infections in saudi arabia due to lack of other insights this criterion was assessed as 1 pointusing the scoring system of original gft table iv the result showed 40 points out of 54 points indicating a likely unnatural outbreak likelihood 74 for the assessment by the recalibrated gft the result showed 40 points out of 60 points likelihood 67 table v also indicating likelihood that merscov outbreak in saudi arabia may be unnaturalbased on available data and published evidence the use of both the original gft and mgft suggested likelihood of merscov being an unnatural outbreak in saudi arabia the findings are consistent with a previous qualitative assessment which showed a discrepant epidemiology of merscov macintyre 2014 this study does not comprise proof of bioterrorism but could be helpful to further investigate the origin of human merscov infections epidemiology and risk analysis can only flag unusual patterns but proof of bioattacks is the remit of law enforcement and intelligence agencies macintyre 2015ahistorically many unnatural outbreaks have not been identified as such at the time for example the large salmonellosis outbreak in oregon in 1984 which was caused by rajneesh cult who deliberately released salmonella in salad bars in 10 local restaurants was wrongly judged as a natural outbreak by public health experts trk et al 1997 public health authorities would never have known that this was bioterrorism except for a confession by bhagwan shree rajneesh six months later and the accidental discovery by the federal bureau of investigation fbi of their laboratory containing the exact outbreak strain a full 12 months later trk et al 1997 another example is operation seaspray where bacteria were sprayed over san francisco in open air testing by the us military in 1950 wheat zuckerman  rantz 1951 treating doctors noted an unusual resultant illness in exposed people but health professionals never identified the illness to be unnatural in origin and the cause was not known until 20 years later when it was disclosed us army 1977 unless the question of natural or unnatural origin is asked unnatural outbreaks cannot be identified public health training practice and culture defaults to the assumption that every outbreak is natural in origin and does not routinely include risk assessments for bioterrorism macintyre 2015a even if the questions were asked except for smallpox which was eradicated in 1980 who 2019b all known and new emerging infections cannot easily be discerned as natural or unnatural routine use of tools such as the gft could assist in this differentiation and may be more relevant in an era of accessible biotechnologythe risk of unnatural epidemics is high in the era of synthetic biology and genetic engineering technology an extinct poxvirus closely related to smallpox was synthetically created in canadian laboratory in 2017 using the mailordered dna koblentz 2017 there are more than 150 private companies providing genetic sequences to biomedical laboratories worldwide including selfregulated doityourself diy laboratories global engage 2017 the technological capability is present to give rise to unnatural epidemics compounded by the risk of laboratory accidents and insider threats macintyre et al 2017 the question therefore is whether risk analysis tools such as the gft should be routinely used in public health when investigating outbreaksinterestingly in this study the original gft scored merscov higher than the mgft but it does not indicate that the latter is less sensitive than the original gft the two scores are not directly comparable due to changed weights different thresholds and total points the significance is that this study shows the value and flexibility of the mgft in assessing and predicting the risk for an ongoing outbreak with simple criteriato conclude the risk analysis of merscov outbreak in saudi arabia flagged likelihood of an unnatural origin using both the original gft and mgft further investigation of this possibility is a matter for intelligence and law enforcement agencies in saudi arabia in the era of rapidly expanding and accessible technology for synthetic biology and genetic engineering as well as stated intent of terrorist groups to use biological attacks hummel 2016 use of the highly sensitive risk assessment tool the mgft could be integrated into routine outbreak investigation by public health authoritiesthe host range expansion of coronaviruses covs from wildlife to humans via genetic recombination andor mutations on the receptor-binding domain in the spike s gene is well established and results in several diseases with high fatality rates such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers 1 2 despite their bat origins sars-cov and mers-cov have infected humans via an intermediate host rather than through a direct infection from bats palm civets have been suggested but not definitively confirmed to be an intermediate host for sars-cov and dromedary camels are confirmed to be the intermediate host for mers-cov 3 currently the number of known intermediate hosts involved in the transmission of bat-origin coronaviruses to humans is limited compared to many other species pigs are in frequent contact with both humans and other animals such as cats dogs horses and aquatic birds and theoretically possess a greater chance to promote cross-species viral transmission for instance pigs are susceptible to infection with human and avian influenza a viruses iavs such as h1n1 and h3n2 which then reassort to infect humans 4 thus pigs are regarded as mixing vessels for iavs however pigs were not known to be susceptible to bat-origin coronaviruses until recently when two independent groups reported the detection of novel swine enteric alphacoronaviruses seacovs distinct from known swine coronaviruses with one group successfully isolating live virus the seacovs were found to be phylogenetically close to bat coronavirus hku2 5 6 this suggests that bat-origin coronaviruses may have jumped the species barrier to infect pigsin february 2017 outbreaks of severe watery diarrhea of suckling piglets were reported in commercial pig farms in guangdong province china the disease had high case fatality rates cfrs over 35 for 10-day-old suckling piglets and none of the animals were positive for known pathogens responsible for porcine diarrhea 6 instead two genomes of novel seacov were detected in the ill piglets by two independent groups and preliminary analysis showed that the seacovs possibly originated from bat hku coronaviruses 5 6 it is currently unclear whether seacovs had been circulating undetected in pigs if the viruses had originated from cross-species transmission or if the seacovs were the result of viral recombination to understand the molecular origin and evolution of seacovs we performed a detailed phylogenetic analysis at the genomic level by using all known alphacoronaviruses and bat-origin coronaviruses which are known to cause severe diseases such as sars and mers a total of 224 312 and 778 complete genomes from mers-cov sars-cov and alphacoronaviruses respectively were used phylogeny was reconstructed using conserved regions in genomes by the maximum likelihood method with 300 replicates figure 1
a consistent with previous studies phylogenetic analysis shows that seacovs were closely related to the rhinolophus bat coronavirus hku2 isolated in southern china figure 1a seacov was found to share a common ancestor with human coronavirus 229enl63 but these viruses are distant from other known swine alphacoronaviruses indicating their different origins further analysis on the s gene which determines virus attachment host cell entry and host jump of coronaviruses 7 showed that domain 0 in the s1 subunit has structural similarity to that of nl63 the rest of the domain on the s1 subunit was similar to that of murine hepatitis coronavirus betacov 6 there were 11 residues of the receptor-binding domain rbd also called c-terminal domain ctd of seacov directly in contact with its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 that were mutated or deleted 7 figure 1b seven mutations a deletion of four amino acids and three substitutions among the 11 sites in seacov were also found in 229enl63 indicating similarities in the receptor-binding mechanism between seacov and 229enl63 therefore seacov may be able to infect humans and should be closely monitored infection of seacov in vero cells a primate cell line will provide experimental evidence to support this possibility 6another requirement for the host range expansion of viruses is physical contact between different host species the novel seacovs were both detected in guangdong province whereas closely related bat coronaviruses were also isolated from guangdong or hong kong figure 1a in guangdong province the high density of pig slaughterhouses and the wide distribution of bat species figure 2
a promote the possibility of viral cross-species transmission additionally bats have a wide geographical distribution in southern china with extensive species diversity unique behaviors characteristic flight patterns diet roosting and mobility 8 and constant interactions with both pigs and humans figure 2apigs are well established as mixing vessels and as intermediate hosts for iavs and coronaviruses have already been shown to possess potential for recombination in animals 9 given that pigs are in frequent contact with human and multiple wildlife species and that pork is one of the most commonly consumed meats in non-muslim countries it is important to assess whether pigs could be mixing vessels for the emergence of novel coronaviruses with high agricultural impact and risks to public health it has already been reported that pigs are susceptible to infection with human sars-cov 10 and mers-cov 11 additionally the cd26 receptor sequence alignment of pigs and humans shows 945 similarity which is sufficient for potential cross-species transmission 7 in southern china the unique climate the high density of domestic as well as wild pigs and extensive bat distribution together with bats carrying large numbers of recombinant novel coronaviruses 12 could lead to the emergence of more novel coronaviruses in the futurethe isolation of seacov from ill piglets expands our knowledge of the host range of bat-origin coronaviruses and potentially poses a threat to public health despite considerable progress in characterizing cross-species transmission for coronaviruses several areas need to be addressed including i whether other unknown coronaviruses are circulating in pigs ii whether pigs are mixing vessels for coronaviruses iii whether seacov infects humans and causes severe disease and iv whether seacov vaccines should also be developed to control the spread of this virus in pigs in-depth epidemiological investigation and comprehensive analysis of these novel coronaviruses should be performed to answer these urgent questionsthe internal mutation theory on the pathogenesis of fip asserts that fipvs arise by mutation during infection with fecvs poland et al 1996 vennema et al 1998 although subsequently challenged dye and siddel 2007 brown et al 2009 the internal mutation theory has been validated by several recent studies chang et al 2010 chang et al 2011 pedersen et al 2009 fecv mutants that attain the fip biotype have gained tropism for macrophages reviewed pedersen 2009 this altered tropism allows the virus to stray from its normal host cell mature intestinal epithelium and become a systemic pathogen of macrophages a cell type that is at the core of both innate and adaptive immunity the type and strength of immune responses to this macrophage infection is thought to dictate whether or not a cat becomes diseased and if diseased the form it takes reviewed pedersen 2009mutations that increase macrophage tropism were originally thought to reside solely in the 3c gene to work by altering the size of the gene product and to be unique to each cat dying of fip vennema et al 1998 pedersen et al 2009 the 3c is one of 11 genes in the feline coronavirus genome and it is uncertain whether it is an integral part of the virion and its exact function in the virus life-cycle it encodes a triple-spanning membrane protein that is similar in hydropathic profile but not sequence to the m protein oostra et al 2006 although the basic role of internal mutation endures the essential role of 3c mutations in the fecv to fipv conversion has been questioned it is now apparent that one-third or more of fipv isolates have 3c genes that are intact which is the case for all fecvs chang et al 2010 based on their findings chang and colleagues 2010 concluded that whereas an intact 3c is essential for intestinal replication functional mutations in 3c are not essential for increased macrophage tropism and fip however neither of these conclusions was tested by experimental cat inoculation studies rather the disease potential biotype of their coronavirus isolates was defined by their origins ie fecv if they were found in feces and fipvs if they were isolated from diseased tissues the implications of these findings go beyond the nature of the fipv mutations if fipvs with intact 3c can replicate in the intestine they may also transmit cat-to-cat this is counter to the current corollary that fipv is rarely if ever transmitted horizontally and that cats with fip are therefore not risks for other cats reviewed by pedersen 2009 pedersen et al 2009the present research is an extension of the work of chang and colleagues 2010 in determining the role of 3c for intestinal replication of both fipvs and fecvs the fecv and fipv isolates used in this study were obtained from a large metropolitan shelter in san francisco that receives kittens and adult cats from the bay area the shelter staff educates owners about the health problems that may occur in their new pet with emphasis on serious diseases such as fip owners are also encouraged to seek veterinary care from the shelter staff or private veterinarians if fip or signs of fip occur as a result of these practices many of the fip cases among adoptees come to the attention of the shelter staff therefore this collaboration yielded a large number of both fipv and fecv isolates the e m 3ac genes were then sequenced and used to categorize the various isolates for their 3c gene status a subset of these genetically characterized isolates were then used to infect laboratory cats both oronasally and by the ip route to determine their disease potential and ability to replicate in the intestine additional studies were also conducted on isolates obtained after animal passagecats sampled in this study were from the san francisco society for the prevention of cruelty to animals sf spca shelter this shelter intakes approximately 3000 cats a year about 50 of which are kittens cats and kittens are obtained from a local animal control shelter from local citizens or from a number of regional orphan and abandoned kitten fosterrescue organizations older kittens are often taken directly into the shelter while kittens received at 45 weeks of age are immediately transferred to local volunteer foster caregivers foster caregivers house one to several litters of kittens at a time until they attain the necessary age and weight for spaying or castration 912 weeks and 0910 kg at which time they are returned to the sf spca shelter there is a biphasic peak in kitten numbers in the shelter with the first peak in spring a decrease in august and september and a second wave around october through december kitten numbers decrease to very low levels during the winter january to marchearly april this seasonal rush causes crowding at all levels of the kitten relinquishmentadoption cycle and the incidence of coronavirus infection correlates with population density ie low in winter and high in late spring and early summerforty adoptees were known to have died of fip between june and december 2008 and samples of diseased tissues were obtained at necropsy by either private veterinarians or the shelter veterinary staff samples from 32 of these cats were sequenced feces were collected when possible from the colon of fip affected cats at the time of necropsy diseased tissues and feces were frozen at 40 to 70 c until used fecal samples from 184 healthy cats usually kittens of neutering size and age were obtained from litter boxes from june to october 2009 forty five of these samples were tested and 31 69 found to be positive for coronavirus and 2731 were sequencedfecv and fipv are considered as biotypes of feline coronavirus fcov for the purpose of this study the original name fecv will be applied to coronavirus present in the feces of healthy cats pedersen et al 1981 and fipv to coronavirus present in diseased tissues or exudates of cats with necropsy confirmed fip ward 1970 alternatively the terms fcov or coronavirus will be used when the disease potential of a particular isolate has not yet been tested by cat infection or when speaking about both biotypes of feline coronavirus in a generic mannerdiseased tissue usually inflamed omentum or granulomatous lesions from kidney or mesenteric lymph nodes was harvested at

 isolates from cats sfs-20 and -21 were identical thus yielding 18 unique mutations all these mutations involved the creation of premature stop codons 1018 or frame shifts 818 causing truncation of the 3c product almost all of these mutations were unique to the cat from which it was obtained fig 1 four of 19 of these tissue extracts also contained an intact 3c variant sfs-06 15 20 and 21 one of the 19fip isolates sfs-11 had a mutation that abolished the stopstart codon at the 3b3c junction and yielded an extended 3b protein and no 3c product fig 1 this isolate also had two deletion mutations in 3c fig 1 similar deletion mutations occurring downstream of a premature stop codon were also observed in three other fipv isolates sfs-03 14 and 23 one fipv isolate sfs-01 had a premature stop code in 3a while isolate sfs-18 had a 3-nucleotide deletion in the m gene fig 1 the remaining 1132 344 fip tissue isolates had intact 3c genes and normal sized transcripts for 3a b e and mno significant mutations in 3c other than amino acid substitutions were detected in 2627 fecv isolates an isolate from sfs-68 had a single histidine insertion at amino acid position 17 of the 3c protein fig 2
 virus was detected in the feces of two cats that died of fip the fecal virus from sfs-119 had the same 3c mutation as the tissue virus fecal and tissue isolates from cat sfs-05 had an identical intact 3c and the fecal virus fcov-2 was used for cat passage studies expt 2 table 4

 a greater proportion of fipv isolates contained mutations than fecv isolates 344 vs 111 respectively and the number of mutational events per isolate was also greater for fipv than fecv isolates table 5the infectious inocula used in this study were made from diseased tissues pooled from several cats this was done for two reasons 1 to test the disease potential of a greater number of coronavirus isolates using fewer laboratory cats and 2 to study the relative infectivity of different strains care was taken that each mixture contained only variants with either intact 3c or mutated 3c following infection with a mixture of isolates only one or two strains were associated with disease and the infecting strains often varied from cat to cat among an experimental group fig 5
 the infecting strains were either identical to the strains found in the inoculum or a recombinant for example one of the infecting variants in cat-025 and cat-022 was a recombinant between two isolates that were present in the infecting material fig 5 the predominant infecting strain could also possess mutations not detected in the parent virus cat-007 016 025 026 027 fig 5a in one study expt 3b which used an inoculum m3c-1 made from diseased tissues of four cats and presumably contained four mutated 3c variants the infecting virus in five of six cats was a double 3c deletion mutant ddfipv not initially detected in the inoculum fig 5bthis part of the study involved a more in depth comparison of 3ab e and m gene products of all fecv and fipv isolates fecv and fipv isolates from the shelter cats belonged solely to serotype 1 based on 3a sequence analysis pedersen et al 2009 unique mutations were found in genes other than 3c in a number of fecvs an identical mutation in 3a was detected in 1727 fecv isolates resulting in a truncated 3a protein with 62 amino acids see sfs-25 in fig 2 there were four fecv isolates sfs-33 31 39 and 68 that had deletion mutations in 3b resulting in truncation of its protein fig 2 one fecv isolate sfs-68 had a single amino acid deletion at amino acid position 53 in the e protein identical to that found in the four fipv isolates of clade i fig 2 fig 3 isolate sfs-31 had a 51nt deletion resulting in the loss of 17 amino acids starting at position 3 of the m protein fig 2strain specific mutations were also found outside of 3c in cats with naturally occurring fip the four cats with fip sfs-08 10 16 and 46 making up clade i had an identical single amino acid deletion at position 53 of the e protein fig 1 fig 3 all but one sfs-13 of the fip tissue isolates making up clade iii contained a double amino acid insertion isoleucine-proline in 3c at positions 42 and 43 fig 6
 sfs-13 had a four amino acid deletion in the region where the isoleucine-proline insertion occurred an identical isoleucine-proline insertion in the same position was also present in the 3c of all fecv isolates from clade iv supporting the close genetic relationship of clades iii and iv two isolates had functional mutations causing a premature stop codon in 3a sf-01 and a 3nt deletion in m sfs-18 even though they had intact 3c genesthe 3a b e and m amino acid sequences from the 32 fipvs were compared to those of 27 fecvs to examine whether a specific mutations in any of these proteins might differentiate fipvs from fecvs similar to the 3c product fig 6 a number of hypervariable regions were identified in the 3a b e and m proteins the same hypervariable regions were present in both fecvs and fipvs and no single amino acid changes or indels in these proteins were unique to either fecvs or fipvsnon-synonymous amino acid changes were examined in 13 representative fecvs 8 from clade ii and 5 from clade iv and 13 fipvs with intact 3c genes 2 from clade i 5 from clade ii 6 from clade iii fig 6 the number and position of non-synonymous amino acid changes were nearly identical from position 1 to 140 however unique non-synonymous amino acid substitutions were more frequent in fipvs than fecvs from position 150 to the 3 end of the 3c protein 17 non-synonymous changes in fipvs vs 4 in the fecvs fig 6the 3ac e and m sequences of isolates from lesional tissues of cats that died of fip during 2008 and from feces of healthy cats that were in the shelter in 2009 were used to construct a phylogenetic tree fig 3 four clades iiv of coronavirus were identified among this group of cats isolates within clades i and iii were 9899 identical to each other while all clade iv isolates were virtually identical 99100 clades i iii and iv were 9697 identical to each other while clade ii was 8794 identical to clades i iii and iv isolates from clade ii were much more diverse showing an overall identity of 8794 fig 3 this degree of relatedness is comparable to that encountered among isolates from geographically disparate regions of the us pedersen et al 2009 and suggests that strains within clade ii came from cats originating over a wide geographic area in contrast the close relatedness of coronavirus strains within clades i iii and especially iv indicated that each originated from a common source this common origin was supported by the presence of characteristic mutations in each of these three clades see section 35 cats infected with clades i and iii entered the shelter over a 6 month period in 2008 while clade iv isolates were collected over a 6 month period in 2009 again suggesting that these cats were infected from three different sourcesthirty two cats from a large regional shelter died of fip within several months of being adopted as pets forty percent of the fip isolates from these cats were found to have an intact 3c and 60 had deletion or stop codon resulted from nucleotide substitutions that yielded a truncated gene product this was in agreement with previous studies on fip isolates from the netherlands chang et al 2010the remainder of this study was an extension of the experiments reported by chang et al 2010 on the role of the 3c gene except that the biotypes of coronavirus isolates from both healthy and fip diseased cats were confirmed by infection of laboratory cats animal inoculation studies confirmed the basic conclusions of chang et al 2010 but with some modifications their first conclusion was that an intact 3c was essential for intestinal replication indeed all fecvs studied had intact 3c genes and were infectious by the oronasal route and shed at high levels in the feces however one of three cats infected ip with fecvs did shed virus from the feces indicating that fecvs could reach the gut from the peritoneal cavity but with some difficulty therefore intestinal vs macrophage tropism of fecvs may be relative rather than absolute a second conclusion of chang et al 2010 was that mutations in 3c were not essential to cause fip indeed fipvs with intact and functionally mutated 3c genes were equally capable of causing fip when given by either oronasal or ip routes therefore truncating mutations of 3c were not essential in causing fip chang et al 2010 also predicted that fipvs with truncated 3c genes would not infect the intestine following oral infection and would not be shed in the feces although true for most isolates there was again one exception a 3c double deletion mutant ddfipv was shed from the gut following oral infection with the m3c-1 inoculum however a fecal extract from laboratory cats shedding this particular mutant was not infectious for laboratory cats by the oronasal route it is noteworthy that the original inoculum containing ddfipv also contained a variant with an intact 3c gene this variant was no longer detected in feces after passage in laboratory cats it is possible that ddfipv used this variant as a helper for intestinal replication during its initial passage in laboratory catsthe fecal shedding of fipvs with intact 3c genes indicates the possibility of cat-to-cat horizontal transmission of fip the surprising finding in the present study was the lack of infectivity of coronaviruses that were shed in the feces of cats that were infected oronasally with fipvs possessing an intact 3c this lack of infectivity also applied to the novel double-deletion 3c mutant that appeared in the tissues and feces of cats infected with the m3c-1 inoculum and to a fecal virus from a cat with naturally acquired fip that possessed the same intact 3c as the lesional virus the reason for this lack of infectivity cannot be explained at this time but is another example of the complexities of fip pathogenesis however these findings support one corollary of the internal mutation theory ie cats with fip do not appear to effectively transmit fip horizontally to other cats pedersen 2009it is generally assumed that fecvs are tropic for the mature intestinal epithelium while fipvs are tropic for macrophages this implies that fecv infection is entirely contained within the intestinal tract however several studies have shown that fecv infection has both an intestinal and a systemic phase and that the systemic phase involves monocyte-macrophages kipar et al 2010 vogel et al 2010 this again suggests that intestinal and monocyte-macrophage tropisms of fecvs and fipvs are relative and not absolute this would explain how fecv was able to reach the intestinal epithelium in one of three cats infected with fecv by the ip route if fecvs can replicate briefly in macrophagemonocytes then the mutational transformation of an fecv to an fipv may actually occur in monocyte-macrophages rather than intestinal epithelial cells such a scenario takes into account the high mutability of fecv and fipv both within and between cats pedersen et al 2009 the mutation rate may also be greater during replication in macrophages than intestinal epithelial cells as indicated by the present study high mutability would provide ample opportunity for positive selection for macrophage tropism the better and longer an fecv can survive in macrophages following primary or secondary infections the more adapted to macrophage growth it would become and the more virulent in terms of fip indeed stoddart and scott 1989 demonstrated that the ability of an fipv to replicate in macrophages increased with its virulence for cats mutational events snps insertions deletions in the present study were also found to be much more common in fipvs than fecvs both in natural and experimental infections indicating that fipvs are under much more mutational pressure than fecvsthe role of antibodies in fipv infection and replication in macrophages needs to be considered as well the timing of acquisition of serum antibodies in experimental fipv either by passive or active immunization always coincides with the onset of disease pedersen and boyle 1980 antibodies greatly enhance the uptake and replication of coronavirus in macrophages and contribute to subsequent disease signs through an arthus type reaction jacobse-geels et al 1982 olsen et al 1992 pedersen and boyle 1980 pedersen 1986 weiss and scott 1981 fipv specific antibodies allow the mutant coronavirus an alternative pathway to enter macrophages ie by fc receptors therefore the fate of the host cat may be linked to its ability to contain primary fecv replication in monocyte-macrophages before antibodies appear in the present study as with other studies of experimental fip infection reviewed pedersen 2009 a proportion of cats appear to resist experimental fipv infection from the onset the importance of an intact immune system in this initial containment has been demonstrated in a previous study using fecv infection of aged fiv infected cats and their non-infected siblings poland et al 1996 there also appears to be a genetic component to fip susceptibility foley and pedersen 1996
chang and colleagues 2010 concluded that mutations in genes other than 3c can also lead to the fipv biotype however they could find no evidence for such mutations a comparison 3ac e and m nucleotide and amino acid sequences of fecvs and fipvs in the present study also failed to find any consistent differences in the 3a 3b e and m gene sequences or products that would implicate these genes in fip one fipv isolate sfs-01 in the present study had a premature stop codon in the region overlapping 3a b another sfs-11 had a mutation that resulted in an extended 3b protein and no 3c product and two fipv isolates had 3 nt and 27 nt deletions in the m protein the 7a and 7b genes and their products were not studied herein because isolates of both fecvs and fipvs with significant mutations have been found to coexist in nature kennedy et al 2001 lin et al 2009 furthermore deletion of 7b causes fipvs to become avirulent herrewegh et al 1995 finally significant mutations in 7a and 7b were not observed in a previous comparison of fipvs and fecvs pedersen et al 2009 previous studies have also failed to implicate the spike s and nucleocapsid n genes in the fecv to fipv biotype conversion battilani et al 2010 vennema et al 1998 it is also possible that alternative fip causing mutations may exist in the first two open reading frames comprising the replicase genes which collectively make up more than two-thirds of the genome however the replicase tends to be highly conserved and mutations in these genes would be expected to inhibit virus replication and decrease virulencealthough a singular importance of 3c mutations in the evolution of fipvs has been questioned chang et al 2010 such a conclusion may be premature in light of what is now known about variants although 60 of fipvs have a functionally mutated 3c such mutants often coexist with intact 3c variants in the same lesions the opposite situation is also true in some cats the pressure to progressively truncate 3c is also evident upon experimental cat passage pedersen et al 2009 these observations suggest that mutations ultimately causing fip do not start with the acquisition of premature stop codons or frame shifting deletions and insertions that alter the size of the 3c product fipv causing isolates with intact 3c genes in the present study had four times more unique non-synonymous amino acid mutations in the 3 one-third of their 3c protein than fecvs although chang et al 2010 reported no differences between 3c of their fecvs and fipvs with intact 3c a comparison of their fecv and fipv 3c gene sequences obtained from genbank also showed a similar trend from amino acid positions 160 to 240 of the 3c protein the number of predicted non-synonymous amino acid substitutions in this region in 26 of their fecvs was 065isolate compared to 20isolate for 10 of their fipv isolates however these differences may reflect a higher replication rate in macrophages vs intestinal epithelial cells and play no role in fip virulence the ultimate answer as to the nature of fip causing mutations may require as suggested by chang et al 2011 the creation of infectious molecular clones of the basic feline enteric coronavirus by forward or reverse genetic manipulations site directed mutagenesis to mimic various genotypes and animal inoculation studies to confirm the resultant phenotype unfortunately a true fecv has not been adapted to cell culture and most fipvs also cannot be grown in vitro and the essential reagents are still missingphylogenetic data from the large regional shelter sampled in this study allowed at least three conclusions 1 feline coronavirus isolates within the shelter belonged to different genetically defined clades 2 clades differed genetically over time 3 certain groups of cats in the shelter were infected by genetically identical fcovs indicating a point source of infection occurring either prior to or during sheltering and 4 not all fip isolates could be traced back to the adopting shelter these observations highlight essential differences in the dynamics of coronavirus infection in shelters vs catteries or stable multi-cat environments catteries and stable multi-cat environments usually have one major enzootic strain of coronavirus that persists over long periods of time addie et al 2003 herrewegh et al 1997 pedersen et al 2009 poland et al 1996 vennema et al 1998 even in the face of exposure to other strains addie et al 2003 herrewegh et al 1997 most previous studies on the origin of fip viruses have involved catteries and multi-cat environments which explain why fip viruses have been genetically linked to enteric coronaviruses in the same environments hickman et al 1995 pedersen et al 2009 poland et al 1996 vennema et al 1998a failure to understand the dynamics of coronavirus infection in stable vs unstable cat populations can lead to very different conclusions on the origins of fip causing coronaviruses brown and colleagues 2009 also did a genetic comparison of coronavirus isolates from 48 healthy and 8 fip affected cats from a comparable large regional shelter in the northeast of the united states they concluded that fip virus isolates were genetically distinguishable from enteric type coronaviruses in the shelter based on combinations of five specific amino acids at positions 108 120 138 163 and 199 in the m protein two of these sequences yival i or yiial ii were purportedly found in all cats with fip while isolates from healthy coronavirus infected cats were hiivi iii hiivl iv hvial v or yvval vi and uncommonly yival i in agreement with chang et al 2011 the present results confirmed that these particular amino acid sequences in m have no value in distinguishing fecvs from fipvs all but two of the 32 fipv and 27 fecv isolates in the present study had yivali in their m protein one fipv isolate sfs-50 had threonine t instead of alanine a at amino acid position 163 and one fecv sfs-39 had an isoleucine i instead of valine v at position 120 and a valine v instead of isoleucine i at position 138 an alternative explanation for the conclusion of brown et al 2009 was that fcov populations in a shelter are changing continually depending on the age of cats at the time of acquisition and their prior environmental exposure history in order to trace the origins of fip viruses in cats that have passed through shelters one must sample feces prior to the usual age of primary coronavirus infection 910 weeks of age pedersen et al 2008 and in subsequent exposure situations preceding the development of fipcoronaviruses covs family coronaviridae are enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses with the largest genomes 2531 kb among known rna viruses de groot et al 2011 based on genome-scale phylogenies the known covs are classified into 30 species within four genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus ictv 2017 coronaviruses can infect humans other mammals and birds causing respiratory enteric hepatic and neurological diseases of varying severity masters and perlman 2013 coronaviruses are well known globally due to the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars during 20022003 caused by a previously unknown cov ksiazek et al 2003 peiris et al 2003 subsequently other two human covs nl63 and hku1 causing respiratory disease were identified van der hoek et al 2004 woo et al 2005 strikingly the middle east respiratory syndrome mers that emerged in 2012 and characterized by a higher mortality than sars was also caused by a previously unknown cov bermingham et al 2012 zaki et al 2012 the ongoing emergence of these covs in humans means that covs will likely remain a key public health threat for the foreseeable futuresince the discovery of sars-cov in himalayan palm civets guan et al 2003 intense effort has been directed toward identifying and characterizing coronaviruses from animals globally consequently a number of covs have been identified in a diverse range of vertebrates including domestic and wild mammals and birds poon et al 2005 wang et al 2015 woo et al 2012 bats order chiroptera with more than 1240 species have remarkable species diversity and comprise more than 20 of living mammalian species nowak 1994 the discovery of sars-related cov in rhinolophus horseshoe bats in china in 2005 lau et al 2005 li et al 2005 attracted the global attention to these mammals such that diverse alpha- and beta-covs have now been identified in a variety of bats globally over the past decade corman et al 2013 corman et al 2014 corman et al 2015 drexler et al 2014 he et al 2014 huang et al 2016 smith et al 2016 woo et al 2012 more importantly due to the close relationship between covs in bats and those causing human infections it is believed that bats are the original source of human covs including sars-cov and mers-cov corman et al 2015 ge et al 2013 huynh et al 2012 ithete et al 2013 tao et al 2017 due to their high diversity and biological and ecological characteristics that potentially facilitate virus maintenance and transmission bats likely harbor a large number of viruses some of which may then jump to other species balboni et al 2012 hence more effort is needed to identify and characterize the currently unrecognized covs that circulate in batsat least 120 bat species are found in china mainly distributed in the eastern central and southern regions of that country zhang et al 1997 herein we report novel and diverse covs and sars-related covs identified in rhinolophus miniopterus murina and myotis spp bats sampled from several geographic regions of china in addition we inferred their genomic characteristics and evolutionary relationships with known viruses and their hostsduring 20122015 a total of 1067 bats were collected from five caves in five counties from guizhou henan and zhejiang provinces 
fig 1
table 1 and s1 after morphological examination and sequence analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome b mt-cyt b gene these bats were assigned to 21 species the species and their abundance varied among regions with miniopterus schreibersii 47 in guizhou rhinolophus ferrumequinum 45 and r pusillus 32 in henan and r monoceros 41 and r sinicus 50 in zhejiang as the predominant species notably only r pusillus bats were found in all five regionsusing rt-pcr targeting a conserved fragment of the rdrp rna-dependent rna polymerase gene of cov as described previously lau et al 2005 wang et al 2015 viral rna was identified in a total of 73 bat fecal samples with an overall detection rate of 684 table 1 phylogenetic analysis revealed that all these viral sequences were clearly closely related to coronaviruses among the predominant bat species cov prevalence was high in r monoceros 28119 2353 and m schreibersii 16198 808 but was lower in r sinicus 8219 365 r ferrumequinum 2183 109 and r pusillus 1154 064of the 73 newly-identified covs 32 belong to alphacoronaviruses and 41 to betacoronaviruses to better characterize these newly-identified bat covs the complete viral rdrp gene sequence was obtained from 65 89 of the viral rna positive bat samples in addition 5 complete and 4 near-complete viral genome sequences were successfully obtained from cov positive samplesgenetic analysis of the conserved domains in the replicase polyprotein pp1ab  adp-ribose 1-phosphatase adrp nsp5 3clpro nsp12 rdrp nsp13 hel nsp14 exon nsp15 nendou and nsp16 o-mt  revealed that newly-identified bat betacoronaviruses shared more than 90 amino acid sequence identity with severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus sarsr-cov table s2 and clustered together in a phylogenetic analysis 
fig 2 hence these data suggest that these bat viruses belong to the species sarsr-cov according to the criteria for species demarcation in the subfamily coronavirinae defined by the international committeeon taxomony of viruses ictv de groot et al 2011 as these viruses were from rhinolophus bats we therefore designed them as sars-related rhinolophus bat coronaviruses sarsr-rh-batcov among these 33 sarsr-rh-batcovs were identified in 28 r monoceros 1 r pearsonii 3 r sinicus and 1 r thomasi sampled from the city of longquan zhejiang province similarly 2 sars-related covs were identified in r ferrumequinum sampled from the city of jiyuan henan province while the remaining 6 viruses were identified in 5 r sinicus and 1 r rex sampled from the county of anlong guizhou provinceon the rdrp phylogeny fig 2 all known sarsr-rh-batcovs from china could be divided into four clusters within which the newly-identified viruses fell into three clusters that reflect their geographic origins specifically i the viruses identified in rhinolophus bats sampled in zhejiang province denoted rhinolophus bat longquan- were closely related to each other and clustered with rhinolophus bat cov hku3 sampled from r sinicus in hong kong lau et al 2005 ii the viruses identified in r ferrumequinum from jiyuan in henan province jiyuan-84 and jiyuan-331 formed a cluster with those viruses identified in r ferrumequinum from other regions of china the viruses within the cluster were from central china henan hubei and shaanxi provinces with the exception of the lineage comprising jmc15 and btrf-betacovjl2012 identified in r ferrumequinum sampled in northeastern china jilin province iii the viruses identified in r sinicus sampled from anlong in guizhou province clustered with those identified in rhinolophus bats from southwestern china including guangxi guizhou and yunnan provinces ge et al 2013 li et al 2005 strikingly only the bat sarsr-rh-batcovs from southwestern china exhibited a close evolutionary relationship with sars-related human coronavirus sars-cov and sars-related palm civet coronavirus sarsr-cicov tor2 and sz3 suggesting that sars-cov may have originated in this region finally within each of these three clusters the sars-related coronaviruses clustered according to their geographic originsunlike the rdrp gene tree all sarsr-rh-batcovs and sars-covs from china fell into two distant clades on the s gene phylogeny fig 2 the first included the sars-covs and two bat sarsr-rh-batcovs rs3367 and rsshc014 while the second comprised all the remaining bat sarsr-rh-batcovs including the newly-identified covs which could be further sub-divided into three clusters according to their geographic andor host origins finally additional analysis revealed that the s1 and s2 gene tree topologies differed from that of the s gene as a whole fig s1 suggestive of potential recombination events see belowto better characterize these newly-identified sarsr-rh-batcovs we recovered the complete genome sequences from each of the lineages described their genome sizes varied from 29665 to 29693 nucleotides and shared similar genome organizations with known sars-related cov viruses 
fig 3 including the putative transcription regulatory sequence trs motif 5-acgaac-3 at the 3 end of the 5 leader sequence and preceding each orf except orf7b additionally a single long orf8 was observed in all newly-identified sarsr-rh-batcovsthe sarsr-rh-batcovs from longquan zhejiang were closely related to the hku3 strain with nucleotide identities ranging from 947 to 970 and amino acid identities of 982991 in the rdrp notably however in the nsp2 gene they differed at up to 23 at the amino acid level additionally the longquan-140 virus was markedly different from sarsr-cicov at the amino acid level in the nsp2 253 s 203 orf3 175 and orf8 629 gene sequences the sars-related viruses from jiyuan henan were closely related to btrf-betacovheb2013 and btrf-betacovsx2013 with 990992 nucleotide identities strikingly the sarsr-rh-batcovs sampled from anlong guizhou were closely related to sars- and sarsr-cicovs with 94 nucleotide identitieswe next conducted an analysis of possible recombination events using available genome sequence of sarsr-rh-batcovs and other betacoronaviruses including those discovered in this study and sars- and sarsr-cicovs tor2 and sz3 as noted in table s2 the longquan-140 virus was markedly different from hku3 in the nsp2 gene suggestive of possible recombination when the longquan-140 sequence was used as the query for a sliding widow analysis with hku3 as a potential parent two recombination breakpoints located at the nsp2 nucleotide 1727 and nsp3 nucleotide 3055 genes were detected in longquan-140 with strong p-values 1025 and supported by a similarity plot 
fig 4 indeed there was an abrupt change in the topological position of longquan-140 and hku3 downstream of the first breakpoint position 1727 and upstream of the second breakpoint position 3055 accordingly the longquan-140 genome can be divided into three regions with different evolutionary histories regions a nucleotides 11726 b 17273055 and c 3056 to the end of the genome sequence in regions a and c longquan-140 was most closely related to hku3 with 960 nucleotide similarities while in region b it occupied basal position suggesting the recombination event originated from a currently un-sampled parental virus no other putative recombination events received significant statistical supportall remaining bat viruses discovered here belong to genus alphacoronavirus and had genome organizations similar to those of known alphacoronaviruses fig 3 in the rdrp phylogeny these viruses fell into seven distinct lineages within three clusters 
fig 5 the first cluster included the two newly-identified lineages comprising the virus neixiang-31 identified in one myotis davidii bat from neixiang henan and those identified in hipposideros armiger m davidii m siligorensis r macrotis r pearsonii r pusillus bats from anlong guizhou further comparison of the cov replicase domains adrp 3clpro rdrp hel exon nendou and o-mt revealed that these newly-identified bat viruses as well as the bat virus btmr-alphacovsax2011 nc0288111 exhibited more than 10 amino acid difference in all seven replicase domains table s3 these viruses also formed a distinct cluster in all gene trees and exhibited a clear cluster according to their geographic origins fig 5 and s2 together these data suggest that these viruses satisfy the species demarcation criterion defined by ictv and should therefore be considered as a novel member of the genus alphacoronavirus which we denote as neixiang md bat coronavirus nmbvwithin the second cluster the viruses discovered in bats from both anlong guizhou province and neixiang henan province formed a distinct lineage that was closely related to scotophilus bat coronavirus 512 sc-batcov 512 tang et al 2006 as these viruses exhibited 10 amino acid difference from members of the genus alphacoronavirus in the conserved replicase domains with the exception of o-mt to sc-batcov 512 93 table s2 it is possible that anlong-190 and neixiang-32 represent a novel cov species which we denote as anlong ms bat coronavirus however further studies are clearly needed to determine whether this virus indeed represents a novel coronavirus the remaining viruses which were discovered in bats sampled from lushi and neixiang and designated as lushi ml bat coronaviruses formed another distinct lineage that showed a close evolutionary relationship with the bat virus jtac2 ku182966 remarkably these viruses were most closely related to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv in all five gene trees fig 5 and s2 and exhibited 10 difference in six conserved replicase domains from known members of the genus alphacoronavirus in other genes table s3 however the o-mt gene of lushi ml bat coronaviruses was most closely related to that of pedv with 73 amino acid difference indicating that it is a novel variant of pedv designed as lushi ml bat coronavirus clearly these data support the evolutionary origin of pedv from bats huang et al 2013within the third cluster the newly-identified bat viruses fell into three lineages the newly-identified virus neixiang-64 in miniopterus schreibersii from neixiang formed a lineage with viruses in m fuliginosus kj4737991 and showed a close relationship with the hku8 virus chu et al 2008 notably the viruses from anlong were grouped into two lineages one of which contained miniopterus bat coronavirus 1 a afcd62 chu et al 2008 in sum our data reveal a high genetic diversity of alphacoronaviruses from bats in chinacomparison of the tree topologies of sarsr-rh-batcovs and their bat hosts revealed strong incongruence between the sarsr-rh-batcovs and their rhinolophus bats hosts at the species level with only two likely co-divergence events 
fig 6a similarly our co-phylogenetic analysis of alphacoronaviruses and their bat hosts provided evidence for 67 co-divergence events 1112 host switching events 0 lineage duplication 12 losses and 0 failure to diverge events fig 6b overall our co-phylogenetic analysis did not identify significant congruence between the phylogenetic trees of viruses and their bat hosts p004clearly more sarsr-rh-batcovs were identified in r sinicus and r ferrumequinum bats sampled from a variety of locations fig 2 as well as in r monoceros sampled from zhejiang province in addition the same virus could be identified in several species from the same geographic locality for example sarsr-rh-batcovs were identified in four species of rhinolophus bats from longquan zhejiang and in two bat species from anlong guizhou similarly neixiang md bat coronavirus alphacoronavirus was identified in six bat species sampled in anlong guizhou hence it is possible that high contact rates among some animal species may enable the acquisition and spread of covssince the discovery of sarsr-rh-batcovs in bats in 2005 lau et al 2005 li et al 2005 intense effort has focused on characterizing additional covs in bats leading to the identification of diverse sars-like viruses and other bat covs worldwide drexler et al 2014 hu et al 2015 huang et al 2016 woo et al 2006 more importantly recent studies provide more evidence that human covs including mers and sars viruses may have their ultimate ancestry in bats annan et al 2013 corman et al 2014 corman et al 2015 ge et al 2013 huynh et al 2012 hu et al 2015 ithete et al 2013 tao et al 2017 these results highlight the potential significance of detecting and characterizing of covs in bats before their emergence in humans herein we describe diverse sarsr-rh-batcovs and alphacoronaviruses including novel species in 13 species of bats sampled from three provinces in china with an overall prevalence of 684 as such these data reveal both the high genetic diversity and the wide geographic distribution of covs in diverse bats in chinaamong the known sarsr-rh-batcovs those discovered by yang et al 2015 are most closely related to human sars covs in the s gene 90 amino acid similarities but distant in the orf8 gene 43 amino acid similarities interestingly other covs have been described that are closely related to sars-covs in the orf8 gene but relatively distant in the s nsp2 nsp11 and orf3 genes table s2 lau et al 2015 wu et al 2016 in this study with the exception of the s and orf3 genes the viruses discovered in bats sampled in guizhou province were most closely related to sars-covs including the orf8 gene that all these sarsr-rh-batcovs were sampled in southwestern china provides evidence for the origin of sars-covs from bats in this regionto date sarsr-rh-batcovs have been detected in bats sampled from diverse geographic regions in china as well as in europe drexler et al 2010 notably the majority of sarsr-rh-batcovs have been discovered in chinese rhinolophus bats while only one study reported the detection of sars-related covs in chaerephon plicata bats sampled from yunnan province yang et al 2013 in our study a total of 1067 bats from 21 bat species were captured with sarsr-rh-batcovs identified in 5 species of rhinolophus bats although previous studies indicated that r sinicus and r ferrumequinum bats exhibited a higher prevalence of sars-related viruses lau et al 2005 li et al 2005 tang et al 2006 more sarsr-rh-batcovs were identified in r monoceros bats table s1 in sum these data suggest that sarsr-rh-batcovs may be specifically associated with rhinolophus batsit is commonly stated that all the alphacoronaviruses originate from bat species woo et al 2012 as may also be the case for the human covs nl63 and 229e corman et al 2015 tao et al 2017 in addition it is believed that pedv might have originated from bats although direct evidence is lacking huang et al 2013 in this study lushi mi bat coronaviruses discovered in bats m leucogaster m schreibersii from lushi and neixiang exhibited a close relationship to pedv especially in the o-mt domain 927 amino acid identity in addition all other viruses within the cluster were sampled from bats hence these data provide more compelling evidence that pedv may have originated from batsthe evolutionary history of rna viruses is characterized by both host switching and co-divergence li et al 2015 shi et al 2016 which also appears to be true of coronaviruses annan et al 2013 cui et al 2007 drexler et al 2014 lau et al 2010 lau et al 2012 lau et al 2013 tang et al 2006 vijaykrishna et al 2007 wertheim et al 2013 woo et al 2009 woo et al 2012 similarly to previous studies drexler et al 2010 ge et al 2013 lau et al 2005 li et al 2005 wu et al 2016 yang et al 2013 sarsr-rh-batcovs were mainly identified in rhinolophus bats but not in other bats even when sampled in the same locality eg in guizhou and henan in contrast alphacoronaviruses were mainly identified in non-rhinolophus bats and no alphacoronaviruses were discovered in the colony that only comprised rhinolophus bats finally it was noteworthy that a sarsr-rh-batcovs and neixiang md bat coronavirus alphacoronavirus were identified in several bat species from up to three families in the localities of anlong and longquan indicative of local inter-species transmission hence these data suggest that high contact rates among specific animal species enable the acquisition and spread of covsbats were captured alive with mist nets or harp traps in caves of natural roosts in guizhou henan and zhejiang provinces during 20122015 fig 1 bat species were initially identified by morphological examination and further confirmed by sequence analysis of the mt-cyt b gene guo et al 2013 all bats were anesthetized before surgery with every effort made to minimize suffering tissue samples including those from the rectum were collected from bats for coronavirus detectionwe extracted total dna from bat tissue samples using the dneasy blood  tissue kit qiagen valencia usa according to protocols suggested by the manufacturer total rna was extracted from fecal or tissue samples using trizol invitrogen carlsbad ca according to the manufacturers instructions coronavirus rna was detected by rt-pcr as described previously lau et al 2005 wang et al 2015 other coronavirus gene sequences were amplified using the primers designed based on the conserved regions of known genome sequencesrt-pcr amplicons were purified using the qiaquick gel extraction kit qiagen valencia usa according to the manufacturers recommendations purified dna 700 bp was subjected to a direct sequencing protocol while purified dna 700 bp was cloned into pmd18-t vector takara dalian china which was subsequently transformed into jm109-143 competent cells dna sequencing was performed with applied biosystems 377 gene sequencersfour representatives of cov in bats were selected for full-genome sequencing the initial pcr primer sets for pcr were designed from each pan-cov amplicon sequence andor from a conserved region in the cov rdrp as required walking primers were designed

were compiled for evolutionary analyses accordingly sequence alignments were performed using the mafft algorithm katoh and standley 2013 after alignment gaps and ambiguously aligned regions were removed using gblocks v091b talavera and castresana 2007 phylogenetic trees were estimated using the maximum likelihood ml method implemented in phyml v30 guindon et al 2010 with bootstrap support values calculated from 1000 replicate trees the best-fit amino acid substitution models were determined using mega version 5 tamura et al 2011full-length genomic sequences of the sl-covs longquan-140 anlong-103 and jiyuan-84 viruses were aligned with those of bat sarsr-rh-batcovs and other betacoronaviruses using mega 50 the aligned sequences were preliminarily scanned for recombination events using the recombination detection program 40 rdp4 employing the rdp geneconv and bootscan methods with default parameters martin et al 2015 the potential recombination events suggested by rdp ie those with strong p values were investigated further by similarity plots implemented in simplot 351 lole et al 1999 for each of the putative recombinant regions phylogenies were estimated using the maximum likelihood method available in phyml v30 guindon et al 2010co-phylogenetic analyses of bats hosts and their associated coronaviruses were conducted using the heuristic event-based method available in the jane software package conow et al 2010 we reconstructed patterns co-divergence and hence cross-species transmission using a weight of 0 for co-divergence and a weight of 1 for duplication host switching lineage loss and failure to diverge we used jane with 100 generations and a population size of 100 as parameters for the genetic algorithm to test the probability of observing the inferred co-divergence number by chance we employed the random tip mapping method with the generation number 100 population size 100 and sample size 50china has been the epicenter of emerging and reemerging viral infections that continue to stir a global concern in the last 20 years china has witnessed several emerging viral diseases including an avian influenza in 1997

the outbreak of viral pneumonia in wuhan is associated with history of exposure to virus reservoir at the huanan seafood wholesale market suggesting a possible zoonosis the seafood market also sold live animals such as snakes marmots birds frogs and hedgehogs currently there is no evidence suggesting a specific wildlife host as a virus reservoir studies of relative synonymous codon usage rscu bias between viruses and their hosts suggested that viruses tends to evolve codon usage bias that is comparable to their hosts

11
 results from our analysis suggest that 2019ncov has most similar genetic information with bat coronovirus and has most similar codon usage bias with snake more interestingly an originunknown homologous recombination may occured within the spike glycoprotein of the 2019ncov

 which may explain its crossspecies transmission and limited personperson spreadthe newly sequenced betacoronavirus mn908947 genome was downloaded from the genbank database five hundred closely related sequences were also downloaded from genbank out of them 271 genome sequences 19 000 bp in length were used in this study together with the abovedescribed betacoronavirus 2019ncov mn908947 genome sequence table s1 the geographic origins of the sequences were from bulgaria n  1 canada n  2 china n  67 germany n  1 hong kong n  5 italy n  1 kenya n  1 russia n  1 singapore n  24 south korea n  1 taiwan n  11 united kingdom n  2 united states of america n  67 and unknown n  88 sequences were aligned using mafft v7222

 support for the inferred relationships was evaluated by a bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates and trees were midpointrootedto investigate the putative parents of the 2019ncov we performed similarity and bootscanning plot analyses based on the kimura twoparameter model with a window size of 500 bp step size of 30 bp using simplot v351

 we divided our data set into four clades the newly discovered 2019ncov sequence was grouped as the query sequence the closest relative coronaviruses batslcovzc45 and batslcovzxc21 obtained from the city of nanjing china were grouped as clade a the other two coronaviruses btcovbm4831bgr2008 and btky72 from bulgaria and kenya were grouped as clade b the rest sequences were grouped as clade c figure 1to estimate the rscu bias of the 2019ncov and its potential hosts all avaliable coding sequences retaining coding sequences with atg primer and mutiple of 3 nucleotides excluding incorrect coding sequences of the 2019ncov genome 1cdss 9672 codons batslcovzc45 genome 1cdss 9680 codons bungarus multicinctus genes 38 cdss 5381 codons naja atra genes 64 cdss 9587 codons erinaceus europaeus genome cds 28947 cdss 16717458 codons marmota genes 36055cdss 21090600 codons manis javanica genome cds 39192 cdss 22980491 codons rhinolophus sinicus genes 10 cdss 8081 codons and gallus gallus genome cds 49453 cdss 36086657 codons from genbank were calculated with codon w142

 the coronavirus and their potential hosts were clustered using a euclidean distance methodphylogenetic analysis of 276 coronavirus genomes revealed that the newly identified coronavirus 2019ncov sequence was monophyletic with 100 bootstrap support the clade a batslcovzc45 and batslcovzxc21 derived from bats in the city of nanjing china between 2015 and 2017 represents the sister lineage to 2019ncov the clade b btcovbm4831bgr2008 and btky72 obtained from bats in bulgaria and kenya between 2005 and 2007 formed a distinct monophyletic cluster with 100 bootstrap support the clade c including 267 coronavirus strains was clustered together with 63 bootstrap support figure 1 this suggest that 2019ncov has most similar genetic information with bat coronovirushomologous recombination is an important evolutionary force and previous studies have found that homologous recombination occurred in many viruses including dengue virus

 similarity plot analysis of the 2019ncov revealed that homologous recombination may occurred between clade a strains batcoronaviruses and the originunknown isolates located within the spike glycoprotein that recognizes cell surface receptor figure 2 these characteristics indicate that crossspecies transmission may be caused by homologous recombinationas parasitic microorganism virus codon usage pattern resembles its host to some extent the rscu bias shows that the 2019ncov batslcovzc45 and snakes from china have similar synonymous codon usage bias figure 3a table 1 the squared euclidean distance indicates that the 2019ncov and snakes from china have the highest similarity in synonymous codon usage bias compared to those of bat bird marmota human manis and hedgehog and figure 3b two types of snakes containing b multicinctus manybanded krait and n atra chinese cobra were used for rscu analysis squared euclidean distance between the 2019ncov and b multicinctus is 1354 the distance between the 2019ncov and another snake n atra is 1669 the distance between the 2019ncov and rhinolophus sinicus is 2346 however the distance between the 2019ncov and other animals is greater than 26 specifically 2693 for bird 3479 for marmota 3536 for human 3671 for manis and 3796 for hedgehog these data suggest that the 2019ncov might more effectively use snakes translation machinery than that of other animalstwo types of snakes are common in southeastern china including the city of wuhan figure 4 geographical distributions of b multicinctus include taiwan the central and southern china hong kong myanmar burma laos and northern vietnam

n atra is found in southeastern china hong kong northern laos northern vietnam and taiwan
25
 snakes were also sold at the huanan seafood wholesale market where many patients worked or had a history of exposure to wildlife or farm animalsin this study we have performed an evolutionary analysis using 272 genomic sequences of coronaviruses obtained from various geographic locations our results show that the novel coronavirus sequence obtained from the viral pneumonia outbreak occurring in the city of wuhan forms a separate group that is highly distinctive to sarscov the sarscov first emerged in china in 2002 and then spread to 37 countriesregions in 2003 and caused a travelrelated global outbreak with 96 mortality rate
26
 more importantly results from our analysis reveal a homologous recombination may occurred between the bat coronavirus and an originunknown coronavirus within the viral spike glycoprotein gene sequence homology analysis of the partial spike glycoprotein genes 1783 bp from the 2019ncov was done through blast at the ncbi website interestingly no similar sequence was found with known sequence in the database suggesting that a putative recombination parent virus was still unknown previous study suggested that the recombination of sars in the spike glycoprotein genes might have mediated the initial crossspecies transmission event from bats to other mammals
27
 bootscanning plot analysis data not shown suggested that the major parents of the 2019ncov originated from clade a batslcovzc45 and batslcovzxc21 but formed a monophyletic cluster different from them overall the ancestral origin of the 2019ncov was more likely from divergent host species rather than sarscovthe host range of some animal coronaviruses was promiscuous

 they caught our attention only when they caused human diseases such as sars mers and 2019ncov pneumonia

28
 it is critical to determine the animal reservoir of the 2019ncov to understand the molecular mechanism of its crossspecies spread homologous recombination within viral structural proteins between coronaviruses from different hosts may be responsible for crossspecies transmission
27
 information obtained from rscu analysis provides some insights to the question of wildlife animal reservoir although it requires further validation by experimental studies in animal models currently the 2019ncov has not been isolated from animal species although it was obtained from one patient identifying and characterizing the animal reservoir for 2019ncov will be helpful for investigation of the recombination and for a better understanding of its persontoperson spread among human populationsthe 2019ncov has caused a total of 217 confirmed cases of pneumonia in china as of 20 january 2020 with new patients also reported in hong kong thailand singapore south korea and japan unlike sarscov the 2019ncov appeared to initially cause a mild form of viral pneumonia and have limited capability for personperson spread this might be due to the recombination occurred within the receptorbinding glycoprotein however there is a concern about its adaptation in humans that may acquire the capability to replicate more efficiently and spread more rapidly via close personperson contactin summary results derived from our evolutionary analysis suggest that 2019ncov has most similar genetic information with bat coronovirus and has most similar codon usage bias with snake additionally a homologous recombination may occured within the viral receptorbinding spike glycoprotein which may determine crossspecies transmission these novel findings warrant future investigation to experimentally determine if homologous recombination within the spike glycoprotein determine the tropism of the 2019ncov in viral transmission and replication new information obtained from our evolutionary analysis is highly significant for effective control of the outbreak caused by the 2019ncovinduced pneumoniathe authors declare that there are no conflict of interestswriting wj and xl data collection jz ww and xz data analysis wj and xlin the early years of nucleic acid sequencing aggregation of the majority of published dna and rna sequences into public sequence databases greatly aided biological hypothesis generation and discovery search tools capable of interrogating the ever-expanding databases were facilitated by creative algorithm development and software engineering and by the ever-increasing capabilities of computer hardware and the internet in the early 2000s sequencing methodologies and computational technologies advanced in tandem enabling quick homology results from a novel sequence without substantial costwith the development of larger-scale sequencing methodologies the time and resources to search all extant sequence data became untenable for most studies however creative approaches involving curated databases and feature searches ensured that many key features of novel sequences remained readily accessible at the same time the nascent field of metagenomics began with numerous studies highlighting the power of survey sequencing of dna and rna from samples as diverse as the human gut and antarctic soil 1 2 as the diversity and size of such data sets expand the utility of searching them with a novel sequence increases meta-metagenomic searches are currently underutilized in principle such searches would involve direct access to sequence data from a large set of metagenomic experiments on a terabyte scale along with software able to search for similarity to a query sequence we find that neither of these aspects of meta-metagenomic searches is infeasible with current data transfer and processing speeds in this communication we report the results of searching the recently described severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 sequence through a set of metagenomic data sets with the virome tagi computing hardware a linux workstation used for the bulk analysis of metagenomic data sets employs an 8-core i7 intel microprocessor 128 gigabyte gb of random access memory 12 terabytes tb of conventional disk storage and 1 tb of solid state drive ssd storage additional analyses of individual alignments were conducted with standard consumer-grade computersii sequence data all sequence data for this analysis were downloaded from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi website with individual sequences downloaded through a web interface and metagenomic data sets downloaded from the ncbi sequence read archive sra using the sra-tools package version 291 the latter sequence data were downloaded as sra files using the prefetch tool with extraction to readable format fastagz using the ncbi fastq-dump tool each of these manipulations can fail some fraction of the time obtaining the sequences can fail due to network issues while extraction in readable format occasionally fails for unknown reasons thus we developed a set of scripts implementing a workflow that continually requests sra files with ncbi-prefetch until at least some type of file is obtained followed by attempts to unpack into fastagz format until one such file is obtained from each sra file metagenomic data sets for analysis were chosen through a keyword search of the sra descriptions for virome and downloaded between 27 january 2020 and 31 january 2020 we note that the virome keyword search will certainly not capture every metagenomic data set with viral sequences and likewise not capture every virus in the short sequence read archive despite these clear limitations the virome keyword search identified a broad and diverse set of experimental data sets for further analysis with up to 16 threads running simultaneously total download time prefetch was approximately 2 days similar time was required for conversion to gzipped fasta files a total of 9014 sequence data sets were downloaded and converted to fastagz files most files as expected contained large numbers of reads while a small fraction contained very little data only a few reads or reads of at most a few base pairs the total data set consists of 25 tb of compressed sequence data corresponding to approximately 1013 basesiii search software for rapid identification of close matches among large numbers of metagenomic reads we used a simple dictionary based on the sars-cov-2 sequence our query sequence for sars-cov-2 was genbank accession no mn9089473 and its reverse complement querying every 8th k-mer along the individual reads for matches to the sequence as a reference and to benchmark the workflow further we included several additional sequences in the query vaccinia virus an arbitrary segment of an influenza virus isolate the full sequence of bacteriophage p4 and a number of putative polinton sequences from caenorhabditis briggsae the relatively small group of k-mers being queried 106 allows a rapid search for homologs this was implemented in a python script run using the pypy accelerated interpreter we stress that this is by no means the most comprehensive or fastest search for large data sets however it is more than sufficient to rapidly find any closely matching sequence with the downloading and conversion of the data rather than the search being rate limiting while the high degree of conservation between isolates of individual coronaviruses and between related coronaviruses 3 4 facilitates this very simple approach to pattern matching for discovery of closely related viruses in this family alternative approaches with more-sensitive matching algorithms for other gene or virus families would require only minimally expanded computing resources 5iv alignment of reads to sars-cov-2 reads from the pangolin hit data sets were adapter rimmed with cutadapt version 118 6 and mapped to the sars-cov-2 genome with bwa-mem version 0712 7 using default settings for paired-end mode alignments were visualized with the integrated genomics viewer igv tool version 2410 8v assessment of nucleotide similarity between sars-cov-2 pangolin metavirome reads and closely related bat coronaviruses all pangolin metavirome reads that aligned to the sars-cov-2 genome with bwa-mem after adapter trimming with cutadapt were used for calculation the bat coronavirus genomes were aligned to the sars-cov-2 genome in a multiple sequence alignment using the web interface for clustal omega httpswwwebiacuktoolsmsaclustalo 9 with default settings we note that sequence insertions with respect to the sars-cov-2 genome in either the pangolin metavirome reads or the bat coronavirus genomes are not accounted for in the similarity traces shown in fig 1bvi regional assessment of synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations although the incomplete nature of coverage in the pangolin metavirome data somewhat limits the application of measures such as normalized dnds ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous evolutionary changes values it remains possible to identify regions with the strongest matches of this inferred viral sequence with the human and bat homologs and to determine the distribution of synonymous and nonsynonymous variants in these regions details of this analysis are presented in fig s3 in the supplemental materialvii accessibility of software scripts used for the observations described in this communication are available at httpsgithubcomfirelabsoftwaremetasearch2020to identify biological niches that might harbor viruses closely related to sars-cov-2 we searched through publicly available metavirome data sets we were most interested in viruses with highly similar sequences as these would likely be most useful in forming hypotheses about the origin and pathology of the recent human virus we thus set a threshold requiring matching of a perfect 32-nucleotide segment with a granularity of 8 nucleotides in the search ie interrogating the complete database of k-mers from the virus with k-mers starting at nucleotide 1 9 17 25 33 of each read from the metagenomic data for a perfect match this would catch any perfect match of 39 nucleotides or greater regardless of phasing relative to the 8-base search granularity with some homologies as short as 32 nucleotides captured depending on the precise phasing of the readall metagenomic data sets with the keyword virome in ncbi sra as of january 2020 were selected for analysis in a process that required approximately 2 days each for downloading and conversion to readable file formats and 1 day for searching by k-mer match on a desktop workstation computer i7 8-core together the data sets included information from 9014 ncbi short read archive entries with in total 62  1010 individual reads and 84  1012 bp despite the relatively large mass of data the 32-nucleotide k-mer match remains a stringent measure with spurious matches to the 30-kb sars-cov-2 genome expected at only 1 in 3  1014 positive matches among the metagenomic data sets analyzed were relatively rare with the vast majority of data sets 89949014 or 998 showing no matched 32-mers to sars-cov-2 of the data sets with matched k-mers one was from a synthetic mixture of viral sequences that included a feline alphacoronavirus 10 while the remaining were all from vertebrate animal sources the latter matches were from five studies two bat-focused studies 11 12 one bird-focused study 13 one study focused on small animals and rodents 14 and a study of pangolins 15 table 1the abundance and homology of viruses within a metagenomic sample are of considerable interest in interpreting possible characteristics of infection and relevance to the query virus from the quick k-mer search an initial indicator could be inferred from the number of matching reads and k-mer match counts for those reads table 1 see also table s1 in the supplemental material for the sars-cov-2 matches among the available metagenomic data sets the strongest and most abundant matches in these analyses came from the pangolin lung metaviromes the matches were observed throughout the sars-cov-2 query sequence and many of the matching reads showed numerous matching 32-mer sequences the vast majority of matches were in two lung sampleslung07 and lung 08with small numbers of matches in two additional lung data sets lung02 and lung09 15 no matches were detected for seven additional lung data sets and no matches were seen in eight spleen samples and a lymph node sample 15 further analysis of coverage and homology through alignment of the metagenomic data sets revealed an extensive if incomplete coverage of the sars-cov-2 genome fig 1a and fig s1a to c percent nucleotide similarity can be calculated for pangolin metavirome reads aligning to sars-cov-2 fig 1b and these segmental homologies consistently showed strong matches approaching but still overall weaker than the similarity of the closest known bat coronavirus ratg13 a provisional comparison of synonymous differences at the nucleotide level between the pangolin reads bat coronavirus ratg13 and sars-cov-2 was also feasible for genes where pangolin sequences were available and readily aligned many synonymous generally codon third base changes were visible in such comparisons fig s2 and s3 comparisons of ratg13 to sars-cov-2 revealed synonymous changes at 10 of conserved amino acid residues while comparisons of the aggregate but incomplete pangolin reads indicated synonymous changes at 23 of conserved amino acid residues within the receptor binding domain rbd of the spike protein 16 these values are 26 and 34 respectivelythe potential structural implications of protein sequence divergence in the rbd region of the spike protein were explored through combined sequence-directed structural alignment the bat coronavirus ratg13 rbd is markedly divergent relative to the sars-cov-2 rbd with several amino acid differences located at the ace-2 receptor-rbd interface fig s4 with coordinate information shown in text s1 in the supplemental material 17 thus changes in these amino acid sequences as previously described 17 and shown for comparison in fig s4 could be expected to influence interactions with the human ace-2 receptor in the case of the pangolin sequences amino acid changes relative to the sars-cov-2 rbd seem to be for the most part located outside of the ace-2 interface with the exception of two residues 417 and 498 at the interface 17 18 overall the sars-cov-2 and inferred pangolin virus amino acid sequences differ at seven positions in the rbd residues 346 372 402 417 498 519 and 529 fig s4meta-metagenomic searching can provide unique opportunities to understand the distribution of nucleic acid sequences in diverse environmental niches as metagenomic data sets proliferate and as both the need and capability to identify pathogenic agents through sequencing increase meta-metagenomic searching may prove extremely useful in tracing the origins and spreading of causative agents in the example we present in this paper such a search identifies a number of niches with sequences matching the genome of the sars-cov-2 virus these analyses raise a number of relevant points for the origin of sars-cov-2 before describing the details of these points however it is important to stress that while environmental clinical and animal-based sequencing is valuable in understanding how viruses traverse the animal ecosphere static sequence distributions cannot be used to construct the full transmission history of a virus among different biological niches so even if the closest relative of a virus-causing disease in species x were to be found in species y we cannot define the source of the outbreak or the directions of transmission as some viruses may move more than once between hosts the sequence of a genome at any time may reflect a history of selection and drift in several different host species this point is also accentuated in the microcosm of our searches for this work when we originally obtained the sars-cov-2 sequence from the posted work of wu et al 3 we recapitulated their result that bat-sl-covzc45 was the closest related sequence in ncbis nonredundant nrnt database in our screen of metavirome data sets we observed several pangolin metavirome sequences which were not in the ncbi nrnt database at the time that are more closely related to sars-cov-2 than bat-sl-covzc45 an assumption that the closest relative of a sequence identifies the origin would at that point have transferred the extant model to zoonosis from pangolin instead of bat to complicate such a model an additional study from zhou et al 4 described a previously unpublished coronavirus sequence designated ratg13 with much stronger homology to sars-cov-2 than either bat-sl-covzc45 or the pangolin reads from liu et al 15 while this observation certainly shifts the discussion legitimately toward a possible bat-borne intermediate in the chain leading to sars-cov-2 it remains difficult to determine if any of these are true intermediates in the chain of infectivitythe match of sars-cov-2 to the pangolin coronavirus sequences also enables a link to substantial context on the pangolin samples from liu et al 15 with information on the source of the rescued animals from smuggling activity the nature of their deaths despite rescue efforts the potential presence of other viruses in the same whole-lung tissue and the accompanying gross pathology the pangolins appear to have died from lung-related illness which may have involved a sars-cov-2-homologous virus notably however two of the deceased pangolin lungs had much lower sars-cov-2 signals while seven showed no signal with sequencing depths in the various lungs roughly comparable although it remains possible that the sars-cov-2-like coronavirus was the primary cause of death for these animals it is also possible as noted by liu et al 15 that the virus was simply present in the tissue with mortality due to another virus a combination of infectious agents or other exposuresduring the course of this work the homology between sars-cov-2 and pangolin coronavirus sequences in a particular genomic subregion was also noted and discussed in an online forum virologicalorg with some extremely valuable analyses and insights matthew wong and colleagues bring up the homology to the pangolin metagenomic data sets in this thread and appear to have encountered it through a more targeted search than ours this study has since been posted online on biorxiv 19 as noted by wong et al 19 the spike region includes a segment of 200 nucleotides encompassing the rbd where the inferred divergence between ratg13 and sars-cov-2 dramatically increases this region is of interest as it is a key determinant of viral host range and under heavy selection 20 the observed spike region divergence indeed includes a substantial set of nonsynonymous differences fig s2 and s3 notably while reads from the pangolin lung data sets mapped to this region do not show a similar increase in variation relative to sars-cov-2 we also did not observe a significant drop in variation between sars-cov-2 and pangolin sequences in this region fig s2 and s3 instead variation in the region is comparable to numerous other conserved regions of the spike and to the viral genome as a whole while wong et al 19 and others 2128 raised the model that recombination occurred in the rbd region in the derivation of sars-cov-2 the lack of a singular dip in the landscape of pangolin-sars-cov-2 variation in the region would seem counterintuitive were sars-cov-2 a result of a localized recombination between a close relative of ratg13 and a close relative of the putative pangolin coronaviruses under consideration thus alternative models for the observed sequence variation seem important to consider and indeed parsimonious including that of selection acting on the ratg13 sequences in bats or another intermediate host resulting in a rapid variation of the amino acids at the highly critical virus-receptor interface overall definitive conclusions regarding the origins of sars-cov-2 or other coronaviruses will remain difficult with limited sequencing data and without knowledge of evolutionary trajectories in different lineages 29 30a number of literature contributions now discuss the potential role for bats pangolins and other possible progenitorintermediate species in derivation of sars-cov-2 from different approaches and perspectives with a diversity of approaches and interpretations in understanding the origin of the virus in particular there has been extensive discussion and debate about the possible pangolin origin of sars-cov-2 19 2128 3141 these studies provide useful insights into the evolution of sars-cov-2 but have limitations and uncertainty in drawing conclusions regarding the viral origin as most studies were mainly performed through sequence-based comparison and simulation thus better understanding of the current pandemic requires additional information on investigational experimental and epidemiological levels that may resolve questions of origin and of preventing the reemergence of sars-cov-2 and other pathogens nevertheless the availability of numerous paths both targeted and agnostic toward identification of natural niches for pathogenic sequences including our meta-metagenomic search will remain useful to the scientific community and to public health as will vigorous sharing of ideas data and discussion of potential origins and modes of spread for epidemic pathogenscoronaviruses are enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses with a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry 1 coronaviruses have been widely identified as causing respiratory and intestinal infections in humans after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in guangdong china in 2002 and 2003 2 3 sars was determined to be caused by sars-cov and emerged in a market where civets were sold 2 3 only a decade later the world witnessed another outbreak in the form of middle east respiratory syndrome mers caused by mers-cov in the middle east 4 5 while the researchers were still investigating the underlying mechanisms of pathogenicity and developing effective therapeutic strategies against mers the world witnessed the deadliest outbreak in the form of covid-19 6 the causative coronavirus of this outbreak was named sars-cov-2 due to its resemblance to sars-cov 79 the sars-cov infects ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type-ii pneumocytes through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a receptor 2 10 mers infects unciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type-ii pneumocytes by using dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 also known as cd26 as a receptor 2 11 the mechanisms associated with the infectiousness of sars-cov-2 are not clear however structural analysis suggests it is likely entering human cells through the ace2 receptor 12 this newly emerged virus has much greater similarity to sars-cov than to mers-cov thus both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 may cause pathogenesis through similar mechanisms the transmission of sars-cov to humans was reported from market civets while that of mers-cov was from dromedary camels 13 14 similarly the newly emerged sars-cov-2 also appears to be transmitted to humans from markets where wild animals are sold 8 however the zoonotic source of its transmission is not yet clear according to previous reports the aforementioned three coronaviruses are thought to have originated in bats 2 11 15 16since the first epidemic of sars the pathogenic coronaviruses have harmed thousands of people worldwide 1 17 considering the adverse outcomes of the current covid-19 epidemic developing effective therapeutic strategies is necessary to cope with the lack of effective drugs high mortality rate and the potential of the virus to cause further epidemics in this review we focus on the origin evolution and pathogenicity of sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 we also discuss the therapeutic options for sars-cov-2 given its importance in the current scenario of covid-19 outbreak in wuhan china this review will be useful in preparing against future outbreaks and continuing pathogenic infections by this class of novel coronaviruses virulent to humanscoronaviruses are members of the subfamily coronavirinae family coronaviridae order nidovirales which contains four genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus 2 gamma- and deltacoronaviruses generally infect birds although some of them can cause infection in mammals whereas alpha- and betacoronaviruses are known to harm humans and animals the viruses sars-cov betacoronavirus 229e alphacoronavirus hku1 betacoronavirus nl63 alphacoronavirus oc43 betacoronavirus and mers-cov betacoronavirus can all cause infections in humans 2 however betacoronaviruses are the most important group because they comprise the most highly pathogenic viruses against humans including sars-cov-2 mers-cov and sars-cov 2 18 19 the highly pathogenic mers and sars coronaviruses originated in bats 2 18 19 however the origin of the newly emerged sars-cov-2 remains debatable investigations have revealed that the sars-cov strains detected in market civets 20 21 were transmitted from horseshoe bats 22 these viruses were found to be phylogenetically related to sars-cov in bats from china europe southeast asia and africa 2 22 23 in addition the genome sequences of sars-cov strains isolated from humans were highly similar to those in bats 21 however some variations were found among the s gene and orf3 and orf8 gene sequences which encode a binding and fusion protein and dispensable proteins for replication respectively 2 23 nevertheless clade2 of the s genetic region 22 24 orf8 23 and orf3b in sars-cov from bats contain major variations compared to sars-cov from humans 23different strains of mers-cov obtained from camels were found to be similar to those isolated from humans 14 25 26 except for variations among the s orf4b and orf3 genomic regions 26 furthermore genome sequencing-based studies have revealed that mers-cov strains from humans are phylogenetically related to those from bats the strains have identical genomic and protein structures except for the s proteins 27 in addition recombination analysis of genes encoding orf1ab and s revealed that mers-cov originated from the exchange of genetic elements between coronaviruses in camels and bats 26 28although the zoonotic source of sars-cov-2 is not confirmed its genome sequence exhibits close relatedness 88 identity with two bat-derived sars-like coronaviruses bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 phylogenetic analysis reveals that sars-cov-2 is genetically distinct from sars-cov and mers-cov however homology modeling reveals that both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 have similar receptor-binding domain structures despite amino acid variation at some key residues including the absence of the 8a protein and the fluctuation in the number of amino acids in the 8b and 3c proteins in sars-cov2 29 in contrast the primary protease is highly conserved between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov with a 96 overall identity 30 these observations suggest that bats are the source of origin while an animal sold at the wuhan seafood market might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans 12 31after the emergence of sars-cov in the guangdong province of china it rapidly spread around the globe 2 3 during november 2002 an epidemic of pneumonia with a high rate of transmission to other people occurred in guangdong china 32 followed by subsequent outbreaks in hong kong in hong kong a total of 138 people contracted the infection within 2 weeks after the exposure to an infected patient in the general ward of a hospital 1 32 overall sars-cov infected 8098 people and caused 774 fatalities in 29 different countries by the end of the epidemic 1 later during june 2012 a patient infected by mers-cov developed severe pneumonia and died in jeddah saudi arabia 1 33 analysis of cluster of nosocomial cases in jordan during april 2012 confirmed that mers-cov caused the outbreak 34 the spread of mers-cov continued beyond the middle east causing further reports of infected individuals 1 4 until 2020 2468 cases and 851 fatalities had been reported globally 35 36 during december 2019 clusters of patients with atypical pneumonia were reported by local health facilities in wuhan china on december 31 2019 a rapid response team was dispatched by the chinese center for disease control and prevention china cdc to conduct an epidemiologic and etiologic investigation 37 the patients were found epidemiologically linked to the wet animal wholesale seafood market in wuhan china later the infectious agent responsible for this atypical pneumonia was confirmed and reported as coronavirus sars-cov-2 which caused the first fatality in early january 2020 15 during the first 6 weeks of the outbreak several cases were reported in more than 37 countries including the usa japan iran and south korea 38 the infection rapidly spread across the globe from wuhan china therefore the chinese authorities implemented several strategies including massive lockdown in wuhan and suspension of transport to and from wuhan to control the spread 17 according to situation report 35 published on the who website sars-cov-2 caused 79331 confirmed cases and 2618 deaths around the globe however covid-19 caused 77262 confirmed cases and 2595 deaths inside mainland china alone 38 through february 24 who had reported 8 deaths in iran it is now the second country after china bearing the highest fatalities due to sars-cov-2 infection 38 the spread of sars-cov-2 in iran poses a higher risk of pandemics in the middle east and south asian countries between december 10 and january 4 analysis of the growth rate of the epidemic gave a basic reproductive number r0 of 22 meaning each patient has been spreading the infection to 22 other individuals 39 the estimated r0 value for sars was around 3 however sars was successfully controlled by isolation of patients 39 moreover the r0 for mers ranged from 045 in saudi arabia to 81 in south korea 36 considering the lower r0 value the rapid increase in suspected as well confirmed cases of covid-19 may be inferred via viral transmission through the fecal-oral route and aerosol formation moreover asymptomatic persons are thought to be potential sources of sars-cov-2 infection 40 which may have caused the rapid spread of sars-cov-2 this asymptomatic spread may be one reason that the control strategy based on the isolation of patients has not been fully successful to overcome these problems a complete quarantine is necessary allowing all of the infected individuals to develop symptoms without spreading the virus randomly thus the direct and indirect contacts of infected individuals can be easily identified and isolatedclinical features associated with patients infected with sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 range from mild respiratory illness to severe acute respiratory disease 1 17 both mers and sars patients in later stages develop respiratory distress and renal failure 1 17 pneumonia appears to be the most frequent manifestation of sars-cov-2 infection characterized primarily by fever cough dyspnea and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging 17 the period from infection to appearance of symptoms varies generally it is thought to be 14 days however a research group at guangzhou medical university reported the incubation period to be 24 days in a family cluster of infections the onset of fever and respiratory symptoms occurred approximately 3 to 6 days after presumptive exposure 41diagnostic testing for the sars-cov-2 is primarily done in public health laboratories delays in testing result from the need for administrative oversight of testing at the national or regional level as well as the time needed to transport specimens and the high volume of testing needed in some regions more rapid testing should be widely available in the event of epidemics high-level testing facilities at regional hospitals and commercial laboratories are needed in addition to the commercially available tests that have undergone regulatory approval several tests have been validated by public health authorities including those in china germany thailand japan and the united states who covid-19 technical guidance feb 12 2020 these tests are reverse transcriptase pcr rt-pcr tests that use primers and probes designed to detect a variety of targets in the sars-cov-2 genome although these have been designed and validated there is currently very limited information available related to the performance of these tests the sensitivity and specificity of the tests are not widely known and some of them might detect other related coronaviruses such as sars-cov in addition the utility of different specimen types for detection of the viruses is not known as a result testing of multiple specimen types is recommended by some agencies including the cdc 42 the availability of serological tests is unclear and presumably such tests are in development moreover the collection and submission of sera from potentially infected patients is recommended by some public health laboratoriesthe cdc and who have both issued recommendations for laboratory safety when testing specimens from patients suspected of being infected with sars-cov-2 42 43 both guidelines recommend that manipulation of potentially infectious specimens should be done in a biosafety cabinet if there is potential for splashes or generation of droplets or aerosols viral isolation culture should be done only in bl-3 laboratories testing in chemistry and hematology laboratories can be done following routine laboratory precautions recommended for such workcurrently there are no promising antiviral treatments available however numerous compounds have been proven effective against sars-cov and mers-cov but have not been tested widely for the newly emerged sars-cov-2 remdesivir and chloroquine were found highly effective in vitro for the control of 2019-ncov infection 44 treatment with remdesivir alone or in combination with chloroquine or interferon beta was found effective against covid-19 infection this strategy has not caused any obvious side effects yet 35 44 45 however more investigations are necessary to confirm the impacts of remdesivir as coronaviruses share key genomic elements common therapeutic targets are likely to be of greater importance therapeutic agents targeting nucleosides nucleotides viral nucleic acids and enzymesproteins involved in the replication and transcription of coronaviruses can be promising strategies to treat coronavirus diseases table 1 1 the surface spike glycoprotein s is an important potential target for antiviral agents due to its vital role in the interaction between the virus and the cell receptor s consists of two subunits s1 the amino-terminal receptor binding subunit and s2 the carboxy-terminal membrane fusion subunit 46 in addition activation of membrane fusion and virus entry requires the cleavage at the junction of s1-s2 46 hence s1 subunit-targeting monoclonal antibodies and s2 subunit-targeting fusion inhibitors may be effective therapeutic agents for coronaviruses 1 furin a serine endoprotease cleaves off s1s2 47 could thus be a suitable antiviral agent further the helical nucleocapsid interacts with s protein envelope proteins and membrane proteins to form the assembled virion 1 therefore targeting the structural genes using small interfering rnas could be an effective therapeutic strategy against coronaviruses 1 the host receptors are also associated with the viral entry into host cells thus agents targeting these receptors also inhibit coronaviruses 46 inhibitors of endosomal cysteine protease and transmembrane protease serine 2 can partially block viral entry into the cell 48 k22 targets membrane-bound rna synthesis in coronaviruses and inhibits double-membrane vesicle formation 49 and thus could be effective against sars-cov-2broad-spectrum antivirals such as dsrna-activated caspase oligomerizer draco which selectively induces apoptosis in virus-containing host cells provide another class to evaluate for effectiveness against sars-cov-2 50 however this class does not provide a promising strategy alone as they cannot block virus entry or disrupt viral nucleic acid in contrast thiopurine compounds naphthalene inhibitors protease inhibitors zinc and mercury conjugates target 3clpro 3c-like protease and plpro papain-like protease enzymes in coronaviruses and have been shown to block their pathogenicity 51 52 therefore combinational therapy of these antiviral agents with draco may enhance the overall impact on the recovery of patients despite the higher rate of infectiousness coronaviruses are thought to have the ability to suppress counteracting responses from host innate interferons this response can be augmented by the utilization of interferon inducers or recombinant interferons 1 recombinant interferons such as interferon alpha and interferon beta that have been tested against sars-cov 1 might be utilized either alone or in combination with other potential antiviral drugs including remdesivir both interferon alpha and beta inhibit viral replication 1 the use of interferon inducers in combination with effective antiviral agents is worth evaluating for possible synergistic effects against sars-cov-2 in addition calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine 53 in combination with antibiotics and traditional chinese medicines could also be evaluated for activity against sars-cov-2effective vaccines are important to prevent and control sporadic viral attacks and emerging virus-mediated epidemics such as the recent outbreak caused by sars-cov-2 although sars-cov was fully controlled during 2003 and mers-cov has been prevented from causing high mortality rates the newly emerged sars-cov-2 is spreading efficiently with a significant increase in the number of cases and fatalities during each passing day vaccines are required to prevent sars-cov-2 from causing covid-19 live-attenuated vaccines such as has been designed for sars 1 may be evaluated for sars-cov-2 infected patients in addition rhesus -defensin 1 and protein cage nanoparticles are innate immunomodulators with high anti-sars-cov efficiency 54 55 based on the high similarity and phylogenetic relatedness between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 protein cage nanoparticles designed for sars-cov can be evaluated for sars-cov-2 meanwhile following similar strategies utilized for sars-cov novel protein cage nanoparticles specified for novel coronavirus can be designed on an emergency basis given the urgency in the current scenario of covid-19 outbreak vaccination strategies based on viral vectors recombinant protein and viral-like particles which have been developed or are being developed for sars andor mers could be modified for utilization against sars-cov-2 56 despite the current progress further work is needed to develop safe and effective vaccines available for individuals at high risk of sars-cov-2 endemics to control the ongoing and risk of future epidemics further an interesting feature of plasma from recovered patients is the presence of active antibodies the transfer of plasma from people who have recovered from covid-19 into infected individuals might enhance immunity against sars-cov-2 monoclonal antibodies that could inhibit virus-cell receptor binding and interrupt virus-cell fusion have been developed 1 combining two or more monoclonal antibodies may be suitable for the quicker recovery of patients lastly antiviral peptides that target different regions of s such as hp2p-m2 peptide effective against viral infections 1 should also be considered against covid-19although some strategies against sars-cov are being developed including receptor-binding domain rbd-based vaccines they require further evaluation 2 given the importance of the current outbreak in wuhan further studies are needed to deepen understanding of replication pathogenesis and biological properties using reverse genetics and related molecular techniques these investigations will help the control and prevention of sars-cov-2-mediated pneumonia disease and novel emerging diseases in the futuresars-cov and mers-cov were reported to originate from recombination within bat viruses before their introduction into guangdong province through civets and the middle east through camels respectively some of the sars-cov strains became epidemic after several independent spillovers to humans during the outbreak of 2002 in guangdong china 3 similarly mers-cov became epidemic after a series of human infections in 2012 in middle eastern countries 33 both viruses transferred to several countries beyond the countries of origin however unlike the continuous propagation of the mers-cov epidemic the sars-cov outbreak was successfully controlled in 2003 based on the origin of other coronaviruses sars-cov-2 is likely to have originated in bats and have been introduced to wuhan china through an unknown intermediate until now no effective clinical treatments or prevention strategies are available to be used against human coronavirusestesting drugs against coronaviruses requires suitable animal models prior to their use in humans the currently established models are not very promising for the studies of pathogenesis and treatment of highly pathogenic coronaviruses for instance nonhuman primates were unable to reproduce the characteristics of the severe human disease and mortality was not observed 57 however some small animals have developed clinical symptoms of disease 57 such as transgenic mice expressing human ace2 and mouse-adapted sars-cov strains are one of the most suitable models 1 additionally transgenic mice expressing human dpp4 are a suitable small animal model for mers 1 like the animal models for sars-cov transgenic animal models may also be standardized for sars-cov-2 the development of clinical drugs for coronaviruses is challenging because of the repeated emergence of novel coronaviruses with diverse features thus requiring specific drugs for each newly emerged virus moreover only a limited number of animal models are available and most of them can only be used in highly demanding biosafety level 3 labs 1 from the perspective of the current outbreak designing effective therapeutics for sars-cov-2 is yet another challenge for scientists although a large number of antiviral treatment options for sars and mers have been reported with potent in vitro activities a very limited number of these may have potential in the clinical settingmoving forward there are treatment options available that could be utilized clinically during the ongoing sars-cov-2 epidemic some of the broad-spectrum antiviral drugs may be effective for sars-cov-2 and there is opportunity to test them in the current scenario of pneumonia in wuhan china broad-range combinational therapies including lopinavir and interferon antiviral peptides can also be evaluated and examined as these agents have shown significant effects against mers in nonhuman primates 1 the design and development of novel broad-spectrum antiviral drugs that can potentially target all coronaviruses may prove to be the best treatment option against reemerging and circulating coronavirusesunprecedented levels of international cooperation led to the sequencing of two sars viral genomes within 6 weeks of the identification of atypical pneumonia in hong kong20 21 alignment to the genomes of known groups 1 2 and 3 coronaviruses showed that sars coronavirus is phylogenetically distinct and only distantly related to the other coronavirus clades these early analyses showed that sars coronavirus is not a recently evolved pathogen and group 4 was proposed within which to classify the novel coronavirus20 21 subsequent alignment of the sars coronavirus replicase open reading frame orf 1b about 5500 bp genome segment using the genus torovirus order nidovirales to root the tree suggested that sars coronavirus represents an early split-off from the coronavirus group 2 lineage22 and should be thought of as a group 2 subgroup this result has found support from other studies using alternative outgroups23 24 and methods23 24 25 26 27
however as clearly shown by analyses of other coronaviruses28 29 single-stranded rna viruses are prone to recombination within and between lineages this greatly complicates phylogenetic analyses as different regions of the genome will have different evolutionary histories marra and colleagues20 proposed that sars coronavirus may have undergone intergroup recombination after noting that the sars coronavirus s2m motif is found in the group 3 avian coronaviruses as well as the more distantly related equine rhinovirus picornaviridae later studies focused on the sars coronavirus spike s matrix m nucleocapsid n replicase polyprotein pp1ab and rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp proteins with bayesian techniques here phylogenetic incongruence was reported to occur across the sars coronavirus genome by showing that the m and n genes were most likely to have originated from an ancestral bird group 3 coronavirus whereas pp1ab showed homology with a mammalian-like group 2 coronavirus24 sliding-window approaches suggested that the s and rdrp genes are candidate mosaic sequences and identified the possible site of the original interlineage recombination events24 30 it has been proposed that recombination in the crucial s protein may have generated a virus with modified host specificities leading to the contemporary emergence in human populations24 an event of similar nature may have led to the 1918 spanish influenza pandemic however the bootstrap methods used24 30 support an independent and genetically distant sars coronavirus clade for all genes this suggests that any recombination events if they have occurred are evidently ancient and therefore not implicated in the current emergence of sars coronavirus in human populationsretrospective assessments of case reports identified 11 index cases from the guangdong province china the earliest of which was recorded from the city of foshan on nov 16 200210 these index cases were unlinked except for the epidemiological observation that seven of the 11 patients worked with animals in the food industry31 within live-animal markets in guangdong province 1340 of wild-animal traders and slaughterers were seropositive for sars9 32 these findings led to the speculation that sars is a zoonosis from an unidentified animal source suspicion focused on palm civet cats because 73 of the traders primarily trading in masked palm civet cats tested seropositive for the virus32
pcr and serological surveys of 25 animals from the live-animal market found serological evidence for infection in five himalayan palm civet cats a raccoon dog and a chinese ferret-badger coronaviruses were successfully isolated from the palm civet cats and raccoon dog yielding two full-length genomes with 998 homology to human sars coronavirus9 further surveys of civet cats farmed in hubei province have shown that these too are infected with a sars-like coronavirus31 comparative analyses of the shenzhen civet cat sequences against those from 11 human isolates showed that the human and animal isolates are phylogenetically distinct33 the genetic distance between civet cat coronavirus isolates is greater than that observed between geographically china hong kong canada and temporally separated early and mid-epidemic human sars coronavirus isolates9 these data suggest that sars originated from an animal reservoir and that the ultimate source of the coronavirus that caused the emergence of the human sars coronavirus genotype remains unclear however sequence data from a recent case gd03t0013 isolated dec 16 2003 has found closer grouping with the civet cat coronaviruses than was previously observed31 suggesting that civet cats may indeed be the source of sars coronavirus further attempts to isolate the virus from market animals has met with little success34 35 36 final confirmation of the animal reservoir of sars coronavirus therefore awaits a systematic survey of chinese faunaby may 9 2003 14 genomes of sars coronavirus had been sequenced37 this total has risen to 100 genbank depositions by may 2004 molecular analyses have shown that the early phase of the epidemic was characterised by two genotypes the first cluster a is composed of 10 isolates corresponding to the very early cases from guangdong province and three separate introductions to hong kong33 the second cluster b corresponds to the so-called super-spreading event sse triggered by the arrival of patient 1 hku-33 in hong kong31 33 this is the genotype that ultimately became pan-global the finding that most of the sars coronavirus genetic diversity occurs within cluster a is consistent with the epidemiological observations that guangdong province china is the geographical point of origin for the emergence of the virusif we assume that sars coronavirus had a single emergence within human populations the most recent common ancestor of sars coronavirus will correspond to our best approximation for the emergence of the virus efforts to date the most recent common ancestor of sars coronavirus have mostly followed the rationale that was used to date the emergence of hiv-1 m group viruses38 this relies on building a phylogenetic tree of isolates to find the most deeply branched sequences then assuming neutral clock-like evolution to date the root of the tree using the divergence of s-gene sequences from 139 patients33 linear regression dated the emergence of sars coronavirus to mid-december 2002 95 ci late september 2002 to mid-january 200339 a recent study by the chinese sars molecular epidemiology consortium31 attempted to correct for the potential effects of selection by only using synonymous ks substitutions they dated the ancestral sequence with the deeply rooted isolate gz02 as an outgroup and estimated an origin of mid-november 2002 95 ci early june 2002 to late december 2002 if correct these data suggest that the earliest known sars case in november 2002 was not far removed from the theoretical origin of the epidemichowever although promising these studies necessarily rely on isolates that are collected over a short timescale and are probably rapidly evolving whereas contemporary isolates are rare there have been recent infections that are not associated with laboratory escapes31 due to the observation that the isolate gd03t0013 is the most deeply rooted yet seen use of this sequence to date the most recent common ancestor of sars coronavirus will push back the epidemics origin perhaps significantly if done such an analysis would suggest that sars coronavirus has been circulating undetected in china for longer than was previously expected it is also evident from comparisons of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates kaks in the s protein that the sars genome is under strong directional selection31 the use of techniques that account for variation in the rates of evolution over the course of the epidemic ie bayesian evolutionary analysis sampling trees beast v102 available from httpevolvezoooxacukbeast accessed oct 4 2004 would therefore be appropriatea key factor in the epidemiology of an infectious disease is the incubation period which is defined as the time from infection to onset of clinical symptoms of disease40 the distribution of the incubation period has important implications for contact tracing and quarantine strategies so accurate estimates of the distribution are an important goal for early epidemiological investigations of a novel disease furthermore the average incubation period influences the timescale of the development of the epidemic as it partly determines the time interval between a case and the infections that the case subsequently generates identification of determinants of the incubation period such as age infectious dose and host genetics can provide insights into the mechanisms of disease progressionalthough infection events cannot be observed directly some patients retrospectively reported well-defined periods of exposure to one or more known sars cases when an event ie infection is only known to have occurred within a defined period the data are said to be interval censored41 patients with long periods of exposure are uninformative however patients with short and well-defined periods of exposure are informative even though the exact date of infection is unknown these data when analysed appropriately can be used to estimate the distribution of incubation periods in the patient populationsummaries and analyses of incubation period data have been published for various populations of patients table 1
figure in many cases the difficulties posed by interval censoring led to researchers presenting descriptive summary statistics without further analysis other work corrected for the interval censoring by use of both parametric47 and non-parametric57 approaches however it should be noted that naive analyses that assume patients were equally likely to have been infected throughout their reported interval57 overestimate the variance in the distribution and could also bias the estimates of the mean incubation period with the size of these problems depending on the width of the reported exposure intervalsgiven the difficulties inherent in the interpretation of interval-censored data the central estimates means and medians table 1 are remarkably consistent in patients in china hong kong singapore and canada with central estimates ranging from 4 to 6 the mean from european cases 72 days was somewhat higher but the estimate is uncertain because it is based on only five cases54
the maximum incubation period is less clear with a number of reports of incubation periods exceeding whos maximum incubation period of 10 days45 50 54 the who consensus document on the epidemiology of sars published in october 2003 noted the existence of incubation period outliers of more than 10 days but suggested they had not necessarily been subjected to rigorous and standardised investigation54 furthermore interval censoring causes particular difficulties in assessing the maximum incubation period and if midpoints in large exposure intervals are relied on then errors can result for example an incubation period in a patient exposed to a sars case 525 days before symptom onset might be naively and most likely incorrectly reported as a 15-day incubation periodthree studies reported somewhat higher mean incubation periods 8 73 and 76 days58 59 60 similarly another group61 reported that although the index case had an incubation period of 4 days the secondary and tertiary generations had incubation periods of 7 and 8 days respectively noting that shorter incubation periods were associated with longer fevers and greater clinical severity by contrast he and colleagues62 reported a mean incubation period of 45 days in patients from guangdong province china and li and colleagues63 reported a median incubation period of 3 days range 110 days in beijing china however we were unable to obtain full translations of these papers so were not able to determine how these estimates were obtainedsince only a small proportion of the sars cases will have data suitable for estimation of the incubation period distribution international collaboration would be particularly valuable who has suggested that such data exist on only 200 cases worldwide54 such efforts would however need to go well beyond straightforward analysis of a merged dataset due to the care and precision required to define periods of exposure to sars infection accurately if an international dataset were systematically compiled then rigorous overall estimates of the incubation period distribution could be obtained and any dependence of the incubation period distribution on patients characteristics ie age sex stage of the epidemic could be determinedfollowing the appearance of symptoms virtually all sars patients were either admitted to hospital or placed under home quarantine disease progression was best summarised by peiris and colleagues64 who followed 75 sars patients for 3 weeks after admission to hospital in hong kong patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms after a mean of 89 days a peak in viral load at approximately 10 days after admission and 60 of patients had seroconverted by 20 days the rates of admission to intensive care units icus in cohorts worldwide ranged from 23 to 40 with a high proportion of those admitted with acute respiratory distress syndrome and requiring mechanical ventilation45 65 66 67 68 69
transmission of sars in most cases could be linked to direct close contact with another sars case many of these contacts were nosocomial roughly half of cases were healthcare workers in studies in hong kong45 and guangzhou china70 and 77 of cases were exposed in hospital in a study from the toronto area canada46 although these studies are convenience samples drawn from particular hospitals the levels reported are similar to those reported from the national database of sars cases in hong kong with 49 of the sars cases resulting from infections occurring in clinics hospitals or elderly or nursing homes g m leung department of community medicine university of hong kong personal communicationwithin the community rates of transmission were generally low with 8 of household contacts infected in one study in hong kong71 and 67 in a study in singapore72 the closeness of contact also seems to be important for example in a large retrospective examination of case notes of quarantined close contacts of sars cases in beijing china the overall attack rate was 63 with the highest rates 154 in spouses and lowest rates in work and school contacts 03673 these figures are further supported by large-scale screening for sars coronavirus antibodies in direct contacts of sars cases which have very low rates 02 were positive for sars coronavirus igg antibodies74 nosocomial transmission therefore seems to have been the major source of new infections with higher attack rates reported in this setting for example in a study of nosocomial outbreak in toronto rates in nurses working in the emergency department icu and coronary care unit ranged from 10 to 6052 good barrier protection was essential to prevent transmission in a case-control study in hong kong inconsistent use of goggles gowns gloves and caps was significantly associated with a higher risk of sars75
early in the epidemic with little known about the pathogenicity of sars there was substantial concern about the increasing rates of morbidity and mortality that were being reported through individual case reports estimation of the case fatality rate cfr the percentage of people diagnosed as having a specific disease who die as a result of that disease during an outbreak is complicated because the eventual outcomes of patients still in hospital are unknown at the time of analysis the duration of hospital stay depended on the severity of illness but for most patients this was in the region of 14 days to 1 month47 76 naive estimates of the cfr based simply on the cumulative number of deaths divided by the cumulative number of cases77 were therefore particularly misleading because they yielded underestimates of the true mortality this bias was reduced as the epidemic progressed and as the outcome of a greater percentage of patients was known which is why reported estimates of cfr seemed to indicate that mortality was increasing over time causing some to incorrectly conclude that sars coronavirus was evolving to be more lethal78 79 the earliest estimates that used appropriate statistical methodology were published in may 2003 with data from hong kong47 and worldwide48 and gave final cfr estimates of between 14 and 18 table 2
shows the estimates obtained in various cohorts with cfrs at 21 days after hospital admission of 65 and 10 at 28 days of 10 and at 3 months of 1246 65 66 67 cfrs for those admitted to icus were significantly higher with estimates at 28 days of 26 and 34 in hong kong and toronto cohorts respectively80 82
several cohorts have consistently described the course of disease for sars patients using these data to assess factors that contribute to an increased risk of an adverse outcome the definition of adverse outcome varies but generally includes death admission to an icu requiring mechanical ventilation and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome most studies identify older age as a factor that increases the probability of an adverse event45 64 65 66 68 80 82 the strong association between age and cfr is also clearly seen in national case reports with cfr estimates in those aged over 60 years particularly high47 furthermore no deaths from sars occurred in children who had fewer complications and less severe symptoms83 84
the presence of co-morbidities including diabetes mellitus hypertension coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease also significantly increased the risk of adverse outcomes and death from sars46 64 65 80 82 85 and probably helps to explain the strong association between the cfr and age indeed in some cohorts deaths almost exclusively occurred in patients with other co-morbidities69 85 other notable factors contributing to higher cfrs were sex with men at higher risk than women45 86 high lactate dehydrogenase concentration at presentation45 66 and higher viral loads87
most patients with sars received some treatment that was based on previous experience with respiratory infections and evolved over the course of the epidemic for this reason most reports of the success of different treatments are observational and may be subject to treatment allocation bias common treatments included administration of antibiotics ribavirin and corticosteroids46 64 69 82 88 89 with the hiv-1 antiviral drug lopinavir also tested later in the epidemic in hong kong90 in one study in guangzhou china patients were randomly allocated to one of four treatment regimens with the best response seen in the group receiving early high-dose steroids88 however as was the case for the observational studies the study was not fully randomised since this fourth group consisted of patients diagnosed later in calendar time than the other three groupstraditional epidemiological approaches cannot be used to assess the population-level risk posed by an emerging infectious disease the expected number of cases on any given day is determined by the current size of the outbreak the transmissibility of the disease and the mixing behaviour of the population with the infection process causing positive feedback which results in highly non-linear trends in case incidence over time mathematical epidemic models14 describe with varying levels of realism the underlying mechanisms and dynamics of disease progression in the infected individual and transmission in the population they are therefore also known as mechanistic or dynamical models it is now common practice for the continuing population-level risk from infectious disease to be assessed using such modelsthe most important concept underlying the dynamics of infectious disease epidemics is that of the reproduction number rt this is defined to be the average number of new infections caused by one infectious case over the whole course of that individuals infectious period at the very start of an outbreak t0 the basic reproduction number r0 is defined to be the average number of secondary cases caused by the index case in an entirely susceptible population if r0 is greater than 1 then an infectious disease outbreak has the potential to establish itself resulting in an epidemic that will infect a substantial proportion of the population if there is no significant change in either the behaviour ie reduced mixing or the susceptibility of the population ie through vaccination if disease spread is not controlled the number of new cases each day will not start to decline until the pool of susceptible people has been substantially depletedthe objective of disease control is therefore to reduce rt to below 1 as quickly as possible either by reducing contact rates in the population through public-health campaigns or improving hospital infection control reducing rt to below 1 causes a rapid reduction in case incidence long before a significant proportion of the population has been affected however the relative ease with which an epidemic can be controlled is critically dependent on the magnitude of r
014 to control an epidemic with r010 through vaccination 90 of the population need to be immunised whereas if r02 the level of coverage required drops to 50

summarises the structure fitting method and results of modelling studies published during and after the sars epidemic r0 values from between 105 and 77 have been estimated for sars in different settings53 92 93 94 95 97 98 99 sses see below are included in the model presented by riley and colleagues92 but excluded from their r0 estimate of 2137 for sars in hong kong wallinga and teunis99 used an elegant method based on individual cases to infer the most likely network of contacts between cases from partial exposure data and estimates of the generation time distribution this method allows direct non-parametric estimation of the mean and distribution of rt through time they calculated rt to be 3 before the who global alert on march 12 2003 and 07 afterwards lipsitch and colleagues93 give a much broader range of 1177 for r0 these estimates were derived using two methods one fitting exponential growth to three pre-selected timepoints for data from hong kong canada and singapore and a second more sophisticated approach resembling that used by wallinga and teunis99 overall sars can be classified as moderately transmissible with smallpox being slightly more transmissible r0410100 and measles being much more transmissible r0745101
all the regional sars outbreaks were controlled relatively quickly implying that rt was rapidly brought below 1 however the reason for this drop in rt is the subject of some debate riley and colleagues92 showed that very little of the drop in rt can be attributed to changes in the speed with which people are admitted to hospital and suggested that it was due to a general reduction in overall mixing in the community coupled with improved infection control in hospitals lloyd-smith and co-workers102 use a relatively complex model of community and hospital transmission to show that it was improved infection control in hospital that contributed most to reductions in transmissibilitythe reproduction number is of course not the only factor determining how difficult it is to control an epidemic the generation time tg also called the serial interval the average time between a person being infected and infecting others also plays an important role in determining the feasibility of any control measures diseases with a very short generation time such as influenza tg3 days spread so rapidly that reactive control measures such as contact tracing are unlikely to be practical conversely smallpox may be comparably transmissible but has a much longer generation time tg 14 days making contact tracing pre-infectious diagnosis and isolation or treatment much more feasiblethe third key factor determining the likely success of simple public-health interventions such as isolation or contact tracing against an emerging disease is when infectiousness occurs during disease progression103 diseases for which a substantial proportion of transmission occurs before the onset of clear symptoms make reactive control measures such as case isolation less effective however if symptoms nearly always precede the onset of substantial infectiousness as was the case with sars rapid and effective diagnosis hospital admission and isolation of clinical cases is predicted to be a highly effective means to control transmission this issue is the topic of a recent analytical study103 which examined the formal relation between the outcome of public-health measures r0 and the proportion of pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic transmissionthe main benefit of mechanistic models compared with purely descriptive models is their ability to allow the exploration of hypothetical situations table 4
 this can take the form of examination of the impact of a range of potential control options on case incidence such as the imposition of movement restrictions92 or improved quarantine and contact tracing93 or the investigation of disease spread in a novel setting such as japan where there were no sars cases104 such investigations do by definition involve extrapolation beyond the observed data however when presented with careful sensitivity analyses that show the extent to which key results depend on model assumptions these studies can provide valuable insights to scientists and public-health policy makersheterogeneity in contact rates or infectiousness has been recognised as a key factor in determining patterns of infectious disease spread for many years14 however for sars the importance of such heterogeneity was particularly underscored by the occurrence of a few dramatic sses in which single individuals were responsible for infecting many times more individuals than the average given by rt the examples of patient 1 in hong kong who infected 10 people in the metropole hotel known as hotel m and additional people after his admission to st pauls hospital hong kong106 and the amoy gardens107 108 cluster in hong kong are the best known but patients who generated large numbers 10 of secondary cases were also identified in singapore with at least five such patients49 and canada52 however super-spreading individuals are not unique to sars their existence has been well documented for tuberculosis109 measles110 111 and smallpox112 and they are believed to have occurred in other diseases including ebola113 and the zoonotic transmission of monkeypox114 furthermore the importance of a small number of individuals with high rates of partner change is critical to the epidemiology of many sexually transmitted infections115 116
there will of course be variability in the number of secondary cases from any primary case owing to random variation even without any underlying variation due to characteristics of the primary case however if all cases have identical levels and durations of infectiousness with constant contact probabilities such variation is expected to be poisson117 once variation in the duration of infectiousness period is allowed for higher than poisson variance is expected with negative binomially distributed numbers of secondary cases expected for exponentially distributed infectiousness93 117 118 119
however key to the debate surrounding sses is whether such events are merely the extreme tail of a continuous distribution93 or they represent a distinct separate class of cases92 105 although some of the sses particularly those in hong kong seem too extreme to have arisen from an underlying continuous distribution it should be noted that estimating the frequency of sses from case data in a single region is subject to severe selection biases this is because in the earliest stages of a local outbreak the occurrence of an sse dramatically lowers the chances of that outbreak becoming extinct by chance93 hence sses are more likely to have occurred early in the outbreaks in those locations where large outbreaks were seen eg toronto hong kong singapore ideally one would like to characterise the overall distribution of secondary case numbers for sars before and after controls were introduced to do this rigorously would require a global analysis given the early importance of international spread however the detailed contact tracing data required for such an analysis does not exist in some areas and are incomplete for others where large outbreaks were seenirrespective of whether sses are a discrete class of transmission events or the tail of a distribution it cannot be assumed that variation in secondary case numbers is primarily due to biological variation in the amount of virus shed by patients and hence their infectiousness variation in contact rates with other individuals in the population is also likely to have been important and may indeed have been the dominant factor explaining sses such variation might be in the frequency of direct contacts eg large numbers of medical personnel saw the index patient in the prince of wales hospital in hong kong120 or indirect contacts eg unusual modes of viral spread in the metropole hotel and amoy gardens107 108 characterisation of heterogeneity in contact rates has been the topic of much research in infectious disease epidemiology14 121 122 and various modelling approaches including stratified population models123 124 125 126 and individual-based network models127 have been developed to incorporate such heterogeneity masuda and colleagues105 use a network-based approach to model sars and concluded that sses are best explained by an increase in infectiousness in a few individuals rather than extreme contact-rate heterogeneity however these conclusions are dependent on the investigators simplifying assumptions about network structure overall identifying the biological social or environmental causes for sses is important for the development of strategies for efficiently preventing or controlling such events since the optimal choice of tactics to be employed will depend on the causative mechanismsdespite the substantial achievements already made in understanding the origin and determinants of spread of the sars epidemics important questions remain unanswered these include clarification of how if at all seasonality contributed to the epidemic patterns observed understanding precisely how transmission took place within particular settings eg hospital wards gaining insight into the extent to which differences in social networks contributed to heterogeneity in sars transmission and determining the zoonotic origins of the virus answering these questions will depend mainly on the reliability and availability of the relevant data and will require multiple methodological approachesfor example investigating the impact if any of seasonality on transmission would require coordinated modelling of the large sars epidemics in china hong kong taiwan singapore and canada to separate the effects of temporal changes in humidity temperature and other environmental factors from the effects of temporal changes in epidemiological factors such as contact tracing and reduced mixing greater understanding of within-ward transmission would be gained into risk factors associated with both infectiousness and susceptibility from detailed stochastic modelling of patient and healthcare worker contacts this work could usefully build on published markov chain monte carlo models of nosocomial transmission128
as well as giving greater insights into processes underlying the sars epidemic the models and estimation methods developed will strengthen the set of analytical tools available for the analysis of future epidemics in each case surveillance and data quality are fundamental to providing sound foundations to underpin analyses and conclusions contingency plans developed on the basis of the experience of the sars epidemics have rightly placed a high priority on both surveillance and contact tracing129 130
epidemiological modelling has clarified the types of diseases that can be controlled with the straightforward public measures of isolation and contact tracing103 more detailed modelling will be required to further clarify the potential impact of further measures including restrictions on both short-range and long-range movements of people a review of recent smallpox modelling131 cautioned that modelling efforts should not set the nearly impossible goal of identifying the best public-health strategy in advance of an epidemic but should identify sets of recommended actions with associated decision rules for adaptive management as an epidemic unfolds
data for this review were identified by searches of pubmed isi web of science medline and references from relevant articles search terms were severe acute respiratory syndrome sars incubation period mortality attack rate and model only english language papers were reviewed publication dates based on electronic publication for those many sars publications published in this fast-track manner are given in tables to indicate the timeline of data availability and analysis
currently people all over the world have been affected by coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 which is the fifth pandemic after the 1918 flu pandemic as of now we can trace the first report and subsequent outbreak from a cluster of novel human pneumonia cases in wuhan city china since late december 2019 the earliest date of symptom onset was 1 december 2019 the symptomatology of these patients including fever malaise dry cough and dyspnea was diagnosed as viral pneumonia 1 2 initially the disease was called wuhan pneumonia by the press because of the area and pneumonia symptoms whole-genome sequencing results showed that the causative agent is a novel coronavirus therefore this virus is the seventh member of the coronavirus family to infect humans 3 the world health organization who temporarily termed the new virus 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov on 12 january 2020 and then officially named this infectious disease coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 on 12 february 2020 later the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv officially designated the virus as sars-cov-2 based on phylogeny taxonomy and established practice 4 subsequently human-to-human transmission of covid-19 occurring within hong kong has been shown in clinical data 5 since covid-19 initially emerged in china the virus has evolved for four months and rapidly spread to other countries worldwide as a global threat on 11 march 2020 the who finally made the assessment that covid-19 can be characterized as a pandemic following 1918 spanish flu h1n1 1957 asian flu h2n2 1968 hong kong flu h3n2 and 2009 pandemic flu h1n1 which caused an estimated 50 million 15 million 1 million and 300000 human deaths respectively 6 7 8 9 fig 1
sars-cov-2 is an enveloped and spherical particle approximately 120 nm in diameter containing a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome it belongs to the subfamily coronavirinae family coronavirdiae and order nidovirales the rna genome of sars-cov-2 contains a 5 methyl-guanosine cap poly a-tail and 29903 nucleotides according to wh-human 1 coronavirus whcv 3 10 it is classified as a beta-coronavirus cov lineage b and is the seventh coronavirus to infect humans following 2 cov hcov-229e and hku-nl63 and 4 cov hcov-oc43 lineage a hcov-hku1 lineage a severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov lineage b and middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov lineage c 11 12 13 14 it has been shown that bats and rodents are the gene sources of most covs and covs however avian species are the gene sources of most covs and covs by evolutionary analyses the human coronavirus hcov strains hcov-nl63 hcov-229e hcov-hku1 and hcov-oc43 usually cause mild self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections such as the common cold 15 16 however sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 can cause severe acute respiratory syndrome and result in life-threatening disease 17 18 19 table 1
sars-cov-2 transcribes nine subgenomic rnas and its genome comprises a 5 untranslated region including a 5 leader sequence an open reading frame orf 1aab encoding nonstructural proteins nsp for replication four structural proteins including spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n several accessory proteins such as orf 3a 6 7ab and 8 and a 3 untranslated region the replicase polyprotein pp1aab encodes and is proteolytically cleaved into 16 putative nsps including nsp3 papain-like protease nsp5 3c-like protease nsp12 rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp nsp13 helicase and other nsps 10 13 20 the spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 in human and chinese horseshoe bats civet for cell entry that is also dependent on s protein priming by the serine protease tmprss2 a similar panel of mammalian cell lines can be infected with sars-cov-2-s and sars-cov-s 21 22 23 24 the spike protein could be cleaved by host proteases into the s1 and s2 subunits which are responsible for receptor recognition and membrane fusion respectively s1 also can be divided into an n-terminal domain ntd and a c-terminal domain ctd the s1 ctd of sars-cov-2 but not the ntd showed strong affinity for human ace2 hace2 the receptor-binding domain rbd within sars-cov-2 ctd is the key region that interacts with the hace2 receptor with higher affinity than the rbd of sars-cov by 10- to 20-fold with kinetic quantification 23 25 the putative life cycle of sars-cov-2 in host cells begins from spike protein and hace2 receptor binding the conformational change in the s protein after receptor binding facilitates viral envelope fusion with the cell membrane through the endosomal pathway the viral rna genome is then released into the cytoplasm and translated into viral replicase polyproteins pp1a and 1ab which can be cleaved into small products by virus-encoded proteinases the polymerase transcribes a series of subgenomic mrnas by discontinuous transcription the subgenomic mrnas are finally translated into viral structural proteins the s e and m proteins enter the endoplasmic reticulum er and golgi apparatus and the n protein is combined with the positive-stranded genomic rna to form a nucleoprotein complex the structural proteins and nucleoprotein complex are assembled with the viral envelope at the ergolgi intermediate compartment the newly assembled viral particles are then released from the infected cell fig 2
all human coronaviruses have animal origins namely natural hosts bats may be the natural hosts of hcov-229e sars-cov hcov-nl63 and mers-cov furthermore hcov-oc43 and hku1 probably originated from rodents 26 27 28 bats are undoubtedly important and the major natural reservoirs of alpha-coronaviruses and beta-coronaviruses 29 domestic animals can suffer from disease as intermediate hosts that cause virus transmission from natural hosts to humans for example sars-cov and mers-cov crossed the species barriers into masked palm civets and camels respectively 30 31 table 1 sars-cov-2 sequenced at the early stage of the covid-19 outbreak only shares 796 sequence identity with sars-cov through early full-length genomic comparisons however it is highly identical 962 at the whole-genome level to bat-cov ratg13 which was previously detected in rhinolophus affinis from yunnan province over 1500 km from wuhan 21 bats are likely reservoir hosts for sars-cov-2 however whether bat-cov ratg13 directly jumped to humans or transmits to intermediate hosts to facilitate animal-to-human transmission remains inconclusive no intermediate host sample was obtained by scientists in an initial cluster of infections of the huanan seafood and wildlife market in wuhan where the sale of wild animals may be the source of zoonotic infection furthermore the earliest three patients with symptom onset had no known history of exposure to the huanan market 1 therefore there may be multiple sources of covid-19 in the beginning according to previous studies by metagenomic sequencing for the samples from malayan pangolins manis javanica in guangxi and guangdong china it has been suggested that pangolins might be the intermediate hosts between bats and humans because of the similarity of the pangolin coronavirus to sars-cov-2 32 33 the additional analysis of phylogenetic networks can be effective and useful to trace undocumented covid-19 infection sources 34 in addition to the zoonotic origins of sars-cov-2 by natural evolution there are still some disputes about the origin of the virus because its spike protein seems to perfectly interact with the human receptor in contributing to human-to-human transmission after evolution in a short period nevertheless more direct evidence is required to clarify the argumentsreplication of rna viruses could generate mutations due to the low proofreading ability of their rdrp the genome variations generated by viral rdrp could be beneficial for an emerging virus to adapt to new hosts however previous studies have shown that the mutation rates could vary in rna viruses 35 the synonymous substitution rate for coronaviruses might be approximately 1  10-3synonymous siteyear which is lower than some other rna viruses the mutation rate during coronavirus replication could be partially controlled by the viral exoribonuclease nsp14 36 37 nevertheless sars-cov-2 has been continuously evolving to different groups worldwide during the pandemicaccording to the information of ncov-19 sars-cov-2 sequences submitted to the gisaid database in january 2020 the virus was first collected in late december 2019 from wuhan china however those viral sequences varied from the latest submitted sequence collected in early april 2020 from north america since the viral sequences continuously change the construction of a phylogenetic network is crucial to investigate the adaption of the virus in different human populations and environments although the virus keeps evolving within humans who could also be susceptible to other human coronaviruses recombination between sars-cov-2 and old human coronaviruses such as hcov-229e oc43 nl63 and hku1 has not been found nevertheless a recent study revealed that three genetic types a b and c of the virus have been circulating globally 34 the study demonstrated that the genotypes could also correlate to the geographic locations this indicates that the evolution of sars-cov-2 may be affected by replication environments such as genetic and immunological restrictions in different human populations with evolutionary pressure the selection of sars-cov-2 mutations will be ongoing the investigation of the geographic patterns of sars-cov-2 variations will provide information on vaccine development for different populationshuman coronaviruses usually cause mild upper respiratory diseases however in the past two decades two coronaviruses transmitted from animals sars-cov and mers-cov have caused severe pneumonia and death in humans in addition since late december 2019 the covid-19 pandemic has spread globally and consequently resulted in at least 190549 deaths worldwide as of april 24 2020 38 due to the high sequence homology with a coronavirus isolated from bats sars-cov-2 is considered a zoonotic origin coronavirus undoubtedly sars-cov-2 has become the fifth human coronavirus and it is possible that this virus will continuously circulate in the human population in the future because specific antiviral treatments and vaccines are still under development testing quarantine and social distancing are encouraged to prevent virus spread nonetheless since the virus keeps mutating and evolving during the pandemic studies on viral pathogenicity treatments and prophylactic vaccines should closely consider the genetic characteristics of the virusemerging viruses and pathogens represent a global public health threat the recent coronavirus epidemic outbreak reported for the first time in late 2019 in wuhan hubei province china is rapidly becoming of worldwide concern coronaviruses are single plus-stranded rna viruses belonging to the family coronaviridae including mers mers-cov and sars sars-cov coronavirus cause different disease with respiratory enteric hepatic and neurological clinical symptoms 12 in december 2019 several clusters of patients with pneumonia of unknown origin epidemiologically associated with a seafood and animal market in wuhan were described calling the attention of the chinese center for disease control report of clustering pneumonia of unknown etiology in wuhan city wuhan municipal health commission 2019 httpwjw wuhan govcnfrontwebshowdetail2019123108989 leading to the isolation of a new coronavirus named 2019-ncov distinct from both mers-cov and sars 3since december 2019 the number of ascertained cases of infection has been daily increasing with 4593 confirmed cases and 106 deaths up to the time of writing ecdc jan 26 2020 httpswwwecdceuropaeuenpublications-datarisk-assessment-outbreak-acute-respiratory-syndrome-associated-novel-0based on epidemiological analysis animal-to-human transmission seems to be the likely origin of the epidemic as the first cases were detected in patients with recent history of visits to wuhan fish and wild markets evidences for animal-to-human and subsequent human-to-human transmission of the virus were also reported even if the transmission dynamics are not completely understood and significant knowledge gaps still need to be filled in 46 in this short report initial phylodynamic and phylogeography analyses of the 2019-ncov were performed on the full genome sequences currently available in order to clarify virus transmission dynamics and trace its initial epidemic spreadthe dataset comprised all currently available n  29 full genome sequences from the current 20192020 ncov epidemic as well as closely related n  2 bat strains sars-like cov retrieved from ncbi httpwwwncbinlmnihgovgenbank and gisaid httpswwwgisaidorg databases alignment was performed using mafft online program 7 the complete dataset was assessed for presence of phylogenetic signal by applying the likelihood mapping analysis implemented in the iq-tree 168 software httpwwwiqtreeorg 8 a maximum likelihood ml phylogeny was reconstructed using iq-tree 168 software under the hky nucleotide substitution model with four gamma categories hkyg4 which was inferred in jmodeltest httpsgithubcomddarribajmodeltest2 as the best fitting model 9in order to investigate the temporal signal we regressed root-to-tip genetic distances from this ml tree against sample collection dates using tempest v 151 httptreebioedacuk 10 the ml phylogeny was used as a starting tree for bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis using beast 1104 httpbeastcommunityindexhtml 11 we employed a stringent model selection analysis using both path-sampling ps and stepping stone ss procedures to estimate the most appropriate molecular clock model for the bayesian phylogenetic analysis 12 we tested a the strict molecular clock model which assumes a single rate across all phylogeny branches and b the more flexible uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock model with a lognormal rate distribution ucln 13 both ss and ps estimators indicated the uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock bayes factor  43 as the best fitted model to the dataset under analysis besides we have used the he hkyg4 codon partitioned cp1  23 substitution model and the bayesian skyline coalescent model of population size and growth 14 we computed mcmc markov chain monte carlo duplicate runs of 100 million states each sampling every 10000 steps convergence of mcmc chains was checked using tracer v171 14 proper mixing of the mcmc was checked for ess values 200 for each estimated parameter using tracer 17 systematic biology 20186759014 a maximum clade credibility mcc trees was obtained from the tree posterior distribution using treeannotator httpbeastcommunityindexhtml after 10 burn-indespite the short time since the beginning of the epidemic the isolates analyzed have already exhibited a substantial degree of heterogeneity with differences in 15 of the sites 11 of which were parsimony informative thus indicating the presence of sufficient phylogenetic signal for further analysis in agreement with the low level of phylogenetic noise shown by likelihood mapping 7 the root-to-tip vs divergence plot of the full dataset showed high correlation between sampling time and genetic distance to the root of the ml tree of the available sequences r-squared 085 indicating substantial temporal signal and the possibility to calibrate a reliable molecular clock despite the limited number of sequences and short sampling interval availablebayesian model selection chose the bayesian skyline demographic model with an uncorrelated relaxed clock as the one that best fit the data molecular clock calibration

reconstruction of 2019-ncov isolates the probable origin of 2019-ncov is as expected wuhan with a state posterior probability spp of 093 dating back the time of the most recent common ancestor mrca of the human outbreak to november 25 2019 95hpd september 28 2019 december 21 2019 while the mrca of bat sars-like coronavirus and related 2019-ncov lineages dates back to february 22 2011 95hpd september 20 2008 august 15 2014 figure s1 which may suggest a relatively extended period of sub-epidemic circulation before the most recent events the first evidence of 2019-ncov dissemination appears to be according to our phylogeographic reconstruction from wuhan china to nonthamburi thailand with an spp of 096 followed by the emergence of two distinct lineages one with further spreading in nonthamburi and the second one following a more complex pattern from nonthamburi to zhejiang huangzhou spp  047 as well as from zhejiang to kanagawa kanto spp  062 and from nonthamburi to guandong zhuhai spp  045 the first reported us cases in chicago illinois and seattle washington appeared to be linked to guandong zhuhai isolates in agreement with reports of patients traveling back from that region of china before being diagnosed finally our analysis identified the bat sars-like coronavirus as the most probable origin of the 2019-ncov spp  099very little is known about 2019-ncov virus including basic biology animal source or any specific treatment the substantial degree of genetic heterogeneity 15 accumulated among human isolates during the past few months of the ongoing epidemic outbreak is not necessarily surprising for an rna virus that has been shown to be a measurably evolving population over short time spans 15 however our findings underscore the urgent need for further molecular surveillance and the development of appropriate and an in-depth monitoring system capable of investigating viral mutation and transmission capabilities as 2019-ncov unfortunately keeps spreading at a regional and potential global level in other words given the viruss fast evolutionary rate and population dynamic tracking the emergence of novel transmission routes andor patterns should be considered a significant prioritythe results of our bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction seem to be in agreement with a recent report of benvenuto et al httpswwwbiorxivorg suggesting that a bat sars-like coronavirus sequence is homologous and genetically more similar to the 2019-ncov than other bat sars-like coronavirus sequences but very distant from sequences isolated in sars 2022003 epidemic and mers coronavirus the finding may imply a most recent common ancestor between 2019-ncov and the bat sars-like coronavirus circulating in the rhinolophus bat family we also identify in agreement with epidemiological reports the city of wuhan as the most likely origin of the human epidemic dating back to the end of november 2019 in 2010 a previous article has suggested that the emergence of diverse virus strains within a few decades in the different rhinolophus species may be the result of rapid evolution generating variants with the ability of easily crossing species barriers the same study has shown that the epizootic transmission of the sars from bat to human during the 2003 epidemic may have actually occurred up to 8 years earlier than the actual human outbreak 16 moreover the migration map of the rhinolophus bats in china involves almost the same geographic areas of the 2019-ncov epidemic httpwwwbiobrisacukresearchbatschina20batsrhinolophussinicushtm taken together these results indicate a recurring pattern among the sub-genre of the betacoronavirus leading to periodical epizootic epidemicsin the present 2019-ncov epidemic who estimates r0 the basic reproduction number as 14 to 25 less than sars 2 to 5 but this number can grow if the epidemic is not controlled by applying quarantine and isolation strategies purely epidemiological data such as incidence reports and contact tracing can provide background information on individual cases and population level transmission however molecular epidemiological data analyses when sampling strategies are appropriate and representative of the full genetic heterogeneity of the pathogen population can circumvent human error and present quantitative information about an infectious agentcombining epidemiology with molecular evolutionary data in a holistic approach is valuable for understanding the virus epidemic history and transmission in order to implement effective public health measures and prevent future epidemics like sars-cov and 2019-ncov using phylodynamic analysis to investigate 2019-ncov evolutionary history will add indispensable details to curb the current outbreak by identifying most closely related cases and providing crucial information of transmission and evolutionary patternsnineteen parameters including three mononucleotide frequencies g c and t and
16 dinucleotide biases were computed from 777 spike gene sequences see supplementary table s1 all
parameters show significant differences across the host groups kruskal-wallis
tests p  22e16 therefore they were subsequently
employed as factors in statistical models for discriminant analyses
empirically a dinucleotide relative abundance or dinucleotide bias eg
 is significantly high if  or extremely low if 24 among the 16 dinucleotides in this study the cpa and tpg show
an average abundance that is significantly higher than the expected values
  129
  128 whereas
the average bias of cpg is extremely low   044 this result indicates that the observed
abundances of cpa and tpg are significantly higher than their expected values
and the observed abundance of cpg is significantly lower than the expected
value the gc content is minimal 3147 this finding indicates
that coronaviruses exhibit a low density of nucleotide sequences and may be
sensitive to heat or alkali the low gc content also indicates a preference for
codons ending with a or t and a higher mutabilitythe data matrix with 19 factors as columns and 730 samples as rows was fitted to
svm and md models all predictions in leave-one-out cross-validations were
listed in supplementary table s2 and
summarized in table 1 according to host species the
validations indicate that both models achieved high accuracies on the training
data set 9986 for the svm and 9808 for the md all incorrect cases in
unsupervised predictions are listed in table 2 the only
incorrect prediction by the svm is sample nc0169961 which is isolated from an
avian species but was predicted to infect humans among all 14 incorrect
predictions by md bats are the common predicted hosts no sample was
incorrectly predicted by both modelsthe trained models were applied to 47 additional samples and the predictions
unveiled clues regarding potential interspecies transmission see table 3 sequences 131 comprise spike genes
of coronaviruses that were primarily isolated from palm civets from restaurants
animal markets or farms in southern china when sars wreaked havoc in 2003 the
sequences of these coronaviruses civet-covs are similar not only to each other
but also to sars-cov cross-host evolution research of sars-cov in palm civet
and humans indicated that the variations in spike genes seemed to be essential
for the transition of coronavirus from animal-to-human transmission to
human-to-human transmission25 in addition to
cross-neutralization with sars-cov these sars-like civet-covs can use human
ace2 as an entry receptor26 bats are the reservoir hosts of a
number of coronaviruses and a recent study also suggests that bats are natural
reservoirs of these sars-like coronaviruses whereas palm civets and humans are
intermediate hosts1 all hosts predicted by the svm are humans
which supports the previously mentioned research the md identified both bats
and humans as hosts of these samples but bats are the preferable hosts for
samples 126 and the second choice for samples 2731
this finding is also expected as bats are considered to be natural hosts of
these virusessequences 3240 comprise spike genes of mers-covs from dromedaries
after the outbreak in the middle east in 2012 mers-covs are similar to the bat
coronaviruses hku5 and hku4 in their amino acid sequences27 and
they can use human dpp4 as an entry receptor28 mers-covs was
assumed to originate from hku5 in pipistrelle which is a type of japanese
bat3 in our study these mers-covs isolated from camels were
predicted to be capable of infecting humans and bats are also likely hosts next
to humans in predictions by md this result is obviously consistent with above
speculations and also supports the who advices about avoiding close contact
with camels httpwwwwhointcsrdon20140723mersenthe 41st sample was a sars-associated coronavirus that was transmitted from human
to pig29 and both svm and md detected its threat to humans bat
and avian might be potential hosts since both models suggest that they are more
vulnerable than porcine samples 4244 rsshc014 rs3367 and
sl-cov-wiv1 consist of three sars-like coronaviruses from bats30 analyses based on the sequence similarities and cultures in the cell lines
suggest that rs3367 and sl-cov-wiv1 are capable of using a sars-cov receptor for
cell entry and pose a threat to humans whereas rsshc014 cannot30 our study provides a precise support to these conclusions the md correctly
predicts bats as the natural hosts of the three viruses and the svm indicates
that rs3367 and sl-cov-wiv1 are harmful to humansthe 45th sample was isolated from an alpaca by jin et al in 2007 with a
serotype of bovine the phylogenetic analysis suggests that it shares the same
ancestor with bovine-coronaviruses31 our analysis supports the
finding that this coronavirus is capable of infecting bovine these analyses
imply that this strain is capable of interspecies transmission between bovines
and alpacas samples 46 and 47 are enteric coronaviruses from bovines and
humans they have been identified as the same strain named human
enteric coronavirus 4408 in the ncbi database due to the similarity
between their spike protein sequences of 999 although they are similar to the
human coronavirus oc43 and the bovine coronavirus evidences from morphological
immunological and genomic studies indicate that they are closer to bovine
coronavirus than to human coronavirus unpublished research from personal
communication this finding is consistent with our analysis in addition avian
and bat are worthy of attentions as potential hosts due to the small md
valuestwo groups of two-dimensional data are plotted in fig 1
the blue points represent a loose population with a
larger standard deviation sd of n1 1 and the red points represent a
tight population with a smaller sd of n35
05 the red line separates the two groups classified by the md and the groups
predicted by the svm are delimited by the blue line in this figure two
individuals the red triangles between the two lines from the
tight population were classified into the
loose group by the md whereas the svm accidentally
excluded four points the blue reversed triangles between the two lines from
the loose population this example shows that md and
svm have inverse tendencies in some cases ie when a
loose population is close to a
tight population md intends to classify outliers of
the tight population into the former the opposite
situation is valid for the svmnucleotide composition analysis revealed the overrepresentation of cpa and tpg
dinucleotides and the suppression of cpg dinucleotides see supplementary table s1 which indicates that
coronaviruses generally prefer motifs that contain cpas and tpgs and avoid cpgs in
sequences these dinucleotide biases are common characteristics of rna viruses in
vertebrates11121516 as most vertebrates exhibit a very low
cpg representation in genomes rna viruses may gradually adapt to the accumulation
of host mutations and mimic the host genes dinucleotide patterns for
survival11 for dna viruses the most-accepted mechanisms for the
suppression of cpg dinucleotides are the methylation of cpg nucleotides and the
subsequent deamination of 5-methylcytosine which renders cpg a mutational
hotspot24 for rna viruses a different hypothesis is that the
rna viruses encounter different selection pressures when they switch to a new host
and viral rna genes mimic host mrnas to avoid immune detection11
similar to other human ssrna viruses coronaviruses show a strong correlation
between cpg pressure and cg content pearsons correlation coefficient
r  05443
p  22e-16 our data a lower cg content
usually indicates that the nucleotide sequence of the virus is unstable or is highly
variable under evolutionary selection pressure considering that the mutation rates
for rna viruses are significantly higher than the mutation rates for dna
viruses32 mutational pressure may be the most important
determinant of the bias in codon usage in human rna viruses such as
coronaviruses14the capabilities to bind with receptors and to replicate in host cells are essential
for any virus to infect hosts different genes contribute to these biological
processes variations on these genes may enable a virus to transmit cross-species
one famous example would be the polymerase 2 pb2 of influenza a virus in which
amino acid change from e to k at its 627th position would render the virus to
replicate in mammalian cells333435 in coronaviruses the spike
protein is functionally associated with recognition of hosts and the rna-dependent
rna polymerase rdrp is related to proliferation of virus however there are two
obstacles limiting the use of rdrp gene 1 the similarities among nucleotide
sequences is too high to train md model ie the variation rate of rdrp sequence
is slower and cannot provide enough resolution to discriminate different
coronaviruses 2 even worse available full-length cdss in public databases are
very limited  only 23 or so on the contrary the spike gene perfectly
satisfied the requirements for variation rate and availability therefore was
adopted as markers in this studymd and svm show opposite tendencies in judging outliers see fig
1 which reflects the different principles of the two classification
approaches unlike the euclidian distance ed which measures the absolute distance
between points or mass centres in space the mahalanobis distance considers the
variances within a population and the covariance between variables in some cases
especially when a population with individuals who are scattered across a wide range
is located close to a tight population with smaller
internal variations the md may classify marginal individuals from the latter into
the loose population even if they are
close to a tight population
according to the ed the md enables loose populations to
have a greater number of points the svm has a different philosophy svm separates
populations by finding a hyperplane that maximizes the distances between
populations when a loose population is close to the
boundary of a tight population svm is more likely to find
this hyperplane within the former this finding explains svms tendency
to exclude outliers from a loose populationbats are the reservoir hosts of a number of coronaviruses that can survive in bats
and accumulate variations in the long evolutionary process13637
thus coronaviruses in bats constitute a loose population
with larger internal gaps we assume that some strains of viruses in bats gain
sufficient variation to enable them to infect other organisms these viruses form a
new tight population at the edge of the original group in
this case the md emphasizes the connection of a virus with the original source
whereas the svm may be more sensitive to the possibility of infecting new hosts
therefore the incorporation of analyses using the md and svm can be especially
helpful for revealing the profile of interspecies transmissionaccording to the predictions by md bats are not only the hosts in all 14 incorrect
cases from training data set see table 2 but also in the
host list of each coronaviruses for testing see table 3
furthermore bats were predicted to host of 6402 training samples isolated from
other hosts see table 1 these facts convincingly support
the notion that these viruses originated from bats and shifted to other hostsnext to bats avians could be infected by 3664 samples from other hosts if bats
are the only reservoir hosts and coronaviruses spread from bats to avians and other
animals according to the stochastic event model the probability of co-infectivity
to both bat and avian can be the product of the infectivity probabilities to each of
them ie 03494 05164  06767 see table 1 then 255
03494  730 samples are expected to be of
co-infectivity however only 173 samples were predicted to be of co-infectivity to
bats and avians so avians might be the second independent source of coronavirus in
parallel to bats if this speculation is true people will have to maintain
vigilance to avian coronaviruses apart from avian influenza viruses especially due
to the high accuracy of the svm in cross-validation we should seriously consider
its only wrong prediction perhaps it is sensible to
investigate whether the nc0169961 virus from avian is capable of infecting
humansfor the viruses that are capable of spreading across a host species barrier the
combination of the md and the svm is valuable for assessing their potential threat
the origin and interspecies transmission of coronaviruses have been extensively
discussed in the past ten years and the coronaviruses of most mammals are believed
to originate from their ancestors in bats13637 our analysis with
dual statistical models support the finding that sars-covs and mers-covs spread from
bats to humans and other animals in most cases our approach provided convincing
predictions the dual-model approach can be expected to become a useful tool in
future studies typically when a novel coronavirus is isolated the combination of
the md and the svm may provide meaningful hints regarding its origin and potential
threat to humans or other animals as soon as more virus genomes are sequenced this
approach can be applied to investigate the interspecies transmission route of other
threatening viruses including the recent ebola outbreak in west africaall genome sequences and complete coding sequences cdss of spike genes were
downloaded from the national centre for biotechnology information ncbi
database httpwwwncbinlmnihgov on july 17 2014 sequences of
spike genes were extracted from the 1044 coronavirus genomes and pooled with
1380 downloaded cdss then we removed replicate sequences and sequences that
contained non-standard bases or were incapable of coding complete products the
length of each sequence is longer than 3000 bases among all 777 valid
nucleotide sequences that are listed in supplementary data s1 730 sequences fall into six categories
according to different hosts 196 for humans 182 for porcines 77 for bovines
74 for bats 28 for murines and 173 for avians the majority of the remaining 47
viruses were isolated from the two epidemic diseases caused by the coronavirus
in the past 12 years although we only listed the hosts from which they were
isolated these viruses have been verified or suspected to have the ability to
infect different hosts thus all 47 sequences were employed to explore
interspecies transmission of coronaviruses viruses from other mammals
including canines felines rabbits equines alpacas and whales were excluded
from the data set as the number of spike sequences for each host is insufficient
for establishing a separate groupthe mononucleotide frequencies and dinucleotide biases of the spike sequences
were computed using our original python scripts dinucleotide bias is the ratio
of the observed value to the expected frequency of each of the 16 dinucleotides
 where  is
the dinucleotide bias fxy is the frequency of
dinucleotide xy fx and fy are
the frequencies of nucleotide x and nucleotide y38
respectivelyin this study we considered 19 factors including three mononucleotide
frequencies g c and t and 16 dinucleotide biases as none of the frequencies
has a normal distribution the nonparametric kruskal-wallis
test was employed to investigate the difference in each factor
among six categories as a result significant differences across categories
were detected for each factor thus all 19 factors were employed for
modellingas a classifier the svm can efficiently perform a nonlinear classification using
a kernel technique that is rooted in structural risk minimization in this
study the r package e1071 version 16320 was
employed for the svm analysis c-classification was
adopted as the model type and radial was adopted as
the svm kernel in our analysis the md is a measure of the distance from a point
to the centre of a distribution the principle of this discriminant is that
individuals belong to the closest group in the distance the md is defined as
 where x denotes the population
x denotes the individual  is the mean value of
the population t denotes the matrix transpose and  denotes the covariance matrix of population39 the r program
distinguishdistancer40 was
employed in the md analysis leave-one-out cross-validation was employed for
both svm and md analyseswhen the trained models are applied to a sequence for testing each of the six
categories of hosts will obtain a p value from svm and a md value based
on p values and md values three steps will be taken to determine
candidate hosts first the host of minimal p value or md value is
reasonably regarded as the preferable host then two adjustable empirical
thresholds can be used for each model to pick out other potential hosts in this
study we adopted 005 and 001 for p value 200 and 100 for md value
ie likely hosts were determined if
p  005 or
md  200 and very likely hosts were defined by
p  001 or
md  100 the two steps are unsupervised
prediction in case that the isolate source is among the six host groups for
modelling a supervised prediction can be applied as the third step ie all
host species with p values or md values no more than those of the
observed host will be listed as potential hosts which can be practical

increases in the number of coronavirus genome sequences available following efforts to investigate the diversity in the wild the family coronaviridae now contains four genera international committee on taxonomy of viruses 6 while those species that belong to the genera alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus can infect mammalian hosts those in gammacoronavirus and the recently defined deltacoronavirus mainly infect avian species 4 79 phylogenetic studies have revealed a complex evolutionary history with coronaviruses thought to have ancient origins and recent crossover events that can lead to cross-species infection 8 1012 some of the largest sources of diversity for coronaviruses belong to the strains that infect bats and birds providing a reservoir in wild animals for recombination and mutation that may enable cross-species transmission into other mammals and humans 4 7 8 10 13like other rna viruses coronavirus genomes are known to have genomic plasticity and this can be attributed to several major factors rna-dependent rna polymerases rdrp have high mutation rates reaching from 1 in 1000 to 1 in 10000 nucleotides during replication 7 14 15 coronaviruses are also known to use a template switching mechanism which can contribute to high rates of homologous rna recombination between their viral genomes 9 1620 furthermore the large size of coronavirus genomes is thought to be able to accommodate mutations to genes 7 these factors help contribute to the plasticity and diversity of coronavirus genomes todaythe highly pathogenic human coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov belong to lineage b sub-genus sarbecovirus and lineage c sub-genus merbecovirus of betacoronavirus respectively 9 2123 both result from zoonotic transmission to humans and lead to symptoms of viral pneumonia including fever breathing difficulties and more 24 25 recently an unidentified pneumonia disease with similar symptoms caused an outbreak in wuhan and is thought to have started from a local fresh seafood market 2630 this was later attributed to a novel coronavirus the covid-19 virus and represents the third major zoonotic human coronavirus of this century 31 on february 28 2020 the world health organization set the covid-19 risk assessment for regional and global levels to very high 32from analyses employing whole genome to viral protein-based comparisons the covid-19 virus is thought to belong to lineage b sarbecovirus of betacoronavirus from phylogenetic analysis of the rdrp protein spike proteins and full genomes of the covid-19 virus and other coronaviruses it was found that the covid-19 virus is most closely related to two bat sars-like coronaviruses bat-sl-covzxc21 and bat-sl-covzc45 found in chinese horseshoe bats rhinolophus sinicus 12 3337 along with the phylogenetic data the genome organization of the covid-19 virus was found to be typical of lineage b sarbecovirus betacoronaviruses 33 from phylogenetic analysis of full genome alignment and similarity plots it was found that the covid-19 virus has the highest similarity to the bat coronavirus ratg13 38 close associations to bat coronavirus ratg13 and two bat sars-like covs zc45 and zxc21 are also supported in alignment-based phylogenetic analyses 38 within the covid-19 virus sequences over 99 sequence similarity and a lack of diversity within these strains suggest a common lineage and source with support for recent emergence of the human strain 12 31 there is ongoing debate whether the covid-19 virus arose following recombination with previously identified bat and unknown coronaviruses 39 or arose independently as a new lineage to infect humans 38 in combination with the identification that the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 protein is a receptor for covid-19 virus as it is for sars and other sarbecovirus strains the hypothesis that the covid-19 virus originated from bats is deemed very likely 12 33 35 38 4044all analyses performed thus far have been alignment-based and rely on the annotations of the viral genes though alignment-based methods have been successful in finding sequence similarities their application can be challenging in many cases 45 46 it is realistically impossible to analyze thousands of complete genomes using alignment-based methods due to the heavy computation time moreover the alignment demands the sequences to be continuously homologous which is not always the case alignment-free methods 4751 have been proposed in the past as an alternative to address the limitations of the alignment-based methods comparative genomics beyond alignment-based approaches have benefited from the computational power of machine learning machine learning-based alignment-free methods have also been used successfully for a variety of problems including virus classification 4951 an alignment-free approach 49 was proposed for subtype classification of hiv-1 genomes and achieved 97 classification accuracy mldsp 50 with the use of a broad range of 1d numerical representations of dna sequences has also achieved very high levels of classification accuracy with viruses even rapidly evolving plastic genomes of viruses such as influenza and dengue are classified down to the level of strain and subtype respectively with 100 classification accuracy mldsp-gui 51 provides an option to use 2d chaos game representation cgr 52 as numerical representation of dna sequences cgrs have a longstanding use in species classification with identification of biases in sequence composition 48 51 52 mldsp-gui has shown 100 classification accuracy for flavivirus genus to species classification using 2d cgr as numerical representation 51 mldsp and mldsp-gui have demonstrated the ability to identify the genomic signatures a species-specific pattern known to be pervasive throughout the genome with species level accuracy that can be used for sequence dissimilarity analyses in this study we use mldsp 50 and mldsp-gui 51 with cgr as a numerical representation of dna sequences to assess the classification of the covid-19 virus from the perspective of machine learning-based alignment-free whole genome comparison of genomic signatures using mldsp and mldsp-gui we confirm that the covid-19 virus belongs to the betacoronavirus while its genomic similarity to the sub-genus sarbecovirus supports a possible bat originthis paper demonstrates how machine learning using intrinsic genomic signatures can provide rapid alignment-free taxonomic classification of novel pathogens our method delivers accurate classifications of the covid-19 virus without a priori biological knowledge by a simultaneous

length statistics and results of mldsp-gui after applying 10-fold cross-validation as classification accuracy scores are shown the classification accuracy scores for all six classification models are shown with their average see table 1as shown in table 1 for the first test test-1 we organized the dataset of sequences into 12 clusters 11 families and riboviria realm only the families with at least 100 sequences were considered the riboviria cluster contains all families that belong to the realm riboviria for the clusters with more than 500 sequences we selected 500 sequences at random our method can handle all of the available 14668 sequences but using imbalanced clusters in regard to the number of sequences can introduce an unwanted bias after filtering out the sequences our pre-processed dataset is left with 3273 sequences organized into 12 clusters adenoviridae anelloviridae caudovirales geminiviridae genomoviridae microviridae ortervirales papillomaviridae parvoviridae

classification models trained on 208 sequences were used to classify predict the label of the 29 covid-19 virus sequences all of our machine learning-based models predicted the label as betacoronavirus for all 29 sequences table 2 to verify that the correct prediction is not an artifact of possible bias because of larger betacoronavirus cluster we did a secondary test-3b with cluster size limited to the size of smallest cluster after removing the gammacoronavirus because it just had 9 sequences the maximum classification accuracy of 100 is obtained using the linear discriminant model for test-3b all six classification models trained on 60 sequences were used to classify the 29 covid-19 virus sequences all of our machine learning-based models predicted the label as betacoronavirus for all 29 sequences table 2 this secondary test showed that the possible bias is not significant enough to have any impact on the classification performancegiven confirmation that the covid-19 virus belongs to the betacoronavirus genus there now is a question of its origin and relation to the other viruses of the same genus to examine this question we preprocessed our dataset from our third test to keep the sub-clusters of the betacoronavirus with at least 10 sequences test-4 this gives 124 sequences placed into four clusters embecovirus merbecovirus nobecovirus sarbecovirus

betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus the covid-19 virus showed the highest k-mer frequency correlation to betacoronavirus at k  7 table 4 which is consistent with the mldsp results in test-3 table 2 the covid-19 virus was then compared to all sub-genera within the betacoronavirus genus embecovirus merbecovirus nobecovirs and sarbecovirus seen in fig 7 the spearmans rank test was again consistent with the mldsp results seen in table 3 as the k-mer frequencies at k  7 showed the highest correlation to the sub-genus sarbecovirus table 4 these tests confirm the findings in mldsp and are consistent with the covid-19 virus as part of the sub-genus sarbecovirusprior work elucidating the evolutionary history of the covid-19 virus had suggested an origin from bats prior to zoonotic transmission 12 33 35 38 41 62 most early cases of individuals infected with the covid-19 virus had contact with the huanan south china seafood market 2631 human-to-human transmission is confirmed further highlighting the need for continued intervention 33 6264 still the early covid-19 virus genomes that have been sequenced and uploaded are over 99 similar suggesting these infections result from a recent cross-species event 12 31 40these prior analyses relied upon alignment-based methods to identify relationships between the covid-19 virus and other coronaviruses with nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarities when analyzing the conserved replicase domains of orf1ab for coronavirus species classification nearly 94 of amino acid residues were identical to sars-cov yet overall genome similarity was only around 70 confirming that the covid-19 virus was genetically different 64 within the rdrp region it was found that another bat coronavirus ratg13 was the closest relative to the covid-19 virus and formed a distinct lineage from other bat sars-like coronaviruses 38 40 other groups found that two bat sars-like coronaviruses bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 were also closely related to the covid-19 virus 12 3337 there is a consensus that these three bat viruses are most similar to the covid-19 virus however whether or not the covid-19 virus arose from a recombination event is still unknown 3840regardless of the stance on recombination current consensus holds that the hypothesis of the covid-19 virus originating from bats is highly likely bats have been identified as a reservoir of mammalian viruses and cross-species transmission to other mammals including humans 4 7 8 10 13 6567 prior to intermediary cross-species infection the coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov were also thought to have originated in bats 24 25 34 6870 many novel sars-like coronaviruses have been discovered in bats across china and even in european african and other asian countries 34 7177 with widespread geographic coverage sars-like coronaviruses have likely been present in bats for a long period of time and novel strains of these coronaviruses can arise through recombination 4 whether or not the covid-19 virus was transmitted directly from bats or from intermediary hosts is still unknown and will require identification of the covid-19 virus in species other than humans notably from the wet market and surrounding area it is thought to have originated from 30 while bats have been reported to have been sold at the huanan market at this time it is still unknown if there were intermediary hosts involved prior to transmission to humans 27 31 33 39 78 snakes had been proposed as an intermediary host for the covid-19 virus based on relative synonymous codon usage bias studies between viruses and their hosts 39 however this claim has been disputed 79 china cdc released information about environmental sampling in the market and indicated that 33 of 585 samples had evidence of the covid-19 virus with 31 of these positive samples taken from the location where wildlife booths were concentrated suggesting possible wildlife origin 80 81 detection of sars-cov in himalyan palm civets and horseshoe bats identified 29 nucleotide sequences that helped trace the origins of sars-cov isolates in humans to these intermediary species 13 24 38 77 sampling additional animals at the market and wildlife in the surrounding area may help elucidate whether intermediary species were involved or not as was possible with the sars-covviral outbreaks like covid-19 demand timely analysis of genomic sequences to guide the research in the right direction this problem being time-sensitive requires quick sequence similarity comparison against thousands of known sequences to narrow down the candidates of possible origin alignment-based methods are known to be time-consuming and can be challenging in cases where homologous sequence continuity cannot be ensured it is challenging and sometimes impossible for alignment-based methods to compare a large number of sequences that are too different in their composition alignment-free methods have been used successfully in the past to address the limitations of the alignment-based methods 4851 the alignment-free approach is quick and can handle a large number of sequences moreover even the sequences coming from different regions with different compositions can be easily compared quantitatively with equally meaningful results as when comparing homologoussimilar sequences we use mldsp-gui a variant of mldsp with additional features a machine learning-based alignment-free method successfully used in the past for sequence comparisons and analyses 50 the main advantage alignment-free methodology offers is the ability to analyze large datasets rapidly in this study we confirm the taxonomy of the covid-19 virus and more generally propose a method to efficiently analyze and classify a novel unclassified dna sequence against the background of a large dataset we namely use a decision tree approach paralleling taxonomic ranks and start with the highest taxonomic level train the classification models on the available complete genomes test the novel unknown sequences to predict the label among the labels of the training dataset move to the next taxonomic level and repeat the whole process down to the lowest taxonomic labeltest-1 starts at the highest available level and classifies the viral sequences to the 11 families and riboviria realm table 1 there is only one realm available in the viral taxonomy so all of the families that belong to the realm riboviria are placed into a single cluster and a random collection of 500 sequences are selected no realm is defined for the remaining 11 families the objective is to train the classification models with the known viral genomes and then predict the labels of the covid-19 virus sequences the maximum classification accuracy score of 95 was obtained using the quadratic svm model this test demonstrates that mldsp-gui can distinguish between different viral families the trained models are then used to predict the labels of 29 covid-19 virus sequences as expected all classification models correctly predict that the covid-19 virus sequences belong to the riboviria realm see table 2 test-2 is composed of 12 families from the riboviria see table 1 and the goal is to test if mldsp-gui is sensitive enough to classify the sequences at the next lower taxonomic level it should be noted that as we move down the taxonomic levels sequences become much more similar to one another and the classification problem becomes challenging mldsp-gui is still able to distinguish between the sequences within the riboviria realm with a maximum classification accuracy of 911 obtained using the linear discriminant classification model when the covid-19 virus sequences are tested using the models trained on test-2 all of the models correctly predict the covid-19 virus sequences as coronaviridae table 2 test-3a moves down another taxonomic level and classifies the coronaviridae family to four genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus deltacoronavirus gammacoronavirus see table 1 mldsp-gui distinguishes sequences at the genus level with a maximum classification accuracy score of 98 obtained using the linear discriminant model this is a very high accuracy rate considering that no alignment is involved and the sequences are very similar all trained classification models correctly predict the covid-19 virus as betacoronavirus see table 2 test-3a has betacoronavirus as the largest cluster and it can be argued that the higher accuracy could be a result of this bias to avoid bias we did an additional test removing the smallest cluster gammacoronavirus and limiting the size of remaining three clusters to the size of the cluster with the minimum number of sequences ie 20 with test-3b mldsp-gui obtains 100 classification accuracy for this additional test and still predicts all of the covid-19 virus sequences as betacoronavirus these tests confirm that the covid-19 virus sequences are from the genus betacoronavirussequences become very similar at lower taxonomic levels sub-genera and species test-4 test-5 and test-6 investigate within the genus betacoronavirus for sub-genus classification test-4 is designed to classify betacoronavirus into the four sub-genera embecovirus merbecovirus nobecovirus sarbecovirus see table 3 mldsp-gui distinguishes sequences at the sub-genus level with a maximum classification accuracy score of 984 obtained using the quadratic svm model all of the classification models trained on the dataset in test-4 predicted the label of all 29 covid-19 virus sequences as sarbecovirus this suggests substantial similarity between the covid-19 virus and the sarbecovirus sequences test-5 and test-6 see table 3 are designed to verify that the covid-19 virus sequences can be differentiated from the known species in the betacoronavirus genus mldsp-gui achieved a maximum classification score of 987 for test-5 and 100 for test-6 using subspace discriminant classification model this shows that although the covid-19 virus and sarbecovirus are closer on the basis of genomic similarity test-4 they are still distinguishable from known species therefore these results suggest that the covid-19 virus may represent a genetically distinct species of sarbecovirus all the covid-19 virus sequences are visually seen in modmap3d generated from test-5 see fig 2b as a closely packed cluster and it supports a fact that there is 99 similarity among these sequences 12 31 the modmap3d generated from the test-5 fig 2b visually suggests and the average distances from covid-19 virus sequences to all other sequences confirm that the covid-19 virus sequences are most proximal to the ratg13 distance 00203 followed by the bat-sl-covzc45 00418 and bat-sl-covzx21 00428 to confirm this proximity upgma and neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees are computed from the pcc-based pairwise distance matrix of sequences in test-6 see figs 3 and 4 notably the upgma model assumes that all lineages are evolving at a constant rate equal evolution rate among branches this method may produce unreliable results in cases where the genomes of some lineages evolve more rapidly than those of the others to further verify the phylogenetic relationships we also produced a phylogenetic tree using the neighbor-joining method that allows different evolution rates among branches and obtained a highly similar output the phylogenetic trees placed the ratg13 sequence closest to the covid-19 virus sequences followed by the bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzx21 sequences this closer proximity represents the smaller genetic distances between these sequences and aligns with the visual sequence relationships shown in the modmap3d of fig 2bwe further confirm our results regarding the closeness of the covid-19 virus with the sequences from the betacoronavirus genus especially sub-genus sarbecovirus by a quantitative analysis based on the spearmans rank correlation coefficient tests spearmans rank correlation coefficient 5861 tests were applied to the frequencies of oligonucleotide segments adjusting for the total number of segments to measure the degree and statistical significance of correlation between two sets of genomic sequences spearmans  value provides the degree of correlation between the two groups and their k-mer frequencies the covid-19 virus was compared to all genera under the coronaviridae family and the k-mer frequencies showed the strongest correlation to the genus betacoronavirus and more specifically sarbecovirus the spearmans rank tests corroborate that the covid-19 virus is part of the sarbecovirus sub-genus as shown by cgr and mldsp when analyzing sub-genera it could be hard to classify at lower k values due to the short oligonucleotide frequencies not capturing enough information to highlight the distinctions therefore despite the spearmans rank correlation coefficient providing results for k  1 to k  7 the higher k-mer lengths provided more accurate results and k  7 was usedattributes of the covid-19 virus genomic signature are consistent with previously reported mechanisms of innate immunity operating in bats as a host reservoir for coronaviruses vertebrate genomes are known to have an under-representation of cg dinucleotides in their genomes otherwise known as cg suppression 82 83 this feature is thought to have been due to the accumulation of spontaneous deamination mutations of methyl-cytosines over time 82 as viruses are obligate parasites evolution of viral genomes is intimately tied to the biology of their hosts 84 as host cells develop strategies such as rna interference and restriction-modification systems to prevent and limit viral infections viruses will continue to counteract these strategies 8385 dinucleotide composition and biases are pervasive across the genome and make up a part of the organisms genomic signature 84 these host genomes have evolutionary pressures that shape the host genomic signature such as the pressure to eliminate cg dinucleotides within protein coding genes in humans 83 viral genomes have been shown to mimic the same patterns of the hosts including single-stranded positive-sense rna viruses which suggests that many rna viruses can evolve to mimic the same features of their hosts genes and genomic signature 8286 as genomic composition specifically in mrna can be used as a way of discriminating self vs non-self rna the viral genomes are likely shaped by the same pressures that influence the host genome 83 one such pressure on dna and rna is the apobec family of enzymes members of which are known to cause g to a mutations 8688 while these enzymes primarily work on dna it has been demonstrated that these enzymes can also target rna viral genomes 87 the apobec enzymes therefore have rna editing capability and may help contribute to the innate defence system against various rna viruses 86 this could therefore have a direct impact on the genomic signature of rna viruses additional mammalian mechanisms for inhibiting viral rna have been highlighted for retroviruses with the actions of zinc-finger antiviral protein zap 82 zap targets cg dinucleotide sequences and in vertebrate host cells with the cg suppression in host genomes this can serve as a mechanism for the distinction of self vs non-self rna and inhibitory consequences 82 coronaviruses have au rich and cg poor genomes which over time may have been in part a product of cytidine deamination and selection against cg dinucleotides 8991 this is consistent with the fact that bats serve as a reservoir for many coronaviruses and that bats have been observed to have some of the largest and most diverse arrays of apobec genes in mammals 67 69 the spearmans rank correlation data and the patterns observed in the cgr images from fig 5 of the coronavirus genomes including the covid-19 virus identify patterns such as cg underepresentation also present in vertebrate and importantly bat host genomeswith human-to-human transmission confirmed and concerns for asymptomatic transmission there is a strong need for continued intervention to prevent the spread of the virus 32 33 6264 due to the high amino acid similarities between the covid-19 virus and sars-cov main protease essential for viral replication and processing anticoronaviral drugs targeting this protein and other potential drugs have been identified using virtual docking to the protease for treatment of covid-19 29 43 44 9295 the human ace2 receptor has also been identified as the potential receptor for the covid-19 virus and represents a potential target for treatment 41 42mldsp-gui is an ultra-fast alignment-free method as is evidenced by the time-performance of mldsp-gui for test-1 to test-6 given in fig 8 mldsp-gui took just 1055 seconds to compute a pairwise distance matrix including reading sequences computing magnitude spectra using dft and calculating the distance matrix using pcc combined for the test-1 largest dataset used in this study with 3273 complete genomes all of the tests combined test-1 to test-6 are doable in under 10 minutes including the computationally heavy 10-fold cross-validation and testing of the 29 covid-19 virus sequencesthe results of our machine learning-based alignment-free analyses using mldsp-gui support the hypothesis of a bat origin for the covid-19 virus and classify covid-19 virus as sub-genus sarbecovirus within betacoronavirusthis study provides an alignment-free method based on intrinsic genomic signatures that can deliver highly-accurate real-time taxonomic predictions of yet unclassified new sequences ab initio using raw dna sequence data alone and without the need for gene or genome annotation we use this method to provide evidence for the taxonomic classification of the covid-19 virus as sarbecovirus within betacoronavirus as well as quantitative evidence supporting a bat origin hypothesis our results are obtained through a comprehensive analysis of over 5000 unique viral sequences through an alignment-free analysis of their two-dimensional genomic signatures combined with a decision tree use of supervised machine learning and confirmed by spearmans rank correlation coefficient analyses this study suggests that such alignment-free approaches to comparative genomics can be used to complement alignment-based approaches when timely taxonomic classification is of the essence such as at critical periods during novel viral outbreaksin late december 2019 several medical institutions in wuhan admitted a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unexplained etiology12 an unknown novel coronavirus which was temporarily named as the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov was identified as the pathogen3 subsequently the pneumonia caused by the 2019-ncov has been officially named by the world health organization as the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-194 accompanied with the arrival of the chinese spring festival travel rush the 2019-ncov spread rapidly all over china5 as of february 17 2020 a total of 72436 patients with confirmed covid-19 including 42752 590 in wuhan have been reported in china67 of these 11741 and 1868 cases were severe and death cases respectively furthermore most of severe 9222 785 and death 1381 739 population were from wuhan china the original district of this disease the rate of severity and mortality in covid-19 patients from wuhan were significantly higher than that in other regions outside wuhan suggesting patients infected in the original district wuhan china of this disease may have more rapid aggravationto detect covid-19 viral nucleic acid detection using real-time polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr remains the standard of reference8 however several defects such as immature development of nucleic acid detection technology variation in detection rate from different manufacturers false negative caused by low patient viral load or improper clinical sampling may cause low efficiency of detection and limit its clinical application8 as a promising method recommended by chinese society of radiology9 computed tomography ct plays an essential role in diagnosis and monitoring treatment responses in covid-19 multifocal bilateral ground glass opacity ggo as an indicator of early disease stage and patchy consolidations as a marker of the disease progression are the most common patterns of ct abnormalities911 based on above-mentioned typical ct findings the severity of covid-19 could be staged into early progression severe and dissipation stage which embodied in the consensus of chinese society of radiology9as for the patients outside the original district wuhan china of this disease the infection routes included an exposure history of the original district wuhan china in short term ie imported infection and a close contact with the infected individuals exposed to the original district recently ie second-generation infection to the best of our knowledge there were no reports focusing on the discrimination in severity of the covid-19 between patients outside the original district wuhan china according to different routes of infection thus the purpose of our research was to determine the discrepancy in ct manifestations of covid-19 in patients outside the original district wuhan china between cases with imported infection and with second-generation infection aiming to help clinicians outside the original district formulate more accurate and effective prevention and treatment measuresthe institutional ethics committee of the affiliated hospital of north sichuan medical college approved this study approval number 2020er0071 and the written informed consent was obtained from each participantfrom january 23 to february 17 2020 22 consecutive covid-19 patients derived from 2 designated hospitals in nanchong china 938 km away from the original district wuhan china of this disease were enrolled into our study all patients had positive results for 2019-ncov detection via the initial rt-pcr after admission patients were subsequently classified into 2 groups based on the following criteriathe baseline data of the onset of symptoms are recorded in table 1all patients underwent initial thoracic ct examinations fig 1a andfig 2a after admission the intervals between the initial ct scan and the onset of symptoms were 49  39 days in group a and 10  45 days in group b it should be noted that 1 patient in group a and 3 in group b were asymptomatic and there was no interval between the initial ct scan and the onset of symptoms all patients underwent follow-up ct scans fig 1b and c and fig 2b and rt-pcr every 3 to 8 days during their hospitalization based on the severity of covid-19 but for the asymptomatic patients in group b they received follow-up ct scans when their rt-pcr results were positive in addition all patients received relevant medical management during their hospitalizationthoracic non-contrast enhanced ct scans were performed in 17 patients with 16-row multidetector row ct system uct 510 united imaging shanghai china and in 5 patients with a 128-row multidetector ct system somatom definition flash siemens healthcare systems germany each examination was performed in a breath-hold mode at full suspended inspiration the scanning coverage was from the thoracic inlet to the middle level of the left kidney scanning parameters for the uct 510 scanner were as followsthe scanning parameters for somatom definition flash scanner were similar to those for the 16-multidetector row ct scanner except the tube current of 250 ma and detector collimation of 06 mm data from 2 ct scanners were respectively transferred to the image processing workstation somatom definition flash siemens healthcare systems germany the window width and level were set to 350 hu and 40 hu for mediastinal window and to 1000 hu and -700 for lung window respectivelyall image data were independently reviewed on above-mentioned workstation by 2 experienced radiologists the first author with 1 year of experience in radiology and the co first author with 8 years of experience in radiology blinded to epidemiologic and clinical information in case of discrepancy between the 2 observers a third radiologist co corresponding author with 12 years of experience in radiology reviewed the images for the final adjudication before the previous radiologists reviewed the image data a professor of radiology the corresponding author with 22 years of experience in body radiology trained them on how to review the image dataaccording to the expert consensus9 the initial ct manifestations in groups a and b were assessed based on the following featuresin order to assess the severity of the disease more accurately we also devised a semi-quantitative scoring system to evaluate the extent and severity of disease in this study as illustrated in tables 2 and 3 the ct lesion extent and density scores were determined based on the anatomic distribution and density of lung lesions referencing to the reported semi-quantitative score system12 the extent score was assessed on lung window based on the extent of the 5 lung lobes involved by covid-19 the overall lung extent score was obtained by summing the 5 lobe scores the density score was evaluated on lung window based on the percentages of consolidation and other abnormalities in each covid-19 lesion and the overall lung density score was acquired by summing the 5 lobe scores the score range for both lungs in each patient is from 0 no detectable abnormality to 20 more than 75 of each lung lobe involved by covid-19 lesion and 100 of consolidation in each lesionin order to assess the intra-observer variability of the above semi-quantitative measurements the first author repeated the image data analysis 3 days later the intra-observer variability was obtained by comparison of the 2 measurements by the first author the inter-observer variability was accessed with the results by 2 independent double-blinded observers the first author and the co-first authorall data were statistically analyzed by ibm spss statistics software version 250 for windows spss chicago il usa the normality of distribution was evaluated by shapirowilk test continuous variables expressed as the mean and standard deviation the categorical variables were described in percentiles and compared using the chi-squared test or fisher exact test both intra-observer and inter-observer variability were tested for ct score using inter-class correlation coefficient icc the semi-quantitative extent and density scores of covid-19 lesions on initial ct were considered to be reproducible when the icc was greater than 07513 statistical difference was defined as p  05 for all tests15 100 patients in group a fig 1a and 3 429 in group b had abnormal findings on initial ct while the remaining 4 571 patients had none abnormal ct findings patients with abnormal ct findings were more frequent in group a than in group b p  05 pure ggos and ggos with consolidation andor other abnormalities were observed in 3 20 and 12 80 patients in group a respectively in group b 1 143 and 2 286 patients had pure ggos and ggos with consolidation respectively among the previous 4 patients with normal image on initial ct scan 3 cases 75 developed into focal pure ggo on follow-up scans fig 2athe mean intra-observer and inter-observer icc values were 096 95ci 091098 and 094 95ci 086097 for extent score and 095 95ci 090098 and 093 95ci 084097 for density score respectively therefore the average of the extent score and density score from the first author and the co first authors measurements was used for the subsequent statistical analysisas demonstrated in table 4 the mean extent score of lesions on ct in group a was 67 ranged from 1 to 17 in group b the mean extent score of lesions on ct was 11 ranged from 0 to 4 in group a 13 867 and 2 133 patients scored at least 5 and 10 respectively except the 4 patients with a normal ct finding on initial scans the remaining 3 patients in group b scored 1 3 and 4 according to the extent scoring system the extent of lung lobe involved by covid-19 lesions in group a was strikingly greater than that observed in group b p  001as shown in table 4 the mean density score of lesions in both lungs in group a mean score 101 range 117 was significantly higher than that in group b mean score 13 range 04 in group a 14 and 11 patients scored at least 5 933 and 10 733 respectively in contrast none of patients in group b with abnormal ct findings on initial scans had lesion density score of more than 5 p  001 indicating that the covid-19 in second-generation infected patients could be milder when compared with those with imported infectioncovid-19 is a new disease with high infectivity causing an enormous impact on public health14 the chinese spring festival travel rush has triggered massive population movements which gave rise to the confirmed cases of covid-19 outside the original district wuhan china of this disease with imported infection as well as cases with second-generation infection in succession in order to better master the characteristics of covid-19 in patients outside the original district for appropriate treatment we carried out our study to investigate the discrepancy in ct manifestations of this pneumonia in patients outside the original district wuhan china between cases with imported infection and the second-generation infectionour study revealed that abnormal findings on initial ct scans can be found in each patient with imported infection but not patients with the second-generation infection in patients with the second-generation infection some patients could have abnormal initial ct appearances and some could not our findings can be explained by the following pathological mechanism as reported1517 rna virus is characterized by error-prone viral replication and recombination and usually generates progeny viruses with highly diverse genomes which might result in reduction of virulence and pathogenicity we could presume that the 2019-ncov as a novel rna virus might have the similar characteristics of reduction of virulence and pathogenicity resulted from the error-prone viral replication and recombinationas shown in our study ggo and consolidation could be the most common patterns of ct abnormalities of the confirmed covid-19 in patients with imported infection which was consistent with the published reports911 as reported9 ggo and consolidation could respectively reflect the potential pathological abnormalities in different stages of the disease seen mainly in the early stage of the disease the underlying pathologic change of pure ggo can be small amount of exudation of fluid in alveolar cavity and interlobular interstitial edema10 consolidation lesions could be regarded as a marker of more severe phase11 reflecting a large amount of cell-rich or fibrous exudation accumulated in the alveolar cavity and pulmonary interstitium10 it is noteworthy that 3 cases of second-generation with normal finding on initial ct scan developed into focal ggos during follow-up ct suggesting that the limitation of ct in the early detection of asymptomatic patients with the second-generation the covid-19 case without abnormal manifestation on initial ct scan should be confirmed by 2019-ncov detection via rt-pcr together with a history of close contact with imported infectionmoreover we found that the discrepancies of extent and density scores obtained on the initial ct could exist between patients with imported infection and with the second-generation infection in detail the extent of lung lobe involved by covid-19 lesions in patients with imported infection was strikingly greater than that in patients with second-generation infection the previous discrepancies of extent and density scores between groups can be explained as follows on one hand the virus load or the chance of being exposed to the virus in the environment in the original district wuhan could be much higher than any other district where there were much fewer covi-19 cases on the other hand ggos with consolidation or other abnormalities ie reticular andor interlobular septal thickening involving multiple lobes could be more common in patients with imported infection than in patients with the second-generation infection resulting in elevated ct density and extent scores in patients with imported infection when compared with patients with second-generation infection our findings suggest that patients with imported infection might have more rapid progression of disease and increasing likelihood of mixed bacterial coinfection1819 based on the comparison of ct density score between groups we can presume that the covid-19 in second-generation infected patients could be milder when compared to those with imported infectionour study had several limitations for one thing a larger sample size of covid-19 patients is required for further investigation especially with an emphasis on asymptomatic second-generation patients for another thing the semi-quantitative scoring system of disease in this study was based on the typical ct manifestations applied in the expert consensus9 the other abnormal findings such as reticulation and interlobular septal thickening did not particularly evaluate and further modification is requiredthe ct findings of covid-19 vary according to the routes of infection patients with imported infection tend to have more severe ct manifestations suggesting that ct could accurately evaluate the covid-19 in the population cases with second-generation infection could be manifested as normal finding on the initial ct scan but may progress to mild abnormalities on follow-up cts indicating 2019-ncov detection via rt-pcr could be essential in the population with high risk of infection we hope that our findings can help clinicians outside the original district wuhan china of this disease

of individual genes body trs brian and baric 2005 pasternak et al 2006 perlman and netland 2009 woo et al 2009almost all cov field studies investigating bats or other animals are based on pcr assays targeting parts of the orf1ab typically the rdrp in these studies pcr amplicon sizes range from as little as 121 to around 404 base-pairs anthony et al 2013a da silva filho et al 2012 de souza luna et al 2007 moes et al 2005 tong et al 2009 it should be noted that these small amplicon sizes drastically hinder cov phylogenetic reconstructions therefore caution should be taken when drawing conclusions on the relationships within the subfamily coronavirinae based on such small sequence fragmentsthere are only few characterizations of complete cov genomes from bat feces as summarized in table 1
 the lack of virus isolates obtained directly from bats challenges the complete genomic characterization of these large and highly variable rna viruses the information originating from the four available metagenomic studies reporting cov sequences offers even less phylogenetic power because the resulting genomic fragments are very variable in genomic location and length donaldson et al 2010 ge et al 2012 li et al 2010 wu et al 2012bto provide order in cov taxonomy the current proposal of the international committee for the taxonomy of viruses ictv is based on pairwise amino acid distances in seven concatenated partial or complete nsp domains encompassing about 50 of the cov genome in technical analogy to an approach that has been validated for the rna virus family picornaviridae lauber and gorbalenya 2012b amino acid identity below 90 was found to be discriminatory for the designation of novel cov species de groot et al 2012 a different criterion relying on rdrp-grouping units rgu also used pairwise amino acid distances but was restricted to a translated 816 nucleotide rdrp nsp12 fragment this was chosen as an amenable approach to account for the partial genomic sequences generated by most pcr-based field studies it was found that defined alphacoronavirus rgu differed by at least 48 and betacoronavirus rgu by at least 63 in this rdrp fragment this allowed a surrogate criterion for species definition in the absence of complete genomic sequences drexler et al 2010 tao et al 2012 however the increase in partial cov sequences has caused a loss of discriminatory power of these rgu thresholdsfor example the novel hcov species mers-cov de groot et al 2013 van boheemen et al 2012 and the genetically closely related pipistrellus bat covs clearly belong to one rgu annan et al 2013 reusken et al 2010 however these novel bat viruses also differ by only 51 from the established cov species hku5 implying that they share sufficient rdrp sequence identity to be classifiable within both an rgu defined either by mers-cov or by hku5 re-analysis of all available rdrp sequence data for the present paper indicated that the 48 threshold previously determined for alphacoronaviruses could be maintained in contrast a revised lower threshold of at least 51 amino acid sequence distance in this rdrp fragment was necessary to accommodate all betacoronavirus species included in the current ictv proposal de groot et al 2012 and the novel partial cov sequences
fig 1
a shows the increase in bat cov sequence deposition into genbank that closely followed the 20023 sars pandemic an even bigger increase of overall cov sequence entries can be observed after 2009 this is likely due to both the advent of next-generation sequencing techniques and changed genbank policies requiring host information from submitters fig 1b shows that the proportion of bat cov sequences among the 5489 overall cov entries containing host information is small compared to those from hosts such as ungulates birds and carnivores possible explanations for this difference are likely the veterinary relevance of livestock and pet covs and the usage of prototype viruses as laboratory models leading to sequence entries eg for bcov tgev fipv and ibv still the number of bat cov entries n
  390 almost equalled that of hcovs n
  460 however the lack of host information for hcovs probably introduces a bias in this comparisonan analysis of published cov research reports is shown in fig 1c the impact of the sars-epidemic in 20023 on the number of cov publications was tremendous leading to a near four-fold increase to around 700 published studies per year after 2002 similarly the identification of sars-related covs in bats led to around 15 studies on bat covs per year after 2005 of note this figure also shows that scientific publications began to decrease a few years after sars-cov disappeared the emergence of the mers-cov is likely to counteract this phenomenon in the years to comethe rapid increase in bat cov studies enabled hypotheses of bats as reservoir hosts for alpha and betacoronaviruses only a few years after the sars epidemic vijaykrishna et al 2007 woo et al 2009 fig 2

provides details of this phylogenetic analysis for the genera alpha- and betacoronavirus the large number of deep branches leading to bat viruses shown in red emphasizes the association of these two cov genera with bat hosts this is particularly true for the alphacoronavirus clade formerly designated 1b which includes hcov-229e -nl63 and the betacoronavirus clades bdthe relevance of bat covs for these genera is also reflected in the current taxonomic proposal of the ictv de groot et al 2012 of the 15 recognized species in these two genera six were only found in bats these viruses are shown with bat pictograms in fig 3 and include miniopterus bat coronavirus 1 miniopterus bat coronavirus hku8 rhinolophus bat coronavirus hku2 scotophilus bat coronavirus 512 pipistrellus bat coronavirus hku5 rousettus bat coronavirus hku9 and tylonycteris bat coronavirus hku4 many partial bat cov rdrp sequences were not included in fig 3 because only small sequence fragments reducing the phylogenetic resolution were available corman et al 2013b drexler et al 2010 still the sequences from these studies detailed in table 1 do not alter the overall picture of bat cov-associated clades within the genera alpha- and betacoronavirusfor most of these bat covs lack of complete genomic sequences prevents their taxonomic designation as species still many of the partial sequences included in fig 3 branch deeply in the phylogenetic tree and likely represent not only new species but even new genetic clades this is exemplified by the unclassified african hipposideros betacoronaviruses pfefferle et al 2009 quan et al 2010 tong et al 2009 which putatively represent a yet to be defined betacoronavirus clade e and unclassified neotropical carollia and pteronotus viruses corman et al 2013b putatively corresponding to additional betacoronavirus clades
fig 4
shows that 11 of the 18 extant bat families already contain cov descriptions including the two major bat lineages yinpterochiroptera and yangochiroptera teeling et al 2005 in most bat families both alpha- and betacoronaviruses are known and these detections have originated from both frugivorous and insectivorous bat hosts lack of detection in the remaining bat families is likely due to non-exhaustive sampling of the almost 1200 extant bat species schipper et al 2008 simmons 2005 teeling et al 2005 this void may be filled in future studies
fig 5
shows the geographic origin of all 53 studies characterizing novel bat covs and table 1 provides details for these studies the figure highlights that studies from all continents are now available but there is a drastic lack of studies from resource-limited or politically unstable settings specifically several biodiversity hotspots linked to the emergence of zoonotic viruses jones et al 2008 are not covered at all including the congo basin large parts of south-east asia and the neotropical ecozone future sampling of bats from these and other poorly studied areas will likely complete bat species coverage and further increase the known cov genomic diversityonly a small fraction of the currently known mammalian covs originates from primate ungulate lagomorph carnivore and rodent hosts as shown in fig 3 bats outnumber any other mammalian host in terms of virus diversity throughout the cov phylogeny examples can be found of both promiscuous and very host-restricted viruses the paramount example of a promiscuous cov is probably betacoronavirus 1 the species including bcov hcov-oc43 and related viruses which has been detected in cows horses dogs humans waterbucks deer antelopes camels and giraffes worldwide alekseev et al 2008 guy et al 2000 hasoksuz et al 2007 jin et al 2007 lim et al 2013 majhdi et al 1997 zhang et al 1994 similarly fipv canine coronavirus ccov and tgev are now included in a single species termed alphacoronavirus 1 and mhv and rat coronavirus together are now termed murine coronavirus de groot et al 2012 another example of an apparently promiscuous cov is the unclassified bat virus hku10 which has been detected in the bat families hipposideridae and pteropodidae lau et al 2012most other covs have been confined to single host genera exemplified by the detection of sars-related covs and several alphacoronaviruses in rhinolophus myotis miniopterus nyctalus and carollia bat hosts including detections of closely related viruses in individual bats separated by thousands of miles corman et al 2013b drexler et al 2010 tang et al 2006 similarly hipposideros betacoronaviruses from thailand kenya nigeria and ghana are closely related gouilh et al 2011 pfefferle et al 2009 quan et al 2010 tong et al 2009 and the betacoronavirus hku9 has been detected in different species of flying foxes in africa and asia anthony et al 2013b lau et al 2010b tao et al 2012 watanabe et al 2010 woo et al 2007 of note the detection of both host-specific and -nonspecific mammalian covs parallels what can be observed in the avian coronavirinae genera for example infectious bronchitis virus ibv genus gammacoronavirus has been detected in a wide range of birds while the recently described deltacoronaviruses appear to be more host-specific chu et al 2011co-segregation of covs and their bat hosts is most visible for hku9 the hipposideros betacoronaviruses and the sars-related cov compared to pteropodidae hipposideros and rhinolophus hosts fig 3 fig 4 a striking counter-example is the large number of bat alphacoronaviruses that cluster together with the prototype viruses hcov-229e -nl63 and pedv fig 3 viruses from numerous bat hosts together with ungulate and human viruses are contained in this part of the alphacoronavirus tree and in contrast to the betacoronaviruses the designation of clearly separated subclades is challenging however more work needs to be done to formally analyze the degree of phylogenetic co-segregation in the coronavirinae subfamilythe most well-studied cov host switches have probably occurred from bats to humans the foremost example is the paradigmatic host switch of sars-cov from rhinolophid bats into humans or potentially civets balboni et al 2011 drexler et al 2010 lau et al 2010a lau et al 2005 li et al 2005 ren et al 2006 rihtaric et al 2010 yang et al 2013 these human civet and bat viruses are now officially summarized by the ictv in one species termed sars-related coronavirus de groot et al 2012the genomic relatedness of human and bat sars-related coronaviruses is greatest in the orf1ab while a bat ancestor containing the structural proteins of human sars-cov has so far not been detected bat sars-related coronaviruses fail to interact with the human sars-cov receptor molecule ace2 possibly associated with small deletions in their receptor-binding domain rbd compared to human sars-cov li 2013 ren et al 2008 in line with these differences a bat sars-related coronavirus synthesized by reverse genetics was only infectious in cell culture and mice when the spike gene was exchanged by the human sars-cov homologue becker et al 2008 because the rbd of european rhinolophid bat sars-related coronaviruses was more related to that of the human sars-cov than the rbd from chinese bat viruses drexler et al 2010 recombination may have played a role in the emergence of the human pathogenic virushowever not all rhinolophid bat species have been tested for sars-related coronaviruses for example only 12 of the at least 19 rhinolophid bat species that occur in china have been tested and sars-related coronavirus sequence information is only available from 5 of these species lau et al 2005 li et al 2005 poon et al 2005 tang et al 2006 woo et al 2006 woo et al 2007 yang et al 2013 yuan et al 2010 therefore further studies of rhinolophus species in africa europe and asia may provide more insight into the ancestral bat viruses that were the source of the emergence of human sars-covit should also be mentioned that the hipposideros betacoronaviruses detected in africa and asia are clearly distinct from sars-related coronaviruses these viruses can be distinguished by both sequence distance-based taxonomic approaches described above additionally the phylogenetic position and genomic properties of the unclassified hipposideros betacoronaviruses differ from sars-related coronaviruses these genomic properties include chiefly their different viral 3-genome ends and accessory orfs downstream from the membrane gene in the hipposideros covs pfefferle et al 2009 quan et al 2010bat ancestors were also found for hcov-229e in african hipposideros bats pfefferle et al 2009 and a growing body of data indicates that bats worldwide harbour covs related to the mers-cov annan et al 2013 anthony et al 2013a ithete et al 2013 reusken et al 2010 wacharapluesadee et al 2013 woo et al 2007 unfortunately no complete genomes are available yet for the putative bat ancestors of hcov-229e and mers-covputative mers-cov bat ancestors have been most consistently found in the bat family vespertilionidae and the related family molossidae these covs include european pipistrellus bat viruses a virus termed pml2011 from a south-african neoromicia bat annan et al 2013 ithete et al 2013 covs from a spanish hypsugo savii and eptesicus isabellinus falcon et al 2011 sequences from thai bat guano wacharapluesadee et al 2013 a cov from a mexican nyctinomops bat anthony et al 2013a and the fully sequenced betacoronavirus clade c prototype bat covs hku4 and hku5 from china woo et al 2007 clade c betacoronaviruses from ghanaian nycteris bats were more distantly related to the mers-cov annan et al 2013 a short 203-nt rdrp sequence fragment 100 identical to the mers-cov prototype strain emc2012 was described in a single saudi-arabian taphozous perforatus bat belonging to the family emballonuridae memish et al 2013 although the high sequence identity should have facilitated characterization of other cov genomic regions no further virus sequence could be obtained from this specimendetection of closely related covs in different bat families is rare but may occur lau et al 2012 yang et al 2013 however even if closely related mers-cov bat ancestors existed in both the distantly related bat families vespertilionidae and emballonuridae fig 4 the lack of further cov sequence information and the single detection of a short genome fragment require further confirmation of this finding interestingly in the same study a 202-nt sequence from a rhinopoma hardwickii bat was detected which was 100 identical to bcov and other betacoronavirus 1 reference strains memish et al 2013 again whether clade a betacoronaviruses also exist in bats requires confirmation by detection in more individual bats and more cov sequence informationregarding potential intermediate hosts of mers-cov camels have been shown to have antibodies against this virus at high rates and titers perera et al 2013 reusken et al 2013 conclusions on the passage of putative bat ancestors of mers-cov to humans via camels will only be possible upon genomic characterization of the viruses eliciting this strong antibody responsefinally no direct bat ancestor of hcov-nl63 has ever been found although the phylogenetic clade containing this hcov is enclosed by bat covs while the recent success in cultivating hcov-nl63 on immortalized bat cells may hint at some link between bats and this virus huynh et al 2012 the bat viruses described in that and all previous studies are genetically rather distant from hcov-nl63 corman et al 2013bthe exact mechanisms by which covs adapt to new hosts are unclear clearly virus entry and innate immune responses are among the paramount obstacles to be overcome during viral host switching the high degree of conservation of the mers-cov receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 in different hosts is thus a worrying scenario muller et al 2012 raj et al 2013 generally it is unclear whether direct zoonotic transmission from bats to humans has occurred for any hcov alternative scenarios involve intermediate hosts such as carnivores or ungulates annan et al 2013 cotten et al 2013 enserink 2013 graham and baric 2010 lau et al 2013 song et al 2005 wu et al 2012aone way to rapidly acquire novel genes that potentially facilitate host switching is recombination between different viruses a canonical example of recombination in covs is fipv type 2 the prototype strains of this feline virus are recombinants between fipv type 1 and ccov in different parts of the orf1b and spike genes herrewegh et al 1998 recombination has also been hypothesized to be involved in the emergence of the sars-cov graham and baric 2010 hon et al 2008 lau et al 2010a yuan et al 2010 and hcov-oc43 genotypes lau et al 2011 however the observed recombination events in sars-cov and hcov-oc43 are restricted to genetically closely related viruses the exact recombination partners giving rise to sars-cov have never been detectedanother phenomenon putatively associated with cov adaptation to distinct hosts and cells is exemplified by the variable deletions spanning over 600 nucleotides in the globular s1 domain of the spike gene that is associated with a change from enteric tgev to respiratory tract porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv tropism whether the 290-nucleotide deletion downstream from the spike gene in hcov-oc43 in comparison to its likely ancestral virus bcov vijgen et al 2006 vijgen et al 2005 represents an adaptation to a human host remains unknownthere is little information on the clinical consequences of cov infections for bat hosts in humans hcovs-nl63 -oc43 -hku1 and -229e circulate constantly sars-cov disappeared a few years after its epidemic transmission while the novel mers-cov may only be starting to spread enserink 2013 all hcov cause primarily respiratory symptoms in humans hamre and procknow 1966 mcintosh et al 1967 peiris et al 2003 van der hoek 2007 van der hoek et al 2006 woo et al 2005 although the mers-cov has also been associated with severe renal complications zaki et al 2012 hcov shedding in feces is not uncommon liu et al 2004 and there are sporadic reports on covs in humans with gastroenteritis eg a case report on bcov in a pediatric patient leading to the tentative designation human enteric coronavirus zhang et al 1994 however covs are apparently not generally related to gastroenteritis in humans esper et al 2010in comparison the clinical picture in other animals is considerably more variable ranging from mild respiratory and gastroenteric symptoms to systemic disease with hepatitis multi-organ failure and death summarized in saif 2004 the high cov concentrations in bat feces annan et al 2013 drexler et al 2011 together with the recovery of coronaviral rna from the small and large intestine of frugivorous bats watanabe et al 2010 point to replication in the enteric tract this is compatible both with the use of bat fecal material or intestinal specimens to detect bat covs in almost all published studies and with the high cov rna concentrations in the lower intestine of naturally infected hedgehogs corman et al 2013a although there are no apparent clinical signs of gastroenteritis watanabe et al 2010 or any other disease in bats it should be noted that bats appear to raise antibodies against their coronaviruses at high rates lau et al 2010b lau et al 2005 muller et al 2007 tsuda et al 2012 whether this correlates with the severity of infection remains unknownfrom an ecologic point of view covs seem to rely on massive amplification on a population level during bat reproductive seasonal cycles potentially associated with fecal-oral transmission drexler et al 2011 gloza-rausch et al 2008 osborne et al 2011 similar phenomena have been observed for other bat-associated viruses such as the filo- henipa- astro- and lyssaviruses amman et al 2012 drexler et al 2011 george et al 2011 wacharapluesadee et al 2010 still respiratory or vertical cov transmission cannot be ruled out at this point mostly due to the necessity of shielding these protected animals from human interference hypothetically one could question whether insectivorous bats that rely on a functional larynx for echolocation of prey could even tolerate respiratory infection this highly speculative scenario could point to an evolution of bat corona- viruses towards infection outside the respiratory tract alternatively it could represent a sample bias due to the rapid death and decay of bats suffering from any respiratory disease that impairs predation a likely scenario given the very active metabolism of bats which for example requires insectivorous bats to consume several grams of insects per night encarnao and dietz 2006ten years after the sars epidemic there is an overwhelming body of evidence highlighting the relevance of bats for the evolution of mammalian covs vijaykrishna et al 2007 woo et al 2009 from a taxonomic perspective there is a clear need for the establishment of reliable criteria for these viruses such as those established for the family picornaviridae lauber and gorbalenya 2012b the challenges observed in attempts to transfer these distance-based approaches to less well characterized virus families such as the filoviridae lauber and gorbalenya 2012a highlight that the current set of cov taxonomic criteria will likely have to be optimized and thoroughly validatedboth the existing ictv and the rgu-based attempts use a similar methodological background and offer more reliable criteria than phylogeny alone however both suffer from several shortcomings loss of discriminatory sharpness upon the increment in known cov genetic diversity will likely limit these approaches although the ictv criteria may prove more robust due to the larger genomic fragments incorporated from a technical point of view it should be noted that the extension of the rdrp fragment size used for rgu definitions can be challenging when field specimens contain low rna concentrations corman et al 2013b drexler et al 2010 a similar difficulty can be observed for the ictv proposal which requires the characterization of approximately 50 of a typical cov genome the more than 20 unclassified cov species in the current ictv proposal demonstrate that this task is not easily fulfilled for viruses which have not been grown in culture de groot et al 2012 furthermore both approaches do not incorporate any sequence distance-based data from genomic regions encoding the structural proteins besides the technical constraints on characterizing these genes that were stated above this is likely also due to the poor sequence alignments some of these genes entail the high variability eg of the spike gene complicates the establishment of criteria applicable to the complete subfamily still incorporation of some of the more conserved structural genes such as the envelope membrane or parts of the spike and nucleocapsid genes may prove helpful in carrying out this promising genome-based taxonomic approachregarding mammalian cov hosts several questions remain to be answered first the complete absence of host-specific covs in monkeys or apes impedes our understanding of any putative cov evolution in other primates than humans the apparently recent host switches responsible for the generation of hcovs may indicate that even if covs exist in non-human primates nhp they may not be relevant for the evolution of their human counterparts however the current lack of cov data from nhps prevents more definite assertions on this topicsecond intermediate hosts adapting bat viruses to humans or other mammals have neither been conclusively found for sars-cov nor for any other hcov despite the high seroprevalence of chinese animal handlers against sars-cov it is not entirely clear whether civets indeed adapted sars-cov for infection in humans graham and baric 2010 guan et al 2003 similarly the high seroprevalence of camels against mers-cov suggests that these animals are a potential source of the initial introduction of this virus into the human population reusken et al 2013 however the current lack of mers-cov genomic sequences from camels prevents definite conclusions on this putative scenariothird many mammalian orders have not been or are only poorly studied this is exemplified by the single cov detected in lagomorphs rabbit coronavirus hku14 which likely belongs to the betacoronavirus 1 species and by murine coronavirus the former mhv the only known rodent cov species whether covs exist in other mammalian hosts and to what extent these viruses contribute to our understanding of cov evolution for now remain obscurefinally the recent description of distantly related nidoviruses in insects has enabled hypotheses on a putative insect origin of coronaviridae ancestors nga et al 2011 zirkel et al 2011 interestingly the number of cov descriptions from insectivorous bats is large and a clade c betacoronavirus was recently described from insectivorous hedgehogs corman et al 2013a insectivorous mammals such as shrews moles and hedgehogs from the order eulipotyphla could thus be specifically investigated to bolster hypotheses on the putative ancient insect origins of the covs harbored by insectivorous mammalian hostsit has been hypothesized previously that large genome size frequent recombination and high mutation rate make coronaviruses particularly prone to zoonotic host switching woo et al 2009 these hallmarks require further consideration first the large cov genomes indeed allow for the accommodation of several genes putatively enhancing virus pathogenicity for example the evolutionary origin of the highly variable sars-cov accessory proteins is largely unknown and deletion of these genes strikingly decreases virulence mcbride and fielding 2012 narayanan et al 2008 similarly among cov genomes only members of the betacoronavirus clade contain a hemagglutinin-esterase related to that of influenza c viruses zeng et al 2008 compatible with putative inter-viral gene exchange still little is known about how and when covs can incorporate novel genes into their genomes the technical difficulties observed with the usage of cov-based vectors for heterologous gene expression indicate that at least in vitro the introduction of foreign genes into a cov genome is not an easy task de haan et al 2005 sola et al 2003 additionally there are many examples of smaller rna viruses containing numerous accessory genes that enhance virulence such as hiv-1 at only a third of the typical cov genome size malim and emerman 2008second it should be kept in mind that covs possess proofreading enzymes which limit their mutation rates drastically compared to other rna viruses eckerle et al 2010 hanada et al 2004 minskaia et al 2006 covs have thus likely evolved a fine balance between necessary mutation rates and rna proofreading denison et al 2011 assumptions of high cov mutation rates are therefore probably only adequate in specific scenarios such as the recent host switches of sars- and mers-covthird recombination may certainly occur during cov replication and the prototype example of the recombinant origins of fipv type 2 was discussed above herrewegh et al 1998 pasternak et al 2006 it should be noted however that other rna viruses such as the negative-stranded paramyxoviruses which probably recombine much less than covs still give rise to a huge number of likely zoonotic host switches from bats and birds into other mammals at least rivalling the covs drexler et al 2012the cumulative evidence suggests that at least four hcovs share a likely zoonotic origin hcov-oc43 from bovines and hcov-229e sars- and mers-cov from bats in comparison only three influenza a viruses h1n1 h2n2 and h3n2 have so far successfully established circulation in the human population palese 2004 in contrast to covs influenza a viruses cause regular epidemics or even pandemics still the large number of zoonotic hcovs emphasizes their potential to infect animals other than their original mammalian hosts and demonstrates the value of continuous screening of humans and wildlife for potentially emerging pathogens however it should be kept in mind that sequence detection alone does not warrant premature conclusions as to the zoonotic potential of such viruses deeks et al 2013 drosten 2013 authentic risk assessment strategies would for example rely on infection experiments employing isolated or synthetically reconstructed viruses in the specific case of the covs identification of genomic markers associated with the viral potential to switch hosts or with increased pathogenicity may enable alternative studies these markers could include viral interferon antagonists and the rbd both of which could be analyzed in vitro even in the absence of virus isolates or completely characterized genomesfinally any attempt to eradicate bats or other wildlife in reaction to virus descriptions should be strongly discouraged as this counteracts the ecological relevance of these animals eg for pollination and pest reduction boyles et al 2011 kalka et al 2008comparative genomics at the sequence level has existed for 20 years since the time genome sequencing started in earnest already there have been many proposals to compare genomes boore and brown1 used gene order to study the evolutionary relationships of metazoan mitochondrial genomes snel et al2 later constructed the phylogenetic tree for completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes based on gene content in snel et als method the similarity between two genomes is defined as the number of genes that they have in common divided by their total number of genes however such techniques are time-consuming as they must first identify all the genes in one genome these approaches together with g  c content edit distance and reversal and rearrangement distances35 compare genomes using only partial genomic information thus these results are usually controversial because single-gene sequences generally do not contain enough information to construct an evolutionary history of organismsin koonins editorial6 about the emerging paradigm and open problems in comparative genomics he pointed out  but within these superfamilies there is nothing like a straight one-to-one correspondence between genomes and in distant genomes most of the members may not be orthologous this sentence enlightened us to get a novel idea of comparing genomes we can construct a genome space in this space each point corresponds to a genome uniquely the natural distance between two points in the genome space reflects the biological distance between these two genomes currently there is no method to represent genomes by a point in a space without losing biological informationwe introduce graphical representation of dna sequence to construct the genome space the graphical representation of dna sequence provides a simple way of viewing sorting and comparing various gene structures thus it is an attractive and promising research direction the first important method in this direction is due to hamori7 he used a three-dimensional curve to represent a dna sequence gates8 later constructed a two-dimensional graphical representation that is simpler than the hamori curve however gates graphical representation has high degeneracy recently we reported a new two-dimensional graphical representation of gene sequences9 which has no circuit or degeneracy so that the correspondence between gene sequences and gene graphs is one-to-one in this way the original dna sequence can be recovered from its graph mathematically without loss of biological information in this paper we make a minor modification of our previous method and obtain a new graphical representation approach for dna sequences the breakthrough of the subject is that we can construct the moment vectors from dna sequences using this new graphical method and we can prove that the correspondence between moment vectors and dna sequences is one-to-one the novelty and uniqueness of our approach is that by using these moment vectors of dna sequences we have constructed a genome space as a subspace in euclidean space each genome sequence can be represented as a point in this space therefore this genome space can be used to make comparative analysis to study the clustering and phylogenetic relationship among genomes the biological evolutionary distance between two genomes can be obtained through the euclidean distance among the corresponding points in the genome spacewe constructed a new dna sequence graph in two quadrants of the cartesian coordinate system with pyrimidines c and t in the first quadrant and purines a and g in the fourth quadrant as shown in fig 1 the vectors corresponding to the four nucleotides g a t and c are as follows
here we should emphasize that the specific ordering of the four nucleotides in the cartesian coordinate system is related to the gc content of genomes as it is explained in the discussion section points in the graphical representation are obtained by the sum of vectors representing nucleotides in the sequence in fig 2 we give the graphical representation of whole mitochondrial genome sequences of human common chimpanzee norway rat and hedgehog which are based on the vector system shown in fig 1 since human and chimpanzee belong to the same order primates their mitochondrial genome graphical representations are very similar visually these four dna sequence graphical curves have no circuits or degeneracy and the correspondence between the sequence and the graphical curve can be mathematically proved to be one-to-one9motivated by our previous work for protein sequence analysis10 we use moment vectors to characterize a dna graphical curve given the graphical curve of a dna sequence which can be represented by a sequence of points 1 y1 2 y2   n yn we can compute a sequence of numbers 1  y1 2  y2   n  yn conversely if we know the sequence of numbers 1  y1 2  y2   n  yn we can recover the graph 1 y1 2 y2   n yn therefore we want to find a sequence of numbers each of which uses the global information of the sequence of numbers 1  y1 2  y2   n  yn in such a way that this new sequence of numbers determines and is determined by the sequence of numbers 1  y1 2  y2   n  yn for this purpose we consider the moments which are defined as follows
where n is the number of nucleotides contained in a dna sequence and xi yi represents the position of the ith nucleotide in the dna graphical curve according to this definition each dna sequence has an n-dimensional moment vector m1 m2   mn associated with itthe crucial point in this paper is that the correspondence between a dna sequence and its moment vector obtained from its sequence graph is one-to-one to obtain this conclusion we need to prove the following theoremwe have already obtained a good numerical characterization moment vector to represent a dna sequence now we will use this tool to construct a genome space here we emphasize that the structure of genomes is complicated it may be single-stranded or double-stranded and in a linear or circular structure thus we should consider the different structures when constructing the genome spacefor the simplest genome structures linear single-strand forms we can treat them as linear dna sequences that is every genome corresponds to a general dna sequence thus we can utilize our moment vector to construct the genome space in order to use whole genome information to make comparative analysis among genomes we can use the first n components m1 m2   mn of the moment vector of a genome sequence graph to represent a genome as a point in n-dimensional space thus we obtain an n-dimensional genome space as a subspace in rn using the euclidean distance between two points as an index for comparison we can perform phylogenetic and clustering analysis for genome sequences in this genome spacefor the circular single-strand genomes the construction of genome space is more complicated because we do not know which point is the start point in this circular dna sequence in this case we treat every point as the start point in this circular sequence of length n and then we get n linear single-strand genomes for every linear single-strand genome sequence we can compute its n-dimensional moment vector then we take average by n for these n n-dimensional moment vectors to get a normalized moment vector m1 m2   mn for circular single-strand genomes we use the first n components m1 m2   mn of this normalized moment vector to represent a genome as a point in an n-dimensional space thus we obtain an n-dimensional genome space as a subspace in rnfor the double-stranded genomes we need to point out that the moment vector of reverse complementary sequence is not the same as the original sequence generally when meeting the double-stranded genomes we treat them as two single-stranded genomes we use the above method linear or circular to get two n-dimensional moment vectors for these two single-stranded sequences and then take average to get a general moment vector m1 m2   mn by using the first n components m1 m2   mn of this general moment vector to represent a genome as a point in n-dimensional space thus we obtain an n-dimensional genome space as a subspace in rn here we need to point out that the two strands of some genomes eg mitochondrial genomes some bacterial genomes are differentiated by their nucleotide content which are called the heavy strand and the light strand respectively the two strands have different masses because one has a higher proportion of heavier nucleic acids and its complement a lower proportion in this case we just treat them as the single-stranded by using the heavy strand genomes to make the genome spaceto verify that the biological distance obtained in this way truly incorporates biological utility we apply our new genome space to the phylogenetic analysis of organisms most existing methods for phylogenetic inference using biological sequences can be divided into two groups the algorithms in the first group utilize various distance measures1215 which are based on different models of nucleotide substitution or amino acid replacement and then transform the distance matrix into a tree in the second group of approaches instead of building a tree the tree that can best explain the observed sequences under the evolutionary assumption is found by evaluating of different topologies this category includes parsimony1618 and maximum likelihood methods1921 all these methods require a multiple alignment of the sequences and assume some sort of evolutionary model which require human intervention thus the results are usually controversial however our genome space does not need sequence alignment and any evolutionary model it is totally automatically generated and avoids computation repetitionfirst we consider the phylogeny of mammals mitochondrial dna is not highly conserved and has a rapid mutation rate thus it is very useful for studying the evolutionary relationships of organisms22 we extracted 35 complete mammalian mitochondrial genome sequences from the genbank each of which has length of more than 16 000 nucleotides moreover they have double-stranded and circular structures as mentioned in the previous section because we have already known the gene content of both strands of these genomes we just treat them as the single-stranded by using the heavy strand circular genomes for this case we treat every point as the start point in this circular sequence of length n and then we get n linear single-strand genomes for every linear single-strand genome sequence by using the nucleotide vector system shown in fig 1 we can compute its n-dimensional moment vector then we take average by n for these n n-dimensional moment vectors to get a normalized moment vector m1 m2   mn here we use the first 60 components of the moment vector m1 m2   m60 to characterize these 35 genome graphical curves and obtained 35 points in 60-dimensional genome space by computing the euclidean distances between these points we got the distance matrix for these 35 organisms the phylogenetic tree for them shown in fig 3 is generated using upgma program in the mega 4 package23 the last 10 mammals are grouped into a cluster because they are primates and the phylogenetic relationship among them coincides with those found by raina et al24 we also found that norway rat vole and squirrel are grouped into a cluster for the reason that they are rodent speciesin order to further illustrate the efficiency of our genome space we then focus on the origins and evolution of human immunodeficiency virus hiv hiv is a lentivirus that can lead to acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids a condition in humans in which the immune system begins to fail leading to life-threatening opportunistic infections to develop the anti-hiv drugs and vaccines the research into the origins and evolution of this virus has become very important rambaut et al25 reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of the primate lentiviruses including hiv-1 hiv-2 and the simian immunodeficiency viruses sivs it was discovered that the two human viruses are related to different sivs and therefore have different evolutionary origins however in rambaut et als paper the tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method on an alignment of the nucleotide sequences of polymerase gene in these lentiviruses generally a single-gene sequence does not possess enough information to construct an evolutionary history of organisms thus we use our new method to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree based on the whole genome sequencesthe genomes of lentiviruses are single-stranded linear rna rna has the base uracil u rather than thymine t that is present in dna in fact these rna genome sequences downloaded from genbank have already been transformed into dna sequences change u by t thus we treat them as linear dna sequences using the nucleotide vector system shown in fig 1 the sequence graphs of the genomes of the 33 lentiviruses were obtained here we use the first 12 components of the moment vector to characterize these 33 genome graphical curves and thus we obtained 33 twelve-dimensional vectors these 33 vectors can be viewed as 33 points in a 12-dimensional genome space by computing the euclidean distance between these points we reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of these primate lentiviruses fig 4 using upgma program in the mega 4 package23 the figure illustrates that both the hiv-1 and hiv-2 lineages fall within that of the sivs which are isolated from other primates thus they represent the independent cross-species transmission events in agreement with rambaut et als result our phylogenetic tree shows that hiv-1 group n is a new hiv-1 type between the hiv-1 groups m and o somewhat closer to the m group it also indicates that hiv-1 groups m n and o are closely related to sivs from chimpanzees pan troglodytes troglodytes and pan troglodytes schweinfurthii because there is a mixing of the hiv-1 and siv lineages moreover our result suggests that p t troglodytes sivcpz2 and sivcpz3 in fig 4 is the primary reservoir for hiv-1 group o which is not clear in rambaut et als evolutionary tree in rambaut et als evolutionary tree the position of hiv-1 group o is just between p t troglodytes and p t schweinfurthii but not closer to either of them our suggestion coincides with those found by gao et al26 in gao et als work the authors concluded that the hiv-1 group o is closely related to the just one of these sivcpz lineages found in p t troglodytes for hiv-2 we find that the sivs that are closely related to hiv-2 are not only sivsm sooty mangabey monkey and sivmac macaque as shown by rambaut et als tree but also sivsun sun-tailed monkeyin addition we apply our genome space to another field of virology the taxonomy of coronavirus to study the classification and phylogeny of coronaviruses clearly we apply our genome space to a large set of 30 complete coronavirus genomes from genbank including the two newly sequenced human coronaviruses hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 along with four genomes from flaviviridae and togaviridae which are not coronaviruses outgroups the coronavirus genomes are also single-stranded linear rna so similar to the above lentivirus case we treat these coronavirus genomes as linear dna sequences their abbreviation accession number description and classification are shown in table 1 first we used our two-dimensional genome space actually it is a two-dimensional plane with the first two moments m1 and m2 being x-axis and y-axis to characterize these 34 virus genomes and calculated 34 points in fig 5a four groups group 1 group 2 group 3 and outgroups can be seen in this figure as four distinct clusters to study the classification for coronavirus clearly we expanded it and obtained fig 5b
based on genotypic and serological characterization coronaviruses are divided into three distinct groups with human coronavirus 229e hcov-229e being a group 1 coronavirus and human coronavirus oc43 hcov-oc43 being a group 2 coronavirus there is one additional branch the group 3 coronaviruses which are found exclusively in birds these three distinct groups of coronaviruses clearly form three distinct clusters in our two-dimensional genome space we also find that the newly discovered human coronavirus nl63 is very close to the human coronavirus 229e and thus it is classified into group 1 this result is the same as the identification by van der hoek et al27 our two-dimensional genome space reveals that for human sars-cov the most closely related coronavirus is from a small infected mammal the palm civet not a bird as initially suspected this result coincides with those found by guan et al28 and wang et al29 in guan et als work the authors also suggested that sars viruses were isolated from himalayan palm civets found in a live-animal market in guangdong china similarly in wang et als work the researchers found six palm civets at the restaurant were positive for sars-associated coronavirus they think that sars cases at the restaurant were the result of recent interspecies transfer from the putative palm civet reservoir and not the result of continued circulation of sars-cov in the human populationfor another newly discovered human coronavirus hcov-hku1 woo et al30 classified it into group 2 because hcov-hku1 contains certain features that are characteristic of group 2 coronaviruses however these authors also stated that the proteins of hcov-hku1 formed distinct branches in the phylogenetic trees indicating that hcov-hku1 is a distinct member within the group and is not very closely related to any other known member of group 2 coronaviruses in our two-dimensional genome space we found that hcov-hku1 is an individual coronavirus between the sars group which we suggest as group 4 and the traditional group 2 thus we propose that hcov-hku1 belongs to a new group 5 by computing the distances between the genomes in fig 5a we also reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of these coronaviruses fig 6 using upgma program in the mega 4 package23 thus the evolutionary relationship of these genomes is clearerit should be pointed out that the construction of our genome space depends on four parameters the y-coordinates of the a c t and g in fig 1 if we change these four parameters we shall have different embedding of the genome space because the gc content of dna molecule is found to be variable with different organisms gc content should be considered when we assign the y-coordinate values of nucleotide vectors the genomes of three groups in this paper have low gc content most of them have 3050 gc content thus we assign larger y-coordinate absolute values for g and c however the y-coordinate values of the four nucleotides must be between 1 and 1 to assure that the correspondence between a dna sequence and its corresponding moment vector is one-to-one therefore in order to obtain a universal genome space for all species further studies will be needed to determine the universal y-coordinate valuesin the study of mammalian mitochondrion lentiviruses including hiv and coronavirus genomes we used 60 12 and 2 moments to construct the genome space respectively here we should emphasize that we do not need to calculate all the moments to determine the biological information of genomes remember that in the central limit theorem in probability and statistics the limiting process is gaussian for gaussian the first two moments determine the density function thus we just use the first n moments to get the results where n is much less than n the length of genome thus for coronavirus genomes we only used the first two components of the moment vector m1 m2 because these two moments have allowed us to obtain the stable classified resultwhen higher moments are included the relationship of being close or farther away remains unchanged to make this point clearer we also use the first 20 components of the moment vector m1 m2   m20 to construct the 20-dimmensional genome space by computing the euclidean distances between these points in this genome space we reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of these coronaviruses fig 7 comparing figs 6 and 7 we found that the classification relationship of these genomes are the samegroup 1 group 2 group 3 group 4 group 5 and outgroups can still be seen in the two trees as six distinct clusters this means that when using the higher moments the relationship of being close or farther away remains unchanged in other word two moments are already enough to give the right classifying relationship for these genomes for the same reason we used the first 60 components of the moment vector m1 m2   m60 and the first 12 components of the moment vector m1 m2   m12 to generate the genome space for mammalian mitochondrion and lentiviruses genomes and obtained the stable phylogenetic analysis resultgene rearrangements play important roles in evolution the order of genes and transcription regions are changed during evolution by gene rearrangements such as dna inversions and transpositions31 which do not affect the gene content of the chromosomes for example inversions of large genomic fragments are often observed even between closely related species the phylogenetic analysis based on the gene order is challenging as it requires detailed complex gene order data in genomes and intensive computation in order to test whether our genome space is stable for genomic rearrangement we consider the following simulated experiment we choose the human mitochondrion genome and then invert its two genes atpase 6 and cytochrome oxidase iii to get a simulated genome which we called human ac genome we can treat this new genome as the result of the inversion of genes from the human mitochondrion genome next we randomly generate a genome sequence which has the same length and nucleotide content as the human mitochondrion genome which we called random genome thus we have three genomes of the same length and nucleotide content human human ac and random in addition we also choose the common chimpanzee mitochondrion genome as comparison by using the 60-dimmensional genome space we calculate the distance among these four genomes and get a distance matrix in table 2 in table 2 we found that the distance between human and human ac is very small this means that even some genomic rearrangement happened in a genome the new produced genome still has very close distance from the original genome thus in our genome space the original genome and its genomic rearrangement genome represent different points but have very close distance large-scale genomic rearrangements in closely related organisms make the genome sequences very different from the original genome sequences although the moment vectors of the original and rearranged dna sequences are different if we treat double dna genomes as two single-stranded genomes to get two n-dimensional moment vectors for these two single-stranded sequences and take the average to get a general moment vector m1 m2   mn the computed distances among related species by gene rearrangements will be small the genome spaces constructed by the moment vector have advantages over the gene order phylogenetic analysis since the genome spaces do not depend on gene orders and are capable of using all gene families we will apply the moment vector method on the detailed phylogenetic analysis using the large-scale genomic rearrangement data
in this paper we report a two-dimensional graphical representation for dna sequences a moment vector system to represent a dna sequence is introduced and the correspondence between a dna sequence and its moment vector is mathematically proven to be one-to-one with this moment vector system each genome sequence can be represented as a point in a euclidean space and the genome space is constructed as a subspace of this euclidean space genomes with close evolutionary relationship and similar properties plot close together in this genome space thus it will provide a new powerful tool for analyzing the classification of genomes and their phylogenetic relationships our method is easier and quicker in handling whole or partial genomes than multiple alignment methods there are two major advantages to our method i once a genome space has been constructed it can be stored in a database there is no need to reconstruct the genome space for any subsequent application whereas in multiple alignment methods realignment is needed for add-on new sequences ii one can have global comparison of all genomes simultaneously which no other existing method can achieve furthermore in our method the results in two-dimensional genome space can be displayed and viewed graphically this is user-friendly and allows even non-expert to understand the relationship among different genomes via viewing the graph of genome spacea pandemic of acute respiratory illness has shocked the world initially reported from wuhan province china in dec 2019 currently the viral illness is rapidly spreading across the globe the virus spreads by droplet transmission contact with infected case or contact with contaminated fomites the disease was first recognized after a cluster of pneumonia outbreak was reported in late december 2019 from wuhan china a new human coronavirus hcov was isolated from these cases and identified as a betacoronavirus and provisionally named 2019 novel corona virus 2019-ncov using next-generation sequencing technology 12 on 11 feb 2020 the international committee on taxonomy of viruses named the virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov2 and world health organisation announced covid-19 the name of the new disease caused by it many authors have studied the genome sequences of the circulating virus to understand the viral dynamics and the way this new strain has made its way into the human population and lead to the current pandemic speculations considering it a laboratory constructed or bioengineered virus have also emerged studies to suggest that it natural evolved from its existing ancestors in zoonotic reservoirs of have also been published3 however the research to establish the real origin of sars-cov2 is still underwaycoronavirus cov was first isolated in 1965 by tyrrell and bynoe from the nasal washings of a male child 4 since their discovery in 1965 number of circulating strains of coronaviruses were identified which were considered harmless pathogens causing common cold and mild upper respiratory illness 5coronaviruses covs have large linear positive stranded rna genomes approximately 30 kb in size 2632 kb as they are about 125 nm in diameter 67 and comprise four genera alpha- beta- gamma- and delta-coronavirus 678 the spherical or pleomorphic virions are enveloped and contain a helical nucleocapsid of nucleoproteins n associated with the rna genome embedded in the envelope are 20 nm trimer of spike glycoprotein s also called peplomers which have a club shaped morphology and facilitate attachment to cells envelope also contains integral membrane m and envelope e proteins covs belonging to the beta coronavirus lineage have 5-7 nm spikes of an additional membrane glycoprotein hemagglutinin esterase 7sars was the first known pandemic caused by a cov the disease got recognized in the late 2002 with the outbreak of acute atypical community acquired atypical pneumonia notice first at guangdong province and 29 countries got affected by the spread 5 9 10after the 2003 sars-cov pandemic resulted in widespread morbidity and mortality and same ended in jun 2003 910 this was followed by a novel cov which was isolated from a saudi arabian patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome in june 2012 and the virus was later named middle east respiratory syndrome - coronavirus mers-cov since then multiple outbreaks have been reported in or been epidemiologically linked to the arabian peninsula511besides sars-cov and mers-cov the other human coronaviruses are global in their distribution in a seasonal endemic way are responsible for less than 06-25 of adult community acquired pneumonias patients 12covs have been found in large number of domestic and wild mammals and birds there are studies to suggest that birds and bats are the natural reservoirs of the virus 2 13 14 coronaviruses also have a potential for interspecies transmission which can also cause zoonotic outbreaks 11 studies have suggested a bat origin of the hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 hcov-229e have originated from bats with camelids acting as intermediate hosts 13 14 15 16 molecular evolutionary analysis of hcov-oc43 isolates suggests bovine cov bcov is their genetically closest counterpart compared with other cov species 1718 a high similarity was observed between bcov canine respiratory coronavirus crcov and human coronavirus oc43 hcov-oc43 12 the evolution of hcov-oc43 has been shown to be by recombinant events12 however the origin of cov hku1 is currently unknown 18 phylogenetic analysis has revealed that 2019-ncov fell within the subgenus sarbecovirus of the genus betacoronavirus the homology modelling by the authors derived that 2019-ncov had a similar receptor-binding domain rbd structure to that of sars-cov despite amino acid variation at some key residues and the ability of the virus to bind to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 in humans19the genomic characterisation of the novel coronavirus from wuhan cluster by various study groups based on next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates was performed by various studies lu r et al studied the cov isolated from nine inpatients eight of whom had visited the huanan seafood market in wuhan their study showed that 2019-ncov was related with 88 identity to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-like coronaviruses bat-sl-covzc45 genbank accession number mg 772933 and bat-sl-covzxc21 mg772934 and more distant from sars-cov about 79 and mers-cov about 50 20 however their study also revealed that s gene of 2019-ncov had the lowest sequence identity with bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 at only around 75 20 zhou p et al demonstrated that the novel virus has 962 similarity to a bat sars-related coronavirus sarsr-cov ratg13 mn9965321 21 zhang t et al showed that pangolin cov genes shower higher amino acid sequence identity to sars-cov-2 than to ratg13 genes which included orf1b spike protein975 nucleotide identity orf7a and orf10 the s1 protein which contains the rbd is phylogenetically closer to pangolin-cov than ratg13 and this rbd region within the s1 was found to be conserved between pangolin cov and sars-cov2 the cov spike s protein consisting of 2 subunits s1 and s2 mediates infection of receptor-expressing host cells and the similarity between s1 protein of pangolin cov to sars-cov2 points potential similarity in their pathogenic properties 22 though the origin of the sars-cov 2 is still a debatable topic but the recognition of the intermediate animal host is the crucial step in preventing further dissemination future outbreaks and blocking the interspecies transmissionoutbreak of fatal respiratory illnesses in wuhan china lead to speculations that sars-cov2 could be laboratory manipulated virus however a study published in nature medicine on 17 mar 20 by andersen et al concluded that the sars-cov2 is not a laboratory constructed or manipulated virus based on the rbd on the sars-cov2 3 sars-cov-2 has rbd that has high affinity to ace2 from humans ferrets cats and other species with high receptor homology 21 the receptor binding domain in sars-cov2 is different from that of sars-cov and the binding of sars-cov2 is not optimal based on computational analysis leading to the understanding that there is another mechanism of binding which has arisen out of natural selection of the virus in the human or human like ace2 3 the other salient finding of that study noted is the presence of a polybasic cleavage site at the junction of s1 and s2 though the role of this is not well established may allow better cell to cell fusion without affecting viral entry 32324we performed phylogenetic analysis of circulating coronaviruses strains using maximum likelihood method in mega software see fig 1 the near full length sequences of currently circulating strains were randomly selected and downloaded from genebank recently isolated sars-cov2 from india were also included in the study all sequences showed 9998-100 similarity in the nucleotide sequences establishing a relationship between the currently circulating viruses and implying a recent shift to human fig 2
xialu tang et have carried out extensive study on the circulating sars-cov2 strains and divided the virus into two major types of sars-cov 2 defined by two single nucleotide polymorphisms that show complete linkage the author found that snps at location 8782 and 28144 showed significant linkage 25the author analysed 103 sars-cov-2 virus strains and found that 101 showed complete linkage between the two snps 72 strains exhibited a ct haplotype defined as l type because t28144 is in the codon of leucine and 29 strains exhibited a tc haplotype defined as s type because c28144 is in the codon of serine at these two sites thus the author proceeded to characterise and categorize the sars-cov-2 viruses into two major types with l being the major type 70 and s being the minor type 30 multiple sequence alignment in mega 7 of amino acid sequences of orf 8 protein gene of 26 circulating strains from various locations around the globe to look for the frequency of the ct haplotype against the tc haplotype at position 84 was carried out our findings show that 11 out of 26 randomly selected strains showed serine and 15 showed leucine at position 84 of orf 85769 fig 3
although both sars cov2 and prior sars-cov utilize ace2 receptors to invade respiratory epithelium the magnitude of infections caused by sars-cov2 is enormous we are still unable to pinpoint the original reservoir for sars cov2 sars-cov genome was found to be 998 similar to that from civet cats the similarity of whole genome sequence of sars cov2 to pangolins is only 92 and 962 similarity to a bat sars-related coronavirus sarsr-cov ratg13 which is insufficient to prove beyond doubt that these are the source of the virus sars was a relatively rare disease and at the end of the epidemic more than 8000 cases had occurred from 01nov 2002 to 31 jul 2003 whereas the ongoing covid 19 caused by sars- cov2 has already caused more than 2000000 cases across the globe in a span of approximately five months 2627 though the mode of spread of both the viruses is almost same sars cov2 is far more infectious than sars-cov and the reason for the same is yet to be establishedthe world today is facing a crisis due to the pandemic caused by sar-cov2 based on the available literature and ongoing research it is interesting to see that the more virulent forms sars-covmers-cov and sars-cov2 get adapted to humans at some point in time of their evolution and this moment is crucial to the transmission of these viruses to humans the sars-cov 2 appears to have originated in bats and the intermediate host could be pangolins however it is difficult at this point in time to confidently determine the zoonotic source once they enter the human population it is only a matter of time after which the morbidity and mortality caused by these viruses reach pandemic levels the whole genome sequence analysis of currently circulating human strains of sars-cov2 available show 9998 similarity suggesting a recent introduction of the virus into humanshowever within these two types of sars-cov-2 l type 70 and s type 30 have been observed by tang et al the strains in l type is derived from s type the l type as per the authors conclusion appears to be more virulent and contagious 25 the human-animal interphase created by either encroachment of natural habitat of wild animals maintaining domestic animals which get infected or consumption of animals which may be harbouring the viruses is the tipping point as per a large number of studies it is important to understand viral dynamics so that future outbreaks can be avoided by active surveillance for these viruses regulations also need to be formulated to restrict the domestication as well as consumption of wild animalssince the identification of the first coronavirus  infectious bronchitis virus ibv isolated from birds 1  many coronaviruses have been discovered from such animals as bats camels cats dogs pigs and whales 2 they may cause respiratory enteric hepatic or neurologic diseases with different levels of severity in a variety of hosts including humans coronaviruses have positive-sense single-stranded rnas their genomic size are 26 to 32 kilobases the largest for an rna virus and the viruses themselves appear crown-shaped under electron microscopy coronaviruses belong to the subfamily coronavirinae in the family coronaviridae in the order nidovirales coronavirinae is further divided into four genera alpha- beta- gamma- and deltacoronavirus based on their phylogenetic relationships and genomic structures 3coronaviruses occasionally jump across host barriers often with lethal consequences the alpha- and betacoronaviruses only infect mammals and usually cause respiratory illness in humans and gastroenteritis in animals gamma- and deltacoronaviruses mainly infect birds and no human infection has been reported six coronaviruses known to infect humans are 229e nl63 genus alpha- oc43 hku1 sars-cov and mers-cov beta- whereas only sars- and mers-cov have caused large worldwide outbreaks with fatality others usually cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses a novel coronavirus was identified in a pneumonia patient in wuhan on january 9 of this year represents the seventh human-infecting coronavirusessevere acute respiratory syndrome sars induced by sars-cov first emerged in guangdong province china in 2002 4 and quickly spread around the world with more than 8000 people infected and nearly 800 died the mers-cov is a new member of betacoronavirus and caused the first confirmed case of middle east respiratory syndrome mers in saudi arabia in 2012 over 2000 mers-related infections have been reported as of 2019 with a 34 fatality rate httpswwwwhointbats are notorious for carrying many emerging or re-emerging viruses epidemiological investigations have shown that almost all sars patients have a history of animal exposure prior to the disease sars-cov and anti-sars-cov antibodies were first found in the masked palm civet paguma larvata 5 however coronaviruses related to human sars-cov were found in horseshoe bats genus rhinolophus in 2005 pointing to a bat origin of sars-cov 6 this virus was named as sars-related coronavirus sarsr-cov later scientists reported two bat sarsr-covs could bind to both human and civet ace2 receptors suggesting that the chinese horseshoe bats could serve as the natural reservoir of sars-covs 7 additionally a five-year surveillance found highly diverse sarsr-covs in bats in one cave of yunnan province china and these viral strains in this location contain all genetic building blocks needed to form a human sars-cov 8 further supporting a direct bat origin for human sars-covsviruses isolated from mers patients were found to have close contact with dromedary camels suggesting the animal origin 9 phylogenetic analysis indicated humans and camels were infected with the same source of mers-cov within a short time period 3 more than 10 bat species have been found to harbor mers-related coronaviruses mersr-covs but structural divergence in viral proteins such as spike proteins exists between bat mersr-covs and humancamel mers-covs 10 with mersr-covs at the base of phylogenetic tree suggesting mers-covs likely to originate from batsit is worthy of notice that in 2016 swine acute diarrhea syndrome was found in guangdong province china with a mortality up to 90 for piglets the causative pathogen was identified as a new coronavirus called swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus sads-cov shared 95 genomic identity with bat alphacoronavirus hku2 11 suggesting a bat spillover into pigson december 31 2019 a cluster of pneumonia cases was reported in the city of wuhan in hubei province china laboratory tests identified a new coronavirus excluding the possibility of a variety of pathogens including sars-cov mers-cov influenza virus avian influenza virus adenovirus and other common respiratory pathogens as of february 11 2020 a total of 43103 confirmed novel coronavirus term hereafter as 2019-ncov cases have been reported globally with 42708 from china and 1017 deaths httpswwwwhointseveral genome sequences of the 2019-ncov have been released in the httpvirologicalorg and global initiative on sharing all influenza data gisaid database httpswwwgisaidorg by the chinese center for disease control and prevention and others early published studies showed that the 2019-ncov had 962 similarity to a bat betacoronavirus 1217 thus classified such virus in subgenus sarbecovirus of the betacoronavirus it has been proved that the new virus uses the same cell entry receptor  ace2 as sars-cov although it only had 795 genome sequence similarity to sars-cov 1417 by jan 2 2020 66 patients were found to have visited the huanan seafood market in wuhan 18a simplified phylogeny is shown in fig 1 to illustrate the position of 2019-ncov in the genus betacoronavirus based on the published genetic background and phylogenetics for purposes of clarity 1217 the 2019-ncov has the most recent common ancestor with the neighboring bat coronaviruses supporting the bat origin the root of the coronavirus phylogeny was made up with other bat coronaviruses 13 which is not surprising because bats are the natural reservoir for most viruses from alpha- and betacoronavirus 319 however the possibility remains that unidentified intermediate hosts are responsible for direct transmission of the virus to humans furthermore there is clearly a genetic gap between the novel virus and the nearest bat viruses fig 1 ie 38 genomic difference suggesting a missing link ie other hosts may exist given the history of sars and merssimilar to sars-cov at the early stage 20 the 2019-ncovs in wuhan have shown mild infectivity with person-to-person transmission reported 16 17 nonsynonymous changes an early sequence id epiisl403931 sampling collection date december 30 2019 as reference were observed in open reading frame 1ab orf1ab 9 substitutions spike s 3 substitutions open reading frame 7a orf7a 1 substitution and open reading frame 8 orf8 4 substitutions by comparing the early released 28 viral genomes httpsbigdbigaccnncovgenome most of changes in orf8 and s appeared in the last half of january 2020 while orf1ab and orf7a were from the first half same nonsynonymous changes were found in the s and orf8 of a familial cluster case reported from guangdong ie l84s leu replaced by ser at amino acid position 84 in three members and h49y his by tyr in two indicating viral evolution may have occurred however due to the limited sequence release and no functional changes given at present adaptive evolution cannot be confirmed with these changes thus close monitoring of the viruss mutation evolution and adaptation is neededrecombination of viruses occurs when two different parent viruses co-infect the same host cell and interact during replication generating descendant viruses that have genes from both parental viruses recombination has often been associated with the expansion of the host range increases in virulence the evasion of host immune system and the evolution of resistance to antiviral treatments 21 both point mutations and recombination promote host shift for coronaviruses for instance there were frequent recombination events among bat sarsr-covs by which progenitor of sars-cov could originate from 322as expected recombination events were also involved in the emergence and evolution of mers-cov 2324 due to the lack of genome sequences of 2019-ncovs recombination has not been reported so far but merits further investigationgiven the high prevalence of diverse sarsr-covs and mersr-covs carried by different animals and frequent contact histories revealed by people infected with the animal viruses as proposed in a widely accepted hypothesis fig 2 on the generation and cross-species transmission of the pathogenic coronaviruses 3 one would infer the generation of 2019-ncovs may have similar mechanism during the long time of co-existence of viruses and their hosts host restriction was the dominant natural force keeping viruses circulating within the populations of the same species however occasionally viruses recombine with each other in different hosts to generate new recombinants with some of them having the potential to survive in new hosts such as humans via contacts recombination also occurs during circulation of different but similar viruses in human populations also a natural process for viruses to increase genetic diversityfrequent human-animal contact is the major cause for viral cross-species transmission next-generation sequencing is a highly efficient method for rapid identification of microorganisms and for surveillance of pathogens for infectious diseases 25 animal models and other laboratory tests would be needed to pinpoint the causative agents the novel coronaviruses in wuhan likely had a bat origin but how the human-infecting viruses evolved from bats requires further study the human-infecting virus may become more infectious but less virulent as it continues to co-evolve and adapt to human hosts since wuhan is one of the largest inland transportation hubs in china and the city has been closed off it is urgently necessary to step up molecular surveillance and restrict the movement of people in and out of the affected areas promptly in addition to closing the seafood markets to prevent human-to-human transmission events close monitoring of at-risk humans including medical professionals in contact with infected patients should also be enforced finally virome projects 26 should be encouraged to help identify animal viral threats before viral spillover or becoming pandemicscoronaviridae is a family of viruses with a positive-sense rna that possess an outer viral coat when looked at with the help of an electron microscope there appears to be a unique corona around it this family of viruses mainly cause respiratory diseases in humans in the forms of common cold or pneumonia as well as respiratory infections these viruses can infect animals as well 1 2 up until the year 2003 coronavirus cov had attracted limited interest from researchers however after the sars severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak caused by the sars-cov the coronavirus was looked at with renewed interest 3 4 this also happened to be the first epidemic of the 21st century originating in the guangdong province of china almost 10 years later there was a mers middle east respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2012 which was caused by the mers-cov 5 6 both sars and mers have a zoonotic origin and originated from bats a unique feature of these viruses is the ability to mutate rapidly and adapt to a new host the zoonotic origin of these viruses allows them to jump from host to host coronaviruses are known to use the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ace-2 receptor or the dipeptidyl peptidase iv dpp-4 protein to gain entry into cells for replication 710in december 2019 almost seven years after the mers 2012 outbreak a novel coronavirus 2019-ncov surfaced in wuhan in the hubei region of china the outbreak rapidly grew and spread to neighboring countries however rapid communication of information and the increasing scale of events led to quick quarantine and screening of travelers thus containing the spread of the infection the major part of the infection was restricted to china and a second cluster was found on a cruise ship called the diamond princess docked in japan 11 12the new virus was identified to be a novel coronavirus and was thus initially named 2019-ncov later it was renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 13 and the disease it causes is now referred to as coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 by the who the virus was suspected to have begun its spread in the huanan seafood wholesale market in the wuhan region it is possible that an animal that was carrying the virus was brought into or sold in the market causing the spread of the virus in the crowded marketplace one of the first claims made was in an article published in the journal of medical virology 14 which identified snakes as the possible host a second possibility was that pangolins could be the wild host of sars-cov-2 15 though the most likely possibility is that the virus originated from bats 13 1619 increasing evidence and experts are now collectively concluding the virus had a natural origin in bats as with previous such respiratory viruses 2 2024similarly sars and mers were also suspected to originate from bats in the case of mers the dromedary camel is an intermediate host 5 10 bats have been known to harbor coronaviruses for quite some time now just as in the case of avian flu sars mers and possibly even hiv with increasing selection and ecological pressure due to human activities the virus made the jump from animal to man humans have been encroaching increasingly into forests and this is true over much of china as in africa combined with additional ecological pressure due to climate change such zoonotic spillovers are now more common than ever it is likely that the next disease x will also have such an origin 25 we have learned the importance of identification of the source organism due to the ebola virus pandemic viruses are unstable organisms genetically constantly mutating by genetic shift or drift it is not possible to predict when a cross-species jump may occur and when a seemingly harmless variant form of the virus may turn into a deadly strain such an incident occurred in reston usa with the reston virus 26 an alarming reminder of this possibility the identification of the original host helps us to contain future spreads as well as to learn about the mechanism of transmission of viruses until the virus is isolated from a wild animal host in this case mostly bats the zoonotic origin will remain hypothetical though likely it should further be noted that the virus has acquired several mutations as noted by a group in china indicating that there are more than two strains of the virus which may have had an impact on its pathogenicity however this claim remains unproven and many experts have argued otherwise data proving this are not yet available 27 a similar finding was reported from italy and india independently where they found two strains 28 29 these findings need to be further cross-verified by similar analyses globally if true this finding could effectively explain why some nations are more affected than otherswhen the spread of covid-19 began figure 1 the virus appeared to be contained within china and the cruise ship diamond princess which formed the major clusters of the virus however as of april 2020 over 210 countries and territories are affected by the virus with europe the usa and iran forming the new cluster of the virus the usa figure 2 has the highest number of confirmed covid-19 cases whereas india and china despite being among the most population-dense countries in the world have managed to constrain the infection rate by the implementation of a complete lockdown with arrangements in place to manage the confirmed cases similarly the uk has also managed to maintain a low curve of the graph by implementing similar measures though it was not strictly enforced reports have indicated that the presence of different strains or strands of the virus may have had an effect on the management of the infection rate of the virus 2729 the disease is spread by droplet transmission as of april 2020 the total number of infected individuals stands at around 3 million with 200000 deaths and more than 1 million recoveries globally 30 34 the virus thus has a fatality rate of around 2 and an r0 of 3 based on current data however a more recent report from the cdc atlanta usa claims that the r0 could be as high as 57 35 it has also been observed from data available from china and india that individuals likely to be infected by the virus from both these countries belong to the age groups of 2050 years 36 37 in both of these countries the working class mostly belongs to this age group making exposure more likely germany and singapore are great examples of countries with a high number of cases but low fatalities as compared to their immediate neighbors singapore is one of the few countries that had developed a detailed plan of action after the previous sars outbreak to deal with a similar situation in the future and this worked in their favor during this outbreak both countries took swift action after the outbreak began with singapore banning chinese travelers and implementing screening and quarantine measures at a time when the who recommended none they ordered the elderly and the vulnerable to strictly stay at home and they ensured that lifesaving equipment and large-scale testing facilities were available immediately 38 39 germany took similar measures by ramping up testing capacity quite early and by ensuring that all individuals had equal opportunity to get tested this meant that young old and at-risk people all got tested thus ensuring positive results early during disease progression and that most cases were mild like in singapore thus maintaining a lower death percentage 40 it allowed infected individuals to be identified and quarantined before they even had symptoms testing was carried out at multiple labs reducing the load and providing massive scale something which countries such as the usa did quite late and india restricted to select government and private labs the german government also banned large gatherings and advocated social distancing to further reduce the spread though unlike india and the usa this was done quite late south korea is another example of how a nation has managed to contain the spread and transmission of the infection south korea and the usa both reported their first covid-19 cases on the same day however the us administration downplayed the risks of the disease unlike south korean officials who constantly informed their citizens about the developments of the disease using the media and a centralized messaging system they also employed the trace test and treat protocol to identify and isolate patients fast whereas the usa restricted this to patients with severe infection and only later broadened this criterion like many european countries as well as india unlike the usa south korea also has universal healthcare ensuring free diagnostic testingthe main mode of transmission of 2019-ncov is human to human as of now animal-to-human transfer has not yet been confirmed asymptomatic carriers of the virus are at major risk of being superinfectors with this disease as all those infected may not develop the disease 41 this is a concern that has been raised by nations globally with the indian government raising concerns on how to identify and contain asymptomatic carriers who could account for 80 of those infected 42 since current resources are directed towards understanding the hospitalized individuals showing symptoms there is still a vast amount of information about asymptomatic individuals that has yet to be studied for example some questions that need to be answered include do asymptomatic individuals develop the disease at any point in time at all do they eventually develop antibodies how long do they shed the virus for can any tissue of these individuals store the virus in a dormant state asymptomatic transmission is a gray area that encompasses major unknowns in covid-19the main route of human-to-human transmission is by droplets which are generated during coughing talking or sneezing and are then inhaled by a healthy individual they can also be indirectly transmitted to a person when they land on surfaces that are touched by a healthy individual who may then touch their nose mouth or eyes allowing the virus entry into the body fomites are also a common issue in such diseases 43aerosol-based transmission of the virus has not yet been confirmed 43 stool-based transmission via the fecal-oral route may also be possible since the sars-cov-2 has been found in patient feces 44 45 some patients with covid-19 tend to develop diarrhea which can become a major route of transmission if proper sanitation and personal hygiene needs are not met there is no evidence currently available to suggest intrauterine vertical transmission of the disease in pregnant women 46more investigation is necessary of whether climate has played any role in the containment of the infection in countries such as india singapore china and israel as these are significantly warmer countries as compared with the uk the usa and canada figure 2 ideally a warm climate should prevent the virus from surviving for longer periods of time on surfaces reducing transmissibilityon gaining entry via any of the mucus membranes the single-stranded rna-based virus enters the host cell using type 2 transmembrane serine protease tmprss2 and ace2 receptor protein leading to fusion and endocytosis with the host cell 4749 the uncoated rna is then translated and viral proteins are synthesized with the help of rna-dependant rna polymerase new rna is produced for the new virions the cell then undergoes lysis releasing a load of new virions into the patients body the resultant infection causes a massive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that causes a cytokine stormthe clinical presentation of the disease resembles beta coronavirus infections the virus has an incubation time of 214 days which is the reason why most patients suspected to have the illness or contact with an individual having the illness remain in quarantine for the said amount of time infection with sars-cov-2 causes severe pneumonia intermittent fever and cough 50 51 symptoms of rhinorrhoea pharyngitis and sneezing have been less commonly seen patients often develop acute respiratory distress syndrome within 2 days of hospital admission requiring ventilatory support it has been observed that during this phase the mortality tends to be high chest ct will show indicators of pneumonia and ground-glass opacity a feature that has helped to improve the preliminary diagnosis 51 the primary method of diagnosis for sars-cov-2 is with the help of pcr for the pcr testing the us cdc recommends testing for the n gene whereas the chinese cdc recommends the use of orf lab and n gene of the viral genome for testing some also rely on the radiological findings for preliminary screening 52 additionally immunodiagnostic tests based on the presence of antibodies can also play a role in testing while the who recommends the use of these tests for research use many countries have pre-emptively deployed the use of these tests in the hope of ramping up the rate and speed of testing 5254 later they noticed variations among the results causing them to stop the use of such kits there was also debate among the experts about the sensitivity and specificity of the tests for immunological tests it is beneficial to test for antibodies against the virus produced by the body rather than to test for the presence of the viral proteins since the antibodies can be present in larger titers for a longer span of time however the cross-reactivity of these tests with other coronavirus antibodies is something that needs verification biochemical parameters such as d-dimer c-reactive protein and variations in neutrophil and lymphocyte counts are some other parameters that can be used to make a preliminary diagnosis however these parameters vary in a number of diseases and thus cannot be relied upon conclusively 51 patients with pre-existing diseases such as asthma or similar lung disorder are at higher risk requiring life support as are those with other diseases such as diabetes hypertension or obesity those above the age of 60 have displayed the highest mortality rate in china a finding that is mirrored in other nations as well figure 3 55 if we cross-verify these findings with the population share that is above the age of 70 we find that italy the united kingdom canada and the usa have one of the highest elderly populations as compared to countries such as india and china figure 4 and this also reflects the case fatality rates accordingly figure 5 33 this is a clear indicator that aside from comorbidities age is also an independent risk factor for death in those infected by covid-19 also in the us it was seen that the rates of african american deaths were higher this is probably due to the fact that the prevalence of hypertension and obesity in this community is higher than in caucasians 56 57 in late april 2020 there are also claims in the us media that young patients in the us with covid-19 may be at increased risk of stroke however this is yet to be proven we know that coagulopathy is a feature of covid-19 and thus stroke is likely in this condition 58 59 the main cause of death in covid-19 patients was acute respiratory distress due to the inflammation in the linings of the lungs caused by the cytokine storm which is seen in all non-survival cases and in respiratory failure the resultant inflammation in the lungs served as an entry point of further infection associated with coagulopathy end-organ failure septic shock and secondary infections leading to death 6063the use of chloroquine for the treatment of corona virus-based infection has shown some benefit in the prevention of viral replication in the cases of sars and mers however it was not validated on a large scale in the form of a randomized control trial 50 6668 the drugs of choice among antimalarials are chloroquine cq and hydroxychloroquine hcq the use of cq for covid-19 was brought to light by the chinese especially by the publication of a letter to the editor of bioscience trends by gao et al 69 the letter claimed that several studies found cq to be effective against covid-19 however the letter did not provide many details immediately over a short span of time interest in these two agents grew globally early in vitro data have revealed that chloroquine can inhibit the viral replication 70 71hcq and cq work by raising the ph of the lysosome the cellular organelle that is responsible for phagocytic degradation its function is to combine with cell contents that have been phagocytosed and break them down eventually in some immune cells as a downstream process to display some of the broken proteins as antigens thus further enhancing the immune recruitment against an antigenpathogen the drug was to be administered alone or with azithromycin the use of azithromycin may be advocated by the fact that it has been seen previously to have some immunomodulatory role in airway-related disease it appears to reduce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in respiratory illnesses 72 however hcq and azithromycin are known to have a major drug interaction when co-administered which increases the risk of qt interval prolongation 73 quinine-based drugs are known to have adverse effects such as qt prolongation retinal damage hypoglycemia and hemolysis of blood in patients with g-6-pd deficiency 66 several preprints including a metanalysis now indicate that hcq may have no benefit for severe or critically ill patients who have covid-19 where the outcome is need for ventilation or death 74 75 as of april 21 2020 after having pre-emptively recommended their use for sars-cov-2 infection the us now advocates against the use of these two drugs based on the new data that has become availablethe antiviral agents are mainly those used in the case of hivaids these being lopinavir and ritonavir other agents such as nucleoside analogs like favipiravir ribavirin remdesivir and galidesivir have been tested for possible activity in the prevention of viral rna synthesis 76 among these drugs lopinavir ritonavir and remdesivir are listed in the solidarity trial by the whoremdesivir is a nucleotide analog for adenosine that gets incorporated into the viral rna hindering its replication and causing chain termination this agent was originally developed for ebola virus disease 77 a study was conducted with rhesus macaques infected with sars-cov-2 78 in that study after 12 h of infection the monkeys were treated with either remdesivir or vehicle the drug showed good distribution in the lungs and the animals treated with the drug showed a better clinical score than the vehicle group the radiological findings of the study also indicated that the animals treated with remdesivir have less lung damage there was a reduction in viral replication but not in virus shedding furthermore there were no mutations found in the rna polymerase sequences a randomized clinical control study that became available in late april 2020 79 having 158 on the remdesivir arm and 79 on the placebo arm found that remdesivir reduced the time to recovery in the remdesivir-treated arm to 11 days while the placebo-arm recovery time was 15 days though this was not found to be statistically significant the agent provided a basis for further studies the 28-days mortality was found to be similar for both groups this has now provided us with a basis on which to develop future molecules the study has been supported by the national institute of health usa the authors of the study advocated for more clinical trials with remdesivir with a larger population such larger studies are already in progress and their results are awaited remdesivir is currently one of the drugs that hold most promise against covid-19an early trial in china with lopinavir and ritonavir showed no benefit compared with standard clinical care 80 more studies with this drug are currently underway including one in india 81 82another possible option would be the use of serum from convalescent individuals as this is known to contain antibodies that can neutralize the virus and aid in its elimination this has been tried previously for other coronavirus infections 83 early emerging case reports in this aspect look promising compared to other therapies that have been tried 8487 a report from china indicates that five patients treated with plasma recovered and were eventually weaned off ventilators 84 they exhibited reductions in fever and viral load and improved oxygenation the virus was not detected in the patients after 12 days of plasma transfusion the us fda has provided detailed recommendations for investigational covid-19 convalescent plasma use 88 one of the benefits of this approach is that it can also be used for post-exposure prophylaxis this approach is now beginning to be increasingly adopted in other countries with over 95 trials registered on clinicaltrialsgov alone of which at least 75 are interventional 89 the use of convalescent patient plasma though mostly for research purposes appears to be the best and so far the only successful option for treatment availablefrom a future perspective the use of monoclonal antibodies for the inhibition of the attachment of the virus to the ace-2 receptor may be the best bet aside from this ace-2-like molecules could also be utilized to attach and inactivate the viral proteins since inhibition of the ace-2 receptor would not be advisable due to its negative repercussions physiologically in the absence of drug regimens and a vaccine the treatment is symptomatic and involves the use of non-invasive ventilation or intubation where necessary for respiratory failure patients patients that may go into septic shock should be managed as per existing guidelines with hemodynamic support as well as antibiotics where necessarythe who has recommended that simple personal hygiene practices can be sufficient for the prevention of spread and containment of the disease 90 practices such as frequent washing of soiled hands or the use of sanitizer for unsoiled hands help reduce transmission covering of mouth while sneezing and coughing and disinfection of surfaces that are frequently touched such as tabletops doorknobs and switches with 70 isopropyl alcohol or other disinfectants are broadly recommended it is recommended that all individuals afflicted by the disease as well as those caring for the infected wear a mask to avoid transmission healthcare works are advised to wear a complete set of personal protective equipment as per who-provided guidelines fumigation of dormitories quarantine rooms and washing of clothes and other fomites with detergent and warm water can help get rid of the virus parcels and goods are not known to transmit the virus as per information provided by the who since the virus is not able to survive sufficiently in an open exposed environment quarantine of infected individuals and those who have come into contact with an infected individual is necessary to further prevent transmission of the virus 91 quarantine is an age-old archaic practice that continues to hold relevance even today for disease containment with the quarantine being implemented on such a large scale in some countries taking the form of a national lockdown the question arises of its impact on the mental health of all individuals this topic needs to be addressed especially in countries such as india and china where it is still a matter of partial taboo to talk about it openly within the societyin india the ministry of ayurveda yoga and naturopathy unani siddha and homeopathy ayush which deals with the alternative forms of medicine issued a press release that the homeopathic drug arsenicum album 30 can be taken on an empty stomach for 3 days to provide protection against the infection 92 it also provided a list of herbal drugs in the same press release as per ayurvedic and unani systems of medicine that can boost the immune system to deal with the virus however there is currently no evidence to support the use of these systems of medicine against covid-19 and they need to be testedthe prevention of the disease with the use of a vaccine would provide a more viable solution there are no vaccines available for any of the coronaviruses which includes sars and mers the development of a vaccine however is in progress at a rapid pace though it could take about a year or two as of april 2020 no vaccine has completed the development and testing process a popular approach has been with the use of mrna-based vaccine 9396 mrna vaccines have the advantage over conventional vaccines in terms of production since they can be manufactured easily and do not have to be cultured as a virus would need to be alternative conventional approaches to making a vaccine against sars-cov-2 would include the use of live attenuated virus as well as using the isolated spike proteins of the virus both of these approaches are in progress for vaccine development 97 governments across the world have poured in resources and made changes in their legislation to ensure rapid development testing and deployment of a vaccinethe lack of government transparency and poor reporting by the media have hampered the measures that could have been taken by healthcare systems globally to deal with the covid-19 threat the cdc as well as the us administration downplayed the threat and thus failed to stock up on essential supplies ventilators and test kits an early warning system if implemented would have caused borders to be shut and early lockdowns the who also delayed its response in sounding the alarm regarding the severity of the outbreak to allow nations globally to prepare for a pandemic singapore is a prime example where despite the who not raising concerns and banning travel to and from china a country banned travelers and took early measures thus managing the outbreak quite well south korea is another example of how things may have played out had those measures by agencies been taken with transparency increased transparency would have allowed the healthcare sector to better prepare and reduced the load of patients they had to deal with helping flatten the curve the increased patient load and confusion among citizens arising from not following these practices has proved to be a barrier to providing effective treatments to patients with the disease elsewhere in the worlddespite the previous sars outbreak teaching us important lessons and providing us with data on a potential outbreak many nations did not take the important measures needed for a future outbreak there was no allocation of sufficient funds for such an event many countries experienced severe lack of ppe and the lockdown precautions hampered the logistics of supply and manufacturing of such essential equipment singapore and south korea had protocols in place and were able to implement them at a moments notice the spurt of cases that korea experienced was managed well providing evidence to this effect the lack of preparedness and lack of protocol in other nations has resulted in confusion as to how the treatment may be administered safely to the large volume of patients while dealing with diagnostics both of these factors have limited the accessibility to healthcare services due to sheer volumeduring the sars epidemic china faced an economic setback and experts were unsure if any recovery would be made however the global and domestic situation was then in chinas favor as it had a lower debt allowing it to make a speedy recovery this is not the case now global experts have a pessimistic outlook on the outcome of this outbreak 98 the fear of covid-19 disease lack of proper understanding of the dangers of the virus and the misinformation spread on the social media 99 have caused a breakdown of the economic flow globally 100 an example of this is indonesia where a great amount of fear was expressed in responses to a survey when the nation was still free of covid-19 101 the pandemic has resulted in over 26 billion people being put under lockdown this lockdown and the cancellation of the lunar year celebration has affected business at the local level hundreds of flights have been canceled and tourism globally has been affected japan and indonesia are estimated to lose over 244 billion dollars due to this 102 103 workers are not able to work in factories transportation in all forms is restricted and goods are not produced or moved the transport of finished products and raw materials out of china is low the economist has published us stock market details indicating that companies in the us that have chinese roots fell on average 5 points on the stock market as compared to the sp 500 index 104 companies such as starbucks have had to close over 4000 outlets due to the outbreak as a precaution tech and pharma companies are at higher risk since they rely on china for the supply of raw materials and active pharmaceutical ingredients paracetamol for one has reported a price increase of over 40 in india 104106 mass hysteria in the market has caused selling of shares of these companies causing a tumble in the indian stock market though long-term investors will not be significantly affected short-term traders will find themselves in soup politically however this has further bolstered support for world leaders in countries such as india germany and the uk who are achieving good approval ratings with citizens being satisfied with the governments approach in contrast the ratings of us president donald trump have dropped due to the manner in which the covid-19 pandemic was handled these minor impacts may be of temporary significance and the worst and direct impact will be on china itself 107109 as the looming trade war with the usa had a negative impact on the chinese and asian markets the longer production of goods continues to remain suspended the more adversely it will affect the chinese economy and the global markets dependent on it 110 if this disease is not contained more and more lockdowns by multiple nations will severely affect the economy and lead to many social complicationsthe appearance of the 2019 novel coronavirus has added and will continue to add to our understanding of viruses the pandemic has once again tested the worlds preparedness for dealing with such outbreaks it has provided an outlook on how a massive-scale biological event can cause a socio-economic disturbance through misinformation and social media in the coming months and years we can expect to gain further insights into sars-cov-2 and covid-19kn conceptualization rk aa jm and kn investigation rk and aa writingoriginal draft

infect the human population in almost all countries recently mackenzie and smith 2020 the ncov-19 was taxonomically classified as sars-cov-2 which belongs to the sarbecovirus subgenus beta-coronavirus genus chan et al 2020 owing to its phylogenetic affiliation with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov paraskevis et al 2020 these belong to the family of rna virus transmitted from

2019 based on the appearance of the phylogenomic cluster a single isolate was chosen for each cluster along with two newly sequenced indian strains accession mt0120981 mt0504931 to study the comparative proteomic analysis furthermore a statistical genomic diversity was computed for the selected speciesthe nucleotide and amino acid base pair compositional variations in mmol fraction unit were calculated in r statistical package the phylogenetic hierarchical clustering was carried out with a library called gplots and rcolourbrowsers packages for plotting the heatmap and color key representation the principal component analysis pca was performed in ggplots library to find the convergence and divergence between selected species a dot plot comparison was carried out for functional coding regions using emboss dotmatcher httpswwwebiacuktoolsseqstatsembossdotmatcherwe performed a phylogenomic and phylogeographic tree for 250 isolates of sars-cov-2 genomes along with the

separated and grouped according to country wise isolates color representation in clade and inter- and intra-specific species variation color representation in nodes as shown in fig 1
 the phylogenomic tree of our study indicates that the target wuhan-hu-1 genome was closely related to different isolates of sars-cov-2 genomes bat coronavirus ratg13 bat-sars-cov zxc21 and pangolin-cov gx-p5l were found to be an ancestor a separate phylogenomic tree of various isolates of sars-cov-2 was represented in supplementary fig s1 bat sars-like coronavirus was found to be an ancestor of newly identified covid-19 dataset used for the phylogenomic and phylogeographic tree construction and its closely related species are available in supplementary table s1 based on the constructed genomic tree we further summarized and select an isolate of phylogenetic neighbor from each cluster along with two newly sequenced indian isolates accession mt0120981 mt0504931 to identify proteomic differentiation between them based on these criteria a proteome-based phylogenetic analysis was performed it also provides support evidence to the zoonotic evolution theory that sars-cov-2 might have evolved from bat sars-like coronavirus and pangolin coronavirus as represented in fig 2a when compared with the previous study the genome of sars-cov-2 was found to be about 82 96 and 869 identical to the sars-cov bat-cov-ratg13 and bat-sars like-covzc45 respectively zhou et al 2020the genetic diversity analysis of our study revealed that wuhan-hu-1 was closely related to new isolates of two indian sars-coronavirus 2 with 100 query coverage and 9998 sequence similarity respectively the pair-wise genetic distance occurred in the range between 00 and 0001 however the sars-cov-2 genome was genetically distinct from sars-cov and has a relatively long branch length to the bat-cov ratg13 0014 bat-sars like-cov zxc21 0067 and pangolin-cov gx-p5l 0073 fig 2b a total of 9998 similarity was found across the sars-cov-2 genomes obtained from different patients lu et al 2020 genetic recombination events are complex and more likely occurring in bat-cov ratg13 and bat-sars like-cov zxc21than in sars-cov-2 jaimes et al 2020 lu et al 2020 paraskevis et al 2020 the tajimas neutrality test tajima 1989 was estimated to identify the mutations by dna polymorphism it shows that the nucleotide diversity appears in the range 0045977 with a high number of segregating sites 1123 it further confirms that the rate of gene duplication events may occur due to radical changes in the segregating sites with a high recombination rate as described by clark et al 2012 the fluctuation of amino acid frequencies was estimated using jones et al 1992 evolutionary model jones et al 1992 as represented in fig 2c comparing to other amino acids leucine 911 is a highly enriched amino acid found in this group as per the earlier investigation by matsushima et al 2019 the diverse effects of the mutations or recombinant events are occurred due to leucine-rich repeat and it leads to the origin of several human diseasesthese conversions provide keen evidence of variance in chemical composition atputpgtpctp between the species the hierarchical clustering results show that the two indian isolates sars-cov-2humanind292020 and sars-cov-2humanind1662020 are closely related to each other and it can deviate when sars-cov-2wuhan-hu-1 is compared to other ancestral species fig 3a a low abundance of amino acid was found in pangolin cov gx-p5l and bat-sars-cov zxc21 it also indicates that several compositional variances are found in amino acid bases between the selected species it was further proved by principal component analysis it shows that the two indian isolates and bat-cov ratg13 were closely related to each other while compared to wuhan-hu-1 fig 3b therefore these variations may refer that the sars-cov-2 genome has been expanded in human hosts due to the establishment of a hyper-variable genomic hotspot population wen et al 2020 as per the previous investigation magiorkinis et al 2004 and paraskevis et al 2020 stated that these may occur due to altered diverse lineages in the evolutionary rates or either by ancient recombination eventsa dot plot comparison was performed for the function coding region between wuhan-hu-1 and selected phylogenetic neighbors and ancestors fig 4
 it shows that 70 of sequences from the sars-cov-2 wuhan-hu-1 match with selected species represented in the colored block as aligned regions 1 2 and 3 interestingly a few blocks were identified in wuhan-hu-1 isolates in the position 709611500 bp stand for a white block as mismatch or gapped region a total of 4404 amino acid bases were uniquely found in the wuhan-hu-1 while comparing to our analysis approximately 30 of wuhan-hu-1 doesnt match with any isolates and it may offer new ancestry relationships within the subgenus of sarbecovirus paraskevis et al 2020we conducted a detailed genomic survey to understand molecular and functional diversity between sars-cov-2 and its phylogenomic neighbors from our analysis it is inferred that sars-cov-2 of indian origin has highly diverged from the sars-cov-2 of wuhan-hu-1 which might due to the high mutagenicity rate of covid further high mutagenicity rate was occurred due to the variations of transitiontransversion genetic ratio between the selected pairs it is speculated that this divergence in the evolution of indian origin sars-cov-2 is responsible for the lower death rate scenario in india hence the present genomic and proteomic impending of this virus will provide a lead to the researchers in turn to understand the mutation rate among indian strains and helps to unravel the mechanism behind its emergence and also in drug discoveryauthors are thankful to 1013039501100001843serb 1013039100007225ministry of science and technology

the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paperas the world continues to struggle with the unprecedented ramifications of covid19 two central questions are being asked where did this novel virus come from and how can we prevent future pandemics although there is no definitive answer as to the origins of the virus specialists in the field of immunology and microbiology have suggested that covid19 occurred naturally choudhury 2020 there is significant evidence to suggest that live animal markets or wet markets in wuhan china are the original source of transmission of the virus a major indication is that some of the first patients to test positive for covid19 had connections to the wet markets in wuhan broad 2020 p 3 additionally the causative virus known as sarscov2 is a betacoronavirus that originated in bats much like sars and mers diseases centers for disease control and prevention cdc 2020 an examination into these forms of contagion supports the hypothesis that covid19 potentially transmitted from bats to another susceptible animal such as a pangolin and then to a human choudhury 2020 transmission may have occurred at the wildlife market or while en route to the wildlife market where illicitly traded wildlife may be sold it is currently unknown as to precisely how the virus was transmitted from animals to humans but the threat of bats spreading disease has been a longheld concern for public health officials and biological researchers viruses that are transmitted from animals to humans are very dangerous to human life due to the absence of herd immunity among the population this article will explore the connections among the current pandemic liveanimal markets the spread of animalrelated diseases and the illicit wildlife trade and will include a set of policy recommendations prescribed to prevent future outbreaks stemming from these issuesto explore the connections between bats and covid19 we reviewed academic literature and scientific journals on bat ecology and conservation emerging zoonotic diseases the covid19 outbreak and wet markets in china we used websites of authoritative bodies such as the centers for disease control and prevention cdc and the world health organization who we looked at scholarship and reports addressing the illicit wildlife trade from prominent intergovernmental organizations and nongovernmental organizations such as the united nations office on drugs and crime unodc and traffic we also reviewed reporting from news media outlets such as the new york times and the wall street journalalthough it could be several years before any final conclusions are drawn on the origins of the covid19 outbreak there is still substantial evidence that it originated in bats biological and epidemiological research indicates that different species of bats may potentially carry multiple strands of the virus very similar to that of the current coronavirus the los angeles times stated scientists estimate that 3 out of 4 new or emerging infectious diseases in people come from animals su 2020at the institute of virology in china a horseshoe bat rhinolophus affinis identified as ratg13 was discovered to be carrying a form of coronavirus which shared 96 of its dna with sarscov2 ridley 2020 although this information provides compelling circumstantial evidence it does not prove that this particular species of bat contributed to or assisted in the spread of covid19 however this does not mean that another species of bat does not carry this form of coronavirus that can then be shared with humans in perspective humans share 96 of our genome with chimpanzees bat conservation trust 2020 experts are not certain as to how sarscov2 was transmitted to humans it may have been transmitted through another susceptible animal such as a pangolin the most illegally traded mammal in the world conciatore 2019past research has shown that bats are central to the dissemination of covidlike diseases among animals and humans although rodents bear the responsibility for spreading the bubonic plague during the fourteenth century bats present a unique danger as reservoirs for zoonotic viruses hosting even more bacteria and diseases than rodents luis et al 2013 p 3 therefore bats have been much studied as transmitters of viruses to humans through close contact or direct consumption humans cause harm to bats not only through consumption but also by contributing to their loss of habitat as a consequence of environmental destruction bats seek new areas to feed sometimes causing them to come into contact with livestock that will be eventually sold in open markets plowright et al 2015 pp 34 additionally habitat destruction can cause bats to shed and contract more viruses further increasing the likelihood that they will transmit disease olival 2016 p 7 bats are frequently stored and sold in wet markets and are often transported alongside large groups of uncommon and illicitly traded animals that are consumed by humans this form of transportation and storage allows the spread of pathogens between bats and different sometimes exotic and rare creatures that can carry and advance diseases under severe stressful situationsthe concern over pathogens being transferred from bats to humans is widespread not only among public health professionals but also has been much studied by academics the american society for microbiology published a report entitled identification of a novel coronavirus in bats which stated the recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndromeassociated coronavirus sarscov highlights the importance of virus surveillance in wild animals poon et al 2005 p 2001 it further explains the identification of severe acute respiratory syndromeassociated coronavirus sarscov in civet cats and other wild animals in live animal markets suggests that this novel human pathogen emerged as a result of an interspecies transmission poon et al 2005 p 2001 this report illustrates how other coronaviruslike illnesses in animals have been previously identified as potential sources of transmission to humans in fact this is not a recent discovery and concerns existed already in 2007 that there was a serious danger to human life a university of hong kong study at that time found that the presence of a large reservoir of sarscovlike viruses in horseshoe bats together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in southern china is a time bomb cheng lau woo  yuen 2007 p 638 indeed this warning was unheeded and the failure to act on this insight has contributed to the most serious global pandemic in a centurythis global health crisis originating from zoonotic transmission is not novel in fact over the last 20 years several deadly diseases are thought to have originated from live animal or wet markets wet markets are where fresh meats produce and animals are often stored to be sold in openair environments in close proximity with little to no health safety precautions or sanitation measures these wet markets exist across the world and in china they often contain foreign rare and sometimes endangered species that are sold among other goods by traveling suppliers wet markets facilitate and heavily contribute to the practice of illicit wildlife trade and in turn this practice has led to the spread of zoonotic diseases among the animals and to customers at markets transportation and storage of animals for wildlife trade at these markets enables the spread of diseases from animals to other animalsas one science writer reports live meat markets are perfect laboratories for creating new viruses stressed animals shed more viruses and are more susceptible to infections and cages are often stacked on top of each other facilitating exposure nuwer 2020 exotic meats that are traded illegally such as pangolins are less likely to be inspected for health risks and may come into contact with bats while in transit additionally because these rare animals are often from remote areas they may be more likely to carry diseases that humans have never come into contact with hemley 2020 the conditions the live animals are subjected to in wet markets create a petri dish for the spread of diseasesin china and in some other asian countries these markets are prevalent because consumers view wet markets as fresher not expensive and providing rare types of creatures that serve as status symbols or are believed to possess unique healing elements daszak olival  li 2020 p 7 yet the spread of disease from the live and exotic animals represents the biggest threatfor instance wild carnivores birds reptiles and primates that are traded in these markets carry pathogens from every taxonomic origin therefore pathogens such as newcastle disease can jump from wild to domestic birds and pathogens such as simian foamy virus and chlamydophila psittaci can be transmitted from wild animals to humans gmez  aguirre 2008 p 17 there is a welldocumented history of regional and even global pandemics originating from the transmission of diseases from animals to humans due to the practice of wet markets and illegal wildlife traffickingin april 2020 the united nations un acting head of biodiversity stated countries should move to prevent future pandemics by banning wet markets that sell live and dead animals for human consumption but cautioned against unintended consequences greenfield 2020 public health officials in the united states and around the world have pointed to wet markets and illegal wildlife trading as conduits for the transfer of disease the transference of diseases from animals to humans may transpire through the consumption proximity or mixing of animals or their byproducts typically animals are susceptible to different types of diseases once a strand is introduced into the human population it can be spread from human to human and cause an outbreak or potential public health emergency relatively recent epidemics such as ebola middle east respiratory syndrome mers bird flu severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and swine flu are all examples of diseases that have originated through the transfer of disease to humans from animals for example the highly pathogenic asian avian influenza a h5n1 virus or bird flu is highly contagious and it occurs when humans come into direct or close contact with infected or already diseased poultry cdc 2018 therefore the significant risk factors for infection include visiting or mixing animals in live poultry markets similarly while the swine flu is sporadic in humans infections are typically the result of exposure to infected pigs within live markets fairs or the pork industry cdc 2019aunfortunately due to the nature of infections there is still a lot of information left unknown about how some of these outbreaks originated in the case of ebola and based on the analyses of similar viruses scientists believe it is animalborne with bats or nonhuman primates such as apes or chimpanzees being the most likely source cdc 2019b another example would be in 2003 when sars broke out in the southern province of guangdong in china experts believe this outbreak is the result of an unknown animal reservoir some experts have suggested bats and the spread occurred through other animals such as civet cats world health organization who 2020 during its initial outbreak sars resulted in more than 8000 cases in over 25 countries similar to sars mers began as the result of a zoonotic virus in saudi arabia although different practices other than wet markets or animal reservoirs led to the outbreak of mers the method of transfer is the same animal to human who 2019 the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases dr anthony fauci insisted on a global closure of wet markets because the current crisis is a direct result of this practice guzman 2020 after the sars outbreak china attempted to institute a similar more stringent ban on wildlife trade but this has eroded over time su 2020 several conservationists and medical professionals including members of the chinese academy of sciences hoped this ban would be permanent but the markets and trade routes returned after the crisis ended who 2020 it is certain that without cooperative comprehensive and enforced policies on wildlife trade and of endangered species such as the pangolin in place there will continue to be a spread of global sickness and international loss of lifeglobal law enforcement to address the illegal trading in exotic animals for consumption or possession represents a high priority in preventing future animal to human disease transmission to address this problem countering illicit wildlife trade must be a higher priority of interpol the international police body and of regional and law enforcement bodies but this trade is highly linked to transnational crime that requires corruption to operate therefore there needs to be much more attention paid to dismantling crossnational illicit networks addressing corruption and following the money linked to this trade moreover the role of corporate actors as part of the supply chain for this illicit transit needs much more attention much illicit wildlife trade flows through freetrade zones in asia and they must be held much more responsible for the cargo that goes through their ports shelley 2018 p 193a targeted ban could be effective and have fewer unintended consequences than an outright ban focusing on the most likely vectors of zoonotic diseases could protect public health without the negative effects of a blanket ban although a ban on wild animal and wet markets would lower the number of opportunities for chinese consumers to come into contact with meat infected with infectious agents there is the chance that underground markets will pop up therefore allowing the sale of a limited category of meat in markets as the chinese government is now considering would preserve peoples access to food an overarching ban could destroy these peoples livelihoods or even lead to a black market facilitated by corruption with even greater risks samuel 2020 enforcement of regulations are essential and inspections must be carried out to ensure that meat from exotic animals is not disguised as meat from domestic animalsthere are certain aspects of this pandemic that might make a total ban on wet markets politically viable the markets in china were closed temporarily after the sars outbreak in 2003 though this ban did not last long samuel 2020 this time might be different however the sars outbreak resulted in around 800 deaths worldwide while the death toll from covid19 has caused over 432000 deaths as of june 15 2020 with the recommendations of experts and the drastic toll of covid19 shutting down the wet markets may be politically possibleeven if wildlife markets are banned outreach will be necessary to drive down demand for a black market consumption of wild animals from wet markets is influenced by chinese and asian culture which holds that wild animals and their byproducts have healing powers eating rare animals has also become a status symbol signifying that the consumer is wealthy daszak et al 2020 p 7 in addition chinese culture places a great deal of emphasis on the freshness of the food being consumed this concept of freshness extends to perceptions of food quality healthiness and taste with fresher always being better food from a grocery store is seen as less fresh than food from wet markets some chinese consumers will make trips to easily accessible wet markets every day zhong crang  zeng 2020 p 179dealing with the underground markets will require convincing people that they should not buy from underground wet markets this could be done through public health outreach campaigns that inform people of the dangers of exotic meats and markets that have live wild animals research has shown that public health outreach campaigns can work the first antismoking campaign given federal funds by the united states government showed impressive results inspiring 18 million smokers to attempt to quit and 104000 to quit for good in 2014 cdc 2016 although there are crucial differences between cigarettes and meats from animal markets in terms of addiction and their places in different cultures the concept may have applicability in convincing people not to buy food from wild animal marketsfuture research by the health medical and environmental community must be combined with research on illicit trade and corruption a transdisciplinary approach has been taken in the one health perspective but this approach has not gone outside the scientific perspective aguirre et al 2019 wilcox aguirre de padua siriaroonrat  echaubard 2019 going forward these barriers among academic disciplines must be bridged to consider all the risks to public healthaddressing and preventing pandemics requires an array of transdisciplinary research research must focus on the central causes of the spread of zoonotic diseases such as illicit wildlife trade and wet markets public health conservation biology and illicit trade scholars should collaborate on addressing the facets of supply chains corruption and trade that may contribute to zoonotic transmission there will need to be much more work with the business community to follow the supply chains linked to illicit trade in wildlife governments will need to get involved as well and take action to suppress the wildlife trade in order to prevent future outbreaksthose who are part of the illicit wildlife trade have not taken off days during this crisis lockdown policies and the changing dynamics of international travel have resulted in multiple changes to the supply chains for illicit wildlife trade trade by air has been slowed due to quarantine regulations and transportation by road has been complicated by roadblocks and checkpoints particularly at borders the trade is still happening by sea however additionally because governments have closed so many national parks poachers have taken the opportunity to go after animals that are not being as closely guarded as before the combination of transportation difficulties and unwatched national parks has led to stockpiling of products in the illicit wildlife trade without addressing these issues now the trade could come roaring back as lockdowns are lifted wildlife justice commission 2020 p 5this outbreak was caused by an array of factors including the conditions of wet markets the illicit wildlife trade and environmental destruction a multipronged approach will be necessary to make sure this never happens again on the illegal trade aspect policymakers will need to address the source of demand for these products the wet markets shutting down the wet markets or at least strictly regulating them and banning the sale of live wild animals will be necessary to address the problem of zoonotic diseases hopefully this pandemic will convince government officials that these markets need to be dealt with and convince scholars to study the intersection of illicit trade and public healthconflicts of interest none declaredsevere acute respiratory syndrome sars is a life-threatening form of
pneumonia characterized by high fever nonproductive cough chills myalgia
lymphopenia and progressing infiltrates in chest radiography neuman et al 2005 between 2002
and 2003 an epidemic emerged that facilitated by international air travel spread
within a few weeks from its origin in guangdong province china to many other
countries the who reported over 8000 sars cases and nearly 800 deaths resulting
from the infection with the sars-associated coronavirus sars cov who 2004 studies on sars cov resulted in
identification of protein targets for potential drugs which included sars cov
protease polymerase and helicase kliger et
al 2005this paper proposes a novel in silico method that predicts potent
inhibitors for sars cov protease and captures the specific features of inhibitor
molecules as opposed to ligands that hit other targets the method is based on
experimental publicly available structural information databases and presents a good
starting point for the further experimental validation it is well known that
genomic research and especially structural biology provide an ever increasing
number of potential drug targets and allow for intensive use of structural data in
various drug discovery projects in this study we use all structural homologues of
sars cov protease co-crystallized with various ligands in order to design novel
potential inhibitors for use in vhts virtual high throughput screening methods
experiments for this enzymewe extracted from the protein data bank pdb database berman et al 2000a 2000b all viral cysteine protease of the
trypsin fold based on the structural classification of proteins scop murzin et al 1995 lo conte et al 2002 andreeva et al 2004 the

1q2w 1uj1 1uk2 1uk3 1uk4 the sequence similarity search was performed on
all selected proteins from the pdb database in order to find homologous protein
structures that are not included in the recent version of the scop database the
list of ligands co-crystallized with these proteins include ag7 ace dms gol
ocs dox mpd mse and a few peptides specifically two peptides and a single
ligand chloroacetone were found to be crystallized with the original protein
target ie sars coronavirus protease 1uk4see figure 1 
all protein structures were aligned superimposed using 3d-hit software plewczynski et al 2002
2004 protein chains were divided into
single domains and all domains were structurally aligned in order to analyse the
common binding mode for various ligands figure 2 presents structures superimposed on 1uk4
together with all ligands located in their active sites from aligned structures
we extracted the 1uk4 protein active site neighbourhood with ligands
co-crystallized in it we used 1uk4 as the template for a flexible docking
experiment in order to adjust the conformation of ligands in the new structural
neighbourhood the target structure with structurally aligned ligands
co-crystallized with structurally homologous proteins is presented in
figure 3 the data were then
selected for further analysis in order to remove some inconsistencies in pdb
entries for selected ligands 

in the case of an inhibitor taken from 1uk4 structure the following interactions
were identified arg188 gln189 and gln 192 are in close contact with asn1 of
the inhibitor with the methyl group of met165 such an arrangement warrants good
orientation of the peptide inside the protein cavity nh2 of the
gln189 interacts with o of the first peptide bond of the inhibitor the oh group
of ser2 of the inhibitor interacts with the carboxylate moiety of glu166 glu166
also forms hydrogen bond with amide oxygen of gln5 his163 and leu141 interact
with the terminal side chain of the gln5 of the protein inhibitor the position
of the his163 is stabilized by parallel interaction with the phenyl ring of
phe140 see figures 4
and 5 

although a peptide can bind strongly to a protein target and
effectively block or regulate its activity it is also prone to hydrolysis of
its peptide bonds therefore over the last few years various research groups
searched for peptide bond mimics analogues substitutes or isosters in order
to obtain a molecule whose shape and electrostatic potential are very similar to
these of the parental peptide see table 1 for detailed references we generated here a set of molecules
for further virtual screening by substituting a peptide bond by its mimics
table 1 presents various
linkages capable of substituting peptide bonds almost 40 moieties have been
described in the literature and some of them can be present in various
stereoisomeric forms the substitutes for a peptide bond can be grouped into
various subcategories for example with respect to the number of atoms
separating the groups connected initially by a peptide bond one can identify
linkages with one two three and more atoms there is also a set of peptide
bond substitutes where rings are involved in binding two groups of the parental
peptide in addition there is a group of molecules where side chains of amino
acids are substituted by atoms forming ring structures that substitute both
peptide bonds and some side chains the set with one-atom linkages shorter than
the original peptide bond is composed of amine nh and
ether o bridges baker
et al 1992 the other set with three or more
atoms separating the two groups previously joined
by conh is larger there are linkages where
additional

other o conho n

are inserted in the set where rings are substituting peptide bonds one can find
azaphosphinane rings grembecka et
al 2003 cyclopropane rings martin et al 1992 pyrrole
rings smith et al 1994
and thiazole rings singh et al
2001 while in the group where ring structures substitute not only a
peptide bond but also some amino acid side chains one can find para-substituted
phenyl rings temple et al
1998 tyndall et al
2000 yin et al
2005 and thiazolopyridine rings olson
et al 1993 the largest set is the one where
two atoms are separating the two groups that had been connected by a peptide
bond it is easy here to identify a subgroup with apo group
instead of co in peptides bone et al 1991 fraser et al 1992 tsukamoto et al 1998 collinsova and jiracek 2000 demange
et al 2002 grembecka et al 2003

fluorine atom bound to a carbon atom thaisrivongs

2000first we performed the docking procedure in order to evaluate the
modification of inhibitors by replacing the peptide bond by its mimic
electronic high throughput screening ehits is an exhaustive flexible docking
method that systematically covers significant part of the conformational and
positional search space producing highly accurate docking poses at a speed
practical for virtual high throughput screening zsoldos et al 2003 the ligand docking problem is
divided here into two subproblems poseconformation search and scoring
function the customizable scoring function of ehits combines a local surface
point contact evaluation with traditional empirical and statistical approaches
the search algorithm is fast in many cases capable of finding the correct
binding pose and conformation of the ligand in the virtual screening phasethen we performed the structural similarity search in order to select potential
inhibitor molecules from a large collection of chemical compounds using the
ligandinfo database the ligandinfo system is designed for fast sensitive
virtual high throughput screening of small molecule databases von grotthuss et al 2003
the search algorithms are based on two-dimensional structure similarity for
each molecule a vector of two-dimensional indices and their occurrence counts
are calculated the index represents a unique combination of three connected
atoms each atom is described by six parameters atom symbol charge valence
type of bond and number of connected hydrogen and non-hydrogen atoms in this
study the modified tanimoto coefficient mtc was used as the similarity metric
mtc takes values between 0 and 1 where zero means that there are no identical
indices in either molecule and one means that both molecules are composed of
identical sets of indices the system developed enables a search for similar
compounds in the large approximately a million commercially available
compounds ligandinfo meta-database von
grotthuss et al 2004 the database contains various
publicly available sets of small molecules such as harvards chembank
which encompasses bioactive compounds and approved by fda drugs strausberg and schreiber 2003 chempdb
ligands marked as hetero atoms in protein data bank pdb files
berman et al 2002
boutselakis et al
2003 kegg ligand molecules that are found in the kegg pathways goto et al 2002 the open
national cancer institute database voigt
et al 2001 and a few others we evaluated to what extent one can utilize the structural information
contained in the pdb database in the real drug discovery campaign using as an
example the main protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus
using the methods described we generate potential inhibitors solely on the basis of
the set of ligands from crystallized complexes of a protein target and other
proteins from its structurally homologous family two sets of compounds were built
the first one contains ligands and short peptides dissected from
proteinligand complexes of viral cysteine proteases of the trypsin fold
these ligands and peptides were then modified in order to correct the chemical
structure the second group includes ligands built from peptides of the first set
with the peptide bond substituted by another linkage see table 1 in order to obtain a molecule that
potentially binds to the enzyme more strongly than the original peptidethese two sets were then evaluated with the ehits flexible docking algorithm the top
rank ligands are presented in table 2
for the first data set and in table 3
for the second set the best scoring compounds of the first set are original ag7
ligand ehits docking score 5615 two versions of modified ag7 with
removal of some parts of the original ligand ag7 ehits docking scores 5103
and 4803 and as the fourthfifth scoring compounds the original peptides
of the sars protease 1uk4 chains h and g after improving the initial 3d structure
ehits docking scores 4795 and 4703 the docking scores for the
second group ligands built by modification of the peptide bond are in most cases
lower than those in the case of the first group the best scoring compounds in
table 3 are modified versions of
ag7 score 5940 where the peptide
bond conh in the middle of the parental ag7 molecule
was substituted by
the po2ch2 moiety original ag7
compound score 5615 and vas5 peptide in which the two residues leu and
gln from the c termini were substituted by a thiazolopyridinone ring modified
version with score 5465 and ligand created from the original chain g
peptide from the sars cov target where the peptide bond between ser and thr was
replaced by an ether bridge 1uk4 with score 5430next each molecule presented in table 2
was used for screening the ligandinfo meta-database as a query almost all designed
potential leads did not have any close analogue in the meta-database subset
therefore only experimental confirmation of the slowing down of the activity of sars
cov protease by these ligands can confirm our findings and this confirmation will
require chemical synthesis the only good seed for similarity search ie
2-methyl-24-pentanediol mpd allosteric inhibitor was observed among all the
compounds from table 2 for the 21 most
similar with mtc060 analogues that were found using mpd as a query see
table 4 for details those
compounds might be suitable as starting leads in further experimental studies which
is beyond the scope of this paperthe structure-based drug discovery procedure was assessed with sars cov
main protease serving as an example firstly potential compounds were extracted
from the protein data bank database using sequence and structural similarity of
other proteins to the selected target protein code 1uk4 secondly we applied the
transformation of peptide bonds in order to build ligands on the basis of
co-crystallized peptides the resulting set of compounds was ranked by docking score
for the ehits flexible docking procedure in order to select the most promising
molecules the set of best performing compounds was then used for a similarity
search over the one-million-entry ligandinfo meta-database the selected molecules
belong to close analogues of the mpd allosteric inhibitor and can be used as
starting leads for further experimental researchmpd allosteric inhibitor 2-methyl-24-pentanediol is a simple molecule with two
hydroxylic groups this molecule can have several conformations with accompanying
steric effects using ligandinfo we found 21 similar molecules which were modified
by adding or removing a functional group electronegative groups or atoms and
increasing or decreasing the steric effects some of the molecules like
2-methylpentane-124-triol 1-amino-2-methyl-2-propanol
4-hydroxy-4-methylpentanenitrile 1-hydroxyoxidoamino-2-methyl-2-propanol have
hydrophilic character and the ability to interact with hydrophilic amino acids
other ligands like 24-dimethyl-2-pentanol 2-methyl-2-pentanol
25-dimethyl-2-hexanol 2-methyl-4-pentyn-2-ol 2-methyl-2-hexanol
2-methyl-2-heptanol 26-dimethyl-7-octen-2-ol contain hydrophobic chains that are
able to create hydrophobic interactions all in all these molecules may have many
flexible conformationsmodification of the peptide bond initiates new types of inhibitors such compounds
are a mimics for peptides and can potentially replace known peptide drug types for
this instance ag7 m1 modification interacts with sars cov peptidase more strongly
than the original peptide value of the score function for ag7 5615 and
5940 for ag7 m1 the modified inhibitor replacement of the peptide
bond for phosphorate ether radically changes the environment and radius of
interaction additional oxygen atoms with two free orbitals can interact at longer
distances and for this modification symmetrically in both side of the replaced
bondon march 18 2003 who initiated a virtual network of laboratories to investigate the cause of sars16 daily teleconferences updated members of the network on the progress of laboratory investigations in different parts of the world on patients with suspected sars16 this investigation established that influenza and other common respiratory pathogens were not the cause of this novel disease syndrome strategies for the detection of a novel agent included the use of direct electron microscopy on respiratory specimens bronchoalveolar lavage and lung tissue obtained from lung biopsy or necropsy culture in cell lines known to support respiratory viral infection and subsequently on other types of cells pcr and reverse-transcription pcr rt-pcr with consensus primers for respiratory viral pathogens and random-primer rt-pcr methods serology was used for the detection of agents antigenically related to known respiratory pathogens one of the problems faced in this investigation was the differentiation of sars from more routine causes of atypical pneumonia the one feature supporting the probable diagnosis of sars was epidemiological linkage to a cluster of similar disease cases substantial numbers of such cases were initially present in guangzhou at the hospital outbreaks at hanoi and at the prince of wales hospital hong kong and subsequently in toronto and singapore through global case notification a suspected case from singapore was also intercepted on a flight arriving in frankfurt germany17
members of the network reported virus-like particles in clinical respiratory specimens by electron microscopy and these virus particles had pleomorphic morphology compatible with paramyxoviruses16 17 shortly after human metapneumovirus was detected in the respiratory tract of patients with sars at the prince of wales hospital in hong kong and in toronto18 19 however human metapneumovirus was not consistently detected in other patients with sars in hong kong outside the prince of wales hospital or elsewhere globally in addition the genetic sequence of the human metapneumovirus isolated from these patients was essentially similar to that previously known to circulate in human beings as such it was difficult to explain why human metapneumovirus which was known to have been a human pathogen for many years would cause a novel and unusual disease syndrome such as sars rhinovirus and chlamydia were also detected in patients with suspected sars10 17 20
three laboratories within the who network independently reported the isolation of a novel coronavirus from clinical specimens of patients with sars14 17 20 in all three laboratories the strategies that led to the detection of this novel coronavirus were broadly similar although culture in cell lines including hep-2 mrc-5 mdck llc-mk2 hela rde nci-h292 hut-292 b95-8 and a549 that were usually used to culture respiratory viruses proved unproductive the virus was isolated in vero-e6 cells in two laboratories and frhk-4 cells in the other even before the nature of the virus was identified a link with sars was established by showing that serum samples from patients with suspected sars had increasing antibody titres to virus-infected cells by indirect immunofluorescence assay iifa the identification of the agent as a coronavirus was made using thin-section electron microscopy of virus-infected cells and negatively stained preparations of cell-culture supernatants that were virus infected figure 1
 independent confirmation of the identity of the virus was obtained by sequencing fragments of the viral genome derived through random-primed rt-pcr in two laboratories and the use of consensus primers for coronaviruses in the other laboratory in all three laboratories the region that yielded the early sequence information was the open reading frame orf 1b region of the replicase gene possibly because this is a highly conserved region of the virus dna array analysis using a microarray containing probes for various virus families21 was done on infected and uninfected cells this analysis gave positive signals for a group of eight oligonucleotides whose sequence was derived from two virus families the coronaviridae and the astroviridae20 however microarray analysis could only be done once the virus was isolated in culture and could not be done directly on the clinical specimenthe independent detection by three laboratories of a coronavirus-like agent in samples from patients with sars-like disease in hong kong vietnam singapore and germany patient from singapore led particular credence to the significance of this observation however to conclusively establish a causal role for this novel coronavirus the virus had to be consistently found in the relevant clinical specimens from patients with the disease and not in healthy controls rt-pcr methods based on the initial genetic sequence of the virus replicase gene were designed and applied to detect viral rna in patients specimens the virus isolate was also used in iifas and eias to detect serological responses in acute and convalescent serum specimens with these approaches infection with the novel coronavirus subsequently named sars-associated coronavirus was detectable in 45 of 50 consecutive patients with clinically suspected sars in hong kong all 32 patients from whom paired serum samples were available had seroconverted to positive for sars coronavirus viral rna was not detectable by rt-pcr in healthy controls serum samples from 200 healthy blood donors in hong kong even though there was an outbreak of sars at the time did not have antibody that was reactive to cells infected with sars coronavirus in iifas14 a second study found evidence of sars coronavirus by rt-pcr or virus culture in 19 patients with sars from vietnam hong kong and singapore and nine patients from whom serum samples were available had increasing antibody titres to the virus20 furthermore 384 randomly selected serum samples from us blood donors had no reactivity to the sars coronavirus by eia20 a third study found all five patients with probable sars and three of 13 patients with suspected sars who originated from singapore and vietnam to have evidence of sars coronavirus rna by rt-pcr17 taken together these results indicated that the novel coronavirus was associated with sars and given the lack of serological reactivity in human beings suggested that it was probably recently introduced to the human population because on the basis of the partial genetic information available the virus seemed to be an agent not previously known to circulate in human populations the likely origin of the virus was from an animal sourcefulfilment of kochs postulates for establishing the cause of a disease requires that the microbe should be detected at the site of the disease sars coronavirus was detected in the lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage of a patient with sars by virus culture rt-pcr and electron microscopy10 17 20 in addition virus-like particles compatible in size and morphology to coronavirus were shown in lung biopsy tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage10 20 the lung pathology of fatal sars showed bronchial epithelial denudation loss of cilia type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia and in patients who died later in the course of the disease syncytial cells were seen in the alveoli20 22 23 sars coronavirus rna was shown in the lungs by rt-pcr23 24 and in-situ hybridisation25 26 27 and viral antigen was detected in alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages by immunohistology our unpublished data no evidence of human metapneumovirus was detected in the lungs by rt-pcr by electron microscopy or by a serological response in paired serum samples22 23
the final requirement for the fulfilment of kochs postulates to establish the cause of an infectious disease is reproduction of the disease in a relevant animal model infection of cynomolgous macaques with an isolate of sars coronavirus led to disease that was pathologically similar to that seen in human patients with sars with epithelial necrosis serosanguinous alveolar exudates hyaline membranes type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia and the presence of syncytia28 29 the virus was successfully re-isolated from these lesions and an antibody response to the virus was shown in the infected animals by contrast infection of macaques with human metapneumovirus produced a mild suppurative rhinitis with minimal erosion in the infected airways28 the possibility remained that co-infection with human metapneumovirus could exacerbate the disease caused by sars coronavirus however there was no evidence of human metapneumovirus infection by rt-pcr or serological methods in patients with severe and fatal sars sars coronavirus was detected in these patients which suggested that human metapneumovirus was not necessary for development of severe or fatal sars23 in addition infection of macaques with sars coronavirus followed by human metapneumovirus did not produce enhanced disease28 thus it was concluded that sars coronavirus was both necessary and sufficient to cause the full syndrome of sars subsequently it was shown that sars coronavirus infects and replicates in cats and ferrets and can be transmitted to uninfected animals30 recently sars coronavirus has also been shown to infect and replicate in mice although without overt disease31 these experiments provide alternative animal models for the investigation of sars of these the macaque and ferret models show clinically significant diseasewithin weeks of the isolation of the novel coronavirus associated with sars the full genome of the virus was sequenced32 33 analysis of the genome of the sars coronavirus confirmed that it was completely novel across the whole of its length and was not derived by recombination between previously known animal or human coronaviruses this finding also confirmed that sars coronavirus could not have been artificially generated in the laboratory as a bioterrorist agentcoronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a single positive-stranded rna genome all coronaviruses have five major orfs that encode the replicase spike envelope membrane and nucleocapsid proteins34 35 these viruses can be subdivided into three groups on the basis of antigenic and genetic studies all previously known human coronaviruses can be classified into group 1 eg 229e and group 2 eg oc43 sars coronavirus showed some serological cross-reactivity with antisera raised to human coronavirus 229e group 120 partial initial viral sequences of the viral replicase had indicated that sars coronavirus was genetically distinct from all previously known coronaviruses14 17 20 further characterisation of the full genome confirmed this deduction and suggested that the virus is distantly related to coronaviruses from groups 2 and 332 33 36 these findings prompted the conclusion that either the sars coronavirus represents a new fourth group within the coronavirus genus32 33 or that it represented a group 2 virus that had diverged from others in the group very early in evolution37 however unlike other group 2 viruses sars coronavirus does not contain a haemagglutinin-esterase protein encoding sequence further work is required to confirm the taxonomic classification of this virusthe availability of the full genetic sequence has allowed refinement of diagnostic assays see below rational antiviral drug design and vaccine development38 39
the recent introduction of a novel coronavirus in human beings without prior serological evidence of infection in the human population prompted much speculation about the origin of this virus whereas bioengineered or even extraterrestrial agents were adduced by some to explain its origin40 the most probable explanation was that it was an animal virus that had recently acquired the ability for human-human transmission this hypothesis was strengthened by reports that early patients with sars in guangdong were exposed to live wild game animals held in markets serving the restaurant trade for freshly cooked game meat5 7 a search for the animal source of the precursor virus was prompted figure 2
 sampling of several animal species found in one of the live-game markets in guangdong revealed that some of them carried a virus genetically and antigenically related to the human sars coronavirus41 in particular a sars-like coronavirus was detected by rt-pcr in the nasal and faecal swabs of civet cats paguma larvata and a raccoon dog nyctereutes procyonoides serological evidence of infection was found in these species and also in a chinese ferret-badger melogale moschata41 genetic sequencing of the virus revealed that the animal coronavirus had more than 99 homology with human sars coronavirus figure 3
 however when compared with the animal viruses the human sars coronavirus seemed to have a 29-nucleotide deletion in orf8 figure 4
 this additional sequence predicts that the animal virus will express a putative protein of 122 aminoacids that is not seen in the human sars coronavirus interestingly a subsequent study revealed other genotypes with similar deletions in the same orf42 in that study viruses with a 82-nucleotide deletion were isolated from the early phase of the epidemic in addition viruses with a 415-nucleotide deletion resulting in the loss of the whole orf8 region were found in may 2003 ie at the late phase of the outbreak these results indicated that the expression of orf8 is dispensable for the sars coronavirus in human beings alternatively it is also tempting to speculate that deletions in orf8 might give the virus an advantage to adaptation in human beingsanimal traders working with live animals in these markets had high seroprevalence for both the human and animal sars coronavirus although they did not have a history of sars-like disease41 43 the animal precursor of sars coronavirus is thus likely to be inefficient at infecting human beings and repeated exposure to the precursor animal virus probably leads to the abortive infection or antigenic stimulation that results in this observed serological response in the animal handlers these findings taken with the history of exposure to these same live-animal markets provided by some of the early patients with sars suggests that the live-animal markets were probably the site where the inter-species transfer of the animal virus to human beings occurredit seems that once the virus is introduced into such live-animal markets with a diverse fauna of small mammals the precursor sars coronavirus efficiently establishes itself in several small mammalian species studies with avian influenza viruses in live-poultry markets has shown that such viruses amplify within the setting of a market trading in live birds44 and it is likely that the precursor sars coronavirus does likewise in markets in which there is a diversity of mammalian species with animals being removed and added to the ecosystem on a regular basis45 however the reservoir of this virus in nature remains to be conclusively identified the palm civet or the raccoon dog are current candidates equally another species could be the reservoir of the virus in the wild while the civet cats and similar species serve as the amplifier of the disease in the setting of live-animal markets further work is required to identify the natural reservoir of this virusdetailed molecular epidemiological investigations indicate that the viruses detected in human beings in the early stages of the sars outbreak in guangdong are closely related to the animal sars coronavirus41 42 46 some viruses had the additional 29-nucleotide sequence that was seen in the animal viruses the early viruses were found to be genetically more diverse and more prone to mutation than viruses isolated later in the course of the outbreak which suggests that the sars coronavirus was in the process of host adaptation and was subjected to a high selection pressure during the early phase of the outbreak42 later in the outbreak the virus had presumably become more adapted to human-human transmission and one lineage of the virus had become dominant for example in feb-march 2003 there were at least four introductions of sars coronavirus from china to hong kong46 these were genetically diverse however both classic and molecular epidemiology suggests that only one of these viruses seems to have given rise to the major outbreak in hong kong that subsequently spread globally thus most of the sars coronaviruses isolated from patients in canada vietnam and singapore are genetically closely related to the virus isolated from a single sars patient in hong kong hku-33 whereas other genetic lineages seem to be less transmissible42 46 47 48 49 50
isolation of the causal agent and determination of its partial genome sequence provided the basis for the first generation of laboratory tests for sars14 17 20 rt-pcr tests were based on the orf1b sequence of sars coronavirus replicase gene the first part of the genome to be sequenced serological tests were based on the iifa of virus-infected cells and eias were based on viral cell extracts virus isolation was not very sensitive was labour intensive and took too long to be clinically relevant although these tests used in combination proved robust and useful for the retrospective diagnosis of sars they proved less satisfactory for providing a diagnosis in the first few days after disease onset51 52
the first generation of rt-pcr assays were more sensitive at the end of the first week of illness with only 3565 of specimens testing positive in the first few days of the disease51 53 54 55 however these assays provided important insights into the pathogenesis and transmission of the disease virus was detected by rt-pcr and by culture not only in the respiratory tract but also in the faeces and urine51 replication of the virus in the gastrointestinal tract was confirmed by electron microscopic studies of biopsies of the upper and lower intestinal mucosa in patients with sars56 these findings suggested that infection with sars coronavirus was disseminated and not simply confined to the respiratory tract they also raised the possibility that the infection could be spread by the faecal route this route proved to be important in at least one major community outbreak amoy gardens in hong kong in which over 300 patients were infected within the period of a few days presumably through contaminated faeces57 quantitative rt-pcr assays on the nasopharyngeal aspirates as well as rates of positivity of first-generation rt-pcr assays at different stages of the illness showed that unlike other respiratory viral infections viral load and rates of positivity of sars coronavirus in the upper respiratory tract increased progressively to peak at around day 10 after disease onset51 53 54 55 58 these findings provided the reason why rt-pcr assays were of poor sensitivity early in the course of the disease they also predicted that virus transmission would be lower in the first few days of illness a finding supported by epidemiological observations59 whereas viral rna could be detected by rt-pcr for many weeks or even months after the onset of disease virus culture was only possible during the first 3 weeks of illness51 it is possible that even though virus replication continues after the first 3 weeks of disease the virus may be complexed with antibody and therefore no longer infective or transmissible this finding was also in agreement with epidemiological findingsapart from respiratory samples viral rna was also detected in stool blood cerebrospinal fluid and urine58 60 61 62 63 of these non-respiratory samples stool specimens had the highest proportion of positive rt-pcr results in one study 65 of 67 stool samples collected later in the illness mean 142 days were positive in conventional rt-pcr assays58 this observation agreed with the report that stool samples might be a good alternative to respiratory samples for the identification of sars patients55 however one study indicated that viral rna was not detectable in stool samples within the first 4 days of illness suggesting that stool samples might not be useful for early diagnosis of sars51
the low sensitivity of conventional rt-pcr assays in the first few days of disease the period during which laboratory diagnosis is most relevant for patient care prompted the exploration of several strategies to improve test sensitivity a quantitative real-time rt-pcr approach was used to improve sensitivity as well as turnaround time64 65 these methods had the benefit of being closed systems that reduced the chance of pcr cross-contamination within the laboratory more importantly the technology when combined with automated specimen extraction methods had the potential to become high throughput assays a significant advantage in areas with outbreaks of sars in which large numbers of specimens had to be tested in addition these assays provided quantitative viral load data which helped elucidate the pathogenesis of the disease for example these assays showed that viral load was highest in specimens of the lower respiratory tract eg bronchoalveolar lavage sputum endotracheal aspirates and was higher in nasopharyngeal aspirate than in throat swabs17 faecal samples had very high viral loads toward the end of the first week of illness and were the specimen of choice during the second week of disease66
other approaches were also used to enhance the detection rate of sars the sensitivity of detection could be increased by testing multiple serial samples collected from the same patient62 however this increased the already high workloads in clinical diagnostic laboratories real-time nested rt-pcr strategies were shown to be useful for detecting low copy numbers of sars coronavirus present in the early stage of illness67 68 the turnaround time for this method was much shorter than that for the conventional nested rt-pcr assay however nested rt-pcr increases the risk of laboratory cross-contamination leading to false-positive results69
in infected cells coronaviruses generate subgenomic mrna for the synthesis of structural viral protein by discontinuous transcription because of the genomic organisation of sars coronavirus all subgenomic mrna molecules contain the nucleocapsid gene sequence region of the sars coronavirus32 33 thus targeting the nucleocapsid gene sequence should be expected to enhance sensitivity of diagnosis this proved to be the case when applied to specimens collected from experimentally infected macaques29 however several independent studies on clinical specimens from patients with sars proved otherwise66 70 71 72 and showed that most of the viral rna in clinical specimens is of genomic origin66 however it was advisable to have rt-pcr assays that target different parts of the viral genome to serve as a confirmation of the positive result73 this strategy provides some assurance that a positive result is not due to laboratory contamination with pcr amplicongiven that the analytical sensitivity of rt-pcr assays could not be increased much further the only other option for enhancing test sensitivity was by increasing the amount of viral rna added to the rt-pcr reaction mix70 74 by extraction of rna samples from a larger volume of nasopharyngeal aspirate and by applying quantitative real-time rt-pcr technologies the sensitivity of sars-coronavirus detection improved to approximately 80 of nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens collected from day 13 of disease onset with 100 specificity75 this method was not necessarily associated with an increase in pcr inhibitors75 however this strategy implies that an inhibitor control is important to assure against a false-negative result due to pcr inhibitionin initial studies serum or plasma were not thought to be useful for molecular diagnosis of sars17 62 however subsequent studies on plasma and serum samples from sars patients showed that sars coronavirus rna was detectable in more than 50 of plasma and 78 of serum samples during the first week of illness70 in another study which used multiple serial plasma samples 79 of sars patients within the first 3 days of illness could be identified by quantitative rt-pcr76 a recent study showed that sars coronavirus rna was detectable and was claimed to replicate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a sars patient during early disease61 whether the viral rna originated from infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells or by phagocytosis or endocytosis of virus replicating the respiratory tract is still unclear nevertheless blood leucocytes may provide yet another alternative for early sars diagnosis however sars coronavirus viraemia occurs mainly within the first week of the disease77 in addition outside the period of a sars epidemic most respiratory infections are caused by other pathogens and a respiratory specimen still remains the most important clinical specimen for clinical investigationaccording to the results of first-generation rt-pcr assays patients with a positive rt-pcr result on admission had worse outcomes in terms of survival requirement for intensive care and assisted ventilation when compared with sars patients with negative rt-pcr results at admission53 this finding was presumably a surrogate for viral load early in the disease recently this hypothesis has been confirmed using quantitative rt-pcr and high viral load in the nasopharyngeal aspirate was found to be an independent predictor of mortality viral load from patients who died from the disease was recently shown to be about 45 log higher than in patients who eventually recovered from the illness78 a high viral load is also associated with the occurrence of diarrhoea78 and the requirement for intensive care70 thus quantitative pcr assays might provide critical prognostic information for clinical management in particular if the viral load is a major predictor of clinical outcome effective antiviral therapy that helps to reduce viral load is likely to provide clinical benefitserodiagnosis is currently the gold standard for confirmation of a diagnosis of sars iifa using virus-infected cells spotted onto teflon-coated microwell slides51 or eia based on extracts of virus-infected cells coated on microwell eia plates have proved reliable methods for the diagnosis of sars79 however seroconversion usually occurred in weeks 2 or 3 of illness and a few patients seroconverted as late as 28 days after disease onset58 thus serology is not an option for early diagnosis of the disease detection of igm or iga subclass-specific antibody did not allow earlier diagnosis58 80 these tests require culture of live sars coronavirus to provide the relevant antigen used in the assays and require reliable inactivation of virus infectivity before they can be used outside biohazard level 3 containment recombinant viral nucleoprotein and spike protein antigens expressed in escherichia coli and other substrates have been assessed as alternative serological test platforms79 81 82 these have the potential for providing low cost reproducible and non-hazardous serological tests in an eia format that is amenable to high throughput testing79 83 84 however it should be borne in mind that each antigen and assay format must be individually tested to assess the possibility of cross-reaction with other related human coronaviruses whereas such serological cross-reactions did not prove to be a major problem with the whole native viral antigen assays mentioned above this should not be assumed to mean that recombinant antigens are equally specific until they have been shown to be so furthermore although serological cross-reactivity proved not be a problem during the period of the sars outbreak in the post-sars era when the prior probability of sars is extremely low a positive serological result must be treated with even greater caution in addition to the two known human coronaviruses 229e and oc43 a new human coronavirus has been discovered85 the possibility of cross-reaction with other human coronaviruses although rare is real and must be taken seriously furthermore individuals vary in the antigenic epitopes to which they produce antibodies hence cross-reactivity may well be a rare event although such a result if not interpreted with care may have major implications for public health we therefore suggest that all positive serological results should be confirmed by neutralisation tests in reference laboratoriesin periods in which there are no outbreaks of sars clinical specimens for investigation of sars should be tested with particular care positive rt-pcr results should be confirmed by an independent molecular test on a different specimen rt-pcr tests for different genome targets eg replicase gene and nucleoprotein gene should be available in reference laboratories to confirm positive results and for selective use in confirming negative results on patients on whom there is a high degree of suspicion serial specimens from many sites eg respiratory faeces and serum should be tested in addition to avoid obtaining false-negative results assays with internal pcr inhibitor control should be encouraged positive results should be confirmed in an independent reference laboratory serological assays should show a significant rise in antibody titres to native viral antigens eg iifa and be confirmed by virus neutralisation human infection with an animal sars-like coronavirus which is what we are most likely to encounter may behave atypically compared with sars for example the clinical disease may be milder and the viral load may be even lower and more transient than with sars this means even greater vigilance may be required in making the diagnosis of a infection with the sars-related animal coronaviruspossible options for the re-emergence of sars includes the undetected continued transmission of the virus from the outbreak in the summer of 2003 escape of the virus from laboratories that contain live sars coronavirus or the re-emergence of the virus from an animal reservoir there is at present no evidence for the virus persisting in the human population although the virus may be detected by rt-pcr in the faeces for months after the onset of disease51 virus isolation is rarely possible after the third week of illness and there is no evidence for disease transmission by patients in late convalescence the possibility that immunocompromised patients such as those with aids may harbour the virus long term has to be considered however if epidemiologically relevant transmission from such cases occurred sars should have been manifest by now given the intense global surveillance and awareness that now exists escape of the virus from a laboratory has indeed occurred on three occasions86 and highlights the importance of biosafety who has provided strict biohazard guidelines for the handling of this virus and its secure storage87 at least one of these events involved the handling of virus that was thought to be chemically inactivated86 88 thus researchers should use appropriate and internationally accepted methods for the inactivation of live viruses89 a detailed study on sars-coronavirus inactivation has been recently reported90 to prevent any inadvertent laboratory-acquired infection leading to secondary transmission in the community as happened after the laboratory infections in beijing88 a high level of alert for febrile and respiratory illness in all laboratory workers who handle infectious sars coronavirus needs to be maintainedthe re-emergence of the virus from its animal reservoir remains possible given that the virus is detectable in the faeces and respiratory secretions of small mammals within live-animal markets in southern china re-emergence in four patients with sars in guangdong in december 2003 and january 2004 and epidemiological genetic linkage to live-game markets and viruses isolated from them prompted the wholesale cull of civet cats and other small mammals in these markets in january 200491 no further human cases of sars acquired from animals have since been detected
pubmed searches and references from relevant articles were used for this review search terms used were sars severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus etiology diagnosis pcr and serology only papers published in english except reference 10 were reviewed
four recent articles analyzed the whole-genome sequence of sars-cov-2 and constructed phylogenetic trees 14 it is believed that the virus belongs to the betacoronavirus genus and the sars-cov-2 cluster is situated with the groups of sars severe acute respiratory syndromessars-like coronaviruses with fruit bat coronavirus hku9-1 as the immediate outgroup 2 a recent study pointed out that the similarity between sars-cov-2 and batcov ratg13 a virus strain isolated from rhinolophus yunnanensis was as high as 962 3 bats are therefore the most probable source of the virus bats can carry many kinds of viruses without becoming ill in response to them 5 6 there is a huge natural coronavirus pool in bats that sometimes spreads to humans for example the ebola virus originated from the angora dog bat mops condylurus a fruit-eating bat although its intermediate host is still unknown 7 the mers middle east respiratory syndrome virus originated from the egyptian tomb bat taphozous perforatus and was transmitted to the dromedary camel camelus dromedarius before going on to infect humans figure 1 812fruit bats are rarely found in hubei province but horseshoe bats rhinolophus are widely distributed there and are likely to be the source of the virus but how does rhinolophus spread sars-cov-2 to humans some intermediate hosts may be involved a recent study suggests that sars-cov-2 may be derived from the homologous recombination of a bat coronavirus with a snake coronavirus 13 they compared the relative synonymous codon usage rscu bias of the viral genome with its possible hosts and found that the rscu bias of sars-cov-2 is most close to that of snakes 13 however in that study the numbers of codons of the two snakes were several orders of magnitude lower than those of other species this kind of comparison may be inappropriate in addition betacoronavirus has never been detected in snakes 14 the host range of a certain coronavirus is relatively narrow for example the sars-like coronavirus reported in rhinolophus hupehensis during 2005 could not infect human cells 15 the authors of the above report continuously searched bat coronaviruses in china for the subsequent 8 years until in 2013 they found a sars-like coronavirus isolate wiv1 in yunnan province that could infect cells from both humans and other mammals 16 even if a super-highly contagious betacoronavirus strain emerges it may not cross over mammals to infect snakes tortoises 17 or birds furthermore wild snakes were in hibernation in winter and are unlikely to act as the intermediate hostsstudies on sars indicated that the palm civet paguma larvata may be an intermediate host in fact before the outbreak of sars civet feeding became popular in many parts of china bat sars-like coronavirus may have infected palm civets by accident in a yunnan civet-farm the virus-carrying civets may then have been sold to guangdong province the virus may have further spread and mutated in palm civets on the market resulting in a highly contagious sars virus which infected humans in 2003 figure 1 1820 however in the case of sars-cov-2 the first patient and 12 of the 40 later cases had no link to the wild animal market in wuhan 21 22 therefore the animals usually seen in the market such as palm civets are unlikely to be the original intermediate hosts of the virusthe identity of the full-length spike s glycoprotein between palm civet sars coronavirus ay5155121 23 and sars-cov isolated from humans ah0129992 is 980 while the s glycoprotein identity between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 yp0097243901 is only 754 also indicating that palm civets are the intermediate hosts of sars-cov but not sars-cov-2like palm civets other animals usually seen in the market may also be not the intermediate hosts such as hog badgers dog badgers coyotes and raccoon dogs a recent study showed that sars-cov-2 replicates poorly in dogs pigs chickens and ducks but ferrets and cats are permissive to infection 24 however cats and dogs may usually be infected with alphacoronaviruses not betacoronavirus 14 to define the possible roles of domesticated animals in sars-cov-2 transmission further investigations are requiredxiao et al 25 recently reported betacoronavirus in pangolins however the statement of as close as 99 that made in their press release for the pangolin virus was misleading because the full-length genome similarity between the pangolin virus and sars-cov-2 is only 903 a high similarity of 99 has been found within the e region 25 however viruses from other species are also very similar in this region lam et al 26 also reported several genome sequences of coronaviruses isolated in malayan pangolins although a high similarity of 974 has been found within the receptor-binding domain the full-length genome similarities between the pangolin coronaviruses and sars-cov-2 855924 are much lower than that between batcov ratg13 and sars-cov-2 962 additionally in the phylogenetic tree the pangolin cov cluster is situated outside the clade of human cov and rhinolophus cov 25 26 viruses from the direct intermediate host should be closer to humans than to bats moreover the highest similarity between pangolin coronaviruses and sars-cov-2 is only 924 26 indicating that there is a large genetic distance that needs decades of evolution andersen et al 27 further found that neither pangolin cov nor the batcov ratg13 carries the polybasic cleavage site insertion that is required for human ace2 receptor binding thus sars-cov-2 does not seem to be the result of the recombination of a pangolin virus with a bat virus 28moreover chinas pangolins are on the brink of extinction and almost no wild pangolin could be caught such a low population density makes it almost impossible that it is an intermediate host lam et al 26 suggested that pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission however pangolins have long been banned from sale and pangolins could not be seen in the market it would have been almost impossible for the first generation of patients to come into contact with living pangolinsbetacoronavirus can infect artiodactyla and perissodactyla animals such as swine cattle horses camels etc in 2018 researchers identified a pathogen causing acute lethal diarrhea of piglets in a pig-farm in guangdong which was a new type of bat-derived swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus sads-cov although the virus did not transmit to humans 29 they did indeed observe rhinolophus flying around the pig-farm and the bat feces may be the transmission media figure 1 29 malaysias nipah virus niv has a similar transmission path local people built pig farms next to bat habitats bats that were carrying the virus ate fruit and dropped virus-polluted fruit parts into the pig pens through this route niv infected swine and then infected humans figure 1 30 however livestock infected with coronaviruses would show serious symptoms and even death and yet there have been no recent reports of acute diseases in livestock in wuhan though the possibility of asymptomatic infection cannot be ruled outduring animal selection the viral genome should make some adaptations to the host such as changes in the relative synonymous codon usage rscu bias ji et al 13 interestingly indicated that among all possible mammal hosts the rscu bias of sars-cov-2 is most close to that of marmota a rodent species which may indicate rodents as the intermediate hosts the two endemic human coronaviruses hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 have been suggested to have originated from rodents 31 besides young mice 46 weeks old do not develop illness following sars infections while older 1214 months old mice develop clinical illness and pneumonitis but do not subsequently die 32 33 this suggests that one or more rodent species may be the intermediate hosts in which the virus was circulating and mutating 34the ecological niche overlap between the city mouse and the rhinolophus active in the mountains is low given that both rats and bats are widely distributed around the world the single-point outbreak centered on wuhan cannot be reasonably explained bamboo rats are widely cultured in china however they eat bamboo roots and stems grass shots and so on which have no overlap with the ecological niche of rhinolophus we have noticed that a large number of squirrels have been released in wuhan since 2013 and a park for wild squirrels has been built in wuhan both wild squirrels and rhinolophus are active in mountain forests and their ecological niches overlap to some extent people usually treat squirrels as pets and feed them without any protection they might transmit sars-cov-2 through saliva or by accidental biting during feeding although no coronavirus has been isolated from squirrels so far the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and some lyssaviruses have been reported in sciuridae animals 35 implying a zoonotic transmission capability from squirrelshamsters were found as suitable laboratory animals for sars-cov-2 as it causes disease and pathology in them that is somewhat close to the effects in human 36 this requires further studyandersen et al 27 proposed two theories of the origins of sars-cov-2 selection in an animal host or cryptic adaptation to humans it is possible that a progenitor to sars-cov-2 jumped from a non-human animal bat or some intermediate host to humans directly or indirectly with its genomic features like the polybasic cleavage site and o-linked glycans acquired through adaptation during subsequent human-to-human transmission however cryptic adaptation in humans for example that of seasonal influenza should result in widespread outbreaks not a single-point outbreak furthermore there should be a lot of intermediate types of viruses between the progenitor virus and the current sars-cov-2 whereas there are only 120 substitution sites 041 found in eight coding sequences of the sars-cov-2 viral genome the genomic variation of sars-cov-2 is still very low and no intermediate types such as are proposed above have been found 37putting aside the human adaptation theory the animal selection theory suggests that sars-cov-2 have been circulating in one or more animal species before human infection for a precursor virus to acquire the genomic features suitable for human ace2 receptor binding an animal host would likely have to have a high population density to allow natural selection to proceed efficiently 27 it is interesting to note that rodent betacoronaviruses have the polybasic cleavage site 38 considering the above surveillance and whole genomic analysis of covs from rodents are important to elucidate whether these species have any role in the transmission cycle of the virus and to detect the emergence of possible recombinants involving covs from these species and those from bats however there is not yet any evidence on the role of rodents or squirrels as intermediate hostssy conceptualized the analysis and wrote the original draft s-cj and z-ll reviewed and edited the manuscript all authors have read and agreed to the published

china1 the illness usually began with high fever and mild respiratory symptoms but rapidly progressed to pneumonia within a few days2 at the end of february 2003 the disease had spread to neighbouring regions and countries3 4 the disease was severe transmissible from person to person and seemed to cause clusters of disease in health-care workers it was named severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and who issued a global alert about the disease on march 13 20035 6 sars outbreaks occurred in south-east asia north america and europe and gave rise to the first pandemic of the 21st centuryby july 11 2003 who had recorded 8437 cases of sars worldwide and attibuted 813 deaths to the disease most cases were in mainland china and hong kong7 although a novel coronavirus at the end of march 2003 sars coronavirus cov was identified as the infectious agent in the syndrome8 9 10 the origin of this pandemic remains unclear here we report epidemiological data from the early phase of the sars outbreak in guangdong and the findings of virological investigation of 55 patients with sars who were admitted to hospitals in guangzhou in mid-february 2003to track the emergence of sars we gathered epidemiological data from clinical records of patients admitted with a diagnosis of atypical pneumonia or we used reports issued by local health authorities and interviews done with doctors in charge of the treatment of sars patients in guangzhou these data were used to assess how the disease spread first within guangdong province and then to the rest of world we used the who definition of sars in our investigations11
to identify the causative agent in sars we studied 55 patients admitted to the first affiliated hospital of guangzhou medical college and guangzhou chest hospital between jan 24 and feb 18 2003 27 of these patients were health-care workers from hospitals in guangzhou all patients were diagnosed with atypical pneumonia confirmed by chest radiographs and had symptoms and signs that matched the who definition for sars11
table 1
shows patients characteristics to isolate and identify the infectious agent we took nasopharyngeal aspirates for virus isolation and serum for antibody detectionbetween feb 11 and feb 18 2003 we gathered 40 specimens of nasopharyngeal aspirate from patients with sars the specimens were stored in viral transport medium and inoculated into 9-to-10-day-old chicken embryos and cultured for conventional respiratory pathogens on mdck hep-2 and a549 cell lines on the day of sample collection subsequently these frozen and thawed samples were cultured on fetal rhesus kidney frhk-4 cells for sars cov in methods described elsewhere8 all virus isolates were identified by serological tests and rt-pcrto confirm the infectious agent responsible for the outbreak of sars we collected sera from 55 patients and tested for antibodies 22 paired sera were obtained mainly from patients from guangzhou in the acute stage of the disease another 33 single serum samples came from patients some of whom had been transferred from neighbouring cities who presented more than 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms we used 60 serum samples from healthy adults from guangzhou as controls we tested all sera for the presence of antibodies against coronavirus using an immunofluorescence assay ifa8 for sera that were positive we titrated to the endpoint using serial dilutions we selected one positive paired set of samples for use in detection of viral infected cells in patients nasopharyngeal aspirate sampleswe extracted viral rna from the filtered supernatant of virus-infected frhk-4 cells with the rnesay mini kit qiagen chatsworth ca usa based on the first fulllength genome sequence of a coronavirus isolated from a sars patient in canada12 a primer 5tttttttttttttttgtgatt3 was designed for reverse transcription of viral rna subsequently we did pcr using a series of primers prepared in our laboratory primer sequences available on request from authorafter the purification of pcr products cycling sequencing reactions were done to determine nucleotide sequence by use of methods reported elsewhere13 all sequence data were translated and analysed by wisconsin software package version 101 genetics computer group madison wi usa we constructed the phylogenetic relation of samples with the neighbourjoining method with bootstrap analysis 1000 replicates using molecular evolutionary genetics analysis 2 mega 214 the sequences generated by our study are in genbank accession numbers ay304490 ay304491 and ay304495the sponsors of the study had no role in study design data collection data analysis data interpretation or writing of the reportbefore the major outbreak of sars in february 2003 smaller outbreaks compatible with the disease had been noted in five cities around guangzhou in the preceding 2 months the sequence of the sars outbreaks in the guangdong region is shown in figure 1

the first wavethe first case of sars that fulfilled the who definition was reported in foshan a city about 20 km from guangzhou on nov 16 2002 however there were no clinical samples from this patient available for virological investigation on dec 17 2002 a chef from heyuan who worked at a restaurant in shenzhen was reported to have atypical pneumonia and became the second identified case of sars he felt unwell in shenzhen but sought medical treatment in heyuan he had high fever and mild respiratory symptoms radiographic examination showed shadows in both lungs his wife two sisters and seven medical staff were infected and all had the same clinical manifestations this patient as a chef came into regular contact with several types of live caged animals used as exotic game foodsoon after the heyuen outbreak similar cases were also noted on dec 26 2002 in zhongshan a city about 90 km from guangzhou between dec 26 2002 and jan 20 2003 28 cases 10 men 18 women aged 153 years were clinically recognised as atypical pneumonia with an unknown pathogen figure 2
 13 of the 28 patients were health-care workers but none of their family members was infected four patients required mechanical ventilation2

the second wavesince jan 12 2003 some complicated sars cases from the neighbouring cities were transferred to the major hospitals in guangzhou for better medical care the index community sars case of guangzhou was a 46-year-old male seafood merchant who was admitted to the second affiliated hospital of zhongshan university on jan 31 2003 he had travelled to zhongshan in mid-january the patient stayed in the hospital for only 18 h but caused more than 30 hospital staff to become infected on feb 1 2003 the guangzhou index patient was transferred to the third affiliated hospital of zhongshan university during the transfer the ambulance driver two doctors and two nurses were infected within the next 8 days 20 more medical staff who had been in contact with the patient became infected at the same time 19 family members or relatives of the patient fell ill with similar clinical manifestations after close personal contact with the patient this patient generated a large cluster of secondary infections that further spread and gave rise to the outbreak in guangzhou in mid-february one doctor working at the second affiliated hospital of zhongshan travelled to hong kong and became the major source of the sars outbreak in hong kong which led on to the pandemic4 8 9 10
from nov 16 2002 to feb 9 2003 305 cases of sars were reported 105 of which were in health-care workers figure 1 the outbreak was characterised by infection within hospitals and family clusters suggesting that transmission arises through close contact with infected patients by april 20 2003 1317 sars cases and 48 deaths had been reported1
characteristics of 55 patients with sars who acquired the disease between jan 24 and feb 18 2003 are shown in table 1 18 cases were transferred from neighbouring cities of guangzhou during outbreaks from december 2002 to january 2003 about half 49 of infected people in our study group were health-care workers mainly from two hospitals and the group who were infected during the transfer of the first index sars case of guangzhou other patients were from the community of guangzhouall patients had high fever 38c lasting for a mean of 11 days sd 68 and developed pneumonia within 14 days of admission most had a contact history with a sars patient 15 days before the onset of symptoms many patients presented with shortness of breath some had myalgia and fatigue a few had other mild respiratory infection symptoms such as cough and sore throat radiography confirmed the diagnosis of pneumonia in all patients white blood-cell count was slightly decreased and lymphocyte count was strikingly reduced table 1culture of 40 nasopharyngeal specimens in cell lines used for respiratory diseases yielded four influenza a h3n2 viruses and one adenovirus however serological investigation suggested that these conventional viruses were not the primary infectious agent in other patients with sars for whom we had paired sera samples data not shown the h3n2 virus isolates were partially sequenced and genotypedwe noted typical human h3n2 viruses in all gene segments without evidence of reassortment with avian influenza viruses so all samples of nasopharyngeal aspirate were recultured on frhk-4 cells positive cytopathic effect was noted in three samples after the inoculation all three isolates were confirmed to be sars cov by rtpcr and sequencing pcr products with specific primers12
the three viruses were isolated from specimens from a 36-year-old female health-care worker gz43 a 49-year-old female clerk gz50 and a 39-year-old male health-care worker gz60 all were from guangzhou and had had contact with a patient with sars before the onset of their disease their specimens were all collected on feb 18 2003 at guangzhou chest hospitalto determine whether these sars cov isolates were responsible for the guangdong outbreak paired sera from 22 patients and single sera from 33 patients were tested for antibodies to sars cov for paired sera the first samples were obtained from 18 patients at 35 days from disease onset and four patients at days 710 samples from days 35 had no detectable specific antibodies at 110 dilution of sera the titre of specific antibodies was 10160 in samples taken on days 710 but the antibody titres were at least four-fold higher in the second serum sample taken 15 days after the onset for these four patients sars cov antibodies were also detected in 28 of 33 single sera from sars patients all 18 patients who had been transferred from neighbouring cities and the ambulance driver had sars cov antibodies table 2
 the four patients from whom h3n2 influenza was isolated had no detectable sars cov antibody in their serum during convalescence no specific antibodies against sars cov were detected in sera taken from 60 healthy donors during the same period of the study our findings suggest that most patients from guangdong were recently infected by sars covpaired seraone sample taken during the acute stage of the disease and one during convalescencewere used to detect viral antigen by ifa in cells from the nasopharyngeal samples from 23 patients in whom residual specimens were available 14 samples from the convalesent stage showed viral antigen but none was present in the acute serum figure 3
 most sars covinfected cells were bronchial columnar cells and a few positive cells were squamous cells
sequence comparisonall three virus isolates were partially sequenced to cover the polyprotein p gene and the s gene blast search showed that all guangzhou sars cov had the highest homology 99 with the sequences of the sars cov that were isolated from sars cases in hong kong beijing singapore canada and the usa suggesting that all of these sars cov are closely related all of these sequences have very low homologies with known coronaviruses that arise in human beings and animals12 15
when the s gene sequences of three guangzhou isolates were compared with that of the other 11 sars cov viruses available in genbank 11 asynonymous and six synonymous point mutations were recognised in the whole coding region table 3
 five unique aminoacid residues including 224r 716l 931r 2332d and 3536p numbering starting from the coding region of s gene were recognised only in those sars cov isolated from patients in the early phase of sars outbreak of guangzhou table 3 one aminoacid deletion was identified in gz43 and gz60 residue 214 to 216 nucleotide
phylogenetic analysisinvestigations of the complete s gene nucleotide sequences of sars cov shows that these novel coronaviruses clustered into two distinct sublineages the first one only contains viruses isolated from guangzhou gz01 gz43 and gz60 the second includes sars cov isolates from other regions after sars spread of note is that gz50 also joined the second sublineage but still kept an outgroup relation with all other sars cov from other regions figure 4
 suggesting that gz50 might be the prototype of sars cov noted in other regions the phylogenetic relation matches with the disease spread pathwayie from guangzhou to hong kong and then other regionsvirological surveillance in guangdong province in mid-february 2003 showed that the outbreak of a disease fitting the who case definition of sars started in mid-november 2002 epidemiological investigations suggest that sars probably first emerged in satellite cities of guangzhou circulating for at least 2 months before causing a major outbreak in guangzhou itself serological tests and virus isolation confirmed that sars cov was the primary infectious agent of these early cases of sars genetic analysis of these sars cov isolates showed that they belonged to two different subgroups one closely related to that noted in hong kong and other countries and one that seemingly had not spread to people in other regions phylogenetic analysis also suggests that all sars cov share the same origin and most probably first originated in guangdong southern chinain this report our investigation covered 55 patients with sars from guangzhou and its neighbouring cities in the early phase of the sars outbreak the findings of our study show that most of the patients had serological evidence of infection with the novel sars cov while healthy controls did not information generated here suggests that sars cov was also the primary infectious agent in the outbreaks in guangdong province because most people who had sars in other countries were directly or indirectly linked to hong kong or guangdong province we believe that the coronavirus might have originated from this region thus sars a new emerging infectious disease that has become the first pandemic of the 21st century probably originated in guangdong7 8 9 10
our epidemiological findings suggest that sars had been spreading in an unusual pattern the pandemic began with just a few index cases clustered mainly in families and hospital health-care workers in cities around guangzhou that specific antibodies were not present in any serum samples from healthy controls suggests that this coronavirus has not previously been present in human beings in guangzhouour analyses of genome function segment excludes the possibility that sars cov was generated by a recombination between human and animal or animal and animal coronavirus12 sars virus might be zoonotic and could have been introduced to humans by interspecies transmission quite recently since sars cov had very low homologies with all known coronaviruses12 our postulation is that the new virus might have originally been resident in animals that have infrequent contact with humans rather than in domestic animalsthe strains gz43 and gz60 from two health-care workers affected within the same hospital seem phylogenetically similar wherease gz50 which is an independent case from the community is a distinct lineage this finding suggests that there were multiple lineages of viruses circulating in guangdong one of these lineages gz50 maintains an outgroup relation to the major cluster of cases in hong kong and could represent the precursor virus of the hong kong outbreak whether some lineages are more transmissible than others is not clear1 an analysis of more strains from guangdong are needed to address this issue the spread of sars cov in foshan and zhongshan in november and december 2002 did not lead to an outbreak of the same scale as that in guangzhou in january and february 2003 foshan and zhongshan like guandong are large urban conurbations of more than 1 million people one possibility is that the virus was adapting to human beingsie human transmission with time however spread of the disease might have been promoted by the movement of people during the chinese new year holiday season that in 2003 occurred at the end of january furthermore guangzhou being a premier medical centre received transfers of several patients with respiratory complications associated with sarsviruses that undergo interspecies transmission tend to undergo more rapid genetic change as they adapt to a new host16 17 in fact we noted that the genetic variation in the s gene was associated with mutations that were mainly asynonymous the scov isolated in our study are some of the earliest isolates in the global outbreak further genetic analysis of these isolates might enable us to understand the origins of this virus and how it became established in human beingsthe index case of guangzhou outbreak actually functioned as the trigger for the pandemic that generated a large number of secondary infections retrospective analysis of the pathway of the sars spread from satellite cities to guangzhou then hong kong and other countries showed that the major outbreak around the world could be linked to just a small number of so called super-spreading incidents this finding implies that effective human-to-human transmission is firmly established and suggests that sars cov has become well adapted to human beings16
one important question that has arisen from the sars outbreak is why the new coronavirus emerged in guangdong southern china there might be a link to the culinary habits of some southern chinese who consume wild game meat as a delicacy to satisfy this demand different kinds of wild animals have been hunted for consumption or raised in captivity these animals are a likely source of new emergent infectious disease to human beings in fact the emergence of the highly pathogenic h5n1 influenza virus in humans in 199718 19 and in early 2003 unpublished data is also zoonotic the sars outbreak provides evidence to support the hypothesis that southern china could be a site for emerging pandemic infectious disease in the future20
the investigation of the infectious agent in sars emphasises the importance of international collaboration as an effective strategy to control emerging diseases in people especially for those diseases with the potential to become pandemic the lesson from sars outbreaks associated with coronavirus is that we cannot ignore or underestimate the effect of a new emerging infectious disease the best way to control a new emerging infection is to intervene at an early stage in the outbreakcoronaviruses covs are enveloped single-stranded positive sense rna viruses that belong to the family coronaviridae on the basis of genomic organization and phylogenetic relationship coronaviruses have been classified into the subfamily coronavirinae that consists of four genera alphacoronavirus cov betacoronavirus cov gammacoronavirus cov and deltacoronavirus cov cui et al 2019 evolutionary trend analysis of coronaviruses has revealed that cov and cov originated from bats and rodents while cov and cov were found to have originated from avian species ge et al 2017 the ability of covs to cross the species barrier has resulted in some of the pathogenic covs hku1 nl63 oc43 and 229e covs are associated with mild symptoms in humans whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome cov sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome cov mers-cov are known to cause severe disease fehr and perlman 2015 in 20022003 sars-cov emerged in china with 8000 clinical cases and 800 deaths since 2012 mers-cov has caused persistent epidemics in the arabian peninsula both the viruses have been found to originate from bats and then transmitted into intermediate mammalian host civets in the case of sars-cov and camels in the case of mers-cov and eventually infected humans song et al 2019sars-cov-2 has been declared as a pandemic with 1844683 confirmed cases and 117021 deaths globally by 14th april 2020 world health organization 2020 to characterize the novel coronavirus bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and throat swabs were collected from nine patients who had visited the wuhan seafood market during the initial outbreak special pathogen-free human airway epithelial hae cells were used for virus isolation the collected samples were inoculated into the hae cells through the apical surfaces hae cells were monitored for cytopathic effects and supernatant was collected to perform rt-pcr assays apical samples were collected for next generation sequencing after three passages the whole-genome sequences of sars-cov-2 were generated by a combination of sanger illumina and oxford nanopore sequencing lu et al 2020 phylogenetic analysis has revealed that bats might be at the source of sars-cov-2 andersen et al 2020 additionally some studies have suggested that the origin of sars-cov-2 is associated with pangolins li et al 2020 shereen et al 2020 to decipher the mechanism of replication and development of effective preventive and therapeutic strategies understanding the structure of sars-cov-2 genome organization and replication is crucial therefore this chapter focuses on the morphology and structure genomic organization and replication cycle of sars-cov-2sars-cov-2 isolated from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples were inoculated on the vero cells in order to identify sars-cov-2 inoculated cells were prefixed using 2 paraformaldehyde and 25 glutaraldehyde and transmission electron microscopy was performed the structure of sars-cov-2 observed by examining infected cells after 3 days post infection electron microscopy revealed the coronavirus-specific morphology of sars-cov-2 with virus particle sizes ranging from 70 to 90 nm observed under a wide variety of intracellular organelles most specifically in vesicles park et al 2020 due to high sequence similarity the structure of sars-cov-2 is speculated to be the same as sars-cov kumar et al 2020 the surface viral protein spike membrane and envelope of coronavirus are embedded in host membrane-derived lipid bilayer encapsulating the helical nucleocapsid comprising viral rna fig 31 finlay et al 2004 the structure of spike yan et al 2020 and protease of sars-cov-2 zhang et al 2020 has been resolved which provides an opportunity to develop a newer class of drugs for treatment of covid-19
the size of coronavirus genome is in the range of 26 to 32 kb and comprise 611 open reading frames orfs encoding 9680 amino acid polyproteins guo et al 2020 the first orf comprises approximately 67 of the genome that encodes 16 nonstructural proteins nsps whereas the remaining orfs encode for accessory and structural proteins the genome of sars-cov-2 lacks the hemagglutinin-esterase gene however it comprises two flanking untranslated regions utrs at 5 end of 265 and 3 end of 358 nucleotides sequence variation among sars-cov-2 and sars-cov revealed no significant difference in orfs and nsps the nsps includes two viral cysteine proteases including papain-like protease nsp3 chymotrypsin-like 3c-like or main protease nsp5 rna-dependent rna polymerase nsp12 helicase nsp13 and others likely to be involved in the transcription and replication of sars-cov-2 chan et al 2020 in addition to nsps four major structural proteins are spike surface glycoprotein s membrane nucleocapsid protein n envelope e and accessory proteins encoded by orfs n-terminal glycosylated ectodomain is present at the n-terminal end of m protein that comprises of three transmembrane domains tm and a long c-terminal ct domain fig 32
the m and e proteins are required for virus morphogenesis assembly and budding whereas s glycoprotein is a fusion viral protein comprising two subunits s1 and s2 the s1 subunit which shares 70 sequence identity with bat sars-like covs and human sars-cov comprises signal peptide n-terminal domain ntd and receptor-binding domain rbd walls et al 2020 most of the differences were found in the external subdomain that is primarily responsible for interaction of spike with the ace2 receptor the ectodomain of spike protein 11208 amino acid residues was cloned expressed and crystallize to solve the spike glycoprotein structure of sars-cov-2 the structure of spike glycoprotein structure of sars-cov-2 resembles the spike protein of sars-cov with an rmsd of 38  the study also reveals that the receptor-binding region rbd exhibited the highest structural divergence wrapp et al 2020 the s2 subunit that shares 99 sequence identity with bat sars-like covs and human sars-cov comprises two heptad repeat regions known as hr-n and hr-c which form the coiled-coil structures surrounded by the protein ectodomain the s protein has been found to exhibit a furin cleavage site prrarsv at the interface between s1 and s2 subunits that is processed during the biogenesis coutard et al 2020entry of coronaviruses into host target cells depends on the binding of spike glycoprotein to the cellular receptor and priming of s protein by host cell proteases like sars-cov sars-cov-2 uses the ace2 receptor for internalization and tmprss2 serine proteases for s protein priming hoffmann et al 2020 similar to sars-cov the extrapulmonary spread of sars-cov-2 may be seen due to the widespread tissue expression of the ace2 receptor in addition studies revealed that the spike protein of sars-cov-2 exhibits 1020 times higher affinity as compared to that of sars-cov wrapp et al 2020 binding of spike protein to the ace2 receptor results in conformational changes in spike protein that leads to the fusion of viral envelop protein with host cell membrane following entry via endosomal pathway coutard et al 2020 matsuyama and taguchi 2009 this event is followed by the release of viral rna into the host cytoplasm that undergoes translation and generates replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1b that further cleaved by virus encoded proteinases into small proteins the replication of coronavirus involves ribosomal frame shifting during the translation process and generates both genomic and multiple copies of subgenomic rna species by discontinuous transcription that encodes for relevant viral proteins assembly of virion takes place via interaction of viral rna and protein at endoplasmic reticulum er and golgi complex these virions are subsequently released out of the cells via vesicles fig 33 hoffmann et al 2020
the pathological findings of sars-cov-2 infected patients highly resemble that of sars-cov and mers-cov infected patients flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood samples showed significant reduction of cd4 and cd8 t cell counts and their status was found to be hyperactivated as higher proportion of dual positive hla-dr and cd38 was seen rapid progression of pneumonia was seen in chest x-ray images with some differences between the right and left lung histopathological investigation of lung liver and heart tissue was performed lung biopsy showed cellular fibromyxoid exudates with bilateral diffuse alveolar damage the right lung showed prominent desquamation of pneumocytes and formation of hyaline membrane indicating signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards whereas the left lung showed pulmonary edema with formation of hyaline membrane xu et al 2020 in addition both lungs were found to exhibit interstitial mononuclear patchy inflammatory infiltrates dominated specifically by lymphocytes tian et al 2020 the intra-alveolar spaces were characterized by multinucleated syncytial cells with atypical enlarged pneumocytes showing virus-induced cytopathic effect liver biopsy of patients infected with sars-cov-2 showed moderate microvesicular steatosis and mild portal and lobular activity suggesting that injury might have been caused by the virus or drug induced a few interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates were observed in the heart tissue these pathological changes may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of pneumonia induced by sars-cov-2 that may help clinicians to effectively deal with covid-19 patientsphylogenetic analysis revealed that sars-cov-2 might have originated from bats or pangolins structural investigations of virus-infected cells reveal the coronavirus-specific morphology of sars-cov-2 and the size of the virus 7090 nm the size of sars-cov-2 genome ranges from 26 to 32 kb and comprises 611 orfs which lacks hemagglutinin-esterase gene however it comprises of 5 and 3 flanking untranslated regions utrs the spike glycoprotein structure of sars-cov-2 resembles the spike protein of sars-cov with an rmsd of 38  like sars-cov sars-cov-2 uses the ace2 receptor for internalization and tmprss2 serine proteases for s protein priming histopathological investigation of tissues from sars-cov-2 infected patients showed virus-induced cytopathic effect with signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome in lung cellssars-cov-2 has recently emerged and has been declared as a pandemic by the world health organization based on the genomic sequences submitted to ncbi database the scientific community has analyzed the samples and suggested preventive and therapeutic strategies therefore investigation of genomic diversity in the collected specimens from around the globe needs to be conducted in order to design common effective therapies and vaccines in addition genomic characterization helps us accurately identify the origin and evolution of the virus deciphering the mechanism of sars-cov-2 replication in various cell-based models may help us understand the pathogenesis and identify specific targets to develop effective antiviral drugsinfectious bronchitis ib is a disease mainly affecting chickens that is caused by the infectious bronchitis virus ibv a member of the genus gammacoronavirus in the family coronaviridae international committee on taxonomy of viruses 2015 with a single stranded positive sense rna genome approximately 276 kb in length jackwood and de witt 2013 it causes significant losses in meat and egg producing chickens due to its effects on growth rates egg production and quality and mortality in infected flocks there is no effective treatment and vaccination with attenuated vaccine strains is the major tool used to prevent the losses in production caused by ibv in australia chousalkar et al 2009 inactivated vaccines are used outside australia normally as part of vaccination programs in combination with live attenuated vaccines particularly in layer and breeder flocksthere is considerable variation in the virulence and tropism of ibvs and new strains frequently emerge in part due to point mutations deletions and insertions however one of the most important mechanisms underlying the emergence of new strains is genomic recombination jia et al 1995 the emergent virulent strain ark dpi appears to have originated from recombination between four different ibv strains ammayappan et al 2008 additionally the emergence of new strains of ibv in the usa has been reported to have arisen from recombination events between the massachusetts mass conn and holte strains and field strains thor et al 2011in australia ibv strains have been classified into three subgroups based on the nucleotide sequences of the genes encoding their s1 protein ignjatovic et al 2006 subgroup 1 which includes vaccine or vaccine-related strains subgroup 2 a relatively new group that emerged at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s and subgroup 3 which includes more recently isolated strains that have been shown to be derived from recombination between subgroup 1 and 2 strains mardani et al 2010there have been several episodes of re-emergence of ib as a clinical problem in australian chicken flocks and it has been suspected that the emergent viruses may have originated from recombination events the origin of subgroup 2 strains has remained unknown but as the s1 gene of this subgroup shares less than 64 nucleotide nt sequence identity with those of subgroup 1 vaccine related strains sapats et al 1996 it has been assumed that they may have arisen from a coronavirus exogenous to chickens mardani et al 2008 the subgroup 3 strains which were first isolated in 20022003 have an s1 gene that differs considerably from those of subgroup 1 and 2 strains with nucleotide identities of 6163 and 5659 respectively ignjatovic et al 2006 phylogenetic and similarity plot analyses of the genomic region encoding the structural genes have suggested that this subgroup emerged as a result of recombination between subgroup 1 and 2 strains ignjatovic et al 2006 mardani et al 2010 the strain ckausn108 n108 was isolated from a flock of chickens with clinical signs of respiratory disease that had previously been vaccinated against ib analysis of the section of the genome encoding the structural proteins found evidence of recombination in the s1 gene with the subgroup 2 strain n188 and a subgroup 3 strain as possible parental viruses hewson et al 2014although there is evidence of involvement of recombination within the structural and accessory genes in the emergence of new strains of ibv in australia little is known about the genomic region that contains the polymerase genes here we sequenced the complete genomes of subgroup 1 2 and 3 strains in order to detect potential recombination hot spots in the polymerase genes and to investigate the potential involvement of recombination in these regions in the emergence of novel ibv strainsfour different australian strains of ibv were selected for this study one from subgroup 1 armidale a3 a vaccine strain from subtype subtype c distinct from the most commonly used vaccine strain vics subtype b as assessed by virus neutralisation wadey and faragher 1981 one from subgroup 2 ibvckausn188 or n188 arvidson et al 1991 one from subgroup 3 ibvckausn103 or n103 ignjatovic et al 2006 and a relatively recent recombinant strain ibvckausn108 or n108 hewson et al 2014viral culture was performed by inoculating the allantoic cavity of 8- to 9-day-old embryonated specific pathogen-free chicken eggs after 48 h incubation the allantoic fluid af was aseptically collected the af extracted from the embryonated eggs was clarified and the virus purified as described previously lougovskaia et al 2002 with minor modifications briefly the af was clarified by centrifugation at 2500  
g for 20 min the supernatant was then centrifuged at 100000  
g for 2 h at 4 c viral pellets were then resuspended in 200 l of tris-buffered saline tbs ph 74 and this viral suspension was layered over a 30 to 55 continuous sucrose gradient in tbs the gradient was centrifuged at 100000  
g for 4 h at 4 c the virus band was resuspended in tbs and the viral particles pelleted by centrifugation at 90000  
g for 1 h and the pellet resuspended in 250 l of tbs the genomic rna was extracted using rneasy kits qiagen following the manufacturers instructions for rna extraction from cell cultures and tissues with minor modifications asia pacific centre of animal health protocol for rna extraction from allantoic fluid in summary the initial denaturation was performed by mixing 100 l of the viral pellet with 400 l of lysis buffer plus 5 l of -mercaptoethanol and the mixture was incubated at 4 c overnight a 300 l volume of 70 ethanol was added to the lysate for the steps with washing buffers the time and speed were changed from 15 to 30 s and from 8000 to 10000

grna was fragmented using rnase iii life technologies and purified using magnetic beads to construct the libraries the rna was reverse transcribed and the cdna purified and amplified following the manufacturers protocols and then sequenced quinteros et al 2015 sequencing was performed using the pgm ion torrent platform life technologies with a 314 chip and the 200-base sequencing ion onetouch kit v2 all the sequencing protocols were performed at the monash health translation precinct mhtp medical genomics facility within the monash institute of medical research victoria australia all reads were compared to chicken ribosomal rna and mitochondrial genome sequences and the matching reads were discarded the remaining reads were mapped using the genome sequences of the beaudette strain of ibv two ibv vaccine strains from the united states strains conn46 1996 and massachusetts genbank accession numbers fj904716 and gq504724 respectively and two strains from china saibk and sc021202 genbank accession numbers dq288927 and eu714029 respectively as reference sequences using geneious version 614 biomatters because of the high level of sequence diversity of the s gene the reads were also mapped using the previously determined sequences of the entire structural protein gene region from the s glycoprotein to the 3 end of the australian strains armidale n108 n188 vics-del and vics accession numbers dq490205 jn176213 dq490207 jn983807 and jn176213 respectively and the sequences of the s and n genes of n103 accession numbers fj235186 and fj235194 respectively all gaps and ambiguous sequences were resolved by sanger sequencing of pcr products using bigdye terminator v31 applied biosystems kits with specific primers designed using primer 3 untergasser et al 2012 the list of primers are available upon requestin order to confirm the sequences generated using this approach a second assembly method was used the reads were assembled de novo using geneious version 818 biomatters allowing a maximum gaps per read of 10 and a maximum gap size of 2 nucleotides the minimum overlap allowed was 75 nucleotides with at least 95 identity in the overlapping region the maximum proportion of mismatches per read allowed was 10 with an ambiguity of 2 bases or less all contigs were then mapped to the reference sequence using at least 4 different levels of stringency these results were then aligned in order to obtain a final consensus which was subsequently aligned to the homologous sequence that had been generated previouslythe s1 gp nucleotide sequences from every australian ibv strain available except for those generated in this study were downloaded from genbank the amino acid sequences of the s1 proteins were then deduced using geneious version 818 and aligned in clustal w thompson et al 1994 using the gonnet cost matrix with the default settings a gap opening cost of 10 and a gap extension cost of 01 the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the same parameters described previously stroehlein et al 2015 the aligned residues were subjected to bayesian inference analysis using mrbayes version 322 ronquist et al 2012 the posterior probabilities were calculated using a mixture of models with fixed rate matrices generating 1000000 trees and sampling every 100th tree the initial 25 of trees were discarded as burn-in and the others were used to construct a majority rule tree the potential scale reduction factor or psrf gelman and rubin 1992 was 10 which means that the runs converged as a comparison the alignment was also subjected to a maximum likelihood analysis using the whelan and goldman wag model in mrbayes version 322 ronquist et al 2012 and the parameters described abovea multiple sequence alignment of the complete genome sequences of australian and international isolates of ibv was constructed with clustal-omega sievers et al 2011 using the default settings this included previously determined genomic sequences of two variants of the vics vaccine strain quinteros et al 2015 this was used to prepare a network tree using splitstree4 huson and bryant 2006 version 4143 using the maximum likelihood f84 distance model the neighbornet network algorithm 1000 bootstrap replicates and an estimated proportion of invariant sites of 037 the tree included eleven sequences of strains from the united states accession numbers

additional two gammacoronaviruses isolated from non-gallinaceous species jf705860 duck cov and ay641576 peafowl were included to compare with the australian strains a second network tree was also constructed using only the nucleotide sequences of the australian strains using the same parameters but with an estimated proportion of invariant sites of 02similarity plots were created using the on-line tool multiple sequence local alignment mulan ovcharenko et al 2005 the evolutionarily conserved regions ecr in the graph were estimated using a window length of 10 bases a similarity threshold of 90 and a bottom cut-off of 50 the genome sequence of n108 was used as the query to construct the five plotsa pairwise alignment using the structural gene nucleotide sequences of the strains armidale vics n188 and n103 was performed to create similarity plots using either the genome sequences of the armidale or n103 strain as the query the similarity plots were constructed using the maximum likelihood distance model an empirical transitiontransversion tstv ratio calculated for each window a window size of 200 bp and a step size of 20 bp the analyses were performed using simplot version 351 lole et al 1999the strains isolated in australia were examined using recombination detection program 4 rdp4 version 456 martin et al 2010 for evidence of recombination breakpoints the seven methods used for the analysis were rdp martin et al 2005 geneconv padidam et al 1999 bootscanrescan martin et al 2005 maximum chi square maxchi smith 1992 chimaera posada and crandall 2001 siscan gibbs et al 2000 and 3seq boni et al 2007 automasking was used for the optimal detection of recombination breakpoints thor et al 2011 default settings were used for most algorithms changes from default settings were the window size for rdp 60 and bootscan 500 the window and step size for siscan 500 and 20 respectively and the number of variable sites per window for maxchi and chimaera 120 the size of the window was increased from the default to reduce masking of recombination signals within ibv which has a high mutation rate thor et al 2011 the recombination breakpoint plot was calculated with a window of 200 nt the breakpoint plot was constructed using a 200 bp window moved 2 nucleotides at a time along the length of the genome fig 4 the breakpoints selected were those detected with 3 or more recombination detection methods at a p  005 table 1
the genome sequences of the four australian ibv strains were determined and deposited in genbank with the accession numbers ku556805 armidale ku556804 n188 ku556806 n103 and ku556807 n108 the genomes of these strains were 27673 27165 27626 and 27688 kb in lengths for armidale n188 n103 and n108 respectively the nucleotide similarities of the consensus sequences obtained with the two assembly protocols mapped to sequence and de novo were armidale 992 n103 998 n188 989 n108 985 data previously obtained for vics-del and vics-v were similarly analysed and the similarities between the assemblies were 993 for vics-del and 985 for vics-v the regions that were not similar corresponded to ambiguous sequences the sequences deposited in genbank are those deduced using the mapped to sequence protocolin the network tree fig 1
a most of the ibv isolates were distributed into 7 main clusters the six australian strains included in this analysis formed a separate clade with the armidale strain branch diverging from the main cluster with only limited recombination with any of the other five australian strains included this was also seen in the case of the n188 strain notably there was little evidence of any interaction between the strains in the australian clade and strains in clades from other countries furthermore the australian clade is equally or more divergent compared to the other ibv genomes included in this study than the tcov clade particularly the n188 strain the network tree constructed using only australian isolates fig 1b confirmed the recombination events that have been detected between these isolates and also highlighted how the armidale and n188 strains have diverged both network trees provided strong evidence of recombination and yielded a highly significant phi test p  0001 the strains included as outgroups duck turkey and peafowl coronavirus were not phylogenetically related with the australian strains but with strains from china and the usa fig 1ain the s1 phylogenetic tree both bayesian and maximum likelihood wag models gave almost identical results supplementary fig 1 so the bayesian phylogenetic tree was chosen for the figure the s1 phylogenetic tree contained three clusters the first fig 2
a corresponded to vaccine and vaccine-related strains subgroup 1 while the other two clusters fig 2b and c to subgroups 2 and 3 respectively three strains were removed from the alignment before the inference of the phylogenetic tree as they were identical 100 to other strains 026 to strain b and 044 and 013 strains to vics-v
fig 3
shows a schematic representation of the origin of the different sections of the genome of the three emergent recombinant australian ibvs isolated from major outbreaks in 1988 n188 2003 n103 and 2008 n108the genome of strain n188 was highly similar over 95 identity to that of strain vics from the 5 end of the genome to the end of orf 1a nt 12000 there were two small segments with high similarity to vics in orf 1ab between nt 12500 and 13200 and between nt 16800 and 17800 981 and 995 identity respectively there was a small segment at the 3 end of orf 1ab between nt 19000 and 19500 that had over 99 sequence identity with the armidale strain the remainder of the genome encoding all the structural and accessory genes had low levels of similarity with both of the vaccine strainsthe genome of strain n103 had over 94 similarity with vics from the 5 end of the genome to nt 3800 from this point to nt 5000 it was 995 identical to the armidale strain after which it was again very similar to vics between nt 5000 and 17000 at this point there was a third crossover and the similarity to armidale increased to over 95 the similarities changed again at nt 18200 with similarity to vics increasing to over 99 all inside orfs 1a and 1ab between nt 20000 and 23500 the similarity of the sequence of n103 to either vaccine strain was less than 77 from this point to the 3 end of the genome corresponding to the region in which all the structural and accessory genes except for the peplomer are encoded it was equally similar to both strains 935 and 934 identity with vics-v and armidale respectivelythe genome of strain n108 had a high level of sequence identity with that of n103 952 except between nt 1000 and 2700 where n108 had a high level of sequence identity with the armidale strain rather than vics and between nt 17000 and 18200 where it had 999 identity with vics and another small region between nt 19500 and 20100 where it had 993 identity with armidale

depicts the recombination breakpoints as calculated using rdp4 there were 14 recombination points detected along the genomes of these six strains these breakpoints were located in genes 1ab nsps 2 3 10 11 12 14 15 and 16 s1 s2 3b and e and were consistent with the data previously described and depicted in fig 3the similarity plot fig 5
 of isolate n108 with each of the other 5 australian strains revealed the considerable complexity of the recombination events that have generated strain n108 its genome shared a high level of identity with strain n103 in the regions at the 5 end of the genome from nt 1 to 940 over 98 in the area encoding non-structural protein nsp 3 to nsp13 from nt 2741 to 17001 over 94 part of nsp14 nsp15 and the beginning of nsp16 from nt 18221 to 19601 over 98 and from the region encoding the s2 glycoprotein s2gp until the 3 end of the genome from nt 22481 over 88 the sections of the genome between nt 2741 and 19601 and from nt 22481 to the 3 end were also highly similar to vics-v 985 and 921 identity respectively it also shared a high level of identity with the armidale strain from nsp2 to the beginning of nsp3 between nts 1061 and 2621 over 98 and at the end of the nsp genes between nts 19581 and 20121 over 99 immediately upstream of the s1gp gene the level of identity with vics-v and vics-del was over 98 in the nsp14 gene region between nt 17021 and 18241 n108 had a high level of nt sequence identity with n188 in the region encoding nsp14 974 between nt 16926 and 18488 especially in the region encoding the n-terminus between nt 16926 and 17934 994 n188 also had a high level of identity with n108 in the region encoding the s1gp in fig 5 the first half of the s cds between nt 20141 and 22941 88 while the other strains included in this study had sequence identities with n108 below 68 in this region fig 5 these observations were supported by the rdp4 analyses which detected two recombination breakpoints in this region table 1 the first was located between nt 1010 99 ci 9371133 and 2712 99 ci 24322744 with n103 and armidale proposed as the major and minor parent strains the second breakpoint was located between nt 19712 99 ci 1924220175 and 23273 99 ci 2325923301 with vics-v and n188 as the proposed parent strainsthe similarity plots fig 5 comparing n188 upper panel and n103 lower panel with n108 show that n188 was equally or less similar to n108 than n103 was to n108 across the genes encoding the polymerase genes except for the nsp14 gene where n188 was more similar to n108 than n103 analysis of the predicted amino acid sequences of nsp14 fig 6
 revealed that there were differences within motif i where the first amino acid residue in n188 and n108 was valine while in n103 it was isoleucine and at residue 113 where n188 and n108 both have cysteines whilst n103 has a glycine and residue 455 where there is a glycine deletion in n103infectious bronchitis virus is a highly prevalent virus causing economic losses in the chicken industry globally jackwood and de witt 2013 infectious bronchitis virus strains have been continuously monitored in australian chickens since the first characterisation and isolation of the aetiological agent of nephrosis syndrome in the 1960s cumming 1962 one of the principal milestones of this monitoring was the discovery of the subgroup 2 strains at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s sapats et al 1996 these viruses had s1gp and n protein gene sequences that were very distinct from those of the strains that had been encountered previously this clade of strains also has a translocation and deletion of some accessory protein genes mardani et al 2008 hewson et al 2011 however since only the structural and accessory genes in the 75 kb region at the 3 end of the genome had been sequenced previously the available information suggested that the origin of the subgroup 2 strains was from a coronavirus completely distinct from the strains already circulating in australian chicken flocks the determination of the complete sequences of the polymerase genes presented in this study now suggests that n188 originated in part from ibv strains already circulating in the field as well as from an avian coronavirus of unknown origin phylogenetic analysis of different strains of ibvs isolated from different countries fig 1 supported previous suggestions that australian strains of ibv have been diverging as an independent cluster quinteros et al 2015 however the representation of genetic divergence by a phylogenetic tree alone may not be accurate because once a branch is created no further potential interactions between the branches are represented thor et al 2011 in network trees boxes represent the likelihood that there has been recombination between two different branches the ibv network splitstree fig 1 suggested considerable intra-clade interactions with a significantly lower number of inter-clade interactions supporting suggestions that australian ibvs have been genetically isolated for a considerable time ignjatovic et al 2006 quinteros et al 2015 this could be explained by the geographic location of australia as an island and the enclosed nature of the australian ecosystem and also by the biosecurity barriers imposed by australian authorities on biological imports it is likely that ibv vaccine strains may have played a significant role in intra-clade recombination events in australia because of the high reliance on live attenuated vaccines in australia there is a high probability that co-infection with a field strain and a vaccine strain could occur the chimaeric pattern of relationships between the three australian isolates of ibv characterised here and the two most distinct vaccine strains in use suggests that this has happened multiple times as summarized in fig 3as has been reported previously there is a high level of divergence between the sequence of n188 and the vaccine strains in the region of the genome encoding the structural and accessory proteins downstream of nt 20000 mardani et al 2008 in the region encoding the polymerase genes the genome sequence was highly similar to vics this suggests that for the emergent n188 strain the donor of the polymerase genes was most likely to have been vics or a vics-like strain while the donor of the structural protein genes remains unknown as reported previously mardani et al 2008 this may suggest that the polymerase genes from the parental virus that served as the source of the structural genes were poorly adapted to chicken cells and that the emergence of n188 was driven not only by the antigenic differences between this virus and other circulating ibvs but also by an enhanced capacity of the recombinant virus to replicate in chickens a similar scenario could be behind the emergence of n108 a previous study comparing the sequences of the n108 structural genes suggested that the emergence of this virus could be due to a recombination event between a subgroup 2 strain n188 and a subgroup 3 strain n103 hewson et al 2014 fig 4 last third of the genome from nt 20000 to the 3 end however it is possible that n108 could have resulted from an independent recombination event with vics-v rather than with n103 with recombination breakpoints located between 181 and 1114 bp upstream of the start codon of s1gp nt 1924220175 and between 1278 and 1320 bp downstream of the protease cleavage site nt 2325923301 for the s1 and s2 gp genes table 1 fig 4 letters j and m however an n103-like strain which could be a recombinant derived from n103 and armidale could also be one of the parental strains with n108 derived from recombination between this virus vics and n188 fig 5 and table 1 it is difficult to infer the exact order of these recombination events as the recombinational history of n108 appears to be extremely complexalthough the s1gp gene sequence of n108 is very similar to that of n188 the subgroup 2 strains have not been isolated from any ib outbreak in australia for over 20 years therefore it is possible that the unknown avian coronavirus donor of the structural and accessory genes of n188 is continuing to recombine with ibv vaccine strains leading to the emergence of new strains the detection of this unknown avian coronavirus donor will be crucial to better understanding the origin and evolution of these new recombinant strains there is prior evidence of interspecies recombination in avian coronaviruses in the emergence of turkey coronavirus tcov the genome of tcov is very similar to that of ibv except for the gene for the s gp and as in the case with the emergence of n188 the parental donor of the spike glycoprotein gene remains unknown lin et al 2004 jackwood et al 2010 these interspecies recombination processes have also been described in other members of the family coronaviridae it has been suggested that rp3 a severe-acute respiratory syndrome sarslike coronavirus from bats may have originated by recombination between another sars-like coronavirus bt-slcov rm1 and a human sars coronavirus hu-scov hon et al 2008 interestingly the recombination breakpoint in rp3 is located around the orf 1bs junction which is the site at which recombination between the vics-like parental virus and the unknown parental virus of n188 occurred fig 3as it can be seen in the phylogenetic tree of s1 fig 2 the australian strains are divided in three different clusters and n188 subgroup 2 n103 subgroup 3 and n108 subgroup undetermined belong to 2 clusters separated from the main one where all the vaccines and vaccine related strains can be found n108 lies in the same cluster as n188 implying that the unknown avian coronavirus donor of the s1 gene of n188 could still be recombining with ibv vaccines or field strains to generate new recombinantsprevious experimental inoculation studies in chickens have revealed that the n108 strain has tropism for tracheal tissue inducing only mild lesions as was seen in earlier experiments with the subgroup 2 strain n188 ignjatovic et al 1997 hewson et al 2014 in contrast the subgroup 3 strain n103 causes moderate to severe tracheal lesions and clinical signs together with an increase in mortality and reduced growth rates ignjatovic et al 2006 the analysis of the nt similarities between n188 and n108 and between n103 and n108 to determine genetic factors that may be associated with these differences in phenotype revealed a high similarity between the s1gp nt sequences of n188 and n108 938 and much lower similarity with the s1 gp gene sequence of n103 653 hewson et al 2014 however it has been demonstrated that the replicase genes rather than the structural genes may be more closely associated with the level of virulence of an ibv strain armesto et al 2009 the only peptide gene in the polymerase region in which n108 is more similar to n188 than to n103 is the nsp14 gene nsp14 has been shown to have 3-to-5 exoribonuclease exon and guanine-n7-methyltransferase n7-mtase activity in other members of the family coronaviridae chen et al 2009 chen et al 2013 smith and denison 2012 the exon belongs to the dedd superfamily asp-glu-asp-asp and these conserved residues smith and denison 2012 are found in the nsp14 of 75 strains of ibv at positions 89 91 241 271 respectively data not shown there are also 3 highly conserved amino acid motifs i ii and iii in the nsp14 of all coronaviruses with the dedd signature minskaia et al 2006 studies in sars-cov have revealed that changes in the amino acid residues within motif i impair viral growth rates and lead to higher levels of viral mutations in progeny after several passages in cell culture eckerle et al 2010 the predicted amino acid sequence alignment of n188 n103 and n108 revealed differences in motif i and in the residues at positions 113 and 455 fig 6 it is possible that these changes could lead to conformational changes in this protein especially the cysteine to glycine substitution which could alter the function of either the exon or n7-mtase however it is more likely that these changes in combination with other small changes in the polymerase peptides are jointly rather than individually responsible for the differences in virulence in these ibvsa previous study based on analysis of the s gp gene suggested that subgroup 3 viruses could have emerged as a result of recombination between subgroup 1 and 2 strains mardani et al 2010 however similarity plot analysis of the isolates indicates that this is not likely to be the case the nucleotide sequence of the s gene of n103 was equally dissimilar to both subgroup 1 and 2 strains when the armidale strain subgroup 1 was used as the query the s1 genes of n188 and n103 appeared to be similar however as shown in fig 7
b when n103 subgroup 3 was used as the query the sequence of its s gene was found to be quite distant from that of strain n188 especially in the s1gp region the first half of the s gene with a similarity below 50 thus the origin of the subgroup 3 strain is most likely due to a recombination event between subgroup 1 strains and an unknown s1 gene donor that was quite distant from the donor of the same gene in the subgroup 2 strains probably another unknown avian coronavirus suggesting that there are multiple distant avian coronaviruses with the capacity to recombine with ibvs and contribute to future ibv diversitythe genome sequence of the structural proteins of n108 suggests that if it was used as a vaccine strain could offer broader immunological protection than the australian vaccine strains currently in use the protein that induces neutralising antibodies against ibv is the s1gp and these antibodies confer protection against disease cavanagh et al 1986 ignjatovic and galli 1994 all the australian vaccines belong to subgroup 1 and the amino acid sequence of the s1gp of this subgroup differs from those of subgroup 2 and 3 viruses ignjatovic et al 2006 hewson et al 2011 although antibodies induced by the n protein are not protective ignjatovic and galli 1994 peptides derived from it are recognised by t cells and it is thus believed to play a role in the induction of cell mediated immunity boots et al 1991 saif 1993 seo et al 1997 n108 is the only strain characterised thus far that shares a high sequence identity in either its s1 andor n genes with members of all the australian subgroups of ibv the potential for this virus to induce cross protection against members of all other subgroups needs to be assessed to validate this hypothesiscoronaviruses have been known to medicine for some time 1 but it is of course only very recently that the coronavirus sars-cov-2 the covid-19 virus new and dangerous to humans was identified it is believed to be related to an initial cluster of pneumonia cases associated with a seafood and fresh meat market in wuhan china 2 current case rates at the time of writing are close to one million with close to 60000 deaths the genomic relationships to other coronaviruses were quickly examined by lu et al to shed light on the origins epidemiology and receptor binding of the virus 2 on january 17th 2019 the wuhan isolate genbank entry mn9089473 replaced mn9089472 and mn9089473 probably represents an adequate stable description of the sequence for research into that strain isolate and was immediately investigated by the present author 34 originally it was seen by authorities as a coronavirus outbreak but not as sars severe acute respiratory syndrome however its genomic relationships examined in ref 34 also showed many fairly close correlations with the genomes of sars-cov in the previous human but not pandemic outbreaks and in pigs bats and civets and the emphasis was on finding subsequences that are well conserved across coronavirus strains and species the earliest patients suffering from what is now called covid-19 had overall 9998 genome sequence identity to the above wuhan isolate so that one may reasonably say that it is the origin of covid-19 and its virus sars-cov-2 2 the earlier wuhan isolates also related with 88 identity to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-like coronaviruses collected in 2018 in zhoushan china but differed more from sars-cov at about 79 and mers-cov at about 50 2 the wuhan and related isolates revealed a coronavirus that resides in the subgenus sarbecovirus of the genus betacoronavirus 2 and although genetically distinct from its predecessor sars-cov it appeared to have similar external binding proteins meaning here the spike glycoprotein discussed extensively in the present paper see section 13 below for introduction to this protein which also discusses some further early identified genomic correlations in addition the rest of this present paper discusses many other genomic relationships relevant to the design of synthetic vaccines and therapeutic antagonists againstcovid-19one problem is that covid-19 is a new pathogen posing a global threat and so presents new challenges both in primary prevention where a vaccine is required and in secondary prevention where a therapeutic compound ideally in a pill is required to treat patients who are infected it might also present challenges for tertiary prevention which seeks to remedy a persistent level of infection or to prevent recurrence even to essentially the same strain as discussed in section 12 a main problem of concern and a point of the present paper is the likely appearance of new strains with resistance to vaccines and therapeutic agents at the time of writing confirmed cases double globally every 6 days and undetected cases are expected to be much higher the current plateauing of reported cases in china offers a glimpse that this this should attenuate soon but estimates of how and when are varied with a significant portion of humanity already infected there is enhanced probability of successful escape mutations in the genome of the virus development of vaccines and perhaps particularly therapeutics that could but do not take account of this by targeting less variable protein regions could be a huge waste of resource and a dangerous delaycovid-19 is of course by far the most serious but not the first sars outbreak of concern to humans and coronaviruses have for decades been of veterinary concern 1 however it still remains true that zoonotic coronaviruses have only rather recently seriously impacted humans as far as is known they include sars-cov 2002 betacoronavirus subgenus sarbecovirus and mers-cov 2012 betacoronavirus subgenus merbecovirus although the idea that sars-cov-2 was distinct from sars-cov was originally discouraged distinction is here a matter of degree by usual criteria they are fairly closely related genetically clustering within betacoronavirus subgenus sarbecovirus until very recently sars-cov effectively sars-cov-1 was the primary reference point and model regarding molecular and functional details and it remains importantshortly after the appearance in genbank of the apparently final version of the wuhan seafood market isolate mn9089473 2 the present author compared a variety of coronavirus genomes 34 the krsfiedllfnkv protein subsequence was seen as a potential achilles heel because it is exposed or potentially exposable being required for proteolytic activation cleavage and importantly is also a well-conserved feature on the surface of the virus 34 being well conserved suggests that mutations are much less easily accepted meaning that the virus is less likely to survive more than one or two generations as discussed below the conservation is in a region of protein on the virus surface concerned with at least one step of lung cell entry interesting because coronaviruses seem to be able readily adjust to alternative means of entry possibly hinting at additional roles for the subsequence whether or not that is the case the above motif seems a likely primary target for synthetic vaccines and a basis for drug discovery and was proposed as such 34 it is a motif that was found to be quite well conserved even in more distantly related coronaviruses 34 and the present paper also explores how far that seems to extend it includes the common cold coronaviruses another potential subsequence of interest popular with researchers is also examined the ace2 binding domain discussed below but the above remains popular with the present author because of its relatively high degree of conservationat first glance of the three kinds of prevention tertiary prevention ie including trying to insure that the disease does not recur seems the least worrying in the present authors opinion however it relates to a specter that recently haunted covid-19 vaccine research and which might still cause some concerns this is the question of why there is no significant immunity acquired by the body to prevent recurrence of common cold of which up to roughly 30 of cases are believed to be due to coronaviruses fortunately at time of final writing of this paper news reports indicate that neutralizing antibodies can be found in patients who have had covid-19 however with the risks of escape mutations of the virus in mind it remains worthwhile considering whether the subsequence krsfiedllfnkv again found to be well conserved 34 across many coronaviruses 34 is still present in common cold coronavirus this is in order to force better immune response by targeting using synthetic or cloned vaccines with this epitope most common cold strains fall into one of two coronavirus serotypes oc43-like and 229e-like which are the main examples discussed below while the common cold is generally considered as mainly an upper respiratory tract infection and a mundane inconvenience common human coronaviruses betacoronavirus hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 as well as alphacoronavirus hcov-229e also cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in children and the elderly some discussion is also given to hcov-hku1 in this paperthe above motif krsfiedllfnkv occurs in the spike glycoprotein 4 responsible for initial binding of previous sars coronaviruses to lung cells and their activation of the spike protein by a proteolytic cleavage 5 6 7 the spike glycoprotein or just spike protein is the familiar spike that studs the surface of the coronavirus giving it the appearance of a crown to electron microscopy hence corona latin crown after the completion of the first version of the previous paper 3 a bat virus with 9741 identity of the amino acid sequence of the spike protein discussed extensively in the present paper was entered into genbank as entry qhr633001 as of the time of final writing this on april 2nd 2020 there is 100 match of this protein with entry yp0097243901 that appears to be a same or similar to the above wuhan isolate the top hundred non-redundant matching entries found using mn9089473 by blastp at httpsblastncbinlmnihgovblastcgi see below for mn9089473 spike protein used here vary from the above 100 match down to 7580 such as aau046461 which is a civet isolatein viruses proteins of a similar protruding nature eg the hemagglutinin of influenza a are primary targets for vaccine development and important targets for development of therapeutic drugs that seek to block the virus from infecting host cells at the time of the current project only the three dimensional structures of the sars-cov spike proteins of the earlier sars outbreak was known eg refs 8 which has only 7581 sequence match to sars-cov-2 3 note that it is customary to write sars-cov rather than sars-cov-1 rna viruses mutate with high frequency but so far the differences in spike proteins in emergent sars-cov-2 variants are much less at the time of the study in late february and early march 2020 the amino acid residue sequences of the spike proteins of covid-19 isolates from different states and countries such as california brazil taiwan and india remain identical or almost so for example with respect to the original wuhan isolate 2 phenylalanine f is replaced by cysteine c as residue 797 in a swedish isolate and alanine a is replaced by valine v as residue 990 in an indian isolate as of 21st march 2020 largest variants in the sars-cov-2 genome as a whole show 999 nucleotide sequence match which for a genome of 29858 rna bases suggests approximately 30 base changes and of the order of 5 in the spike glycoprotein gene of 3821 nucleotides that then suggests roughly 1 to 3 amino acid differences in the spike protein of current march 2020 sars-cov-2 variants consistent with the above more specific observations of isolates from california etc a single amino acid change can of course sometimes have significant effect eg on the aggressive character of a coronavirus and so be considered as creating a new strain some new strains are being reported at the time of writing but to the authors knowledge none of them are spike protein variations and more specifically none are as yet in the krsfiedllfnkv subsequencethe left hand side of fig 1
shows the sars-cov previous sars s1 spike glycoprotein within the trimer that makes up the spike the right hand side shows sars-cov-2 the sars of current concern all human sars coronaviruses and indeed the spike proteins of many other related coronaviruses appear similar in overall conformation and the variations seen in experimental structures are probably more to do with crystallization or other preparation methods particularly regarding solvent details and ligands sars-cov on the left has been well studied and still serves as the reference model in order to fuse with and infect cells the spike protein needs to be in an open state presumably the closed state makes it less vulnerable to antibodies on the left fig 1 also shows the approximate positions of the cleavage points superimposed on the protein data bank pdb entry 5xlr for sars-cov reading from the n-terminus of s1 the important functional elements of sars coronaviruses deduced from sars-cov studies 56 and applicable to sars-cov-2 are the s1 n-terminal domain s1-ntd the s1 c-terminal domain s1-ctd the s1s2 site as the first protease cleavage site as a loop between a pleated sheet and a-helix the fusion peptide fp associated with a highly disordered loop between two a-helices which contains the second cleavage site s2 and a heptad repeat hr the arginine r in the conserved motif krsfiedllfnkv that was of interest in the previous study 2 is the cleavage point in s2recall that the krsfiedllfnkv subsequence associated with s2 is potentially important not least because it must be exposed or exposable because it permits proteolytic cleavage and therefore the site cannot be well shielded the experimental three dimensional structures of coronavirus spike proteins do not for the most part reveal the large amount of glycosylation that protects most of the spike protein surface possibly the major problem however is not so much in the selection of accessible surface regions as a basis for design entry inhibitor and vaccine design 89 but that the coronavirus readily escapes from such agents by mutation including in the spike protein 1011 this is the further importance of being a highly conserved motif ie a subsequence that does not readily change from strain to strain except for a conservative sidechain replacement in more remote strains of course as one carries the study forward to more distantly related viruses one expects the motif to differ at some stage and this is investigated later below in contrast nonetheless the pigag motif associate with the s1s2 cleavage site disappears in coronaviruses that are not too distantly related 34 as noted above a high degree of conservation of krsfiedllfnkv in the face of genetic indicates that it is in some way important to the virus presumably for the proteolytic activation cleavage andor initial binding to lung cells but there could be other interactions with other proteins ie to reduce an inflammatory response as discussed later belowmodern computer-driven strategies and the kind of chemical products that they help produce differ substantially from the earlier and more familiar approaches in which the computer played little if any role in large part this is due to the invention of automatable peptide synthesis by merrifield in 1963 who used solid phase peptide synthesis based on crosslinked polystyrene beads 12 traditional vaccines are purely biological being composed of dead or attenuated strains of pathogen meaning mainly viruses and bacteria in contrast a synthetic vaccine is a vaccine consisting mainly of synthetic peptides but also sometimes carbohydrates often linked to a carrier protein to render it immunogenic such vaccines produced via chemical synthesis are safer because they do not involve cell-derived material or biological processes for production their purity can be controlled as in the case of classical drugs the worlds first synthetic vaccine was created in 1982 from diphtheria toxin by louis chedid scientist from the pasteur institute and michael sela from the weizmann institute in 1986 manuel elkin patarroyo created spf66 the first version of a synthetic vaccine for malaria primarily applications so far have been veterinary many early vaccines used dead samples of foot and mouth disease virus to inoculate animals but they caused real outbreaks scientists discovered that a vaccine could be made using only a single key protein from the virus and later also found that loops from the surface proteins could be cloned or used in cloned or synthetic constructs novartis vaccine and diagnostics among other companies developed a synthetic approach that very rapidly generates vaccine viruses from amino acid sequence data in order to be able to administer vaccinations early in a pandemic outbreaktraditional vaccines have so far remained the popular choice but during the h1n1 outbreak in 2009 they only became available in large quantities after the peak of human infections this was a learning experience for vaccine companies creating vaccines synthetically would be currently more expensive but has the ability to increase the speed of production and to retune and fine tune the solution to combat new variations in pathogens this is all especially important in the event of a pandemic synthetic vaccines are also considered to be safer by researchers than vaccines grown from eg eggs or from bacterial cultures in the latter case there may even be other viruses present cloned proteins can however reflect the same desirable principles regions of pathogen amino acid sequence acting as epitopes see below can be presented as loops at the surface of a cloned protein the general idea is that synthetic vaccines are freer of contaminants and focus on the essential features of the required immune response they can also be developed in a more logical step by step approach for example sometimes diagnostics are considered as a useful early step on the way to a vaccine since they are only required to raise antibodies in animals such as sheep for diagnostic kit production not to be safe in humans and also raise immune system memory and a cellular as well as antibody responsesynthetic vaccines also have the advantage that they can be seen as cartridge vaccines meaning that they contain bits and pieces that can readily be replaced by others to update the vaccine in order to combat new strains of pathogen a synthetic vaccine thus has several functional components looking somewhat like a swiss army knife under the electron microscope the key component reproduces the essential features of a pathogen protein that the immune system sees it is an epitope that typically means a patch of some 5 to 20 amino acid residues reproduced as a short peptide epitopes can be considered as haptens haptens are substances with a low molecular weight such as peptides small proteins and drug molecules that are generally not immunogenic and require the aid of a carrier protein to stimulate a response from the immune system in the form of antibody production there are two main types of epitope b and t discussed in theory section 2 a synthetic vaccine consists of t-epitopes as haptens for cell response and immune system memory molecular adjuvant eg muramyl dipeptide and possibly excitatory or anti-inhibitory peptides b-epitopes are good for raising antibodies in eg sheep to use in diagnosticsbiosensors all attached to or cloned into a carrier protein the latter must be safe but at the same time sufficiently different from any human protein to avoid autoimmune disease used extensively as a carrier protein in the production of antibodies for research biotechnology and therapeutic applications keyhole limpet hemocyanin klh is the most widely employed carrier protein and least for studies using laboratory animals for humans the food and drug authorities may have other preferences for carrier protein but klh illustrates the desired features its large size and numerous epitopes generate a substantial immune response and abundance of lysine residues for coupling haptens allows a high haptencarrier protein ratio increasing the likelihood of generating hapten-specific antibodies because klh is derived from the limpet a gastropod it is phylogenetically distant from mammalian proteins thus reducing false positives in immunologically-based research techniques in mammalian model organisms and clinically avoiding autoimmune effects so far the food and drug authorities do not seem to have favored synthetic vaccines for human use but this may be more to do with the peptides themselves than the carrier proteins available the earlier methods of peptide synthesis did not achieve high levels of purity however this has changed and quite elaborate peptides as well as proteins can be made facilitated by making peptide synthesizers run fast to avoid the slower side reactions and by methods that join shorter synthetic peptides into longer chains 43 44 45 46one of the original motivations for the present study was to capture experience and design strategies from vaccine diagnostic and antagonist design 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 methods by the author and colleagues ranged from the expert system approach to automated bioinformatics and protein modeling 26 27 28 29 and automated drug design eg ref 30 31 32 33 more recently there has been an automated approach based on the proposed q-uel language 34 35 36 37 the more fine-grained principles for the design of synthetic peptide vaccines and antagonist peptides made of d-amino acids are discussed in some detail in the previous paper 3 a variety of bioinformatics techniques are available to help in development of these solutions eg refs 38 39 40 41 as well as computational eg ref 42 and synthetic techniques eg ref 43 the q-uel language 33 34 35 36 37 used in the preceding work 3 is also a means of gathering relevant information from the world wide web efficiently when encountering a new problem such as an epidemic caused by a new virus or at least a problem new to the researcher 3437 it also enables more automated interaction with websites for publically available bioinformatics tools the motivation for this was all the stronger because the popular highly integrated approach to bioinformatics called the biology workbench at the university of san diego supercomputer center has been no longer available for some time 38 however the standard bioinformatics tools eg ref 39 40 41 used in the present study can of course be used readily by researchers reasonably experienced in bioinformaticsalthough peptidomimetics containing amino acids that would not occur in normal ribosome-based biosynthesis have been considered by authors as a basis for haptens in synthetic vaccines they are in the authors opinion probably best considered as potential therapeutic antagonists in the present study the specific aims include design of molecules to impede binding and activation of the spike glycoprotein at the surface of lung cells 5 6 7 synthetic peptides copied from subsequences in the spike protein could be used directly for such clinical purposes but then an important design step would be to render them resistant to biodegradation by human proteases this is typically by inclusion of d-amino acid residues 44 45 46previously in the authors personal opinion peptides and peptidiomimetics have been currently best considered as first steps in the research and development of small organic in a pill molecules of the traditional kind favored the by the pharmaceutical industry their role there nonetheless is a powerful one linking amino acid sequences seen in nature conveniently already designed by millions of years of evolution to typically smaller novel organic molecules designed to have van-der-waals and electrostatic features in the binding site however the authors reticence has been largely based on cost including cost in changing traditional production strategy and in the reservations of food and drug authorities but fairly recently all that appears to be changing thpdb httpcrddosddnetraghavathpdb includes an example of a manually curated repository of peptides and related molecules approved by the us food and drug administration fda over some 70 peptide drugs are approved in the us and other major markets and those in pipelines and in or approaching clinical trials may now be exceeding 200 entries as natural compounds peptide drugs are typically less toxic than more traditional chemical candidates although d-amino acids are not natural features of ribosomal production of peptides and proteins human metabolism can handle them they occur in gut microbes and ingested material and in human proteins they form spontaneously in a kind of aging process from some amino acids in situ in protein sequences eg l to d-aspartate diverse d-amino acids such as d-serine d-aspartate d-alanine and d-cysteine are found as free amino acids and small peptides as well as in some proteins and quite commonly in mammals they are often found having playing important roles in the nervous system for example n-methyl-d-aspartate nmda receptors are associated with learning and memory and d-serine d-aspartate and d-alanine bind to those receptors hydrogen sulfide generated from d-cysteine reduces disulfide bonds in receptors and potentiates their activity peptides made of d-amino acids resist not only normal proteolytic degradation but also resist an immune response unless attached to a carry protein 4446 they persist some 46 days in the body which is an ideal time period for pharmaceutical action and are ultimately degraded to safe products probably mainly in the peroxisomes and by enzymes in the kidneys 4446 the negative aspect is that they do have higher entropy to overcome than many drugs of more traditional form but in practice this appears to be more a barrier to computer simulation of binding than to the real molecule as extensively discussed belowstudying the binding of synthetic peptides or small organic molecules to human proteins benefits from computer simulations of the solute-solvent system and it was early found that these should ideally include water molecules in a detailed way because there are hydrogen bonding options between water molecules and amino acid residues which are not particularly intuitive 4748 in most cases the spatial locations of hydrogen atoms are deduced rather than seen in experimental protein and peptide three dimensional structures this is likely to impact considerations of docking ligands to protein targets in the present authors opinion this provides a beneficial possibility for retroinverso designs 3 made by reversing the sequence and using d-amino acids that has the unfortunate or complicating effect of interchanging the c

o and nh groups in the backbone of the synthetic peptide 3 the beneficial possibility is that for example a repulsive cooc electrostatic interaction between a synthetic peptide and the spike protein could be ameliorated in the manner cohoc where the h is a water serine or threonine hydrogen atom or by cohohoc albeit that in practice the water molecule likely lies more to the side of the oo interaction vector somewhat similar considerations apply to any nhhn interactions that can ameliorated by the lone pair orbitals of an oxygen atom both could also involve tautomerization andor rearrangement of internal hydrogen bonding networks eg in the manner  ohoh  to  hoho  today to take care of such matters researchers consider docking of ligand to protein and high grade molecular dynamics simulations of the overall solute-solvent system by molecular dynamics at least as the final refinement step 49 but even the awareness that the above compensations and others can take place can make it worthwhile to synthesize and test a proposal somewhat similarly design of peptide synthetic vaccines and diagnostics can make direct use of peptides duplicating sequence motifs in the pathogen protein found by bioinformatics and relatively simple computational tools after that researchers often go straight to synthesis and experimental immunological testing of the constructs rather than using complex simulations 50 51 52 epitope predictions for sars-cov-2 simply meaning the choice of amino acid residue subsequences to synthesize for synthetic vaccines but also for peptidomimetic antagonists have been made by several authors eg ref 53 they have typically made use of extensive historical experimental data about the amino acid residue sequences of epitopes such as the epitope database and analysis resource iedb and the virus pathogen resource vipr eg ref 53the immune system by its nature can make its own adjustments to recognize pathogens and vaccines but designing some kind of therapeutic antagonist against virus binding to the lung cells requires rather more consideration about what human protein the spike protein is binding bioinformatics as the study of biosequences is a powerful tool but it is well known that having the detailed three dimensional structure of the human protein target for a potential new pharmaceutical agent or to which a virus attaches is a great benefit to rational computer-aided design studies specifically investigating human protein binding and activation of previously known sars viruses have for some years been carried out by several groups eg refs 54 55 56 57 it seems reasonably well agreed that angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 ace2 is responsible for binding the sars associated with the 2002 outbreak combined with a proteolytic cleavage to activate the spike protein for which type ii transmembrane serine protease tmprss2 is the current popular candidate 3 several three dimensional structures are known for ace2 complexed with sars spike protein eg protein data bank pdb entry 6acg and of variants of the latter eg tmprss2 protein data bank entry 2oq5however the full story involving human cell surface proteins with which sars-cov-2 interacts in order to infect and replicate is possibly not quite as firmly established at the time of this present study as some summaries would suggest the origin of the general problem for a more detailed conformational chemistry approach is that diversity of genome and means of infecting cells are readily generated in nature in the case of different virus hosts virus strains and species jumps and it is long established that the binding shows variation in the receptors used that correspond to viral groups there have been alternative proposed candidates for initial binding receptors eg carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 ceacam1 and various dipeptidyl peptidases highly virulent coronaviruses that form syncytia between cells can even spread in a receptor-independent fashion even when an initial binding receptor such as ace2 is identified for a coronavirus initial uncertainty or enduring complexity for the rest of the entry process may be the norm many other human proteases present in the lung seem capable of cleaving various sites on the spike protein and which could cause its activation for example a variety of proteases such as trypsin tryptase clara mini-plasmin human airway trypsin-like protease hat and tmprss2 transmembrane protease serine 2 are known to cleave the glycoprotein hemagglutinin ha of influenza a viruses as prerequisite for the fusion between viral and host cell membranes and viral cell entry human airway trypsin like protease hat tmprss3 tmprss4 tmprss6 have also all been considered by sars researchers at various stages other human proteins that might have similar involvement to the above in the sars-cov-2 case and that are also affected by the same antagonists against the sars-cov-2 targets in the preceding paragraph have also attracted the attention of researchers the trypsin-like serine protease hepsin which has a fairly broad action and which is significantly inhibited by a diverse set of ligands a particular example of one such binding is represented by protein data bank entry 5ce1 even intracellular proteases could be released on cell damage resulting from the first wave of lung infection or from other disease or tissue trauma some variants and strains may use other as yet unknown proteins or sugars to assist entry it is also plausible the spike protein might be activated by other proteases on exit from the epithelial lung cells so allowing it efficiently to infect other cells the spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 also has the so-called furin cleavage sequence prrars or prrars which is an extension to the so-called pigag motif of ref 3 consistent with the present authors preferred choice of krsfiedllfnkv motif coronaviruses with high sequence homology such as that isolated from a bat in yunnan in 2013 lack the furin cleavage sequence nonetheless because furin proteases are abundant in the respiratory tract sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein might be cleaved on exit from cellseven if the means of binding activation and entry is well established for a viral strain recall that a single rna base difference resulting in a single amino acid residue difference could alter all that and there also appear to be several other possibilities that the virus can exploit in parallel indeed somewhat similarly potential inhibitors of sars entry andor activation proposed by researchers eg refs 58 59 60 may work by several routes in parallel and significantly at least three mechanisms were reported in one relevant study 60once a target protein and its relevant binding site are clearly understood methods are available for screening available ligands binding molecules to bind to those sites as potential antagonists or even for growing or evolving antagonist molecules in those sites whether smaller organic molecules 29 30 31 or peptides 32 pharmaceutical chemists have long used evidence and hunches to deduce a pharmacophore ie an abstract description of recurrent molecular features that are necessary for molecular recognition of the ligand by the protein 3 a pharmacophore ultimately implies at least a schematic model of the interfacial surface between ligand and protein but in practice a pharmacophore tends to be either considered from the perception of the ligand one compares similar inhibitors etc or from the perception of the binding site one compares positions of key residues in the binding site the choice depends on the quality of each kind of data but could involve both historically drug design was frequently based only on indirect deduction of binding site features using the chemical features of the ligands which successfully inhibit or in a few instances excite a response this is essentially the use of quantitative structure activity relationships qsar in effect the perception of the binding site was indirect and typically based on the chemists expertise and hunches and so often extremely fuzzy subsequent elucidation of many protein structures with clear pictures of their binding sites led to a crisper physical perspective exemplified by a study 49 that included many ligand molecules in the present investigation and so faced some similar issues in the approach which may now be considered traditional docking calculations are fast using grid maps that consist of a three dimensional lattice of regularly spaced points centered on some region of interest of the protein target under studyas discussed above ace2 and tmprss2 are very likely correct targets but again they are not necessarily the only targets even for cell entry of current sars-cov-2 and the mechanisms used by each new coronavirus strain can differ as the result of even a single amino acid residue change in such circumstances the conservation of the krsfiedllfnkv motif might be considered suspicious the activation cleavage is at the arginine r and workers tend to conclude that this site is more essential for action than s1s2 and mutation of the arginine r specifically inhibits trypsin-dependent fusion in both cellcell fusion and laboratory assays but also with the arginine retained many other proteases can active the spike protein as above and others can do so in laboratory conditions because of the conservation one might therefore hold the seemingly reasonable hypothesis that this site is not also susceptible to cleavage and activation by other extracellular proteolytic enzymes but also doing something else whether or not this is so all this complexity makes detailed interaction models of spike protein binding and activation difficult and while the best bet for ranking the choices of target protein may currently seem obvious making a reasonable currently conventional choice which is actually an incorrect assumption can delay productive research into therapeutic agents in the case of the hunt for prevention and cure of virus diseases and particularly covid-19 there seems to be increased justification for a fuzzier set-theoretic picture of a pharmacophore as an ensemble of different binding sites or of ligands in a ligand-oriented perspective as follows many of these and perhaps all suggest that even if one is using an incorrect picture of the mechanisms of entry and replication even using the wrong or less important protein target one might achieve some success in brief summary the justifications for the ensemble pharmacophore in the coronavirus case ie the contributions to fuzziness include parsimony that proteins and parts of proteins sometimes have more than one function 12 encouraged by limited numbers of accessible sites due to eg glycosylation and exemplified by parallel alternative mechanisms of cell entry multiple methods of drug action escape from scientific defense measures by virus mutation polymorphism of human proteins involved different expression levels of human proteins involved and the potential problem of the specter of vaccine development concerns about missing the appropriate region of the virus that allows common cold viruses to escape the appropriate immune response to the above may be of course added the fact that even if an experimental researcher is convinced of the value a specific protein as appropriate target the picture for the computational chemist is a fuzzy one the system itself real and simulated is to be seen as a statistical mechanical ensemble of multiple states sampled over the population of molecules and across their conformational behavior in time not least protein binding sites are often partially disordered before binding and in any case there may be several binding modes picking the right one can be difficult because there is a fine balance between solvent and conformational entropy and entropy is notoriously hard to compute 12given this argued uncertainty as to the nature of the target protein and its binding site a broader initial net as an ensemble pharmacophore can help docking approaches are continually being improved by researchers and recently include ways of combining features that could ultimately relate to different protein binding sites while many authors of these studies include the word ensemble in their discussion of pharmacophores they appeared to be significantly different to the particular means of combining multiple pharmacophores that was explored here however the present author has had his attention drawn to some that are rather similar and the approach of kumar 33 appears to particularly akin especially in regard to distributions of expected values and use of weighting kumars description 33 thus suffices and briefly stated it explores the ability of an ensemble of selected protein-ligand complexes to populate pharmacophore space in the ligand binding site assesses the importance of pharmacophore features using poisson statistical and information-theoretic entropy calculations and generates the pharmacophore models with high probabilities a scoring function then combines all the resultant high-scoring pharmacophore models there is one significant operational difference between kumars approach and that used here recall that in the more traditional docking approach it is the ligand as candidate drug that is typically seen as the variable and constantly changing and in many studies evolving the ligand chemistry with the pharmacophore is the basis of drug design 29 30 31 32 ref 49 related to the present study has aspects of that applied in a different way kumars approach can however combine the perspective of both pharmacophore and ligand as conceptual variables despite that the present authors approach as used in the present overall project considers one candidate ligand at a time this seems less efficient from the point of view of designing candidates and not even as smart as the older single non-probabilistic pharmacophore approaches 29 30 31 32 nonetheless a single simpler one-ligand-at-a-time strategy is both adequate and appropriate in the present case this is because there is already a data collection of candidate antagonists to build on 49 as discussed in section 17approaches of the ensemble pharmacophore kind are currently highly recommended for investigation of sars-cov-2 and for the spike protein in particular again because of some uncertainties and the likely multiple functions of some spike protein features however it has not as yet had significant impact in the present study the approach actually taken remains consistent in the sense that inclusion of one particular source for a pharmacophore an enzyme considered by the author was evidently going to dominate the ensemble because of certain similarities in the antagonists of sars virus entry and inhibitors of the enzyme 3 given the knowledge available at this time that choice is not however obvious as followswhat may be more controversial is the case when there is a representative choice and it is a protein that is not obviously relevant to the target protein or simply not on the radar of coronavirus researchers what makes it a candidate is not necessarily that it is relevant to viral infection and not necessarily that it has an evolutionary relationship to proteins that are considered relevant although this is a question addressed briefly in this paper rather it may simply be based on the pragmatic notion that there may be ligands potential binding molecules as antagonists which are common to both more popular choices human target proteins and a less obvious candidate the small organic molecule emodin has been found to inhibit sars coronavirus entry 5859 as also so have other compounds some of which have emodin-like features 360 similar molecules and importantly emodin itself are also inhibitors of 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 an example of a steroid binding enzyme 61 it is normally anchored within the endoplasmic reticulum through an n-terminal transmembrane domain its involvement as a protein target is here based on a chemical justification a biological justification might be that this enzyme is involved in the inflammation response which a coronavirus might also benefit by inhibiting if so the goal is not of course to help the virus by inhibiting at the same target which it would also gain by inhibiting but rather to inhibit protein targets more crucial to it ie for cell entry and possibly replication which are even more crucial to the virus some inhibition of 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 might even be a desirable thing because excessive or prolonged inflammation including in response to pathogens is well known to be potentially damaging to the host an excessive inappropriate immune response may also include the basis of allergic reactions and even of autoimmune diseasesa pragmatic reason for this choice of protein as pharmacophore is that was also one of those protein-ligand interaction systems that have been well studied by the present author and collaborators 49 such studies pursued the idea of using a more rigid molecular framework including the steroid framework and fragments of it as a more rigid scaffold for active drug groups 49 importantly that study and subsequent work has already established data base of compounds that bind to 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 and it includes many molecules including some discussed in this paper that again have some of the features of emodin it also includes many weak binders that could also be much stronger binders at what turns out to be a more obviously relevant protein target these issues can be addressed quickly in the laboratory and certainly seem worthy of investigation before addressing the more popular targetsthere was a further implication in the previous paper 3 though not a requirement for its main arguments that the peptides designed on the basis of the krsfiedllfnkv motif bind the same krsfiedllfnkv site as do emodin-like molecules that seems currently to be an even less reliable assumption than the assumption that the above steroid dehydrogenase enzyme is relevant to coronavirus biology and it is not of course an assumption that even matters if either a peptidomimetic andor small organic molecule is found effective however again keeping in mind that there are a limited number of accessible conserved sites in the spike protein and that these may be involved in multiple mechanisms as discussed above common targets for action of both peptides and smaller organics like emodin seems plausible partially the problem is extensive glycosylation it is well known that glycosylation plays an important role in receptor-ligand recognition but also have structural influence in receptor-ligand recognition because of its bulky shape caused by branched side chains for that and other reasons it may be that the krsfiedllfnkv site is with just a little variation almost the only site on the spike protein that is persistently recognizable in coronavirus strains and so presumably carrying out an important function and accessible as also discussed in this paper angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 binding is however also considered in this papera number of ideas and principles borrowed in established and recent design of synthetic vaccines and petidomimetics were used see ref 3 for discussion and eg ref 63 64 65 66 67 as well as some of the ideas that lie behind the popular zinc data base 68 as discussed in refs 34 the present investigation started as a use case for the hyperbolic dirac net hdn and particularly the associated q-uel language for automated inference 34 35 36 37 the theory has been discussed elsewhere eg in refs 34 35 36 37 which relate more to the practical and general uses of q-uel these considerations are less important here because present studies can be reproduced by standard bioinformatics and molecular modeling means nonetheless it is doubtful that the research for refs 34 could have been done and written up so rapidly without the aid of q-uel to interact with websites of the world wide web gather knowledge and facilitate use of the publically available bioinformatics tools 3the challenge is ultimately one of molecular recognition but in practice many key principles for hapten design relate to distinguishing types of naturally occurring epitope by the term epitope in this paper is meant continuous epitope though several smaller epitopes may be joined to represent a discontinuous epitope in which conformation and relative position in space can sometimes be important while a synthetic construct implies the use of synthetic chemistry typically combined with a judicious carrier protein to which the peptide is linked chemically constructs can also be obtained by cloning using protein engineering principles 12 the terms b-epitope and t-epitope relate to the traditional picture of a bone marrow b or thymus t response b cell epitopes occur at the surface of the protein against which an immune system response is required they are recognized by b cell receptors or antibodies in their native structure and are concerned with the bone marrow response and antibody production t epitopes may be buried inside protein structures and released by proteolysis and are traditionally considered as concerned with a cellular response and immune system memory ie active immunity continuous b cell epitope prediction is very similar to t cell epitope prediction the focus is on b-epitopes here though a b-epitope can also be or overlap with a t-epitope especially if it has a significant content of hydrophobic residues prediction of these has traditionally been based has mainly been based on the amino acid properties such as hydrophilicity charge exposed surface area and secondary structure there are many predictive algorithms available but the present author prefers a more expert system kind of approach that incudes experimental data though the above biophysical considerations certainly still play a strong role see belowthe previous paper 3 focused primarily on design of synthetic peptides as infection antagonists however partly for the reason of greater conformational flexibility discussed below smaller less flexible organic molecules ie with fewer rotatable bonds are the traditional province of the synthetic chemist rather than use of an automated peptide synthesizer are preferred for pharmaceutical application consideration of peptides is more often considered as merely a useful intermediate step in more traditional pharmaceutical compound design biodegradability per se of peptides is not the main concern since including d-amino acids in the design prevents proteolysis in preliminary docking and simulation studies the peptides do bind to 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 but less strongly and with several binding modes 3 this weaker binding is not in itself a contraindication of the idea that these peptides bind at the same site as the more rigid non-peptide molecules because it is an expected consequence of the much greater flexibility of peptides compared with molecules with for example multiple aromatic ring scaffolds conventional wisdom eg ref 12 frequently uses the rule-of-thumb that the total change in intramolecular bond rotational entropy of a peptide ligand is roughly tstotal  15 kcal mol1 per residue at 300 k corresponding approximately to a 12-fold reduction in conformational freedom per residue on binding because van der walls and hydrogen bonding tend to be very roughly equivalent for peptides in water and in well bound forms the water entropy effects known as hydrophobic effects along with electrostatic forces play an important role in determining the balance of energies and final outcome krsfiedllfnkv would thus cost about 195 kcalmol entropic contribution to bind rigidly primarily compensated by hydrophobic contacts at up to about 17 kcalmol in going from an aqueous to a non-polar environment ie 221 kcalmol for a 13 residue peptide or analogue of krsfiedllfnkv that example would not favor binding but the proper calculation is in the details which of should show balance that favors good binding if that is found to be the case experimentally despite the above comments the flexibility of peptides does provide more opportunities to fit a specific binding site ie they can show some accommodation and they are more tolerant to imperfections in the design process however this is also an argument for their importance as an intermediate step in the design of more conventional pharmaceutical agentsthe main methods are essentially standard bioinformatics approaches as used in ref 34 some methods eg rules for epitope prediction are best discussed in context in results section 4 the q-uel methods specifically for bioinformatics are discussed in ref 37 and those for computational chemistry and docking of compounds are those using krunch as described in ref 3 and the appendix to ref 49 they are somewhat unorthodox by focusing on heuristics to handle the multiple energy minimum problem but the end effect is probably similar to that of long runs using high grade molecular dynamics calculations given opportunities for calibration 49 epitope predictions lie in more traditional one dimensional bioinformatics and in this paper and the previous paper depended on predictions using a gor4 secondary structure prediction of -helix h extended chain or -sheet e and coil or loop c the reason for this and the particular use of gor4 is discussed in ref 3 but briefly it is in part because sections predicted by runs of c tend to be immunogenic even if they are incorrect as structure predictions 3 however charged residues in -helices and -sheets are believed to be occasionally b-epitopes and short sections extended chain can effectively imply loops the core and initial rules for b-epitope prediction used in the present study considerisurface exposure when a three dimension structure is known but allowing for conformational adjustment to expose residue when in a likely disordered or flexible loop scores 2iiknown exposure based on other kind experiment which also recognizes the possibility that a partially buried site by the above criteria can be brought to the surface on binding notably for proteolytic cleavage 3iiiruns of amino acid from the set stnqy score 1 from the set dekhr they score 2 and from the set livfcm they score 1ivruns of secondary structure prediction as coil or loop c though runs of three or less e and the first and last three of helix h can be considered as c for this purpose score 1 andvthe motif nxstx of asparagine n serine s or threonine t where x means not a proline p scores 2 however this will not permit a corresponding peptidomimetic or vaccine without considering glycopeptide synthesis technology see discussion below which would justify a negative score depending on the technology available
in addition these may be combined with predictions based on significant homology with proven epitopes in data bases which has already been done by several groups for sars-cov-19 eg ref 54for sources of data concerning covid-19 virus spike proteins genbank and the protein data bank were the main sources there was some use of in-house collections of data eg of typical b-epitopes and t-epitopes although publically available collections would probably serve the same function there was also use also of a data base of non-peptide ligand molecules of potential interest already generated during and since the work described in ref 49 that was used where appropriate many of these molecules including emodin are also found on the public zinc data base 69 as indicated in results section 4 below but several including derivatives of carbenoxelone are not and these derivatives are of interest as potential coronavirus antagonists to look up an entry on the zinc data base by the codes used in this and other papers one can go to httpzinc15dockingorgsubstancesand enter zinc00011032 in an automated approach such as that favored by q-uel a variable such as a perl variable mol to zinc00011032 and is set an the q-uel application goes to httpzinc15dockingorgsubstancessearchqmol any references to experimental binding results concern data from cited papers and see for example ref 68 for typical methods used for natural herbal compounds as discussed in ref 3 q-uel helped gather these in the form of q-uel knowledge representation tags so they become part of the growing knowledge representation storein regard to peptides and proteins table 1
used in ref 3 shows the standard iupac one-letter codes used for amino acid residues in sequences throughout this paperconservative replacements are those common substitutions from a peptide design perspective but for example phenylalanine f isoleucine i and alanine a are seen as natural substitutions that appear in discussion of spike protein sequence motifs later below these amino acid residues have hydrophobic sidechains but they are not conservative replacements but rather substantially different size a reasonable explanation is of course that sidechain size conservation matters less when the sidechains are at exposed at the surface of the protein similar notions underlie the idea that what can readily replace what is not always an equal probability in each direction in that respect table 1 tends to reflect the changes that are used in the present project for design when starting from epitopesthe previous paper 3 should not give the impression that the specific motifs discussed and particularly krsfiedllfnkv are the only sections likely of the sars-cov-2 spike protein to be of interest in the above respect the preference for one choice was based on a conservation across many strains suggesting that the site has an important function and is likely at the spike surface and b avoiding the shielding of the spike protein by extensive glycosylation the dramatic effect of relaxing these restrictions is a major point of this section in which a large number of candidates are found over-prediction is not necessarily a bad thing because once a laboratory has a peptide synthesizer and other tools for constructing and testing designs it is relatively easy and cheap to test and reject ideas and more problematic to miss opportunities the intention here is also to cover most possibilities to enable index numbers to be assigned to them according to their order in the sequence putative epitope 1 etc consequently in future one may then readily refer to the index number or speak of a new proposal or experimental epitope extending overlapping or even lying between two of these epitopes they are primarily to be seen as b-epitope predictions though they are favored if some t-epitopic character is also expectedan initial step is based on adding up weights as described in methods section 32 in practice there was also some judicious use of expertise and an epitope data base in an attempt to refine assignments recall that the trimeric sars coronavirus sars-cov spike glycoprotein consists of three s1s2 heterodimers some of these will be shielded by that configuration during most of the life cycle of the virus but not necessarily in every s protein monomer and also shielded by glycosylation the higher scoring predicted epitopes in the sequence below are underlined and in bold and are primarily to be considered as b-epitopes but with some extension to include t-epitope character where possible also included in these predictions are those using the immune epitope database and analysis resource iedb and the virus pathogen resource vipr which have already been made 54 see later below these are shown in underlined bold and in italics in the following and since some are contiguous sections that look like a single long representation in the following they are also stated separately below it is apparent that while focus was on just krsfiedllfnkv if strain variation and glycosylation are ignored then much of the spike protein sequence contains epitope candidates
many of the epitopes predicted in the present study overlap with prediction made using the immune epitope database and analysis resource iedb and the virus pathogen resource vipr 54 and these comprised the following1davdcaldplsetkctlks ftvekgiyqtsn2vcgpkkstnlvknkcvnfnfngltgtgvltesnkkflpfqqfgrdiadttdavrdp3qtleilditpcsfggvsvigtntsnqvavlyqdvnctevpvaihadqltptwrvystgs4fsqilpdpskpskrsfie5fgagaalqipfamqmayrfngi
recall that one of the reasons for the original single preferred candidate krsfiedllfnkv was that many of predicted epitopes contain evidence of glycosylation reflecting the last of the rules v in methods section 31 above that rule has however a special status and the present author has tended to consider them undesirable for synthetic vaccine or diagnostic development it indicates likely glycosylation of the protein the bulky oligosaccharides so attached can be immunogenic but they are rather difficult to work with synthetically traditionally expected to make bulk production expensive and may be variable in structure which cannot typically be seen in detail in experimental three dimensional protein structures typically as obtained by x-ray crystallography or high grade electron microscopy antibodies that are raised against the glycosylated surface patch of the protein or corresponding synthetic glycopeptides may be specific for their carbohydrate units these can be recognized irrespective of the peptides or in the context of the adjacent amino acid residues conformation and exposure of b-peptide epitopes of glycoproteins may be modulated by glycosylation because of intramolecular carbohydrate-protein interactions the beneficial versus undesirable effects of glycosylation in synthetic vaccines is also a complex matter glycosylation may be essential for reactivity with the antibody but conversely it may in effect inactivate the capabilities of a section of amino acid sequence to function as a b-epitope which seems to be a very good reason for giving the glycosylation motif a strong negative rather than positive score unfortunately this will depend on the structure of the antigenic site and antibody fine specificity and the recognition mechanisms involved are not fully clear there is a usually positive aspect however in the current view that similar effects of glycosylation apply to t-cell-dependent cellular immune and igg antibody responses and that glycosylated peptides can elicit glycopeptide-specific t cell clones after being bound and presented by mhc class i or ii molecules it is of course only a positive aspect if the intended effect is obtained by the synthetic constructthe overall spike glycoprotein protein sequence shown above changes across the coronaviruses but the krsfiedllfnkv subsequence is most notable amongst the exceptions it extends to the common cold coronaviruses with minor variation and may imply a better targeted approach to stimulate immunity for common colds caused by the rhinovirus recent research suggests misdirection of antibody responses against a non-protective epitope as a mechanism how the virus escapes immunity and so permits recurrent infections 71 a clearer understanding of conserved subsequences in coronaviruses may also help tune the action of toll-like receptors to initiate the appropriate response these are a class of proteins that play a key role in the innate immune system they are single-pass membrane-spanning receptors usually expressed on sentinel cells eg macrophages and dendritic cells that recognize structurally conserved molecular features of pathogens 72despite concerns about two or more strains of covid-19 virus appearing these are not big changes for present purposes it is sufficient to consider the sequence of the original wuhan isolate as reference in comparisons for present purposes ie for comparing the spike protein sequences of other coronaviruses recall that as discussed in introduction section 13 at the time of the study in late february and early march 2020 the sequences of the spike proteins of covid-19 isolates from different states and countries such as california brazil taiwan and india remain identical or almost so for example with respect to the original wuhan isolate 2 phenylalanine f is replaced by cysteine c as residue 797 in a swedish isolate and alanine a is replaced by valine v as residue 990 in an indian isolate neither of these relate to the sequence motif krsfiedllfnkv of particular interest herein the initial studies 34 the genome of the common cold coronavirus and particularly the sequence of the spike protein was considered sufficiently far from that of the covid-19 virus so as to be less relevant to that problem while looking at differing sequences is essential for detection of conserved motifs very different and less relevant pathogens are unlikely to preserve them except perhaps as pattern matches involving quite complex substitution rules however the appearance of the covid-19 krsfiedllfnkv motif does appear in common cold coronaviruses and with typically at most two relatively conservative substitutions that is in the sense of preserving hydrophobic sidechain as discussed above in methods section 3 the conservative aspartate d and asparagine n replacement is also fairly common in the motif in the sequences examined an example shown below is a clustal omega alignment of the covid-19 virus spike protein original wuhan seafood market isolate genbank entry mn9089473 with spike proteins representatives members of the two major common cold coronaviruses strains 229e and oc43 genbank entries np0735511 and aiv419871 despite radical sequence differences for the spike protein sequences overall only 128 identity well within the range for a random match the underlined sequence motif krsfiedllfnkv of covid-19 virus is essentially retained as that sequence except that alanine a replaces phenylalanine f in the common cold coronavirus which is moderately conservative at the surface of a protein and a conservative leucine for valine substation in one case in the sequence not shown of hcov-hku1 which is often associated with more serious cases of cold-like diseases the above motif is still noticeable as rsffedllfdkv in which the isoleucine i is replaced by phenylalanine f the a for f modified motif rsaiedllfdkv is also found in the coronaviruses of dogs cats rodents pigs rabbits camels ferret badgers raccoon dogs amongst others all of these might be eaten by humans in certain countries and notably they are for the most part species that live in close proximity to humans
the pigag motif does not show up in the above alignment as is also the case in many other distantly related coronaviruses 34 however there is a subsequence pigtnyrscestt in the hcov-hku1 spike protein that appears to relate to pigagicasyqtq in the covid-19 virus recall that hcov-hku1 is a common cold virus albeit usually associated with more severe lower respiratory tract cases in contrast not only does the krsfiedllfnkv motif stand out as potentially important to the covid-9 virus by virtue of such comparisons but also a match with that motif is almost the only continuous stretch of amino acid residues in most alignments like that above the subsequence kwpwyiwl is an exception that is of interest and a characteristic feature of many sars coronaviruses it is not however considered further in the present paper except to note that it does not appear to be associated with a covid-19 virus spike protein proteolytic cleavage site these sites are most prominently
as one looks out to more distant relatives there are a number of variations in the krsfiedllfnkv motif which despite large variations in spike protein sequence as a whole are still recognizable in the spike proteins of coronaviruses of diverse various host species as shown for some examples in table 2
 the most noticeable variation is the occasional substitution of the cleavage point arginine r by a g rather than disrupt the possibility of cleavage however it is seemingly displacing that role to a arginine r or lysine k that lies to the n-terminal left side of the motif it is interesting that this commonly retains firmly the iedllf core of the motifthe notion that the krsfiedllfnkv motif overall plays an important role and presumably a common or similar function across at least a very large number of known coronaviruses still seems a reasonable one most important of course is that it is at least the case for the sars-cov-19 virus and its near relatives at this time no match with a coronavirus in genebank has been detected by the author by blast-p using queries with no phenylalanine f eg rsaiedllldkv rsaiedllidkv rsaiedlladkv rsaiedllmdkv rsaiedllwdkv and rsaiedllydkv as queries but the search has not been exhaustive because it would not be too contradictory to any of the current hypotheses if some were found in the group with the inserted glycine g replacement of initial argine r by the similar positively charged lysine k is common however as long as the motif is significantly recognizable no histidine h as opposed to initial arginine r has been foundthe motif cannot extend to other strains indefinitely as recognizable because at some point the evolutionary tree will bring up virus and hosts subject to quite different selective pressures and the motif is not the definition of coronaviruses however it still persists as recognizable in birds such as duck eg genbank kx266757 kc119407 white-eye bird cov hku nc016991 magpie-robin shama cov hku18 nc016993 strains a selction which spans a large range of coronavirus genome sizes see the alignments below compared with the wuhan seafood market isolate genbank mn9089473 showing the motif underlined and in bold
some indication of the limit of the survival of the motif rsfiedllfnkv as the researcher departs from sars-cov-19 might be given by the nidoviruses other than coronaviruses somewhat coronavirus-like nidoviruses are common as eg reptile viruses the order nidovirales contains enveloped positive-strand rna viruses with the largest known rna genomes nidoviruses have been identified in snakes they appear to be most closely related to coronavirus subfamily torovirinae and might be best represented as a genus in this subfamily sequences suggestive of rsfiedllfnkv eg knfidlllagf do occur in genomes such as the ball python genome but these really lie beyond the limit of serious detection for example clustal omega gives 18 exact match between the wuhan isolate and spike protein nidovirus 1 of the reptile shingleback but the motif is barely recognizable
including fish nidovirus of the pacific salmon genbank qeg082391 is notable here because it supports the above alignment because it is preserved but gtlywldy of the salmon nidovirus is far from krsfiedl and the nearest preceding plausible cleavage point is an arginine r 10 residues in the n-terminal direction to the left however a similar occurs in some mammalian coronaviruses and so that residue may still play a similar role as an activation cleavage
looking for similar motifs in human proteins has a somewhat different motive it makes sense in that if there is significant match with subsequences they might represent features of proteins to which both the spike protein and other human proteins may bind irrespective of any other justification for commonality even if coincidental as epitopes similar to those in a proposed synthetic vaccine they are always of possible interest in assessing the risk of cross-reaction and inducing autoimmunity in synthetic vaccine designs and on certain occasion with peptidomimetics that induce an immune response perhaps by a binding strongly to a human protein that the designer did not intend as discussed in ref 3 there is a motif match at 56 identity with 77 coverage is with tumor protein d55 isoform 2 homo sapiens id np0010018742 and similarly with tumor protein d52-like 3 homo sapiens id aah337921 next match is in regard to neprilsyn entries at only 56 match and 55 coverage none of these are sufficient close of concern regarding induction of an autoimmune response some fairly close matches of krsfiedllfnkv and of the a for f modified motif rsaiedllfdkv have come to light that might plausibly have a biological significance if supported by biological relevance but are more likely to be random matches selecting only for human proteins hits vary from 100 cover with 50 identity to 62 cover with 92 identity these hits cannot be considered significant for peptides of this length in isolation from other evidence however a few seem worth recording for future reference in regard a potential biological function for the virus as already noted 3 rrsfidelafgrg a section of a human semaphorin genbank np0012432761 produced in response to lung disorders running rsaiedllfdkv itself in blastp generates 100 coronavirus hits rnareellfd is found in human mhc class ii antigen genbank axn555881 rnareellfd is found in human immunoglobulin heavy chain junction region genbank mcg496331 dllfekv is found in human tubulin gamma complex associated protein 6 isoform crad genbank eaw735101 e3 is of interest with 75 identity 87 matches for sfleellfin khksfleellf in ubiquitin the cellular e3 ubiquitin ligase ring-finger and chy zinc-finger domain-containing 1 rchy1 have been identified as interacting partners of the viral sars-unique domain sud and papain-like protease plpro with the involvement of cellular p53 as antagonist of coronaviral replication down-regulation of p53 is a major player in antiviral innate immunity 72 again however these matches remain tenuous genbank has of the order of 02 billion nucleic acid sequences but a 13 residue peptide can have 81920000 billion sequenceswhile the krsfiedllfnkv motif remains favored by the author as a target at this time identifying the amino acid residues in ace2 and the spike protein is important it may for example involve conserved residues that are not together in a continuous sequence while a conserved run of amino acid residues is sufficient to be on the list of candidates for an important site important sites are not necessarily conserved runs of amino acid residues here is shown that there is some conservation but significant variation compared with rsfiedllfnkv subsequences rsfiedllfnkv and pigagicasy  r discussed in ref 3 as motifs associated with activation cleavage sites do not lie in the receptor ace2 binding domain of the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein the relationships between the whole spike protein and the receptor binding domains in pdb entries 6m17 and pdb 6vw1 are shown in the alignment below note that the above receptor binding domain precedes the above motifs in the sequence a three dimensional perspective is required for an appreciation of the important sequence features in fig 2
 the pdb 6vw1 binding domain is on the right bound to ace2 on the leftof course not all the receptor binding domain is interacting intimately with ace2 the sections of the receptor binding domain that do interact with ace2 are also shown underlined to facilitate deeper analysis the loops on the spike protein receptor binding domain were initially classified as loops abcde and f in order of visual perspective then joined into three subsequences 1 2 3 that contain these loops the part of the spike glycoprotein sequence that represents the receptor ace2 binding domain can be shown by considering the proteins used in the two structural determinations 6m17 and 6vw1 in the protein data bank shown below in an alignment made using clustal omega alignment note that the above receptor binding domain precedes the above motifs in the sequence
the amino acids residues in bold and underlined font are the subsequences of ace2 that interact with the above spike protein ace2 binding domain loops which are indicated above each subsequence these include some longer range electrostatic interactions and potential solvent effects those also in italics dkfnheaedlfy

dkfnheaedlfy and kgdfr have particularly strong interactions
as a reference perspective the full sequence for ace2 as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 isoform x1 homo sapiens genbank entry xp0115438511 is as follows the part in the three dimensional structure above is in bold underlined font
note that at least in these particular experimental structures there is an involvement of glycosylation-like molecules for example in 6vw1 there are well localized n-acetyl-d-glucosamine -d-mannose and 12-ethanediol molecules that make significant interactions in a glue-like manner and essentially glue around the edges however there no obvious indication of involvement of glycosylation in the main interior interaction face of the complex the intimate interactions are protein-protein ie between amino acid residuesprimarily but not solely ace2 and spike glycoprotein association involves interaction between the bent -helix residues 1954 stiee  nyntn of ace2 and an extended chain configuration effectively a stretched loop that runs from residue 485500 gfncy  ygqpt of the spike glycoprotein and involves or ends in loops 3a 3b and 3f in the case of ace2 interacting with the ace2 binding domain of the spike glycoprotein one could in principle imagine blocking the ace2 as receptor with a mimic of the spike protein surface or blocking the receptor binding site of the spike glycoprotein protein with a mimic of the ace2 receptor surface in other kinds of infection the former is usually considered more plausible but the latter would not interfere with normal function of ace2 and it is of course essentially the way in which immune system and notably antibodies work possibly the main argument against this second choice it is that it is essentially equivalent to using antibodies raised against the spike protein ie in effect passive immunization 
at the time of final writing various news articles are drawing attention to potential use of the upper sequence or parts of it which is that of the -helix of ace2 for example httpsscitechdailycommit-chemists-have-developed-a-peptide-that-could-block-covid-19 in the above alignment the helix contains 35 residues and the extended chain below contains 16 they have similar length as is as expected for such structures an -helix has a rise of 15  per residue along its axis and there are in typical protein helices with turn variations that imply up to 20  the -strand or a similar extended chain in the spike glycoprotein that interacts with it has a rise of circa 35  per residue this general geometry naturally puts the two sequences above in roughly the one-to-one spatial correspondence shown note that this is not intended to be a sequence match representation these chains have to interact in that respect there is a lack of charged residues acidic and basic sidechains in the extended chain of the spike glycoprotein in structure 6vw1 although an aspartic acid d replaces the serine s in some strains arginine r replaces asparagine n in others and so on eg see blastp alignments later below a detailed backbone view is confusingly cluttered but one may identify residues that interact at the boundary between ace2 and spike protein all sidechains in the above spike protein subsequence gfncyfplqsygfqpt either make close contact or are likely to have some influence at the interface it is perhaps useful to have the initial mental picture that very roughly speaking the planes of the peptide groups are tangential to the above -helix surface rather than constituting an extended chain that makes an edge-on approach as even fig 2 suffice to makes clear however the extended chain like any so-called extended chain in proteins in practice is essentially a visible helix of larger pitch resembling a very stretched-out -helix and is itself slightly supercoiled to wrap around the ace2 -helix in this case this tends to follow the elbow or bend in the -helix staying roughly parallel to the local axis of the -helix so as to make intimate contact overallif gfncyfplqsygfqpt is to be use as an epitope analogue the cysteine c may be tested as a convenient linker to a carrier protein otherwise replaced by serine s as a close analogue as far as peptide antagonists are concerned the difficulty with using the above sequences stiee  and gfncy  is that they are readily degraded by host proteases this would not occur if the peptide is made entirely of d-amino-acid restudies a retro-inverso peptide 346 is made up of d-amino acids in a reversed sequence to the subsequence which is seeks to mimic and in the extended conformation assumes a side chain topology similar to that of the original native peptide but with backbone nh and carbonyl co groups interchangednh3-dextro-nwsalssqyfldeaehnfkdlftkaqeeits -coo

these are peptidomimetics of the subsequences sequences stiee  in ace2 and gfncy   in the spike glycoprotein respectively the cysteine c in  cnfg in the second molecule may be a convenient linker for an epitope for a vaccine but should be replaced by serine s in an antagonist recall that the problem of having the backbone amide nh and carbonyl co groups interchanged is that if in the original section of backbone being mimicked any nh and co groups form a hydrogen bond with recipient and donor groups in the protein those hydrogen bonds are now disrupted in the intended competitive antagonsist eg they would be unstable nhhn or cooc interactions it would thus seem a significant advantage in using the ace2 mimic because that is essentially an -helix which uses up its backbone amide and carbonyl groups however retro-inverso -helices are not typically found in the areas that have shown some degree of success 47 such as antigenic mimicry it would nonetheless seem to be of value to test both of the retro-inverso peptides in laboratory studiesas to developing the above further both as the basis of a synthetic vaccine or as a peptidomimetic and as to the worth of extending the studies to small organic drug molecules everything in the above depends on the extent to which gfncyfplqsygfqpt can produce escape mutations which might soon rend such solutions useless as in the previous paper we can relate this to variations of the above sequence bother in closer and much more distant relatives as the following shows using blastp we do not have to go very far from sars-cov-2 to find matches with only part of this sequence coverage and differences within that area of partial matchin the original wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate wuhan-hu-1 genbank id mn9089473 the subsequence in this regions is fncyfplqsygf and the following are examples of coverage as found by blastp
the last of the above blastp at httpsblastncbinlmnihgovblastcgi match results differs in total alignment by clustal omega at httpswwwebiacuktoolsmsaclustalo as follows but of course this illustrates the high degree of variation that occurs as one proceeds on to coronaviruses less related to the wuhan seafood market isolate that is believed to be associated with the origin of covid-19
for completeness note that the alignment obtained in the region that blastp indicated is as follows
phenylalanine f commonly immediately precedes many of these matching subsequences ncyfp ncywp etc and the conservative substitution tryptophan w substitution for the second phenylalanine f is also very common so it may be worth noting that fnctwp is a subsequence in the mammalian vomeronasal type-2 receptor 1 on sensory cells within the main nasal chamber that detects heavy moisture-borne odor particles and fnctwp is also found in in dynein many viruses require the minus-enddirected dynein motor complex transport on microtubules from cell surface toward the nucleus and dynein in addition to kinesins for the transport toward the plasma membrane however a direct connection to viral infection while tempting is far from obvious as to any mechanistic or evolutionary explanation also dynein nuclear shuttle transport may be less relevant to the coronavirus an rna virus but certainly rna viruses can rely on the dynein system eg hanta virus uses it for endoplasmic reticulum-golgi intermediate compartment at very least the above illustrates the kinds of further perhaps immediately less obvious functions that the above ace2 binding domain of the spike glycoprotein and the above motif might havewithin the coronaviruses there is some degree of conservation that suggests that ncywplndygf is a segment for the virus to conserve and a hint that fnctwpgf is the key part but there are soon very clearly significant variations across coronaviruses of different hosts as we depart from the wuhan seafood market isolate compared with the rsfiedllfnkv motif in the s2 cleavage regions 3 small organic drugs design to mimic this section or simply designed to designed to antagonize ace2 binding are thus potentially susceptible to escape mutations ie rapid appearance of drug resistance11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 which is inhibited by emodin was an interim model pharmacophore of choice 3 at this point in the development of the argument for optimal targets for vaccines and therapeutic antagonists the above target fits in as follows while the above regarding ace2 binding must be kept in mind for antagonist development as noted above the motif is not well conserved and so could be prone to development of escape mutations ie acquired resistance to vaccines and therapeutic antagonists because of the dominant theme of an ace2 -helix interacting with an extended chain loop of the spike glycoprotein the structure of the interaction region is fairly easy to deduce for various sars strains and there was as yet no obvious strongly recurrent theme of significant conserved residues that are discontinuous ie not together in the same subsequence that could be interacting closely with ace2 at the same time while emodin appears to act at the ace2 binding site 58 it remains of interest because there are complexities 5960 as discussed in introduction section 16 notably the ace2 binding domain of the spike protein and the binding sequence discussed above might bind other human proteins and might have other functions that emodin and related compounds related in the sense that they are at least consistent with pharmacophore features might inhibit a priori the binding properties of emodin and the choice of 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 as model pharmacophore could equally relate to the rsfiedllfnkv site or some other site or a mix of several the case for interaction vomeronasal type-2 receptor 1 and dynein discussed above was at best marginal but these examples illustrated the diversity other kinds of functions important to the virus that might apply in any event any relations between emodin and similar and potentially related molecules remains of interest to impeding sars-cov-2 entry and the worse casualty would be the continuity of the story developed above which is intended to illustrate a flow of reasoning in using the standard tools of bioinformatics11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 is interesting as accommodating a great variety of ligands at the steroid binding site but not without a degree of specificity as to general features of the ligands and so far these resemble those of potential sars-cov-2 therapeutics keeping in mind the refutation principle 3 that a pharmacophore or contribution to a pharmacophore ensemble the dehydrogenase is worthy of use until a new ligand or other information proves otherwise so far pharmacophore validation here ie a demonstration that it is a suitable pharmacophore model until proven otherwise has been based circumstantially on emodin and compounds looking chemically similar to it that are known in practice or argued theoretically to interact with sars virus entry in some way and bind at least weakly experimentally or computationally to 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 3 a review of compounds that are known experimentally to inhibit the dehydrogenase and known experimentally inhibit coronavirus entry replication and maturation is being prepared however validation is also extensively based on a weaker but larger body of preliminary binding studies involving a variety of antagonists of coronavirus infection and very often other kinds of virus infection that also bind at least very weakly to the dehydrogenase see discussion on very weakly below most of these emodin-like and otherwise were first found by q-uel knowledge gathering tools as used in the initial coronavirus study 3 combined with very early candidate selection rules based on estimates of the mean binding strength of groups when binding well note that a hydrogen bond worth about 4 kcalmol is nonetheless effectively zero when binding well because it is relative to binding to water in contrast aromatic and large aliphatic and are worth circa 3 kcalmol due to hydrophobic interactions which depend on being considered relative to water there are more complex electrostatic and intramolecular entropic considerations beyond present scope noting that at least preliminary study of the interaction with 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 is the arbitrator weak and very weak candidates are also considered because there may be multiple binding modes that will take a great deal of computer time to explore but which could yield lower binding fre energiesthis produces a fairly mixed bag of compounds based on the argument that viruses and coronavirus in particular may use each of its limited number of exposed or exposable sites for several purposes and the coronavirus seems to be able to readily adjust to new mechanisms under the selective pressure of drugs and vaccines the details of these molecules and studies are the subject of a further paper that will also discuss some interesting unifying themes briefly they include many names as hoped-for drugs against the coronavirus that appear in the news and internet discussion it is convenient to see them as dividing into three classesiquinone-like a quinone is any of a class of aromatic compounds having two carbonyl or ketone co functional groups in the same six-membered ring though in quinone-like the author includes include many compounds resembling steroid fragments that may have many or just one carbonyl groups and several rings this group includes 910-anthraquinone and derivatives that relate to many important drugs some with suggestive laxative and antiinflammatory functions collectively called anthracenediones they include ubiquinone as coenzyme q and various shorter aliphatic chain forms hydroxyl-decyl-ubiquinone and shorter aliphatic chain forms laxatives such as dantron emodin and aloe emodin and some of the senna glycosides antimalarials such as rufigallol antineoplastics used in the treatment of cancer such as mitoxantrone pixantrone and the anthracyclines caution is reuired in reading this list as a list of potential therapeutics because anthraquinone derivatives rhein aloe emodin or anthrone that lacks the methyl group parietin physcion to some extent emodin itself and chrysophanol extracted from cassia occidentalis are toxic and known to cause hepatomyoencephalopathy in children it is a medical term effectively defined to cover lethargy jaundice and altered senses of children in india after consumption of cassia seedsiisteroid-like this group includes some plant steroid-like compounds such as carbenoxolone itself from liquorish licorice and others found in soy and sprouts17-estradiol the endogenous ligand responsible for the growth and development of many tissues diethylstilbestrol a synthetic estrogen 7-methyl-benzaanthracene-39-diol a possible natural product from a common polyaromatic hydrocarbon is also of interest this group resembles group i but the concern for this group ii is that molecules like emodin that are known to antagonize viral or other infections are generally smaller so it possible that a more relevant pharmacophore would sterically exclude a large steroid-like ringiiiquinine-like these should not be confused with quinone-like quinine is an alkaloid derived from cinchona bark used to treat malaria and as an ingredient of tonic water a common feature is nonetheless the abundance of aromatic and other rings that in the quinine-like case include nitrogen so variously resembling pyrimidines purines histidine and tryptophan this group is of current considerable interest as potential thereputics for covid-19 of particular interest are chloroquine theophylline tavipiravir baloxavir marboxil some ace and ace2 inhibitors can be classified in this group they are weak but not very weak binders as discussed later below camostat a serine protease inhibitor that has been considered as a potential therapeutic for covi-19 is convenient to place in this class because of its analogues but it does not itself include a nitrogen atom within a ring
there are several possible intriguing biological connections that will be discussed elsewhere one might be briefly mentioned when considering combined therapeutic use of a member of each set ubiquinone-like compounds can inhibit ubiquinone sites that work in concert with nadh and nadph cofactor sites the latter in turn are often inhibited by the quinine-like membersmany other above compounds generally bind very weakly though steroid-like compounds are strong binders and many quinine-like compounds are medium binders these are discussed below binding strength is of course a matter of degree rt where r is the gas constant and t the absolute temperature is 0593 at 298 k ie circa 06 at biological temperatures so 1 kcalmol is not significant above thermal noise free energies of 2 3 4 and 5 correspond to binding association constants of 5 148 786 and 4160 the above free energies are usually expressed as negative for the perspective from the associated system considering that absolute values are much less reliable than relative values in this field one might conservatively consider a binding energy of 35 kcalmol as worthy justification for keeping a compound on a list if one does not wish to reject prematurely and this seems reasonable if one still has in mind the refutation principle this includes the mental picture that a model pharmacophore such as 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 has a fairly large cavity which does not provide strong steric inhibition to the candidate ligands but new evidence might show that a large ligand such as a steroid might be too big to fit the real target which the experimental data is describing in other words deficiencies in the pharmacophore model will start to show up when considering larger potential drugsthere is also the benefit of using 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 as model pharmacophore that the present author has a data base of experimental and computational studies on compounds that bind to it it should be stated nonetheless that any case for any common evolutionary relationship between this dehydrogenase and the spike protein binding receptor ace2 would be at best marginal 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 has 292 residues and ace2 has 613 there is a 24 identity match of amino acid residues in the region of best possible match of the dehydrogenase there is also further 19 conservative substitution clustal  ie conservation between groups of strongly similar properties with a score greater than 05 on the pam 250 matrix if taken alone this would provide some basis for further exploring a relationship admittedly the conventional rule of thumb is that any two sequences are considered homologous if they are more than 30 exact amino acid residue matches and strictly speaking this should apply over their entire lengths this is discussed in chapter 8 of ref 12 and a brief review of standard tools is given in refs 237 nonetheless caution is required because the 30 exact match criterion is well known to miss many easily detected homologs and 1520 is sometime found supported by evidence of evolutionary and functional relationship for example alignments between common cold and sars-cov-2 spike proteins already discussed above are in this range but there is every good reason to believe a common ancestry there is an overall conformational similarity and essential features of some sequence motifs are preserved there is some sense of comparable fold motifs with ace2 comprising two 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 folds the dehydrogenase is a bundle of some 12 well defined roughly parallel and antiparallel -helices of up to about 30 residues interspersed by 7 short -pleated sheet strands ace2 has some 20 well defined predominantly and very roughly parallel and antiparallel -helices of up to about 30 residues interspersed by 6 short -pleated sheet strands if there is a common evolutionary origin of 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 and ace2 domains it is distant but it remains marginally possible and more extensive conformational analysis is underwaythere is even less evidence of homology between 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 and tmprss2 although a serine residue is highly conserved in the catalytic site in both cases which arguably makes it worthy of some initial exploration tmprss2 comprises distinct cystine rich scavenger domain residues 150242 and a serine protease domain residues 255484 clustal o124 multiple sequence alignment gives an exact match of amino acid of only 175 there are some grounds for further investigation in the future there is also further 175 conservative substitution clustal  see above for tmprss2 there are some suggestive short section matches in same order of appearance eg aqyyys with ayyyys vvshc with vvshc lyhsd with lfhdd and gilrqs with galrqe which by some arguments slightly increase statistical significance no significant conformational homology is apparent so it is even more likely to be a chance match and any argument for similarity between the proteins would be on the basis of some kind of convergent evolution based on certain common ligands recalling again that the coronavirus might benefit from inhibiting an inflammatory responsepreliminary studies on the panel of ligands discussed below suggest some degree of binding 45 kcalmol and better ie more negative to both the above and 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 but these studies are still not fully complete and low energies may yet be obtained the most substantial data base of results that can reasonably be considered final is in large part from the original studies 49 there carbenoxolone was automatically evolved by automatic editing of its chemical structure under the combined selective pressure of improve binding to 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 while avoiding significant match with compounds covered by all us patents 49 and subsequent docking and high grade molecular dynamic simulations were carried out on ibms blue gene 49 many subsequent studies have however been carried out on using krunch on a personal computer because in the initial study it predicted well the blue gene results providing that the krunch binding energies obtained were corrected or refined to fit the blue gene results by a linear regression formula 49recall again that it is on the basis of similarities between some compounds that antagonize sars virus entry and bind the steroid dehydrogenase plus a notable commonality in the case of emodin ie it binds both that this model pharmacophore was chosen since emodin and many other compounds of interest contain two or three or more aromatic rings it is reasonable at least as an initial tactic that one may regard them as pieces of the steroid ring system and start them in the steroid binding cavity in the same plane as the steroid ring in such a case involving minor variations as sidechains on the original steroid core the way to make initial fit to using carbenoxolone as guide is obvious however the flat view of a steroid is misleading the steroid ring system can buckle in various cis-trans combinations of bonds in the rings and the longer sidechain conformations preferred on the basis of intramolecular energy are perhaps not obvious although the rotation barriers for most of the transitions are clearly above the thermal energy kt energy conformations 06 kcalmol the associated energy demands for buckling of parts of the steroid ring system of variously and roughly 2550 kcalmol are less that the ligand-receptor binding the associated energy demands are below the gain in energy from ligand-receptor binding to the protein target this is shown in the high grade quantum mechanical hartree-fock gamess calculations on blue gene in the original study 49 but which have not been described in the literature minimized energy conformers of steroid-like compounds considered are shown in fig 3
such calculations in vacuo are less reliable for the charged species but one may obtain a qualitative assessment from relative values and comparative uncharged species these compounds are also shown more clearly from the chemists perspective in two dimensional formula format later below fig 4
shows one of early analogues of carbenoxolone the thioketone derivative cbos1 discussed later below in the 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 steroid binding site the particular interest in this compound is as follows since in the original study 49 krunch judged this as the strongest binder at 168 kcalmol this compound was frequently used as a starting template for initial docking configurations when using krunch this is even though a it is probably an unlikely choice for a chemist to use in practice because of likely oligimerization of the thioketone groups and even though b corphos also known as cortisol 21-phosphate cortisol phosphate hydrocortisone-21-phosphate or 21-hydrocortisonephosphoric acid was the strongest at 168 kcal mol when using instead the amber force field for molecular dynamics on ibms blue gene 49 the thioketone still retained a reasonable binding energy of 163 kcalmol in the latter study however ie effectively the same binding strength within the state of the art fig 4 does not of itself give details any ligand-protein interactions but see discussion in ref 349 although it does illustrate the tightest of fit that is except to the lower right of the thioketone ring of the ligand which does appear to relate to genuine opportunities for additional groups to be added to carbenoxolone at that positioncarbenoxolone and initial closely related derivatives derived in that study 49 are shown in fig 4 binding in the range 17 to 14 kcalmol accuracy and limited realism of such methods does not really justify more precise statements on binding energy and the classification of binding below is as strong medium and weak but see ref 49 for more detail on some of the compounds authors variously consider binding energies 5 to 9 as a safe requirement for significant binding but again this is subject to considerations of accuracy and almost all agree that it is only the relative values that are significant note that while they are often interpreteted as estimates of binding free energy the entropy component particularly of the aqueous solvent and solute-solvent intercations is difficult to estimate experimental binding values of ligands in general in biological systems typically range from 4 to 16 kcalmol though over 95 lie in the range 7 to 13 kcalmol the thiioketone derivatives are more of theoretical interest in binding studies because in practice they may cause oligmerizationrecall that the two peptide analogues of features of the spike protein of interest 3 are as followsoriginal l-mimetic nh3-gpskrsfiedllfnkvtlac-coo
retroinverso mimetic nh3-dextro-gnflldeifsrksrkspc-coo
so far simulations only show these to be binding relatively weakly at 10 and 8 kcalmol respectively but these compounds are highly flexible with a theoretical internal in vacuo conformational entropy corresponding to about 195 kcalmol as discussed in theory section 2 show multiple binding modes and conformers on binding and may not yet be complete a high performance computer like ibms blue gene used in the earlier drug design study 49 would certainly helpin fig 6
is shown a set of compounds from the zinc data base 69 and most were identified from the original 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 study 49 and subsequent studies these bind significantly by usual criteria but more weakly they are in the range found for the synthetic peptides of interest but have much less conformational freedom a small few not shown here did appear in the original higher grade studies but the reasonable binding energies could not be reproduced for reasons that are not as yet clear
fig 7
shows some weaker binding results using krunch 49 great caution is required in drawing conclusions from the compounds in fig 3 camostat is definitely of interest as an inhibitor of the ace2 protein to which the spike protein initially binds for cell entry and does seem effective in blocking entry 74 and similarly hepsin results are of related interest eg as it is a potential alternative entry point the ace inhibitors also looked initially interesting by virtue of certain similarities to the other potential ligands and of course because of their binding in this theoretical study but most of the traditional ace inhibitors are commonly viewed as not inhibiting ace 2 taking a drug such as valsartan that acts on ace might up-regulate ace2 so facilitating virus entry 75 but emerging information is revealing a complicated picture see discussion and conclusions there are possible explanations that would still allow for competing with spike protein binding but these seem somewhat unlikely most probably the binding is sufficiently weak that the normal substrate and also the spike protein displace it aromatic group interactions may be important here 76some consideration has been given to prediction of ligand binding site motifs but so far these have proven essentially negative as regards interesting results that might shed any further light on the above although some clues may well have been missed binding sites are often comprised of conserved residues that are not contiguous continuous in a sequence which will require further and more detailed study although subsequences of 26 amino acid residues in length are worthy of a quick preliminary study because they are commonly involved in ligand interactions the matches involved in here as judged by blastp and clustal omega are not statistically significant but one might think of weak matches as ligand binding site predictions in much the same way that one thinks of epitope predictions in much of the present paper the structure of emodin carbenoxolone and related compounds have involved discussion of aromatic rings and hence phenylananine f tyrosine y and tryptophan w and more generally amino acid residues with hydrophobic character very polar subsequences are also strong binders of charged ligands or have a role for charged molecules or inorganic ions in some way as far as such subsequences in the coronavirus spike protein are concerned very polar charge-pattern motifs such drets and dreds are common in ligand binding some of the molecules that may be of interest as antagonizing sars entry activation or replication in some way in the present authors experience specifically motifs like this were of initial interest in the present project because sars-cov nonstructural proteins have zinc finger motifs and ret and especially red are common in prosite motifs at httpsprositeexpasyorgcgi-binprositeprositesearchfullpl including zinc-finger motifs this is not considered directly relevant to the spike protein but for example respectively in genbank entry aia622401 and dreds and drets align with srldkv in three-way clustal omega alignment with srldk of the original wuhan spike protein sequence mn9089473 and drldt of np0735511 spike protein however these and many similar alignments also illustrate considerable sequence variation and the weak matches are not close in the sequence to the subsequences of interest neither for coronavirus spike protein nor human proteins of potential discussed above as far as ace2 is concerned the closes match with drets and dregs is drkkps but this weak match again lays well away from regions of current interest eg in the sequence from the region that interacts with the spike glycoprotein dteta and drfin do occur in the c-terminal half of human 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 but again these are expected to be coincidental matcheslike the first vaccines 77 therapeutics too have of course been drawn directly or almost directly from nature until the late 19th century when chemical synthesis became a science and only in the 1970s did use begin to made of computers for rational drug design the advantages of still seriously considering herbal remedies is that they tend to be tolerated by cells because they are produced in cells they are already subjected to hundreds of years of human trial are often economic solutions for bulk production and are leads for further drug development and discovery the principal non-peptide compounds considered above as possible therapeutics have such convenient and herbal sources as reviewed previously 3 the herbal extract emodin is a convenient product extracted from rhubarb buckthorn and japanese knotweed and several fungi the previous paper 3 also noted that emodin had certain molecular similarities with anti-inflammatory drugs such as carbenoxolone derived from an extract glycyrrhizic acid from liquorish licorice that variously inhibit or are believed to inhibit human11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 the above does not guarantee efficacy of emodin carbenoxolone against sars-cov-2 not least because even the emodin studies concerned sars-cov not sars-cov-2 and the case for the dehydrogenase is circumstantial but these and related substances are worthy of investigation indeed this paper has described a number of compounds that bind the dehydrogenase importantly however recall that the weak binders that are also ace inhibitors may be more dangerous and promote infection because they upregulate ace2 75 nonetheless that situation is not resolved as followsthe above considerations as to the action and possible usefulness are empirical observations that are largely independent of bioinformatics and molecular computation and they are even independent of whether the correct human protein targets discussed here are correct and relevant however it would be valuable to know what might relate ace2 and 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 and ideally also understand why both enzymes might benefit the coronavirus by interaction with them also this paper could not provide any evidence of an evolutionary relationship between these proteins despite certain similarities or with tmprss2 so far there is no obvious relationship with the dehydrogenase and some other studies by the author on other transmembrane serine proteases do not as yet suggest any relationship without such connections the dehydrogenase can only be considered as a rather arbitrary model pharmacophore as such it is possibly meritorious as correctly representing an ensemble of multiple targets but that may be fortuitous and hence only to be used until refuted by evidencenonetheless possible clues as to mutual relevance of these human protein targets might come noting their tissue distribution and considering how this may relate to their biological role as regards ace2 its mrna is known to be present in virtually all organs studying sars entry into human cells hamming et al 78 considered their most remarkable finding to be the substantial surface expression of ace2 protein not only on lung alveolar epithelial cells but also enterocytes of the small intestine as in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organ studied oral and nasal mucosa nasopharynx lung stomach small intestine colon skin lymph nodes thymus bone marrow spleen liver kidney and brain there is the attractive prospect that several many herbal remedies considered as laxatives interact with ace2 and inhibit sars-covid-2 entry recall that emodin is an antagonist of both ace2 59 60 61 and 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 62 in the past 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 has been considered to be distributed mainly in the human liver with no detectable levels in the intestine or kidney mostly membrane-bound and retained in the liver microsomal fraction 79 this was not however the finding of bruley et al 80 they found it to be highly expressed in glucocorticoid target tissues including liver and notably the lung and modest levels in the brain it was also found in modest levels in adipose tissue where it is of medical interest that selective increase expression occurs in obese humans and rodents and is likely to be of pathogenic importance in the metabolic syndrome 80 lung expression appears to be managed differently a new promotor that the authors discovered and called p1 predominated in lung while the previously known promotor predominated in liver adipose tissue and brain 79researchers therefore need to sort out an intriguing web of information it is possible that a complex web of laxative and anti-inflammatory effect may provide clues by somehow relating to the bodys attempts to reject and eject viruses of this kind and the viruss attempts to resist it is well known that some covid-19 patients complain of stomach upsets and diarrhea to recapitulate the essential themes in terms of action in the alimentary tract recall again that emodin had earlier been shown by several groups of researchers eg refs 79 to inhibit sars-cov entry into cells apparently initially by binding ace2 and emodin is taken as a herbal laxative licorice has conversely been sometimes taken as a soother for alimentary disorders and carbenoxolone has been used commercially in the past specifically to treat peptic ulcers intriguingly carbenoxolone is also known to influence the renin-angiotensin system involving ace2 so at least there appears to be a connection in terms of networks of physiological control as noted above while traditionally 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 has been thought of as a liver enzyme many researchers have indicated that both ace2 and the dehydrogenase are available in both lung and intestinal tract eg ref 78 79 80 this all hints also that some of the other laxatives that work in a similar stimulatory way might block viral entry on ace2 and perhaps other targets and should be explored of course absolutely nothing should be done by patients without physician direction because dosages are difficult matters not least in herbal products and there are potentially serious side effects on such as salt balance and blood pressure and some might cause birth defects all potentially worse than covid-19 would be for most people but more worryingly still the situation is not settled and physicians and patients could take action in the wrong direction gurwitz 81 has emphasized that the picture is even more complex he examined reports from china suggesting that a mechanism of production of lung injury during the viral infection may be due to excess free angiotensin-ii which might be displaced from ace2 by the sars virus particles if so then increasing the amount of ace-2 could be desirable and administering angiotensin receptor antagonists could beneficially upregulate the production of ace-2 it now becomes important to examine medical records of patients who have and who have not been infected by sars-cov-2 with a particular eye on who is and who is not taking ace inhibitorsas noted in section 14 merrifield developed first solid phase peptide synthesis on crosslinked polystyrene beads in 1963 12 somewhat like natural compounds discussed above peptides and petidomimetics are potentially important first steps in more detailed rational design of small organic molecules convenient as traditional in a pill drugs however as in the present paper the ability to propose specific peptides and peptidomimetics does depend on bioinformatics and benefits from some computational chemistry note that in this case one is thinking largely not of screening natural products but now considering truly novel molecules using theoretical methods because they do not yet exist the variations in the krsfiedllfnkv motif that might be appropriate to synthetic vaccine and peptidomimetic antagonist design suggest the following where the amino acid residues in square brackets   represent alternatives g means an optional glycine insertionkrgsailfailfedillfandskv
the above is also valid as a regular expression ie a match query in operating systems and software more generally and colloquiallypositive charge-optional glycine-serine-hydrophobic-hydrophobic-glutamate-aspartate-hydrophobic-leucine-phenylalanine-hydrophilic or alanine-lysine-valineconsiderations at the n-terminus and c-terminus to design a synthetic vaccine and the retro-inverso approach for a peptidomimetic agonist are described in ref 3other variations appear as the strain becomes more distant there is not a universal clear indication of any sharp point of departure although the above glycine g insertion is evidence that a significant jump can happen one may therefore ask what variations should be included with the emphasis on sars-cov-2 only closely and medium distance relatives are of interest with the purpose of prevent mutations that escape from vaccines and antagonists and elude diagnostics as far as sars-cov-2 is concerned krsfiedllfnkv is a satisfactory basis because a large number of coronaviruses significantly different from sars-cov-2 preserve it or in a few cases have very conservative substitutions it may well be that the fact that residues are for example hydrophobic or positively charged is sufficient to for the approach to be applicable to other mammalian coronavirus diseases if successful for the above basic motif form attempting to tackle the common cold is not a priority in other words it may well be that an immune response against krsfiedllfnkv will also illicit a response against the motif variants providing of course that krsfiedllfnkv elicits a response itself it remains that this motif is one of very few subsequences that still recognizable when moving on to rather distantly related coronaviruses such as those of the common coldone feature of both fig 5 fig 6 fig 7 is of course the constant appearance of aromatic rings and this is also noticeable in many of the studies of antagonists against sars virus binding and activation of course the aromatic ie benzene ring makes copious appearance in many pharmaceutical agents in any event because they provide rigid scaffolds for added groups supported by many long-established recipes for synthesis the compounds in fig 5 fig 6 fig 7 should be distinguished from those such as lopinavar ritonar promazine and particularly niclosamide that have been explored for sars viruses in the past because these are targeted by drug designers against the sars virus own protease required for maturation of the assembling virus nonetheless some of these do have a visual similarity to the compounds in fig 3 particularly niclosamide which is normally a medication used to treat tapeworm infestation also in the present case prevalence of aromatic rings in fig 1 fig 2 fig 3 is hardly surprising since carbenoxolone and derivatives shown in fig 1 were the starting point for their evolution or selection from the zinc data base nonetheless there is in principle nothing to constrain the evolution to aromatic chemistry 49 and later unpublished studies did produce molecules departing from aromatic chemistry however these bound relatively weaklywith the possible importance of aromatic rings and avoidance of escape mutations by the coronavirus in mind a question is whether occasional loss of phenylalanine f from the krsfiedllfnkv motif discussed above contests the tentative hypothesis that the peptidomimetic candidates derived from krsfiedllfnkv bind to a similar site as the smaller organic ligands considered here because of two phenylalanine residues f in the original motif and a tendency to several benzene rings in the case of organic ligands the answer is perhaps there seems to be a need to have one aromatic ring present in the motif and no match with a coronavirus in genebank was detected by the author by blast-p using queries with no phenylalanine f eg rsaiedllldkv rsaiedllidkv rsaiedlladkv rsaiedllmdkv rsaiedllwdkv and rsaiedllydkv as queries though as also noted above the search has not been exhaustive it would not be too contradictory to any of the current main hypotheses if some examples were found the fact that tyrosine y does not seem to readily substitute here for phenylalanine f from which it differs only by a hydroxyl oh ie phenolic group suggests an important hydrophobic feature of the pharmacophore at that pointof course many or most drug-like molecules contain at least one aromatic ring and this is almost certainly because they can form especially strong stacking interactions in the binding site one very relevant report in the same month of writing the present paper emphasizes that the use of protein and other fragments to characterize binding pocket and determine the strengths of ligand-protein interactions is common in both a computational and experimental approach and that aromatic interactions are both strong and need special attention 76 because of resonance and the special nature of the  orbitals the strength of stacking is best calculated using high level quantum mechanical approaches not empirical force fields 76 however as these calculations are performed in vacuum solvation properties are neglected and this led to the proposal of a grid inhomogeneous solvation theory gist to describe the properties of individual heteroaromatics and complexes this gave good correlation for the estimated desolvation penalty and the experimental binding free energy and prediction of binding sites 76a main conclusion is that peptide krsfiedllfnkv remains of special interest as well conserved across coronaviruses other sites and other proteins of the virus may of course emerge as the solutions to this formidable problem all aspects of the virus must be considered however even the ace2 binding domain is significantly more prone to accepted mutations the recurrence of the core features of the krsfiedllfnkv motif over so many diverse species reminds us of zoonotic origins and it might be recalled that jenner the inventor of vaccination consider that many and perhaps all plagues of mankind might ultimately be of animal origin 7622 23 24 25 70 73this paper is provided to the community to promote the more general applications of the thinking of professor paul a m dirac in human and animal medicine in accordance

protein inhibitors and human cell receptor inhibitors to be studied extensively some interferon inhibition like ribavirin and cyclophilin were studied to treat coronavirus pneumonia interferon inhibition alone cannot treat the sars-cov-2 multi target therapy to be considered as effective way of treating which includes inhibition of receptor proteases like furins viral proteins like spike s and nsp12 a coronavirus is an rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp protein vital enzyme for coronavirus replicationtranscription complex which can inhibit both viral host cell entry and replication as designing of novel molecules at present is time consuming and no present therapies existing to treat sars-cov-2 we propose use of existing antiviral and other drugs to treat the coronavirus infection high-throughput screening bioinformatics and ai based tools and methods to screen existing drug database is the fastest approach to discover drug leads against sars-cov-2 for example anti-retro viral drugs like lopinavir and ritonavirafter determining the efficacy the drugs can be approved through proper hospital based clinical trials for clinical treatment of patients viral encoding proteins and human cell proteins aiding viral host cell entry and replication were analysed by bioinformatics tools like molecular docking and swiss dock protocols by conducting homology modelling and ligand preparations sars-cov-2 viral papain like protease main protease spike and rna-dependent rnapolymerase rdrp and human furin human ace2 and type-ii transmembrane serine protease proteins were extensively used for targeted drug discovery virtual screening of proposed protein targets was docked against anti-hiv and anti-hepatitis drugs were selected as ligands from drug database including some natural phytochemicals known for antiviral properties the present study predicts wide range of drug leads that may inhibit this study predicts a variety of compounds that may inhibit novel

urgency to address this situation as no present treatment protocols are not been established the only way to develop quick treatment protocols can be achieved by studying detailed case studies of sars infections caused by influenza and non-influenza viruses and also studying existing antiviral drugscomputational and high throughput screening tools are the best aids to design and study the efficacy of existing antiviral drugs along with some anti-inflammatory drugs against sars-cov-2 targeted sites antiviral drugs like oseltamivir used against neuraminidase of sars in last decade favilavir an rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp inhibitor also showed effective against the sars influenza virus recently japan also proposed use of favipiravir and avian flu drug to treat sars-cov-2 infection remdesivir a proposed drug to treat ebola virus also been proposed to test against sars-cov-2 dna and rna inhibitors like sofosbuvir and anti-hiv drug compositions also been proposed at present to treat the present global pandemic caused by novel coronavirus most of the proposed drugs had shown either less efficacy or effective in some patients but not achieved complete success in order to develop complete treatment protocol one should understand the disease pathogenesis as per case reports available study indicates respiratory outburst due to various inflammatory study indicates severe diarrhoea and respiratory outburst due to inflammatory factors causing death among novel coronavirus infected patients as per our study we found cd4 activation leading to th1 and th2 cytokines outburst in excessive leading to severe respiratory illness in patients affected by sars-cov-2 this virus has orf zone indicating c lectin type binding receptors of host figure 4 5 and 6 which may make this virus to escape mhc class i antigen presentation leading to asymptomatic conditions in some patients interleukins like il6 il8 and il2 along with tnf might be main causative inflammatory leading respiratory failure based on available case study by 14 most of the patients admitted had shown difficulty in breathing cough and fever with severe respiratory illness and pneumonia in this study we propose use of multi target therapy which includes viral protein targets involving in host cell entry and replication and host cytokines viral proteins like spike neuraminidase main protease 3clpro papain like protease plpro and rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp are the key viral protein targets 2 inhibition of spike s protein binding to ace 2 will be key prophylactic drug discovery to control sars-cov-2the present used carried out using computational and high throughput screening tools in order to evaluate the whole genome analysis of sars-cov-2 and identifying potential drugs to treat novel coronavirus influenza gene sequence was obtained from ncbi genome database 153 and molbiol and other blast analysis tools were used to analyse genome wide study similarity search analysis had shown possible close species relation with bat sars corona virus particularly from intermediate horseshoe bat rhinolophus affinis and some beta coronaviridae family the data also suggest some possible cross species interaction of delta coronavirus families and species jump from bats to intermediate host which is unknown or from porcine origin vista tools for comparative genomics had shown some phylogenetic origin of sars-cov-2 by chimeric recombination between hku2 alpha coronaviridae which caused severe swine diarrhoea syndrome caused by bat droppings and hku15 a delta corona virus causing swine respiratory syndrome figure 7 some genome wide analysis also matches with recombination clone of sars coronavirus with genetic id fj2118591 which should be properly evaluated as future indication orf reading had shown more than main 238 orf sites sars coronavirus orf33a figure 6 which is a characteristic protein for sars coronavirus family some other proteins include ns3e small non-structural proteins well conserved among coronavirus strains and a small uncharacteristic protein sarsns6 with small amino acid sequence drugs selected from zinc database like remdesivir paritaprevir sofosbuvir ritonavir lopinavir chloroquine derivatives like hydroxychloroquine including natural molecules like glycyrrhizin corosolic acid and baicalin were used as ligands in docking studies against viral proteins like spike main protease 3clpro papain like protease plpro rna dependent rna polymerase docking results had shown paritaprevir ritonavir and chloroquine derivatives as best drug leads against spike and proteases of sars-co-v2 natural drugs like glycyrrhizin corosolic acid and baicalin also shown strong binding affinity against spike and protease proteins of novel corona virus from existing clinical data we also propose use of anti-inflammatory drugs in treating the sars-cov-2 disease progression in this study we propose for clinical study by combined use of paritaprevir entecavir ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine along with anti-inflammatory drugs and also use of niacinamide vitamin c zinc supplements for possible good clinical outcome we also propose study plant protease inhibitors pis glycoprotein-based antibodies and small molecules like lysozyme hydrochloride oxamniquine and nateglinide therapiesthe current outbreak of a novel coronavirus 2019ncov now named sarscov2 that started in december 2019 in the city of wuhan hubei china once again demonstrates the risk of emerging zoonotic viral infections in general and that of coronavirus species in particular after only 2 months the epidemic of covid19 is already larger than the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus sarscov outbreak which during 20022003 lasted 8 months and infected 8096 people with a mortality rate of 95 it is a larger threat than the multiple smaller outbreaks of middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus merscov a zoonotic coronavirus that was discovered in 2012 bermingham et al 
2012coronaviruses that are closely related to sarscov are typically found in bats li et al 2005 there is evidence that sarscov originated in bats in china and reached humans most probably after jumping to an intermediate host the civet paguma larvata reviewed by wang and eaton 2007 similarly merscov is endemic in dromedary camels in the middle east from which it can be transmitted to humans but it may also have originated in bats cui et al 
2019 the mers epidemic is ongoing and as of december 2019 2468 cases have been reported baharoon and memish 2019 and the mortality rate has been as high as 42 mohd et al 
2016 at the other end of the virulence spectrum are coronavirus species that cause common colds in humans with relatively mild symptoms reviewed by su et al 
2016some coronaviruses are strictly hostspecific while others can be found in a range of hosts drexler et al 
2014 the genome sequences of 2019ncov that is responsible for the current outbreak suggest that it too may have originated from bats though it may have undergone a host jump to another mammal that was sold on a liveanimal market in wuhan where the outbreak presumably had started zhang et al 
2020 while this manuscript was under review it was published that this animal might have been a pangolin manis javanica liu et al 
2019 alternatively though less likely a highly infectious patient zero may have been present at the market as we now know that the virus can spread via humantohuman contacts riou and althaus 2020 and individuals infected with a coronavirus can be superspreaders as was demonstrated for mers cho et al 
2016 kang et al 
2017coronaviruses are divided into three genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus sars mers and 2019ncov are members of betacoronavirus which is divided into the subgenera embecovirus hibecovirus merbecovirus nobecovirus and sarbecovirus all coronaviruses have a genome consisting of a positivesense singlestrand rna molecule a long polycystronic messenger is produced from this that codes for a number of proteins some of which are posttranslationally cleaved to produce smaller proteins cui et al 
2019 approximately twothirds of the genome codes for a large open reading frame often called orf 1ab that undergoes a frame shift during translation and whose product is processed into a number of smaller proteins while a variable number of smaller open reading frames are located downstream of orf 1aba number of highly similar genome sequences of 2019ncov have now been released in the public domain and these are currently being analysed by multiple groups in an attempt to understand the biology of the virus although it is still a challenge to predict virulence from viral genome sequences the fact that coronaviruses are extremely diverse complicates such analysesin order to be better prepared during a future zoonotic coronavirus outbreak we attempted to identify a dna target that would be able to detect all known members of betacoronavirus and further to identify commonality between members of the subgenera the analysis identified that a relatively short fragment of the noncoding upstream flank of the genome is sufficient for phylogenetic analysis moreover the types of bats that have commercial value in china were considered as potential sources for zoonotic coronavirusesin a pilot experiment all coding regions of four virus species representing three subgenera merscov for merbecovirus human coronavirus oc43 for embecovirus and sarscov and 2019ncov for sarbecovirus were compared by multiple alignment of nucleotide sequences this did not identify any region that was sufficiently conserved to potentially design an rnatwoprimer amplification detection target for all betacoronavirus genera which we had set as our initial goal to identify it is clear that addition of the genomes of more virus species would only decrease conservation furtherthis lack of homologous dna sequences was a bit surprising as lu et al 2020 recently published a phylogenetic tree based on 50 genome sequences including 10 2019ncov isolates with high bootstrap values which can only be obtained with sufficient degrees of conservation between members of the data set their analysis was based on complete genomes presumably nucleotide sequences whereas in our pilot analysis only proteincoding nucleotide sequences were compared this initiated an analysis to identify how much of the phylogenetic signal and conservation was actually present in noncoding regions of the viral genomes in case of coronavirus these are mostly restricted to the 5 and 3end flanks as all open reading frames are tightly packed therefore a more extensive comparison was performed this time with either the 5 or the 3end noncoding flanks obtained from 31 whole genome sequences covering all subspecies of betacoronavirus table 1 this selection included the most variable genomes identified by lu and colleagues complemented with other members of the subgenera while genomes with high similarity to another genome were discarded to remove redundancy the phylogenetic trees obtained with these two noncoding regions are shown in fig 1 both fragments could separate the four subspecies and an unclassified bat isolate from cameroon could be identified as a member of the nobecovirus another unclassified virus isolated from a nigerian bat showed high similarity with the only other fully sequenced member of hibecovirus at least for its 5 flank fig 1aassigning a betacoronavirus to a subgenus does not implicate information about its virulence host specificity or geographical origin however the two analysed fragments were relatively strongly conserved within a subgenus as illustrated by multiple alignments shown in supporting information since only two highly similar genome sequences of hibecovirus members were available for analysis their comparison was not included the identified conserved regions could provide potential targets for pcr or rtpcr allowing for rapid classification of novel coronaviruses in particular for the sarbecovirus groupalthough any section of the viral genome that is conserved within but not between subspecies would result in correct classification the conservation of such regions within coding sequences of sarbecovirus members was generally weaker than we observed for the noncoding flanks using coding sequences of this same small selection of seven sarbecovirus members the maximum conservation at nucleotide level for gene 1ab was 85 within a sliding window of 60 bases compared to 93 for the downstream and 90 for the upstream flank the longest stretch of conserved nucleotides was 22 in the upstream flank 33 in the downstream flank and only 20 nucleotides in orf 1ab results not shown only the gene coding for envelope protein e was as strongly conserved as the noncoding flanks maximum conservation 95 over a window of 60 bases with a longest conserved stretch of 32 nucleotides for the seven genomes analysed here as conservation of coding sequences decreases with thirdbase variation it is likely that this degree of conservation in gene e would decrease as more genomes would be included in the comparison thus restricting analyses to only comparing coding regions may reduce the chance a proposed detection target might be able to detect a novel sarbecovirus species instead we recommend inclusion of the noncoding genome regions in such attempts although it was not our aim to develop improved detection methods for which we would have to experimentally test any proposed target region our findings can be a starting point for such studiesit has been proposed though not yet proven that 2019ncov naturally propagates in bats but the bat species in which the population mainly resides was unknown at the time of writing the food market of wuhan may or may not have been selling bats for food however bats and their excrements are often used in traditional chinese medicine tcm which may be a reason for their legal or illegal trading it is also possible that the virus had infected another mammal that was traded at the market and served as the source of the infection such a case has been proposed for malayan pangolins liu et al 
2019 a meat delicacy that was most likely sold in the exotic meat market such crossinfection could also have occurred during handling storage or selling prior to animals reaching the food market the case for pangolins being the actual source of 2019ncov has not yet been proven but was referred from sequence similarities liu et al 
2019 even in this scenario there must have been a reason why an infected bat came in the vicinity of a pangolin that ended up in the market for which only bat species with local commercial value come into questionof an extensive list of bat species that historically have been used in tcm riccucci 2012 five were found to carry coronaviruses as reported in a surveillance study tang et al 
2006 pipistrellus abramus murina leucogaster rhinolophus ferrumequinum scotophilus kuhlii and scotomanes ornatus of these bat species the first three can be found in the province of hubei source httpwwwiucnredlistorg the habitat of s ornatus reaches to the south of the province but does not cover the wuhan area while s kuhlii is not endemic in this region a number of whole genome sarbecovirus sequences isolated from these bats and other bat species were selected and their 5flank was compared to that of 2019ncov fig 2 this produced the highest identity to the same isolate that lu and coworkers had identified lu et al 
2020 demonstrating that an analysis of 253 nucleotides directly upstream of the start codon of the polycystronic messenger suffices to identify genetic relationships between sarbecovirus speciesthe bat cov to which 2019ncov has the highest similarity was isolated from rhinolophus sinicus mg772933 described in hu et al 
2018 which might indicate that this species may also have been the original source of 2019ncov however the database is highly biased towards particular bat species that were specifically sampled in search of the source of sars highly similar coronaviruses can be detected in different bat species as identified by asterisks in fig 2 so that even a high similarity match to a bat isolate may not always identify the correct bat species that was the cause of a given zoonotic outbreak this caution can be extended to other possible animal hosts that have been or will be claimed as sources of the 2019ncov without a proven epidemiological linkthe use of bats in tcm is of great concern and the use of the greater horseshoe bat rhinolophus ferrumequinum is of particular interest the faeces of this bat y ming sh in chinese marketed as vespertilionis see for instance httpswwwbestplantshopproductsye-ming-sha-bat-feces-bat-dung-bat-guano is used to cure eye conditions while body parts are dried and added to wine or ground into a powder for oral intake as a means to detoxify the body both practices could be highly risky in case an animal was infected with a coronavirus particularly the first use as the virus can be present in faeces and can enter a host via the eye we speculate that a live or recently deceased infected bat species was handled by traders because of its value in tcm and that such an infected individual or the still infective bat or bat products may have been the route by which the virus entered the exotic meat market in wuhan alternatively during the trade chain a host jump occurred between an infected bat handled for tcm purposes and another mammal that then was the source of infection less likely because the material is usually dried significantly the outbreak may have started by medicinal use of batderived contaminated tcm material in this respect it is interesting to note that the first known onset of symptoms on 1 december 2019 were observed in a patient with no known epidemiological links to the wuhan food market huang et al 
2020the possibility that batderived materials sold for tcm practices may be involved in this outbreak has severe implications we point out there is a serious risk of producing batderived materials sold for tcm practices as it involves handling of and trading with wild bats even when the selling of live wild animals at food markets would be completely prohibited in china the trading and handling of bats for traditional medicinal practices would remain a serious risk for future zoonotic coronavirus epidemicsall genome sequences used in this study were extracted from genbank table 1 in all

protein buonavoglia and martella 2007 erles and brownlie 2008the evolutionary origin of crcov remains uncertain although successful experimental infection of puppies with bcov has suggested that crcov

of the chinese cdc all animals were treated strictly according to the guidelines for the laboratory animal use and care from the chinese cdcfrom december 2013march 2014 246 swab specimens nasopharyngeal and anal swabs were collected from diseased dogs at the animal hospital of china agricultural university most of the dogs showed symptoms of gastrointestinal andor respiratory tract infections including coughing lacrimation vomiting and diarrhea all the swab samples were collected by professional veterinarians and were stored at 80 cfor molecular detection total rna was extracted

characterize the crcov discovered here the crcov-positive samples were pretreated and used for random amplification as described previously wang et al 2016 the amplified dna was used as a template for illumina hiseq2500 sequencing 2  125 bp paired-end reads the sequencing procedure was conducted by beijing berry genomic company the full-length genome of crcov was assembled using soap de novo and was annotated based on the sole annotation of crcov k37 strain jx8606401to determine the evolutionary relationships between the crcov discovered here and those identified previously we collected most of the complete sequences of the betacoronavirus 1 and conducted nucleotide acid sequence alignments using the mafft algorithm the phylogenetic analyses were conducted based on the nucleotide acid sequences of the orf1ab s m and n genes and complete genome of crcov all the phylogenetic trees were constructed in the phyml software using the maximum likelihood method with 500 bootstrap replicates the following betacoronavirus 1 genome sequences from the genbank database were used for the phylogenetic analysis as follows bcov reference strain nc003045 hecov nc012950 hcov-oc43 nc005147 crcov-37 jx860640 and bcov strain quebec af220295to confirm the potential recombination events similarity plots and bootscanning analyses were conducted using the simplot software a sliding window of 1000 nucleotides and 100-nucleotide steps were used as the default settings in addition a schematic diagram of the complete crcov genome was examined to determine the recombination sitesthe complete genome of chinabj232 was deposited in the genbank database under accession no kx432213 other sequences generated in this study including the partial s rdrp and complete n gene sequences were also assigned accession numbers kx432214-kx432217a total of 246 swab samples were collected in beijing from december 2013 to march 2014rt-pcr was performed to detect crcov and 16 65 out of 246 swabs originating from chinese dogs tested positive for crcov in addition five crcov-positive samples with high titers were initially processed for complete genome sequencing using deep sequencing technologydue to the limited specimen size and low viral load five clinical samples were used for deep sequencing and only one complete genomic sequence was eventually obtained the genomic data formally referred to as canine respiratory coronavirus strain bj232 and in this report as crcov-bj232 were deposited in genbank kx432213 the crcov-bj232 genome isolated in china was found to have 30868 nucleotides and showed

sequence of crcov-bj232 with 100 nucleotide identity thus far there are only two crcov strains with full-length genomic information submitted to genbank the previously reported crcov-k37 and our current strain crcov-bj232 unfortunately attempts to isolate crcov-bj232 from the five positive samples were unsuccessful future studies to isolate the virus from more canine samples will allow characterization of its pathogenicity and transmissibilitybased on the analysis of whole-genome phylogeny crcov-bj232 was classified into betacoronavirus 1 species of betacoronavirus group 2a fig 1
a and shares a common origin with bcov crcov-k37 hecov and hcov-oc43 moreover the latter four viruses clustered together with high branch bootstrap values fig 1b to investigate the genetic relationships among the betacoronavirus 1 species we generated phylogenetic trees based on the sequences oforf1ab s m and n genes fig 2
 phylogenetic analysis based on different genes consistently show that crcov bj232 is most closely related to hcov-oc43 forming a separate clade of crcov that split off early from other betacoronavirus 1 however crcov-k37 strain closely clustered with crcov-bj232 strain in s gene and was more related to bcov strain quebec af2202951 in the region of orf1ab m and n genes the major genes of the crcov-bj232 strain showed a consistent trend in the evolution while the phylogenetic topology conflicted in the sub-regions of crcov strain k37 especially in the s and orf1ab genes these findings are consistent with recombination a phenomenon not uncommon in coronaviruses implying that the crcov k37 strain may have arisen from genetic recombinationsimilarity plots and bootscanning analyses fig 3
 were performed to confirm the recombination between crcov and bcov the previously reported crcov k37 strain was used as a query sequence and was compared with hcov-oc43 nc005147 bcov bcov-refnc003045 bcov-db2 dq811784 bcov-quebec af220295 hecov hecov-ref nc012950 hecov-4408 fj415324 and crcov crcov-bj232 kx432213 in the s gene strain k37 possessed the highest similarity with the bj232 strain between position 23842 and 29072 as expected however in the orf1ab he m and n genes strain k37 was apparently related to bcov which further confirmed the occurrence of genetic recombination between crcov and bcov the consistency in the results of bootscanning and phylogenetic analyses also supported the possibility of recombination in the s genewe collected all available crcov sequences from the genbank database and conducted comprehensive phylogenetic analyses separately based on he s m and n genes to understand the epidemiology distribution of the recombinant strainsouth korea strain k37 the bj232 bj221 bj34 and bj202 strains were collected from china in this study while the k37 k39 and k9 strains came from south korea and the 24005 and 4182 strains were derived from italy and the united kingdom respectively as shown in fig 4
 the crcov strains from china including the bj232 bj221 bj34 and bj202 strains clustered with strains prevalent in italy and the united kingdom the 24005 and 4182 strains and the crcov strains detected in south korea k37 k39 and k9 strains were all derived from recombinant lineagecrcov is a causative agent for cird and a novel pathogen detected in respiratory samples from dogs erles and brownlie 2008 a serological survey of crcov conducted worldwide revealed that antibodies against crcov were common in the canine population erles et al 2004 isaacs et al 1983 pratelli et al 2003 priestnall et al 2006 in contrast corresponding genome-wide analyses have rarely been conducted an et al 2010 lorusso et al 2009 in the present study we characterized the first complete genome of crcov named strain bj232 derived from china and phylogenetic analyses showed that crcov-bj232occupied a deep branch at the root of members of betacoronavirus 1 being distinct from hcov-oc43 and bcov another previously described crcov strain k37 was identified to have arisen from recombination between crcov-bj232 and bcov in detail the crcov-k37 strain was related to crcov-bj232 in the s gene while in the orf1ab he m and n genes crcov-k37 was noted to possess a close relationship with bcovrecombination is a common phenomenon in coronaviruses and thought to contribute to the emergence of new pathotypes gorbalenya 2008 wang et al 2015 thus far most of the recombination events of coronaviruses have been reported between species of the same group herrewegh et al 1998 keck et al 1988 such as among the bat-associated covs corman et al 2014 and 229e-related covs corman et al 2015 and the major recombination breakpoint has mainly been within the s gene genetic recombinant among alphacoronavirus 1 species frequently occurred such as ferret coronaviruses lamers et al 2016 minami et al 2016 however few researches about genetic recombination of betacoronavirus 1 species have been conducted the discovery of genetic recombination between crcov and bcov confirms the phenomenon and intraspecies recombination therefore exists for betacoronavirus 1 speciesphylogenetic analyses based on all available crcov genes showed that the two clusters of crcov including recombinant strain south korea k37 strain and the chinese bj232 strain have been prevalent worldwide for many years crcov and bcov were closely related in betacoronavirus 1 located on the outer leaves of phylogenetic tree and form an independent branch it was difficult to determine the evolution orientation transmission from cattle to canine or both from murine although the latest research supports the murine origins of betacoronavirus 1 lau et al 2011 lau et al 2015 more crcov genome sequences are needed to understand the evolutionary relationship between crcov and bcovregarding the pathogenicity and transmissibility of crcov the chinese bj232 strain and south korea k37 strain were both derived from diseased dogs with respiratory infections genomic analyses showed that the s genes which mediate coronavirus attachment were highly similar in these strains because recombination may be a driving force for the formation of pathogenic viruses from less pathogenic virus forni et al 2017 recombinant may play an important role in the pathogenicity and transmissibility of crcov limitation of this study was that the isolation of crcov-bj232 failed on cell culture more crcov strains were needed to be isolated or rescued using reverse genetic technique to perform experimental inoculation of dogsin conclusion herein we reported the first complete genome sequence of a crcov derived from a diseased dog in china and confirm that intraspecies recombinant exists for betacoronavirus 1 species the results may have implications for the origin and evolution of crcovviruses of the family coronaviridae possess a single-strand positive-sense rna genome ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases in length1 coronaviruses have been identified in several avian hosts2 3 as well as in various mammals including camels bats masked palm civets mice dogs and cats novel mammalian coronaviruses are now regularly identified1 for example an hku2-related coronavirus of bat origin was responsible for a fatal acute diarrhoea syndrome in pigs in 20184
among the several coronaviruses that are pathogenic to humans most are associated with mild clinical symptoms1 with two notable exceptions severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus sars-cov a novel betacoronavirus that emerged in guangdong southern china in november 20025 and resulted in more than 8000 human infections and 774 deaths in 37 countries during 2002036 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus mers-cov which was first detected in saudi arabia in 20127 and was responsible for 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection and 858 fatalities since september 2012 including 38 deaths following a single introduction into south korea8 9

research in context
evidence before this study
the causal agent of an outbreak of severe pneumonia in wuhan china is a novel coronavirus provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov the first cases were reported in december 2019
added value of this study
we have described the genomic characteristics of 2019-ncov and similarities and differences to other coronaviruses including the virus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic of 200203 genome sequences of 2019-ncov sampled from nine patients who were among the early cases of this severe infection are almost genetically identical which suggests very recent emergence of this virus in humans and that the outbreak was detected relatively rapidly 2019-ncov is most closely related to other betacoronaviruses of bat origin indicating that these animals are the likely reservoir hosts for this emerging viral pathogen
implications of all the available evidence
by documenting the presence of 2019-ncov in a sample of patients our study extends previous evidence that this virus has led to the novel pneumonia that has caused severe disease in wuhan and other geographical localities currently available data suggest that 2019-ncov infected the human population from a bat reservoir although it remains unclear if a currently unknown animal species acted as an intermediate host between bats and humans
in late december 2019 several patients with viral pneumonia were found to be epidemiologically associated with the huanan seafood market in wuhan in the hubei province of china where a number of non-aquatic animals such as birds and rabbits were also on sale before the outbreak a novel human-infecting coronavirus10 11 provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov was identified with use of next-generation sequencing as of jan 28 2020 china has reported more than 5900 confirmed and more than 9000 suspected cases of 2019-ncov infection across 33 chinese provinces or municipalities with 106 fatalities in addition 2019-ncov has now been reported in thailand japan south korea malaysia singapore and the usa infections in medical workers and family clusters were also reported and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed12 most of the infected patients had a high fever and some had dyspnoea with chest radiographs revealing invasive lesions in both lungs12 13
we report the epidemiological data of nine inpatients from at least three hospitals in wuhan who were diagnosed with viral pneumonia of unidentified cause using next-generation sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples and cultured isolates from these patients 2019-ncov was found we describe the genomic characterisation of ten genomes of this novel virus providing important information on the origins and cell receptor binding of the virusnine patients with viral pneumonia and negative for common respiratory pathogens who presented to at least three hospitals in wuhan were included in this study eight of the patients had visited the huanan seafood market before the onset of illness and one patient wh04 did not visit the market but stayed in a hotel near the market between dec 23 and dec 27 2019 table

nine patients samples analysed eight complete and two partial genome sequences of 2019-ncov were obtained these data have been deposited in the china national microbiological data center accession

samples were tested by a different real-time pcr assay developed by the chinese cdc with ct values ranging from 2285 to 3241 table these results confirmed the presence of 2019-ncov in the patientsbronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples or cultured viruses of nine patients were used for next-generation sequencing after removing host human reads de novo assembly was done and the contigs obtained used as queries to search the non-redundant protein database some contigs identified in all the samples were closely related to the bat sars-like betacoronavirus bat-sl-covzc45 betacoronavirus23 bat-sl-covzc45 was then used as the reference genome and reads from each pool were mapped to it generating consensus sequences corresponding to all the pools these consensus sequences were then used as new reference genomes eight complete genomes and two partial genomes from samples wh19002 and wh02 table were obtained the de novo assembly of the clean reads from all the pools did not identify any other long contigs that corresponded to other viruses at high abundancethe eight complete genomes were nearly identical across the whole genome with sequence identity above 9998 indicative of a very recent emergence into the human population figure 1a
 the largest nucleotide difference was four mutations notably the sequence identity between the two virus genomes from the same patient wh19001 from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and wh19005 from cell culture was more than 9999 with 100 identity at the amino acid level in addition the partial genomes from samples wh02 and wh19002 also had nearly 100 identity to the complete genomes across the aligned gene regionsa blastn search of the complete genomes of 2019-ncov revealed that the most closely related viruses available on genbank were bat-sl-covzc45 sequence identity 8799 query coverage 99 and another sars-like betacoronavirus of bat origin bat-sl-covzxc21 accession number mg77293423 8723 query coverage 98 in five gene regions e m 7 n and 14 the sequence identities were greater than 90 with the highest being 987 in the e gene figure 2a
 the s gene of 2019-ncov exhibited the lowest sequence identity with bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 at only around 75 in addition the sequence identity in 1b about 86 was lower than that in 1a about 90 figure 2a most of the encoded proteins exhibited high sequence identity between 2019-ncov and the related bat-derived coronaviruses figure 2a the notable exception was the spike protein with only around 80 sequence identity and protein 13 with 732 sequence identity notably the 2019-ncov strains were less genetically similar to sars-cov about 79 and mers-cov about 50 the similarity between 2019-ncov and related viruses was visualised using simplot software with the 2019-ncov consensus sequence employed as the query figure 2bcomparison of the predicted coding regions of 2019-ncov showed that they possessed a similar genomic organisation to bat-sl-covzc45 bat-sl-covzxc21 and sars-cov figure 1b at least 12 coding regions were predicted including 1ab s 3 e m 7 8 9 10b n 13 and 14 figure 1b the lengths of most of the proteins encoded by 2019-ncov bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 were similar with only a few minor insertions or deletions a notable difference was a longer spike protein encoded by 2019-ncov compared with the bat sars-like coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov figure 1bphylogenetic analysis of 2019-ncov and its closely related reference genomes as well as representative betacoronaviruses revealed that the five subgenera formed five well supported branches figure 3
 the subgenus sarbecovirus could be classified into three well supported clades two sars-cov-related strains from rhinolophus sp from bulgaria accession number gu190215 and kenya ky352407 formed clade 1 the ten 2019-ncov from wuhan and the two bat-derived sars-like strains from zhoushan in eastern china bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 formed clade 2 which was notable for the long branch separating the human and bat viruses and sars-cov strains from humans and many genetically similar sars-like coronaviruses from bats collected from southwestern china formed clade 3 with bat-derived coronaviruses also falling in the basal positions figure 3 in addition 2019-ncov was distinct from sars-cov in a phylogeny of the complete rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene appendix p 2 this evidence indicates that 2019-ncov is a novel betacoronavirus from the subgenus sarbecovirusas the sequence similarity plot revealed changes in genetic distances among viruses across the 2019-ncov genome we did additional phylogenetic analyses of the major encoding regions of representative members of the subgenus sarbecovirus consistent with the genome phylogeny 2019-ncov bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 clustered together in trees of the 1a and spike genes appendix p 3 by contrast 2019-ncov did not cluster with bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 in the 1b tree but instead formed a distinct clade with sars-cov bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 appendix p 3 indicative of potential recombination events in 1b although these probably occurred in the bat coronaviruses rather than 2019-ncov phylogenetic analysis of the 2019-ncov genome excluding 1b revealed similar evolutionary relationships as the full-length viral genome appendix p 3the envelope spike s protein mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion24 and is crucial for determining host tropism and transmission capacity25 26 generally the spike protein of coronaviruses is functionally divided into the s1 domain especially positions 318510 of sars-cov responsible for receptor binding and the s2 domain responsible for cell membrane fusion27 the 2019-ncov s2 protein showed around 93 sequence identity with bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21much higher than that of the s1 domain which had only around 68 identity with these bat-derived viruses both the n-terminal domain and the c-terminal domain of the s1 domain can bind to host receptors28 we inspected amino acid variation in the spike protein among the sarbecovirus coronaviruses figure 4
 although 2019-ncov and sars-cov fell within different clades figure 3 they still possessed around 50 conserved amino acids in s1 whereas most of the bat-derived viruses displayed mutational differences figure 4 most of these positions in the c-terminal domain figure 4 in addition a number of deletion events including positions 455457 463464 and 485497 were found in the bat-derived strains figure 4the receptor-binding domain of betacoronaviruses which directly engages the receptor is commonly located in the c-terminal domain of s1 as in sars-cov29 for lineage b and mers-cov30 31 and batcov hku432 for lineage c figure 5
 through phylogenetic analysis of the receptor-binding domain of four different lineages of betacoronaviruses appendix p 4 we found that although 2019-ncov was closer to bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 at the whole-genome level the receptor-binding domain of 2019-ncov fell within lineage b and was closer to that of sars-cov figure 5a the three-dimensional structure of 2019-ncov receptor-binding domain was modelled using the swiss-model program33 with the sars-cov receptor-binding domain structure protein data bank id 2dd834 as a template this analysis suggested that like other betacoronaviruses the receptor-binding domain was composed of a core and an external subdomain figure 5bd notably the external subdomain of the 2019-ncov receptor-binding domain was more similar to that of sars-cov this result suggests that 2019-ncov might also use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a cell receptor however we also observed that several key residues responsible for the binding of the sars-cov receptor-binding domain to the ace2 receptor were variable in the 2019-ncov receptor-binding domain including asn439 asn501 gln493 gly485 and phe486 2019-ncov numberingfrom genomic surveillance of clinical samples from patients with viral pneumonia in wuhan china a novel coronavirus termed 2019-ncov has been identified10 11 our phylogenetic analysis of 2019-ncov sequenced from nine patients samples showed that the virus belongs to the subgenus sarbecovirus 2019-ncov was more similar to two bat-derived coronavirus strains bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 than to known human-infecting coronaviruses including the virus that caused the sars outbreak of 2003epidemiologically eight of the nine patients in our study had a history of exposure to the huanan seafood market in wuhan suggesting that they might have been in close contact with the infection source at the market however one patient had never visited the market although he had stayed in a hotel near the market before the onset of their illness this finding suggests either possible droplet transmission or that the patient was infected by a currently unknown source evidence of clusters of infected family members and medical workers has now confirmed the presence of human-to-human transmission12 clearly this infection is a major public health concern particularly as this outbreak coincides with the peak of the chinese spring festival travel rush during which hundreds of millions of people will travel through chinaas a typical rna virus the average evolutionary rate for coronaviruses is roughly 104 nucleotide substitutions per site per year1 with mutations arising during every replication cycle it is therefore striking that the sequences of 2019-ncov from different patients described here were almost identical with greater than 999 sequence identity this finding suggests that 2019-ncov originated from one source within a very short period and was detected relatively rapidly however as the virus transmits to more individuals constant surveillance of mutations arising is neededphylogenetic analysis showed that bat-derived coronaviruses fell within all five subgenera of the genus betacoronavirus moreover bat-derived coronaviruses fell in basal positions in the subgenus sarbecovirus with 2019-ncov most closely related to bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 which were also sampled from bats23 these data are consistent with a bat reservoir for coronaviruses in general and for 2019-ncov in particular however despite the importance of bats several facts suggest that another animal is acting as an intermediate host between bats and humans first the outbreak was first reported in late december 2019 when most bat species in wuhan are hibernating second no bats were sold or found at the huanan seafood market whereas various non-aquatic animals including mammals were available for purchase third the sequence identity between 2019-ncov and its close relatives bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 was less than 90 which is reflected in the relatively long branch between them hence bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 are not direct ancestors of 2019-ncov fourth in both sars-cov and mers-cov bats acted as the natural reservoir with another animal masked palm civet for sars-cov35 and dromedary camels for mers-cov36 acting as an intermediate host with humans as terminal hosts therefore on the basis of current data it seems likely that the 2019-ncov causing the wuhan outbreak might also be initially hosted by bats and might have been transmitted to humans via currently unknown wild animals sold at the huanan seafood marketprevious studies have uncovered several receptors that different coronaviruses bind to such as ace2 for sars-cov29 and cd26 for mers-cov30 our molecular modelling showed structural similarity between the receptor-binding domains of sars-cov and 2019-ncov therefore we suggest that 2019-ncov might use ace2 as the receptor despite the presence of amino acid mutations in the 2019-ncov receptor-binding domain although a previous study using hela cells expressing ace2 proteins showed that 2019-ncov could employ the ace2 receptor37 whether these mutations affect ace2 binding or change receptor tropism requires further studyrecombination has been seen frequently in coronaviruses1 as expected we detected recombination in the sarbecoviruses analysed here our results suggest that recombination events are complex and are more likely occurring in bat coronaviruses than in 2019-ncov hence despite its occurrence recombination is probably not the reason for emergence of this virus although this inference might change if more closely related animal viruses are identifiedin conclusion we have described the genomic structure of a seventh human coronavirus that can cause severe pneumonia and have shed light on its origin and receptor-binding properties more generally the disease outbreak linked to 2019-ncov again highlights the hidden virus reservoir in wild animals and their potential to occasionally spill over into human populationsdata are available on various websites and have been made publicly available more information can be found in the first paragraph of the results sectionfeline infectious peritonitis fip is a relatively new disease of cats that was first described in 1963 in the united states holzworth 1963 and continues to be one of the most frequent fatal and infectious feline disease worldwide fip is caused by a virulent feline coronavirus feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv and by an inadequate response of the host pedersen 2009according to the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv feline coronavirus fcov belongs to the order nidovirales the family coronaviridae the subfamily orthocoronavirinae the genus alphacoronavirus the subgenus tegacovirus and the species alphacoronavirus 1 together with canine coronaviruses ccovs and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev according to their serological and genetic properties fcovs are classified into type i and type ii and recently their classification in alphacoronavirus 1 clade a and clade b has been proposed respectively jaimes et al 2020 type i is the most frequently detected fcov in cats and has a worldwide distributionfcovs can also be divided into two biotypes that are generally referred to as the avirulent endemic feline enteric coronavirus fecv that is usually cause of asymptomatic infections and is responsible only for a mild and transient enteritis and the virulent biotype fipv that is responsible for fip pedersen 2014 these two biotypes exist in both types i and ii tekes and thiel 2016 jaimes et al 2020 like other rna viruses coronaviruses are prone to mutations few mutations in accessory genes and the spike s gene of fcovs have been identified the mutations m1058 l or s1060a in the s gene that were initially thought to be a marker for fipv were recently associated to the ability of the virus to infect and replicate in monocytes and macrophages representing a marker for systemic fcov replication chang et al 2012 pedersen 2014 porter et al 2014 stranieri et al 2018 felten and hartmann 2019the s gene is also used for fcov typing the s gene of fcov types i and ii differ fcov type i harbors the original feline s gene whereas the fcov type ii acquired the s gene along with other genes from the ccov during recombination events jamies et al 2020 moreover because the s gene encodes for the spike protein which is the protein most subject to evolutionary immune pressure it is the most variable of the fcov genes therefore the s gene is also useful for genetic characterization of strains addie et al 2003 kipar and meli 2014genome sequences and phylogenetic analysis showed that fcov isolates form clusters according to geographic distribution regardless of disease phenotype kipar and meli 2014 sequence comparisons demonstrated that fecvs and fipvs from the same group of cats were very closely related while significant genetic variation existed between fecvs and fipvs that were from different geographic areas pedersen 2014 for a better understanding of pathways of infection dispersion a phylogeographical analysis that allows reconstruction of the most probable place of origin of infections and flow of geographic spread of viruses has been developed lemey et al 2009 drummond et al 2012 this approach has been used to reconstruct spatial and temporal dispersion of some highly variable viruses but to our knowledge has been applied only in one recent study providing insights into the origin of fcov in brazil myrrha et al 2019 phylogeographical analyses has never been applied for the reconstruction of fcov origin in italyin italy fcov has been found in cats with seroprevalences ranging from 39 to 82 indicating an active circulation of fcov in our country pratelli 2008 spada et al 2016 phylogenetic analyses of fcov circulating in italian cats have been based on genes other than s gene such as the nucleocapsid and accessory protein 7b genes that do not allow identification of the fcov type battilani et al 2010 information on the type of fcovs circulating in italy is limited to the descriptions of a type ii fcov in a cat in 1992 and more recently a fcov type i campolo et al 2005the aims of this study were i to characterize the type and genetic diversity of fcov circulating in northern italy using partial s gene sequences and ii to reconstruct the origin and spatiotemporal distribution of type i fcov circulation in italy by a phylogeographic approachthe material comprised feline samples sent to the diagnostic laboratory of the veterinary teaching hospital vth of the university of milan lodi italy between 2011 and 2015 for testing because of suspected fip or for routine fcov screening of healthy animals or cats with suspected diseases other than fip all the samples were collected for diagnostic purposes or within plan of monitoring the rate of fcov infection within catteries and the owners signed an informed consent about the use of residual amounts of samples for research purposes therefore according to the ethical committee of our institution a formal approval of the ethical committee was not required decision 22016 the records of the cats kept at the diagnostic laboratory of the vth were used for the definitive diagnosis of fip the records included results of post-mortem diagnosis using the gold standard test immuno-histochemistry ihc for fip in the case of mortality of animals fip diagnosis was made according to internationally recognized criteria addie et al 2009 felten and hartmann 2019 as reported in previous studies meli et al 2013 lorusso et al 2019 fip was excluded in the presence of persistently clinically asymptomatic catsthe fcov positive samples and the derived sequences were selected on the basis of the following criteria 1 one sequence obtained for each cat 2 known locality and collection date 3 known owner or cattery and 4 sequences representative of fcov-infected cats with and without fipa total of 33 fcov

were observed between the us and germany bf  554 germany and the netherlands bf  8297 and the netherlands and italy bf  1017576 the phylogeographical reconstruction of the significant links showed that after its origin in usa in the 1950s-1970s the virus spread in europe germany in the 1990s reaching nl in the first decade of the 2000s and italy only in the second decade fig 4the year of the first descriptions of fip reported worldwide based on peer-reviewed journals are summarized in table 3
the study primarily focused on the genetic characterization of fcov circulating in northern italy in cats between 2011 and 2015 showing that all the sequences obtained in this study belonged to fcov type i the presence of type i is in agreement with previous studies indicating this fcovtype as the most frequent worldwide pedersen 2014according to phylogeographical reconstruction the fcov type i likely emerged in usa in average between 1950s and 1970s confirming the first description of fip starting from the early 1950s and the subsequent identification of fcov as the causing agent of the disease in cats from the us in 1963 holzworth 1963 the range of fcov origin date that was estimated by our analysis is also confirmed by a previous study indicating that fcov is estimated to have diverged from alphacoronavirues in 1953 vijaykrishna et al 2007 and by the absence of descriptions of the disease before 1950 in the usa pedersen 2009 moreover the description of fip in cats from usa occurring years before cats from other countries suggests the likely american origin of the virus indeed based on available data in peer-reviewed journals the first descriptions of fip in other countries have been reported almost twenty years after the us with the first reports of fip in 1969 in canada and in germany and worldwide starting from the 1970sthe significant migration link that was observed by our phylogeographical reconstruction between the us and germany during 1974-1995 is in agreement with the information on the first reports of fip in germany years after the us landes et al 1984 and suggests that the virus likely moved from the us to europe where it reached germany evidence of north america being the source of introduction of fcov in other countries has also been recently reported in brazil myrrha et al 2019 fcov introduction in countries is likely by animal movements it has been reported that major geographical movements of viruses that need direct contact for viral transmission mirrors those of animals and that key migratory or transport routes followed by host species could also be responsible for virus transmission in areas where the virus was previously absent chen et al 2015 indeed fcov transmission occurs by the fecal-oral route and requires the presence of fecv-infected cats shedding the virus in their feces addie et al 2003 in the case of fcov animal movements between usa and europe may have been linked to cat shows that started in 1871 in uk and have been reported worldwide thereafter hornidge 2002 or to animal movements for breeding purposes it has to be kept in mind that during the second world war cat breeds from europe were almost extinct bell et al 2012 and that after the end of the war cats were frequently introduced from the us where american cat breeders had continued to develop cat breeds longeri m personal communication moreover cats movement may also have been linked to owners movements during the cold war thousands of american soldiers and their families were moved to germany alvah 2007 and it is likely that cats followed their owners indeed air flight companies specialized in pet shipping have reported in their websites that at least from the early days of 1968 pets were flown between the us and germany lauzi s personal communication however further investigations are needed to confirm this hypothesis that may also account for the introduction of fcov-infected cats by american owners in other countries where us personnel and families stationed for prolonged periods after the second world war like japanour result indicating germany being the first european country in which fip was introduced is also suggested by the first description of the disease from samples collected in cats from this country landes et al 1984 compared to other european countries where fip was reported one or few years after germany the presence in our phylogeographic analysis of germany being the most probable origin of the first european subclade with sequences from germany and from the netherlands suggests that fcov type i may have initially spread between these two bordering countries and afterwards to other european countries including italy cat movements between european countries may have been associated with owners movements with imports of purebred cats for breeding purposes or by participation in cat shows in europe the first cat show with cats participating from different european countries dated 1949 and cat shows have been organized in europe thereafter fdration internationale fline 2019the significant geographical structure that was observed by our analysis with the majority of fcov sequences segregating on the basis of their geographical origin has been also recently reported in another study in brazil myrrha et al 2019 in the last decade the presence of different significant subclades with few fcov type i sequences collected from the same country and from cities close to each other in case of italian sequences in a restricted period of time likely represent recent networks in the local circulation of the virus results also suggest that in the last decade fcov was mainly transmitted locally confirming that fcov trasmission requires a close contact with infected animals unfortunately the only italian cat living in a city far from the others as well as the only italian cat included in a subclade with foreign sequences from cats from the netherlands were from two different catteries and it was not possible to establish their previous movementsthe presence of different significant subclades from the same country also indicates that different variants of the virus are circulating at the same time in a country confirming the high genetic variability of fcov addie et al 2003 pedersen 2014 also showed by the high evolutionary rate of the fcov s gene sequences analysed in our work our results also suggest that in the last decade fcov transmission seem to rely on different areas from which the virus spreads a similar result was not reported in brazil myrrha et al 2019 where the fcov 7b gene was used for the phylogeographical analysis showing high conservation of sequences it is likely that the use of a highly variable gene such as the s gene allows a deeper insight of the pattern of spread of fcov in recent yearsfinally it has to be taken in account that date estimations by our analysis may be biased by the absence of available european fcov sequences collected before 2000 in our dataset therefore our results need to be confirmed analysing a higher number of fcov sequences from germany and other european countries that to our knowledge are not available in genbank it cannot be ruled out that pre-existing avirulent feline coronaviruses may have been previously circulating in europe in healthy cats these strains may have been undiagnosed because they were less prone to undergo biotype conversion and cause fip andor because risk factors associated to the outcome of the disease addie et al 2009 were less present in european countries compared to the us indeed the shift in the status of cats as pets after world war ii with number of pet cats greatly increased has been identified as one of the principal factor for fcov infection pedersen 2009moreover it is not possible to establish if the available sequences from the databases truly reflected geographic distribution of the virus it is also possible that available fcov sequences simply reflected the countries with laboratories that first started sequencing because of their scientific interest in fcov studies the availability of fcov sequences from samples collected from european cats before 2000 along with further investigations based on other genetic regions or on whole genomes of fcov would be useful to confirm the geographical origin of fcov in europe by a more complete phylogeographical analysisin conclusion our results highlight the presence of fcov type i in cats from northern italy and the high genetic variability of the s gene of circulating strains our phylogenetic and phylogeographical reconstruction suggests that after its origin in the usa the virus spread to europe our results also showed that in the last decade different strains cocirculate in several provinces in italy suggesting that fcov transmission relies on several hot spots from which the virus likely spreads therefore fcov preventive measures based on control of animal movements from specific geographical areas are not easily defined and quarantine measures and testing of cats are still mandatoryresults also suggest further studies based on archival samples and other genetic regions of fcov in order to confirm our results and to obtain a more in-depth detailed reconstruction of the virus dispersion pattern moreover considering that alpha- and betacoronaviruses have been reported to have their origin in bats maclachlan and dubovi 2016 further studied should also be aimed at the identification of fcov source to better understand if bats may have been the origin of feline coronavirusesthe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest associated with this studythe 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov or the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 sars-cov-2 as it is now called is rapidly spreading from its origin in wuhan city of hubei province of china to the rest of the world 1 till 05032020 around 96000 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and 3300 deaths have been reported 2 india has reported 29 cases till date fortunately so far children have been infrequently affected with no deaths but the future course of this virus is unknown this article gives a birds eye view about this new virus since knowledge about this virus is rapidly evolving readers are urged to update themselves regularlycoronaviruses are enveloped positive sense rna viruses ranging from 60 nm to 140 nm in diameter with spike like projections on its surface giving it a crown like appearance under the electron microscope hence the name coronavirus 3 four corona viruses namely hku1 nl63 229e and oc43 have been in circulation in humans and generally cause mild respiratory diseasethere have been two events in the past two decades wherein crossover of animal betacorona viruses to humans has resulted in severe disease the first such instance was in 20022003 when a new coronavirus of the  genera and with origin in bats crossed over to humans via the intermediary host of palm civet cats in the guangdong province of china this virus designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus affected 8422 people mostly in china and hong kong and caused 916 deaths mortality rate 11 before being contained 4 almost a decade later in 2012 the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov also of bat origin emerged in saudi arabia with dromedary camels as the intermediate host and affected 2494 people and caused 858 deaths fatality rate 34 5in december 2019 adults in wuhan capital city of hubei province and a major transportation hub of china started presenting to local hospitals with severe pneumonia of unknown cause many of the initial cases had a common exposure to the huanan wholesale seafood market that also traded live animals the surveillance system put into place after the sars outbreak was activated and respiratory samples of patients were sent to reference labs for etiologic investigations on december 31st 2019 china notified the outbreak to the world health organization and on 1st january the huanan sea food market was closed on 7th january the virus was identified as a coronavirus that had 95 homology with the bat coronavirus and  70 similarity with the sars- cov environmental samples from the huanan sea food market also tested positive signifying that the virus originated from there 7 the number of cases started increasing exponentially some of which did not have exposure to the live animal market suggestive of the fact that human-to-human transmission was occurring 8 the first fatal case was reported on 11th jan 2020 the massive migration of chinese during the chinese new year fuelled the epidemic cases in other provinces of china other countries thailand japan and south korea in quick succession were reported in people who were returning from wuhan transmission to healthcare workers caring for patients was described on 20th jan 2020 by 23rd january the 11 million population of wuhan was placed under lock down with restrictions of entry and exit from the region soon this lock down was extended to other cities of hubei province cases of covid-19 in countries outside china were reported in those with no history of travel to china suggesting that local human-to-human transmission was occurring in these countries 9 airports in different countries including india put in screening mechanisms to detect symptomatic people returning from china and placed them in isolation and testing them for covid-19 soon it was apparent that the infection could be transmitted from asymptomatic people and also before onset of symptoms therefore countries including india who evacuated their citizens from wuhan through special flights or had travellers returning from china placed all people symptomatic or otherwise in isolation for 14 d and tested them for the viruscases continued to increase exponentially and modelling studies reported an epidemic doubling time of 18 d 10 in fact on the 12th of february china changed its definition of confirmed cases to include patients with negative pending molecular tests but with clinical radiologic and epidemiologic features of covid-19 leading to an increase in cases by 15000 in a single day 6 as of 05032020 96000 cases worldwide 80000 in china and 87 other countries and 1 international conveyance 696 in the cruise ship diamond princess parked off the coast of japan have been reported 2 it is important to note that while the number of new cases has reduced in china lately they have increased exponentially in other countries including south korea italy and iran of those infected 20 are in critical condition 25 have recovered and 3310 3013 in china and 297 in other countries have died 2 india which had reported only 3 cases till 232020 has also seen a sudden spurt in cases by 532020 29 cases had been reported mostly in delhi jaipur and agra in italian tourists and their contacts one case was reported in an indian who traveled back from vienna and exposed a large number of school children in a birthday party at a city hotel many of the contacts of these cases have been quarantined these numbers are possibly an underestimate of the infected and dead due to limitations of surveillance and testing though the sars-cov-2 originated from bats the intermediary animal through which it crossed over to humans is uncertain pangolins and snakes are the current suspectsall ages are susceptible infection is transmitted through large droplets generated during coughing and sneezing by symptomatic patients but can also occur from asymptomatic people and before onset of symptoms 9 studies have shown higher viral loads in the nasal cavity as compared to the throat with no difference in viral burden between symptomatic and asymptomatic people 12 patients can be infectious for as long as the symptoms last and even on clinical recovery some people may act as super spreaders a uk citizen who attended a conference in singapore infected 11 other people while staying in a resort in the french alps and upon return to the uk 6 these infected droplets can spread 12 m and deposit on surfaces the virus can remain viable on surfaces for days in favourable atmospheric conditions but are destroyed in less than a minute by common disinfectants like sodium hypochlorite hydrogen peroxide etc 13 infection is acquired either by inhalation of these droplets or touching surfaces contaminated by them and then touching the nose mouth and eyes the virus is also present in the stool and contamination of the water supply and subsequent transmission via aerosolizationfeco oral route is also hypothesized 6 as per current information transplacental transmission from pregnant women to their fetus has not been described 14 however neonatal disease due to post natal transmission is described 14 the incubation period varies from 2 to 14 d median 5 d studies have identified angiotensin receptor 2 ace2 as the receptor through which the virus enters the respiratory mucosa 11the basic case reproduction rate bcr is estimated to range from 2 to 647 in various modelling studies 11 in comparison the bcr of sars was 2 and 13 for pandemic flu h1n1 2009 2the clinical features of covid-19 are varied ranging from asymptomatic state to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi organ dysfunction the common clinical features include fever not in all cough sore throat headache fatigue headache myalgia and breathlessness conjunctivitis has also been described thus they are indistinguishable from other respiratory infections in a subset of patients by the end of the first week the disease can progress to pneumonia respiratory failure and death this progression is associated with extreme rise in inflammatory cytokines including il2 il7 il10 gcsf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf 15 the median time from onset of symptoms to dyspnea was 5 d hospitalization 7 d and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 8 d the need for intensive care admission was in 2530 of affected patients in published series complications witnessed included acute lung injury ards shock and acute kidney injury recovery started in the 2nd or 3rd wk the median duration of hospital stay in those who recovered was 10 d adverse outcomes and death are more common in the elderly and those with underlying co-morbidities 5075 of fatal cases fatality rate in hospitalized adult patients ranged from 4 to 11 the overall case fatality rate is estimated to range between 2 and 3 2interestingly disease in patients outside hubei province has been reported to be milder than those from wuhan 17 similarly the severity and case fatality rate in patients outside china has been reported to be milder 6 this may either be due to selection bias wherein the cases reporting from wuhan included only the severe cases or due to predisposition of the asian population to the virus due to higher expression of ace2 receptors on the respiratory mucosa 11disease in neonates infants and children has been also reported to be significantly milder than their adult counterparts in a series of 34 children admitted to a hospital in shenzhen china between january 19th and february 7th there were 14 males and 20 females the median age was 8 y 11 mo and in 28 children the infection was linked to a family member and 26 children had history of travelresidence to hubei province in china all the patients were either asymptomatic 9 or had mild disease no severe or critical cases were seen the most common symptoms were fever 50 and cough 38 all patients recovered with symptomatic therapy and there were no deaths one case of severe pneumonia and multiorgan dysfunction in a child has also been reported 19 similarly the neonatal cases that have been reported have been mild 20a suspect case is defined as one with fever sore throat and cough who has history of travel to china or other areas of persistent local transmission or contact with patients with similar travel history or those with confirmed covid-19 infection however cases may be asymptomatic or even without fever a confirmed case is a suspect case with a positive molecular testspecific diagnosis is by specific molecular tests on respiratory samples throat swab nasopharyngeal swab sputum endotracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage virus may also be detected in the stool and in severe cases the blood it must be remembered that the multiplex pcr panels currently available do not include the covid-19 commercial tests are also not available at present in a suspect case in india the appropriate sample has to be sent to designated reference labs in india or the national institute of virology in pune as the epidemic progresses commercial tests will become availableother laboratory investigations are usually non specific the white cell count is usually normal or low there may be lymphopenia a lymphocyte count 1000 has been associated with severe disease the platelet count is usually normal or mildly low the crp and esr are generally elevated but procalcitonin levels are usually normal a high procalcitonin level may indicate a bacterial co-infection the altast prothrombin time creatinine d-dimer cpk and ldh may be elevated and high levels are associated with severe diseasethe chest x-ray cxr usually shows bilateral infiltrates but may be normal in early disease the ct is more sensitive and specific ct imaging generally shows infiltrates ground glass opacities and sub segmental consolidation it is also abnormal in asymptomatic patients patients with no clinical evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement in fact abnormal ct scans have been used to diagnose covid-19 in suspect cases with negative molecular diagnosis many of these patients had positive molecular tests on repeat testing 22the differential diagnosis includes all types of respiratory viral infections influenza parainfluenza respiratory syncytial virus rsv adenovirus human metapneumovirus non covid-19 coronavirus atypical organisms mycoplasma chlamydia and bacterial infections it is not possible to differentiate covid-19 from these infections clinically or through routine lab tests therefore travel history becomes important however as the epidemic spreads the travel history will become irrelevanttreatment is essentially supportive and symptomaticthe first step is to ensure adequate isolation discussed later to prevent transmission to other contacts patients and healthcare workers mild illness should be managed at home with counseling about danger signs the usual principles are maintaining hydration and nutrition and controlling fever and cough routine use of antibiotics and antivirals such as oseltamivir should be avoided in confirmed cases in hypoxic patients provision of oxygen through nasal prongs face mask high flow nasal cannula hfnc or non-invasive ventilation is indicated mechanical ventilation and even extra corporeal membrane oxygen support may be needed renal replacement therapy may be needed in some antibiotics and antifungals are required if co-infections are suspected or proven the role of corticosteroids is unproven while current international consensus and who advocate against their use chinese guidelines do recommend short term therapy with low-to-moderate dose corticosteroids in covid-19 ards 24 25 detailed guidelines for critical care management for covid-19 have been published by the who 26 there is as of now no approved treatment for covid-19 antiviral drugs such as ribavirin lopinavir-ritonavir have been used based on the experience with sars and mers in a historical control study in patients with sars patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir with ribavirin had better outcomes as compared to those given ribavirin alone 15in the case series of 99 hospitalized patients with covid-19 infection from wuhan oxygen was given to 76 non-invasive ventilation in 13 mechanical ventilation in 4 extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo in 3 continuous renal replacement therapy crrt in 9 antibiotics in 71 antifungals in 15 glucocorticoids in 19 and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in 27 15 antiviral therapy consisting of oseltamivir ganciclovir and lopinavir-ritonavir was given to 75 of the patients the duration of non-invasive ventilation was 422 d median 9 d and mechanical ventilation for 320 d median 17 d in the case series of children discussed earlier all children recovered with basic treatment and did not need intensive care 17there is anecdotal experience with use of remdeswir a broad spectrum anti rna drug developed for ebola in management of covid-19 27 more evidence is needed before these drugs are recommended other drugs proposed for therapy are arbidol an antiviral drug available in russia and china intravenous immunoglobulin interferons chloroquine and plasma of patients recovered from covid-19 21 28 29 additionally recommendations about using traditional chinese herbs find place in the chinese guidelines 21since at this time there are no approved treatments for this infection prevention is crucial several properties of this virus make prevention difficult namely non-specific features of the disease the infectivity even before onset of symptoms in the incubation period transmission from asymptomatic people long incubation period tropism for mucosal surfaces such as the conjunctiva prolonged duration of the illness and transmission even after clinical recoveryisolation of confirmed or suspected cases with mild illness at home is recommended the ventilation at home should be good with sunlight to allow for destruction of virus patients should be asked to wear a simple surgical mask and practice cough hygiene caregivers should be asked to wear a surgical mask when in the same room as patient and use hand hygiene every 1520 minthe greatest risk in covid-19 is transmission to healthcare workers in the sars outbreak of 2002 21 of those affected were healthcare workers 31 till date almost 1500 healthcare workers in china have been infected with 6 deaths the doctor who first warned about the virus has died too it is important to protect healthcare workers to ensure continuity of care and to prevent transmission of infection to other patients while covid-19 transmits as a droplet pathogen and is placed in category b of infectious agents highly pathogenic h5n1 and sars by the china national health commission infection control measures recommended are those for category a agents cholera plague patients should be placed in separate rooms or cohorted together negative pressure rooms are not generally needed the rooms and surfaces and equipment should undergo regular decontamination preferably with sodium hypochlorite healthcare workers should be provided with fit tested n95 respirators and protective suits and goggles airborne transmission precautions should be taken during aerosol generating procedures such as intubation suction and tracheostomies all contacts including healthcare workers should be monitored for development of symptoms of covid-19 patients can be discharged from isolation once they are afebrile for atleast 3 d and have two consecutive negative molecular tests at 1 d sampling interval this recommendation is different from pandemic flu where patients were asked to resume workschool once afebrile for 24 h or by day 7 of illness negative molecular tests were not a prerequisite for dischargeat the community level people should be asked to avoid crowded areas and postpone non-essential travel to places with ongoing transmission they should be asked to practice cough hygiene by coughing in sleeve tissue rather than hands and practice hand hygiene frequently every 1520 min patients with respiratory symptoms should be asked to use surgical masks the use of mask by healthy people in public places has not shown to protect against respiratory viral infections and is currently not recommended by who however in china the public has been asked to wear masks in public and especially in crowded places and large scale gatherings are prohibited entertainment parks etc china is also considering introducing legislation to prohibit selling and trading of wild animals 32the international response has been dramatic initially there were massive travel restrictions to china and people returning from china evacuated from china are being evaluated for clinical symptoms isolated and tested for covid-19 for 2 wks even if asymptomatic however now with rapid world wide spread of the virus these travel restrictions have extended to other countries whether these efforts will lead to slowing of viral spread is not knowna candidate vaccine is under developmentat the time of writing this article the risk of coronavirus in india is extremely low but that may change in the next few weeks hence the following is recommendedhealthcare providers should take travel history of all patients with respiratory symptoms and any international travel in the past 2 wks as well as contact with sick people who have travelled internationallythey should set up a system of triage of patients with respiratory illness in the outpatient department and give them a simple surgical mask to wear they should use surgical masks themselves while examining such patients and practice hand hygiene frequentlysuspected cases should be referred to government designated centres for isolation and testing in mumbai at this time it is kasturba hospital commercial kits for testing are not yet available in indiapatients admitted with severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome should be evaluated for travel history and placed under contact and droplet isolation regular decontamination of surfaces should be done they should be tested for etiology using multiplex pcr panels if logistics permit and if no pathogen is identified refer the samples for testing for sars-cov-2all clinicians should keep themselves updated about recent developments including global spread of the diseasenon-essential international travel should be avoided at this timepeople should stop spreading myths and false information about the disease and try to allay panic and anxiety of the publicthis new virus outbreak has challenged the economic medical and public health infrastructure of china and to some extent of other countries especially its neighbours time alone will tell how the virus will impact our lives here in india more so future outbreaks of viruses and pathogens of zoonotic origin are likely to continue therefore apart from curbing this outbreak efforts should be made to devise comprehensive measures to prevent future outbreaks of zoonotic originalthough human coronaviruses cov are known as human pathogens since the 1960s their virus family has gained notoriety in 2002 and 2003 with the first outbreak of the sars coronavirus epidemic and with the recent emergence in 2012 of the mers coronaviruscoronaviruses belong to the family coronaviridae and are enveloped single-stranded rna viruses with positive rna-genomes 1 their genome is about 2632 kilobases long and thus represents the longest know viral rna genome the name coronaviruses is based on electron microscopy photographs which stimulated the imagination of early electron microscopy analysts who thought that the viruses have a crown-like surface consequently these researchers named the viruses according to the latin word for crown ie corona 2 until today all known coronaviruses share a similar genome organization and expression profile of their genomes 16 nonstructural proteins named nsp116 are encoded by an open reading frame orf named 1a1b which is located at the 5 terminus of the genome followed by the structural proteins spikes envelopee membranem nucleocapsidn that in total are encoded by orfs located 3 of the viral genomewithin the family of coronaviruses four genera exist which are named alpha-cov or group 1 beta-cov group 2 gamma-cov group 3 and delta-cov group 4 whereby group 2 coronaviruses comprises four lineages named a b c and d respectively 2 in this context it is worth mentioning that the lineage a viruses of the group 2 covs encode a smaller protein called hemagglutinin esterase he which appears to be functionally similar to the s protein 3as mentioned previously the human coronaviruses have a non-segmented positive-stranded rna genome approximately 6070 of this genome consist of two large and overlapping open reading frames orf1a and orf1b that encode for the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab that in turn are processed into the 16 nonstructural proteins 116 the structural proteins e m n and s share the rest of the orfs of the viral genome while being accompanied by a variable number of the so-called accessory proteins 2 the long genomes are believed to originate from a unique replication fidelity that in turn is originated by a set of viral enzymes harboring rna-processing functions 4in humans hcov infections in general result in self-limiting disease courses that involve the upper respiratory and the gastrointestinal tract symptoms may vary from mild to serious and sometimes life-threatening infections in permissive patients and range from a common cold to bronchitis and pneumonia occasionally renal involvement is seen 515in this context it is important to note that the clinical manifestations of the two most serious but also least frequent hcovs namely sars coronavirus and mers coronaviruses are more serious and frequently are life-threatening however despite the ongoing endemic mers outbreak in the arabian region and single outbreaks in south korea these two pathogens remain limited to single outbreaks in case of sars-cov and endemic zoonotic transmissions in the middle east areain any case none of the remaining human coronaviruses can be identified on clinical symptoms alone and coinfections with other respiratory viruses are as common as with other respiratory pathogens making it difficult to identify which is the leading pathogen in multiple infections 1622to date six human coronaviruses have been discovered ie the human coronaviruses oc43 and 229e nl63 and hku1 and the sars and mers coronaviruses except for the latter two all human coronaviruses have been noted to occur worldwide and are mostly associated with a seasonality that follows the typical flu-like symptom season 2331 as the nomenclature of coronaviruses is far from being logical these viruses are described in the next section in more detail according to their systematic orderoccurring globally the human coronavirus type 229e was initially discovered in 1966 during a trial to identify several newly recognized pathogens associated with the common cold 32 33 the clinical symptoms associated with 229e include malaise headache sneezing sore throat sometimes fever and cough the time span between infection and clinical symptoms is reported between 2 and 5 days with clinical symptoms lasting between 2 and 18 days 3437 anyway as mentioned earlier there is no clinical difference between 229e infections and other respiratory infections caused by viral pathogens such as rhinovirus or influenza a 3437recently it has been postulated that 229e originated from a recombination event between the alpaca alpha-coronavirus this recombination event occurred within the s gene and was followed by a deletion in the same gene 38discovered in 2004 the human coronavirus nl63 has been found worldwide since then and is mainly associated with respiratory infections in children the elderly and immunocompromised patients the virus was consecutively discovered in two separate laboratories in the netherlands one in amsterdam and one in rotterdam 39 40 nl63 infections in general present with mild respiratory symptoms such as cough rhinorrhea tachypnea fever and hypoxia 11 13 4144 and are self-limited a frequently observed complication is croup which is present in approx 5 of nl63 infections 45starting with the description of the human metapneumovirus in 2001 a new era in virology began this era focused on viral discovery methods that combined classical techniques of virology with modern molecular methods the resulting wave of virus discoveries led to another trend in molecular diagnostics in which singleplex step by step methods were replaced with multiplexing technologies able to screen for several pathogens simultaneously during this time hku1 was detected in 2005 at the hong kong university which is also the institution from which the name hku1 was derived the isolation of hku1 was from an elderly patient who suffered from bronchiolitis and pneumonia 4648 fatal infections occur rarely and the infections are indistinguishable from other viral respiratory infections as the other common cold coronaviruses hku is circulating globally 4954the strain oc43 belongs to the longest known human coronaviruses and was identified in 1967 55 56 the discrimination between oc43 and 229 can be performed exclusively by molecular methods or serologically and both viruses have the same morphology and clinical spectrum 55 56much has been speculated even more has been confirmed about the sars coronavirus since it was first detected in 20022003 during an outbreak in china the subsequent pandemic that was beginning was halter due to strict hygienic procedures and intervention measures before a worldwide disaster could occur as a matter of fact the discovery of this virus was possible solely by the first alarming observations reported by dr carlo urbani 57 a physician who was confronted with patients suffering from fever myalgia headache malaise and chills followed by a dry cough dyspnea and respiratory distress in some cases infections of the liver kidney gastrointestinal tract and brain occurred 5862 the overall mortality rate is 9 but is higher with increasing age to date the sars coronavirus has caused only a single outbreak followed by spread to other locations as a result of travel this initial sars coronavirus outbreak is now known to be an archetypic zoonosis outbreak of this virus or other sars-like coronaviruses such coronaviruses circulating in their natural reservoirs should not be excluded during and outbreak and require a narrow mesh of surveillancethe mers coronavirus first came to the attention of the scientific community in 2012 when the virus was isolated for the first time in saudi arabia it causes severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress ards and is frequently associated with gastrointestinal symptoms importantly renal impairment is frequently observed especially patients with an underlying comorbidity are permissive for mers-cov infections and have a high mortality rate 6375 it is important to note that although the virus appears to be endemic spontaneous outbreaks due to imported cases are possible as most recently reported from south korea where the roommate of an index patient left the hospital on his own account and thereby caused a local outbreak 7679 it is worth noting that in terms of the mers-cov it is assumed that the viral spike protein enables the virus to evade the immune system by preventing the binding of neutralizing antibodiesto date it appears that the coronaviruses nl63 hku1 229e and oc43 are well-adapted human viruses that remain in the human reservoir these coronaviruses originated from zoonotic transmission long ago 38 8083 in contrast mers-cov and sars-cov are less adapted to the human host and most likely represent zoonoses originating from their natural reservoirs camels and bats respectively 8290the diagnostic confirmation of a human coronavirus infection does not necessarily lead to a specific therapeutic decision while coronaviruses nl63 hku1 oc43 and 229e do not require special attention isolation of patients is strictly required in case of sars-cov and should be considered in case of mers-covas diagnostic methods neither cell culture-based nor electron microscopy methods are the first choice instead molecular methods such as rt-qpcr lamp or multiplexing methods should be used rt-qpcr protocols have been described by several groups and are the method of choice for the new coronaviruses for mers coronavirus it is recommended by corman and coworkers to use the upe region and the orf1a as targets for the pcr while orf1b has a reduced sensitivity 91 in addition it is recommended to sequence parts of the rdrp- andor the n-gene to confirm the results internal and external controls should be included in every pcr run and are available eg from public health englandfor the other coronaviruses several validated and approved multiplex assays are available such as the respifinder assay pathofinder maastricht netherlands the film array former idaho film assay meanwhile produced and distributed by biomerieux lyon france or the luminex rvp luminex austin texas usa all of these assays have the advantage of a high sensitivity combined with the simultaneous detection of several other pathogens moreover the novel light mix modular assays from rochetibmolbiol could serve as an alternative for coronavirus diagnosticsthe detection of novel coronaviruses within the last 15 years are excellent examples for the necessity of advanced molecular techniques that have to be combined with classical virological methods as an example the discovery of the sars coronavirus has become possible solely due to the sophisticated combination of detailed and timely clinical observation followed by attempts to isolate the virus in cell culture classical method and subsequent characterization by modern molecular techniques the latter method used for the identification of the novel genome of the sars coronavirus was called random reverse transcriptase pcr and led to the amplification and subsequent sequencing of the first known sars genomes 62a further example is the discovery of the human coronavirus nl63 by van der hoek and coworkers 39 these researchers established a novel method called vidisca virus discovery cdna-aflp for this method the viral dna or cdna is digested with enzymes targeting short recognition sequences that are virtually present in all viruses these fragments are then ligated to adaptors and amplified by an adaptor-specific pcr the vidisca method meanwhile was refined fig 1 and is applicable as a sensitive assay for virus discovery also from clinical samples 92coronaviruses have been recognized as a major player in serious airway infections the recent experiences with the mers coronavirus and the outbreak experience with the sars coronavirus have shown that these zoonotic viruses are able to cross the species barrier and along with influenza viruses are the most likely candidates for future outbreaks in concert with newer studies on virus ecology it has become obvious that coronaviruses are ubiquitous pathogens infecting a broad range of mammals that often are in contact with humans thus providing the basics for future zoonotic outbreaksa series of pneumonia cases of unknown origin emerged in wuhan the hubei province of china in december 2019 and the clinical presentations were most similar to viral pneumonia 1 this pneumonia is a newly recognized illness that has spread rapidly across the country and around the world a few days after the initial outbreak chinese scientists managed to identify a novel coronavirus 1 which was later named severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 this virus is classified as a  cov of group 2b and has at least similarity in genetic sequence to severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus sars-cov-1 sars is a zoonosis caused by sars-cov-1 which first appeared in china in 2002 and spread to 29 countries in 2003 causing a global outbreak with 8903 cases 2coronaviruses are viruses with single-stranded rna enveloped by a fat-coated substance this virus belongs to the coronaviridae family and is encountered in humans and mammals although coronavirus infection is generally mild the previous two betacoronavirus epidemics namely sars-cov-1 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov has caused a cumulative case of 10000 patients with a 10 case fatality rate for sars-cov-1 and 37 for mers-cov 34the clinical spectrum of sars-cov-2 pneumonia ranges from mild to critically ill cases the previous studies reported only the epidemiological findings the clinical presentation and the clinical outcomes however more specific information identifying critically ill patients remains unknown recently cardiac injury has been reported to be associated with mortality 5 the mortality of critically ill patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia is substantial 6 older patients with comorbidities and adult respiratory distress syndrome ards are at increased risk of death 6 therefore studying the association of acute cardiac injury with the mortality in covid-19 is essential and justified for prevention and preparation in the hospitals facing these global pandemicsin this systematic review and meta-analysis we aimed to explore the association between acute cardiac injury and mortality the need for intensive care unit icu care acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and severe covid-19

 all of the studies were retrospective observational most of the included studies defined cardiac injury as hs-ctni elevation above 99th percentile there are studies that did not specify their definition of cardiac injury however these studies presumably used similar definition to the existing studies fig 2

coronaviruses covs are enveloped viruses that possess the largest 2732 kb single-stranded positive-sense rna molecule of all such viruses according to the novel classification approved by the international committee of taxonomy of viruses coronaviruses have been divided into four new genera alpha beta gamma- and deltacoronavirus and each genus is subdivided into different species due to their close sequence identity porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev canine coronavirus ccov and feline coronavirus fcov have been regrouped together henceforth forming the alphacoronavirus 1 species within the alphacoronavirus genus carstens 2010the alphacoronavirus 1 species genome includes 7 open reading frames orfs flanked by 5 and 3 untranslated regions utrs the 5 two thirds of the genome encode proteins involved in rna replication and transcription bredenbeek et al 1990 genes encoding the structural proteins are located downstream these include the spike s glycoprotein responsible for virus entry the small envelope e protein the transmembrane m protein and the nucleocapsid n protein which is associated with the viral rna the rest of the orfs encode unknown or less-characterised non-structural proteins the genome of fcovs and ccovs includes two gene clusters encoding non-structural proteins the orfs 3a 3b 3c located between the s and e genes and the orfs 7a 7b downstream of the n gene these genes are not essential for virus propagation in cell culture but are important in virulence or viral tropism chang et al 2010 vaughn et al 1995fcov infections are common in domestic cats and usually remain subclinical in some cases fcov causes a fatal disease called feline infectious peritonitis fip two fcov serotypes exist and can be distinguished by an in vitro neutralisation assay hohdatsu et al 1991 in the field type i fcovs are predominant addie et al 2003 type ii fcovs originate from a double recombination between type i fcov and ccov resulting in an fcov genome with the s gene and the 5 end of the m gene originating from ccov herrewegh et al 1998ccov are also divided into 2 genotypes ccov type i ccov-i and ccov type ii ccov-ii ccov-ii was recently subdivided into two subtypes ccov-iia comprising ccov reference strains and ccov-iib which results from the recombination between ccov-iia and tgev decaro et al 2009 ccov-i strains were identified in the beginning of the 2000s and were initially designated as fcov-like strains due to their high sequence homology within the s gene of fcov-i pratelli et al 2003a pratelli et al 2003b lately an additional orf named orf3 that has not been detected in ccov type ii and other alphacoronaviruses has been identified in ccov-i orf3 is placed downstream of the s gene and encodes a

the presence of coronavirus was assessed by a previously described rt-pcr assay that amplifies the highly conserved 3 end of the viral genome herrewegh et al 1995 all diseased cats were tested positive cats-1 -21 -24 -41 -74 -118 -163 -180 -181 -196 and -198 and out of the 88 healthy cats 15 animals were shedding coronaviruses in their faeces see supplementary table 1 among those infected animals 626 23 were living with at least one dog which is not statistically different p
  005 from the proportion of non cov-infected cats in contact also with dogs 1373 table 1within our range of action we sampled rectal swabs from 3 of the dogs living with cov infected cats and only one dog-1 which was in close contact with cat-22 was shedding coronavirus at the time of samplingsequence analysis of a fragment of the n gene was performed on the assumption that this ordinarily conserved gene would allow significant discrimination of the phylogenetic relationships between strains the sequences obtained were compared by phylogenetic analyses with representative fcov-iii ccov-iii and tgev strains retrieved from genbank the n sequences clustered into two main clades fig 1
 the first clade included fcov-iii whereas the second clade is divided into two separate clusters comprising ccov-i and ccov-iitgev 2026 of the feline samples tested fell into the typical fcov genotype half of them were recovered from asymptomatic infections the others from sick cats but no genetic distinction was evident between n sequences from healthy or diseased cats with exception given to the sequence from cat-57 the nucleotide identity of the sequenced n genes to the reference fcov strains was comprised between 90 and 94 fig 1 interestingly 5 sequences recovered from healthy cats cats-9 -22 -29 -30 and -179 and one from a fip cat cat-163 segregated within the ccov-i cluster the n gene of these strains displayed high sequence identity to ccov-i reference strains ranging from 91 to 96 but less than 79 with any fcovs the n sequence from dog-1 was also grouped within the ccov-i cluster fig 1as the s gene sequences have been widely used to genotype fcovs and ccovs and more recently to discriminate virulent fcov strains leading to fip we investigated the 3 end sequence of s with primers specific to ccov-i and to fcov-i strains addie et al 2003 pratelli et al 2003b chang et al 2012 by using ccov-i primers only the s fragment from dog-1 was amplified and sequenced confirming its highest sequence homology with ccov-i over 95 fig 2
amplification of the 3 end of s was successful with specific fcov-i primers for 1420 cats samples with fcov-i n genes and for 46 samples with n gene clustering with ccov-i fig 2 assays with specific fcov-ii primers failed sequence analyses confirmed that the amplified s fragments from cats -22 -29 -30 and -163 whose n genes clustered with ccov-i strains shared the highest sequence identity with prototype or field fcov-i strains ranging from 89 to 979 and less than 862 with prototype ccov-i strains fig 2 in addition the sequence from cat-163 which died from fip exhibited a leucine residue at position 1058 recently described as virulence marker of fcov-i strains chang et al 2012 the other s sequences retrieved from fip infections also harbour the same mutationrecently a novel accessory gene named orf3 located between the end of the s gene and the orf3a gene was discovered in ccov-i strains this gene is absent in all other alphacoronaviruses studied so far to further characterise feline coronaviruses harbouring an n gene related to ccov-i we attempted to amplify the orf3 gene by rt-pcr thus orf3 was detected in the dog-1 sample and in all but one cat cat-179 harbouring an n gene related to ccov-i conversely the attempt to detect orf3 in a panel of strains with a feline n gene was unsuccessfulthe sequence comparison of the orf3 amplicons revealed 8595 identity with orf3 nucleotide sequences from the ccov-i reference strains the sizes of the amplicons were shorter than the reference sequences orf3 sequences from dog-1 and cat-22 were 595 bp in length sequences from cats-9 -29 and -30 were 568 bp in length and the sequence from cat-163 was only 541 bp in length instead of 623 bp for the reference orf3 sequences deposited in genbank by nucleotide alignment with sequences available from genbank two deletions never described before were identified within the orf3 gene isolated from cats and dog-1 fig 3
a the first deletion located between nucleotides 262 and 289 preserved the reading frame of orf3 and resulted in the loss of 9 amino acid aa starting at the aa 88 fig 3b this deletion was only observed in cats-9 -29 -30 and -163 the second deletion was common to all analysed orf3 sequences even in the orf3 gene from dog-1 which lived with cat-22 it comprised nucleotides 461482 and introduced an early stop codon at the aa 159 fig 3b the orf3 retrieved from cat-163 is shortened at the 3 end of the genecomputer analysis predicted that the deleted orf3 would encode a truncated gp3 protein of 149 or 158 aa while the gp3 protein comprises 207 aa in ccov-i isolates studied so far fig 3b all of the truncated gp3 proteins retained the 14-aa signal peptide and the potential n-glycosylation site described in intact gp3 proteins fig 3bthe data of molecular biology of fcov and ccov have rapidly accumulated since the early 2000s fcov and ccov strains are classified into 2 main genotypes sharing close relationships in particular the s protein from fcov-ii originates from ccov-ii and the s protein of fcov-i and ccov-i share 81 identity which could potentially lead to interspecific transmission of coronaviruses because s mediates cell entry by sequence analysis of fragments from the m and s genes benetka et al suggested that interspecies transmission of covs occurred in a shelter where cats and dogs were in contact they indeed detected atypical fcov strains related to ccov-i benetka et al 2006 however since the orf3 gene had not been described at this time it was impossible to confirm that these atypical strains belonged to the ccov-i genotypethe present study was conducted on cats from private owners with the aim to investigate i the possible influence of the presence of dogs to the prevalence of cats coronavirus infection and ii the genetic characterisation of fcov strains and ccov strains from dogs living with cov infected cats we collected 88 faecal samples from healthy cats and 11 ascitic fluid from cats with clinical symptom of fip among them 19 were living with at least one dog in the same household but the percentages of infected cats and non-infected cats in close contact with a dog were not statistically different table 1phylogenetic analysis was performed on 15 coronavirus strains collected from healthy cats 11 fip cats and one dog by first sequencing fragments from n and s genes fig 1 fig 2 most of the fcov strains were identified as fcov-i with the n and s genes clustering with reference fcov-i strains surprisingly the n sequences from six strains recovered from cats -9 -22 -29 -30 -163 and 179 clustered within the ccov-i genotype whereas the spike gene of 4 of them cats -22 -29 -30 and 163 segregated within the fcov-i genotype one significant element is the presence of the accessory orf3 gene in these atypical fcov strains as this gene was described to be peculiar to ccov-i strains lorusso et al 2008 lorusso et al hypothesised that ccov-i may have acquired the orf3 gene after the divergence of fcov-i and ccov-i from their common ancestor or alternatively that fcov-i may have lost the orf3 gene present in the common parental virus however the description of atypical fcov-i strains harbouring orf3 gene led to the hypothesis that the orf3 gene also persisted in some fcov-i or that these strains may originate from a recombination between fcov-i and ccov-i strains in the present study we identified one couple of cat and dog cat-22 and dog-1 harbouring coronavirus and living together notably dog-1 was infected by a ccov-i strain and cat-22 by an atypical fcov-i strain comprising an orf3 gene moreover strains infecting these animals shared 99 of nucleotide identity within the n gene the orf3 genes exhibited the same 29-nt deletion which yielded a stop codon but the s genes significatively differed it is therefore tempting to speculate that the strain detected in cat-22 originated from recombination with the ccov-i strain from the dog-1 however without extensive sequence analysis of the full-length genome from some atypical fcov-i harbouring an orf3 gene it would be impossible to clarify whether they originate or not from recombination with ccov-i and to identify the putative recombination sitescuriously the orf3 genes amplified herein were found to have one or two deletions never described all had the same 29-nt deletion which yielded a stop codon and four of the six obtained orf3 genes shared another 27-nt in frame deletion fig 3 so far all sequenced orf3 genes originated from italy and all of 623 bp in length lorusso et al 2008 more information regarding the variability of this gene will be necessary to determine if these deletions are essentially restrained to cats viruses or if they are also spread among the canine strainsin this study all cats except cat-163 were living in the same french geographic region moreover cat-22dog-1 and cat-29cat-30 were in close contact which could explain the high degree of sequence homology between the orf3 sequences amplified herein only cat-163 originated from romania and its orf3 sequence diverged from the others with a shortening after the stop codon introduced by the 29-nt deletion fig 3aorf3 belongs to the group of accessory genes which are characteristic of each genus of the coronaviridae family the functions of accessory proteins are often unknown but they are regularly implied in tropism switch or in adaptation of a viral strain to a new host species thus adaptation of sars-cov from the bat to human was accompanied by several mutations in different parts of the genome including a characteristic 29-nt deletion within the accessory orf8 gene chinese 2004 oostra et al 2007 the function of the gp3 protein encoded by the intact orf3 gene is still unknown its biochemical properties glycosylation and molecular weight have been studied by in vitro translation assays lorusso et al 2008 gp3 is a 28 kda n-glycosylated protein with a cleavable n-terminal signal indicating that it may be a secretory protein according to the predictive computer analysis the truncated gp3 derived from the deleted orf3 genes retain the same glycosylation site and the signal peptide more studies on the biological properties of gp3 and its putative truncated counterparts described herein will be necessary to understand their rolefinally our data demonstrate for the first time the circulation of atypical feline coronaviruses harbouring a truncated form of the orf3 gene whereas it was so far described as peculiar to ccov-i strains clarifications must be made upon whether these strains are widespread amongst the cat population and full-length genome sequencing will be required to deepen the the phylogenetic analysis given the dramatic consequences of sars-cov infection and more recently the new mers-cov greater understanding of the molecular processes leading to the emergence of coronaviruses remains crucial zaki et al 2012 in this context the surveillance of animal coronaviruses remains important not only because animal coronaviruses are often responsible of major veterinary diseases but also because the knowledge accumulated have a substantial contribution to the understanding of the genetic evolution and pathobiology of coronavirusesthe novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 denominated before as 2019-ncov is a single-stranded rna virus member of the coronaviridae family the estimates of the most recent common ancestor mrca for the four coronavirus genera of this family range from 10000 to millions of years wertheim et al 2013 the most commented member of the coronaviridae family at the moment sars-cov-2 has a very recent origin based on genome sequence from different sars-cov-2 strains and a yearly mutation rate of 124  103 per site li et al 2020a estimated that it originated on november 24 2019sars-cov-2 is responsible for the current

organization who characterized covid-19 as a pandemic the first one caused by a coronavirus who situation report march 11 2020 sars-cov-2 causes a severe respiratory syndrome in humans being transmitted arguably through different routes ie fomites airborne or fecal-oral by an animal to human and human to humans chan et al 2020 huang et al 2020 li r et al 2020 similar to sars-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and mers-cov middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus sars-cov was initially transmitted to humans by the palm civet paguma larvata kan et al 2005 and mers-cov by the dromedary camelus dromedarius zaki et al 2012 sars-cov-2 is classified as beta coronavirus subgenus sar becovirus with 70 of similarity with sars-cov wu et al 2020 genetic studies from different research groups found that sars-cov-2 is highly similar to the bat rhinolophs affinis coronavirus guo et al 2020 ji et al 2020 li r et al 2020 wu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 other studies comparing genomes of different coronaviruses showed local genomic similarities between the human coronavirus and those from snakes turtles pangolins and minks suggesting these animals as possible intermediate-hosts guo et al 2020 ji et al 2020 li x et al 2020 liu et al 2020 wan et al 2020 wu et al 2020 the most recent metagenomic study on the topic reinforces the idea that pangolins manis javanica should be considered as the most plausible intermediate-host of sars-cov-2 related viruses and that they acquired these viruses independently from bats or another animal hosts lam et al 2020 the authors found putative recombination signals between the pangolins coronaviruses bat coronaviruses and human sars-cov-2 lam et al 2020 which highlights the complexity of the origin of the new human coronavirus although there are uncertainties about the original and intermediate hosts mutation andor recombination among coronaviruses may have enabled cross-species infection letko et al 2020 wan et al 2020similar to sars-cov sars-cov-2 utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as target site to infect cells li et al 2003 li et al 2005ab chen et al 2020 hoffmann et al 2020 letko et

comprises 805 amino acids containing a single catalytic domain ace2 is mainly expressed at vascular endothelium myocardium lungs kidneys and intestines turner et al 2004 mckinney et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 it is a strict carboxypeptidase that hydrolyzes its substrate removing a single amino acid from their respective c-terminal it is responsible for cleaving angiotensin i and ii into peptides angiotensin 1-9 and angiotensin 1-7 respectively both are key elements connected with cardiovascular physiology regulation of vascular tonus blood pressure electrolyte balance and water intake millan et al 1990 donoghue et al 2000 oudit et al 2009 mckinney et al 2014ace2 is a cell-surface non-raft protein with little intracellular localization when binding to coronaviruses the protein internalizes down-regulating activity from the cell surface hamming et al 2007 after sars-cov-like viruses and ace2 attach molecular cascade signal events result in entry of the coronavirus into the host cell simmons et al 2013 showing a successful evolutionary infection strategy kuba et al 2005 showed that ace2 down regulation mediated by sars-cov contributes to the acute lung injury the most important clinical implication of human respiratory diseases caused by a coronavirusthe success of a zoonotic spillover transmission of a pathogen from a vertebrate animal to a human is a complex process it depends on several cultural ecological and climatic conditions as well as features of viruses and hosts olival et al 2017 the efficiency in recognizing the host binding receptor is a crucial step which defines the preference of the virus for a given species tissue or cell type the interaction of sars-cov-2 spike s glycoprotein through its receptor-binding domain rbd happens via an optimized binding to human ace2 domains andersen et al 2020 hoffman et al 2020 walls et al 2020 according to recent studies five amino acid changes associated with natural selection in the critical binding sites l455 f486 q493 s494 n501 located at the sars-cov-2 s glycoprotein would be responsible for this high tropism with human ace2 andersen et al 2020 wan et al 2020 furthermore s glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 contains a cleavage site for furin proteases at the junction of subunits s1 and s2 coutard et al 2020 during viral infection s glycoprotein needs to be cleaved by host-cell proteases into s1 which contains rbd and s2 subunits after this cleavage the exposition of the s2 mediates fusion of the viral and host-cell membranes yan et al 2020 furin proteases are abundant in the respiratory tract and this characteristic of the sars-cov-2 has been considered to be essential for successful infection of sars-cov-2 in human cells lam et al 2020 in contrast the highly related bat and pangolin sars-cov-2-like coronavirus do not have the furin cleavage site which in principle could be a barrier to zoonotic coronavirus spillover moreover human-infecting coronaviruses such as hcov-oc43 mers-cov and hku1 also have been demonstrated to be cleaved at an s1s2 cleavage site by furin proteases coutard et al 2020 however in sars-cov furin-mediated cleavage of the s glycoprotein appears not to occur naturally simmons et al 2004 and the introduction of a functional furin cleavage site in the s1s2 junction of sars-cov s glycoprotein resulted in a dramatic enhancement of cell-cell fusion follis and nunberg 2004changes in key amino acids aa related to an efficient interaction between sars-cov-like s glycoprotein and ace2 are crucial to cross-species infection multi-host infections as well as differences in susceptibility to disease and its symptoms in animal species the evolutionary phenomenon can be evoked to explain at least part of these events and conditions to contribute to a better understanding of this complex process we performed a comparative genomic analysis of 70 ace2 orthologues representative of placental mammal species including pangolin civet bat mink and five new world monkey nwm species parvorder platyrrhini furthermore we describe the genetic variation of key binding sites across human populations our immediate goal is to reveal the taxon-specific variability in ace2 amino acid sequence its possible influence in cross-species sars-cov-2 infection potential hosts and other related topics that can be important and very timely considering the world outbreak of covid-19coding sequences for ace2 gene for 70 placental mammals species were retrieved trough blast from genbank wwwncbinlmnihgov accessed at 20022020 for these analyses we considered 16 domestic and 54 wild species including representatives of orders carnivora n  9 ungulata n  11 chiroptera n  10 primates n  22 rodentia n  9 and others table s1 sequences were aligned according to the muscle algorithm edgar 2004 in aliview software larsson 2014to investigate the variation within homo sapiens we used the ensembl database wwwensemblorg hunt et al 2018 and the uniprot database wwwuniprotorg the uniprot consortium 2019 both platforms used data from the 1000 genome projectthe consensus phylogeny of species based on neutral molecular markers was obtained from the timetree server wwwtimetreeorg kumar et al 2017 this phylogeny is used as a reference by specialized literature following meredith et al 2011 to better understand evolutionary patterns that are acting on ace2 we performed a site model nssite test with codeml package in paml 49 software yang 2007
 which allows for inter-specific phylogenetic comparison of substitution rates in protein-coding genes this test allows for  variation   dnds being dn the rate of non- synonymous substitutions and ds the rate of synonymous substitutions across sites it fits neutral 1 selective constraint 1 or positive selection 1 models to the observed levels of variation to determine which evolutionary model best fits the analyzed data we performed likelihood ratio tests yang 1998 for these we compared the neutral model m1 against the model that allows positive selection m2a with df  2 yang 2007 bayes empirical bayes beb was used to infer sites with a high probability of being under positive selection yang et al 2005 furthermore we classify amino acid variation found in placental mammals ace2 coding sequences into four classes of chemical similarity accordingly grantham score grantham 1974 conservative gs  50 moderately conservative gs  51100 moderately radical gs  101150 and radical 151our results reveal that the m2 model nssite   1 fits the placental mammal ace2 data significantly better than the neutral model 2  258680 p  0001 table s2 considering the m2 model 4 of the ace2 sites are under positive selection a value high enough to infer a non-neutral molecular evolution for this gene as whole at least considering placental mammals note however that this evolutionary scenario is not homogeneous across the different domains of the ace2 protein a parallel analysis bayes empirical bayes beb highlights 22 sites 24 34 91 93 212 228 231 251 255 286 301 387 559 568 607 653 657 658 671 675 689 and 732 table s3 figure 1 with a high probability  95 of being under positive selection all of them being in the active sites at the extracellular portion of the protein residues 18-740 where the ace2 catalytic domain is located of the remaining ace2 sites 69 are under functional constraint due to the negative selection 0  010125 while 27 are with selective relaxation 1  1 for instance the signal peptide 1-17 transmembrane domain 741-761 and cytoplasmatic domain 761-805 see 3 column of the table s4 are more conserved showing little variation across species none of them with positive selection signals tables s2 and s4 we note that ace2 is a critical element in the cascade of regulation of blood pressure and cardiovascular condition among other functions and that these aa changes with a significant signal of positive selection could be taxon-specific related to particular adaptive phenotypes found in some of these diverse placental mammalsafter that first evolutionary analysis we examined all variable sites found considering the 70 orthologues however we choose only the 30 variable sites with information that they are functional andor involved in the interaction between host-ace2 and sars-cov-like viruses towler et al 2004 li f et al 2005 li r et al 2020 luan et al 2020 wan et al 2020 figure 2 shows the aas observed in 30 chosen variable sites across the ace2 orthologues of 70 selected placental mammal species three of them 24 34 and 559 are target sites for positive selection according to beb table s3 the topology of figure 2 recovers the phylogenetic relationship between the major taxonomic groups investigated for example homo sapiens and all other great apes family hominoidea share the same amino acids in the 30 positions and only one divergence from cercopithecidae species at the positive selection site 559 conservative aa change r559k gs  26 figure 2noteworthy our purpose here is not to report each variation observed in the 70 orthologues figure 2 but to point out some thought-provoking findings to support the discussion and the main conclusion of the present study for this we built figure s1 a simplified version of the data from figure 2 where only sites and species commented in the next paragraphs are shownposition 24 which is one of the three sites with high probability of being under positive selection has eight different amino acids segregating across taxon figures 2 and s1 li w et al 2005 showed that the amino acid change from glutamine to lysine at position 24 q24k together with a change from lysine to glutamate at position 26 k26e slightly inhibits interactions with sars-cov s glycoprotein li w et al 2005 rattus norvegicus has this combination 24k and 26e while mouse species mus musculus mus caroli and mus pahari have an asparagine n at the position 24 rattus norvegicus ace2 also has the combination of asparagine n phenylalanine f and serine s at positions 82-84 according to li w et al 2005 this combination in rats r norvegicus inhibits the interaction between ace2 and sars-cov s glycoprotein in addition a histidine h at positions 353 of ace2 in the murine species also could inhibit or reduce the efficiency of the interaction according to wan et al 2020 our study shows that murine species ace2 have only 56 of identity with the human ace2 regarding these 30 binding sites this reinforces the idea that they cannot naturally bind to s glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 on the other hand glutamine q and lysine k at 24 and 26 ace2 positions are found in humans and all primates as well as in cavia porcellus guinea-pig a rodent used very often as an experimental animal however there are differences in other important binding sites resulting in the identity between guinea-pig ace2 and the human ace2 regarding these 30 binding sites being just 70cat felis catus and dog canis lupus familiars are of special interest due to their close relationship with humans their ace2 orthologues present at 77 and 73 of identity with the human ace2 respectively considering the 30 variable sites both species present identity with other species belonging to the carnivora order such as leucine l at position 24 however they also show differences from each other at positions 25 34 427 and 559 two of them are a target for positive selection 34 and 559 table s3 in other words 50 of the differences between the ace2 binding sites of cat and dog are taxon-specific variants that may be connected with specific functions of the ace2 protein in each of these two domesticated speciesinterestingly the five nwm and prossimian species show different patterns than other primates at position 82-84 they present a moderately conserved change at position 82 m82t gs  81 which also represents a change in polarity we note that due to the great number of species that present the amino acid threonine in that position according to the principle of parsimony threonine is probably the ancestral allele meaning that a non-synonymous mutation promoted the aa alteration threonine t  methionine m in the ancestral branches of the catarrhini clade however the ancestor of the platyrrhini maintained the ancestral allele t at position 41 we also found the same amino acid in nwm and prossimian species the moderately conservative modification y41h gs  83 represents changes in charge once histidine h is an acid aa another mutation at this same site y41a gs  112 implies a moderately radical change and polarity difference since tyrosine y is a polar aa while alanine a is a non-polar aa this type of alteration could potentially prevent viral interaction at least with sars-cov according li et al 2005b based on the distribution of the aas at position 41 of ace2 it seems that both nwm and prossimian clades shared the derived allele h also seen in the bat genera hipposideros and myotis as well as in equus suggesting molecular convergencenwm ace2 is also different from other primates species due to two changes in the potential glycosylation sites at positions 432 and 546 luan et al 2020 where arginine n was replaced by serine s the glycosylation was suggested by the presence of electron density at all arginine-linked site of the ace2 n-terminal domain including 432 and 546 and the loss of glycosylation sites may have functional implications towler et al 2004 studies with mers-cov and with its host-cell entry receptor dpp4 indicated that mutations that knock out glycosylation sites present in mouse dpp4 blocked the binding with mers-cov rbd peck et al 2017 the last authors concluded that glycosylation in dpp4 orthologue sites are a substantial barrier to mers-cov infection particularly when combined with taxon-specific changes peck et al 2017we also observed a serine s at the positively selected site 559 which reduces or inhibits the interaction of sars-cov s glycoprotein with ace2 li w et al 2005 a serine in that position is found not only in rodents but also in some species of carnivores that were already considered as possible original or intermediate hosts such as the pangolin manis javanica pangolin ace2 has 85 of similarity with human ace2 lam et al 2020 but only 66 considering just these 30 sites investigated here in addition a serine at position 559 is also observed in the two species of the mustelidae family ferret mustela putorius and sea otter enhydra lutrisfinally we also leveraged intra-specific variation of the ace2 gene using data from human populations available in the 1000 genomes project accessed through ensembl and uniprot platforms this dataset revealed 660 missense variants all with minor allele frequency of 0005 or less 260 synonymous variants 14352 intron variants 67 5utr variants and 268 3utr variants in the ace2 gene in humans many of these have been investigated in case-control or genome-wide association studies for cardiovascular diseases and other correlated conditions see for instance ji et al 2017 regarding the 30 ace2 binding sites selected to present study figure 2 only one of them at position 26 has two alleles segregating k and r minor allele frequency or maf  0002 rs4646116 although we do not have population data for the other species investigated here we observed that there is no relevant polymorphism regarding the 30 sites that promote the interaction between host-ace2 and sars-cov-like viruses in the most studied species of all homo sapiens this finding reinforces the idea that the aas presented in figure 2 are taxon-specific ie characteristic of a species or a taxonomic group where intra-specific variation is absent or negligible also the aa conservation within homo sapiens in these 30 sites indicates an instigating evolutionary constraint whose reasons need to be further studied a search in the genome of the neanderthal homo neanderthalensis and in the specimen of denisova indicates that both present the same aas as homo sapiens in these 30 sitesspecies of the coronaviridae family can infect a wide variety of animals and humans causing severe respiratory enteric hepatic and neurological diseases weiss and leibowitz 2011 in humans coronavirus has caused mainly respiratory tract infections and for decades were considered with little clinical and epidemiological importance until sars-cov and mers-cov outbreaks kuiken et al 2003 zaki et al 2012 today sars-cov-2 is responsible for the covid-19 a pandemic that has challenged governments and peoples of every country in the world covid-19 already killed more persons than diseases caused by sars-cov and mers-cov combined emphasizing the importance of this pathology as a highly relevant public health concern who httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019sars-cov-like viruses use ace2 as their gateway to the host cell figure 2 illustrates the diversity of 70 ace2 orthologues considering 30 potential binding sites to the s glycoproteins of the sars-cov-like viruses this fact opens up a wide range of possibilities for this type of coronavirus whose rate of evolution is high due to its high rates of mutation and recombination li et al 2020a these phenomena that generate variability in the rna viruses explain why they change host more frequently and jump between distantly related species more often than other pathogens woolhouse et al 2005ab davies and pedersen 2008 longdon et al 2014 these facts would explain a predicted origin of sars-cov-2 from original andor intermediate phylogenetically distant hosts for instance bat and pangolin guo et al 2020 ji et al 2020 lam et al 2020 li x et al 2020 wu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020it was also known that specific pathogen mutations are often required to enhance pathogens fitness in a new host longdon et al 2014 this is exactly what happened for the emergence of sars-cov-2 recent investigations suggest the jump across species that resulted in the emergence of sars-cov-2 in humans was mainly due to five amino acid changes in critical s glycoprotein binding sites wan et al 2020 andersen et al 2020 in addition to that the s glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 contains a cleavage site for furin proteases at the junction of subunits s1 and s2 as other human coronavirus hcov-oc43 mers-cov and hku1 but differently than what occurs with bat and pangolin sars-cov-2-like coronavirus and sars-cov coutard et al 2020 these events are associated with the high and efficient tropism with human ace2 andersen et al 2020 lam et al 2020as opposed to the key differences observed across the 70 orthologues in mammals no relevant polymorphism was identified in these 30 ace2 binding sites considering human populations in that sense homo sapiens is a homogeneous primate species at least in regards to the 30 ace2 important binding sites in addition to that homo sapiens has a large population census size of 75 billion individuals currently living in virtually all habitable places on earth including regions with very high demographic density based on these observations we can suggest that the high and efficient tropism is extended to all human populations in addition to demographic and cultural conditions linked to particular human populations that may facilitate contagion and dispersion of this opportunistic coronavirushosts and pathogens are always in an evolutionary arms race several investigations reveal that coronavirus evolved to recognize different host-receptors while others explain the hosts strategies to defend themselves for example peng et al 2017 showed that a hepatitis coronavirus mhv infection drives the evolution of a mouse receptor mceacam1a in this case this event represented an answer to the intense selective pressure from a lethal infection where mhv uses mceacam1a as its host-receptor and changes in critical amino acid residues have led to the emergence of a derived-allele mceacam1b that is much more deficient as mhv receptor peng et al 2017 consequently mice that are homozygous for this derived-allele are highly resistant to death from mhv infections peng et al 2017the first scientific report on the use of ace2 as a host-cell entry portal by a coronavirus involved sars-cov li et al 2003 if this happened before some coronavirus use the ace2 protein as a gateway to the host-cell either with humans or other species we currently do not know therefore and considering only what we know about the history of sars-cov it is a short timeframe for us to expect any evolutionary reaction from the host with a relatively long life cycle at least regarding human ace2 in other words we do not expect to see for the human ace2 in relation to both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 what was reported in the study of peng et al 2017 for the mouse receptor and mhv as a consequence of the very recent evolution of sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein and gain of a cleavage site for furin proteases in addition to the homogeneity of critical ace2 binding sites across human populations and other demographic and cultural factors already mentioned above sars-cov-2 obtained a significant edge in the evolutionary arms race and become a highly infectious and pathogenic coronavirus for humanshowever it is very well known that subsequent to cell entry pathogens can be blocked by neutralizing host-antibodies which appears to be occurring in sars-cov-2 infections in humans conti et al 2020 according to the who the majority of humans infected by sars-cov-2 have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic despite the fact that they have the same aas in the ace2 binding sites as reported here the mechanisms of how antibodies neutralize a coronavirus infection have already been published hofmann et al 2004 reguera et al 2012 li g et al 2020 illustrating that an innate agile and efficient host-immune system like those in young individuals andor in individuals who do not develop an immunological over-response is the first weapon to block the infection of opportunistic coronaviruses eventual population variability in other genetic systems which may also be involved in this heterogeneity of covid-19 symptoms and outcomes cannot be ruled out we must also remember that the ace2 gene has many polymorphisms outside the regions coding for key binding sites as mentioned in the last paragraph of the results section in this way we cannot rule out that some of these snps may also be involved in differential susceptibility for infection as well as to the differences in the symptoms and outcomes observed across human populationson the other hand the differences in these 30 important ace2 binding sites of interaction with sars-cov-like viruses observed between species and taxonomic groups is striking probably impacting sars-cov-2s ability to bind with ace2 in some of these species sars-cov-2 capacity to infect other 42 mammalian species was recently predicted based on changes at positions 31 35 38 82 and 353 in the ace2 orthologues when compared with the human ace2 luan et al 2020 these authors suggested that 76 of the 42 mammal species investigated including pets dog canis lupus familiaris and cat felis catus horse equus caballus cattle bos taurus and sheep ovis aries may bind to s protein of sars-cov-2 the idea of a generalist coronavirus capable of infecting other species of mammals pig ferret cat monkey had also been argued by other authors wan et al 2020 despite of the differences in their correspondent ace2 orthologueshere we have expanded the comparative analysis to more species and sites of interaction between ace2 orthologues and sars-cov-like viruses in sum our results show that ace2 murine species have only 56 of identity with human ace2 and have also several critical taxon-specific changes that explain the barrier to infection with sars-cov-2 for the other species and taxon investigated here however the ability to block or not the infection to sars-cov-2 via this receptor is not easy to predict at the moment preliminary results indicate that a macaque macaca mulatta inoculated with sars-cov-2 recapitulates moderate respiratory disease observed in the majority of human cases munster et al 2020 note that macaca mulatta similar to other species of the family cercopithecidae has only one change r559k relative to human and other species of the family hominidae pan troglodytes pan paniscus and gorilla gorilla
figure 2 we also found a set of aa changes in the ace2 of nwm species which can characterize different patterns of binding to sars-cov-2 making them potentially less susceptible to the infection than humans and great apes earlier one in vivo study greenough et al 2005 demonstrated sars-cov infection outcome in callithrix sp however the pattern of virus replication and the potential risk for infection in nature for this and other nwm species has never been demonstrated therefore callithrix sp although being a good model for mers-cov infection mcauliffe et al 2004 van doremalen and munster 2015 it has not been established as an animal model to sars-cov infection note that mers-cov uses another host-cell entry receptor dpp4 rather than ace2when more in vitro and in vivo functional studies are performed we will know what is the minimum aa combination in the ace2 binding sites and in other critical regions of the receptor that is indispensable for an active connection with sars-cov-2 s glycoprotein until then the predictions are speculative but they can bring subsidies for future studies and strategies to contain the infection and its harmful consequences here we suggest that there are not many ace2 orthologues with tropism for sars-cov-2 precisely because of its ability shaped by natural selection to use homo sapiens ace2 as an efficient and successful gateway to the host-cell to our knowledge there is only one preliminary in vivo study to test the susceptibility of animals to sars-cov-2 shi et al 2020 these authors intra-nasally inoculated ferrets cats dogs pigs chickens and ducks with a dosage of sars-cov-2 and euthanized them some days post inoculation they reported that ferrets and cats are highly susceptible to sars-cov-2 dogs have low susceptibility and livestock including pigs chickens and ducks are not susceptible to the sars-cov-2 on the other hand there are no scientific record up to date of natural infection by sars-cov-2 in animals living in anthropogenic environments only rare press reports that described that cats as well as tigers and lions from the bronx zoo in new york city were infected an observation that challenges previous predictions that this coronavirus would infect a wide range of species luan et al 2020 wan et al 2020 the absence of a veterinary epidemiological emergency during the current human covid-19 pandemic at least considering pets also challenges preliminary results which indicated a high susceptibility of cats to sars-cov-2 shi et al 2020 if there is such a susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection to these and other animals it appears that it is much more restricted than that observed for humansit is also known that viruses that take advantage of receptors with conserved aa sequence have a broad host range woolhouse et al 2012 it is worth recalling that ace2 has conserved the aa sequence in crucial binding sites within homo sapiens but not between placental mammal species investigated here in other words the high mutation rate sars-cov-2 may provide alternatives to infect one of several species but when a high tropism with the host cell is found it can be predicted that the binding region has little if any variation within the target speciesour findings reveal also that an essential part of this taxon-specific ace2 diversity can even be attributed to the positive natural selection since it is a membrane protein related to the water intake blood pressure control and other cardiovascular conditions besides that a common trade-off of adapting to novel hosts is that the performance on the original host is reduced longdon et al 2014 in other words sars-cov-2 is a coronavirus with high performance to infect homo sapiens individuals from any population in contrast it could not infect at least with the same efficiency other species as well as jump and re-infect the original or intermediate phylogenetically distant hosts bats andor pangolins new mutations andor recombination can turn sars-cov-2 into a derived-coronavirus capable of breaking down species barriers again feeding the endless cycle of the arms race between host and pathogenon the other hand closely related species may have similar levels of susceptibility regardless of their distance from the pathogens natural host longdon et al 2014 thus due to the homology that ace2 orthologues of the great apes have with the human ace2 regarding the 30 binding sites investigated here perhaps only they are naturally and equally susceptible to develop symptoms of covid-19 a concern that has already been demonstrated by members of the great ape health consortium gillespie and leendertz 2020our comparative analysis of the ace2 coding region from 70 placental mammal species revealed many variable sites of these we selected 30 sites with records to be relevant for interaction with sars-cov-like s glycoproteins for three of them there is a significant signal of the action of the darwinian positive selection we observed extraordinary conservation within homo sapiens and relatively high variation among placental mammal species our data indicate that sars-cov-2 has similar potential to infect any human population already corroborated by the pandemic character of covid-19 we can suggest that any difference in the rate of infection and mortality of this pathogendisease among humans is related to other factors such as comorbidities of the infected individuals cultural practices demographic density capacity of the countrys health systems suppression or mitigation measures in addition to differences in the sars-cov-2 strains as well as the effective innate immune response from infected individuals the involvement of other genetic pathways in addition to the ace2 protein and the immune system cannot be ruled out either but only the progress of the studies will be able to identify them as well as their eventual role in the covid-19 human pandemicin conclusion sars-cov-2 is highly specialized for infecting humans of all populations ie it is a human-population generalist coronavirus at least considering its gateway to the cell the ace2 in contrast it is not a generalist coronavirus with the ability to infect naturally and easily a range of other species including petsinfluenza virus isolation for monitoring epidemic influenza activity and for the selection of candidate vaccine strains has traditionally been conducted by cultivation in embryonated hens eggs due to receptor limitations such egg passaging can cause adaptive mutations of the haemagglutinin 1 2 these egg-adaptive mutations do not revert on subsequent passage in mammalian cells and they may alter the antigenic properties of the receptor binding site which is also a critical binding site for virus inhibiting and protective antibodies 3 4 in contrast to egg-passaged virus mammalian cell-grown influenza virus preserves the sequence of the original human clinical sampleduring the last decade the worldwide national influenza centres have almost completely changed influenza virus isolation from egg culture to cell culture mainly using mdck cells this change to cell culture was stimulated not only by the relative ease of conducting multiple isolations in cell cultures but also by the better antigenic match of mdck-isolated viruses with field strains increasing difficulties in recovering isolates from embryonated eggs particularly of h3n2 subtypes has also contributed to the change to cell culture 5several companies are currently developing cell culture-based influenza vaccines 6 and the first of those vaccines produced in mdck and vero cells have been licensed and distributed as interpandemic trivalent and pandemic h1n1 vaccines using the conventional recommended reference viruses these vaccines still originate from egg-derived virus isolates or the corresponding high-growth reassortants regulatory concerns mainly with regard to the introduction of adventitious agents are raised if candidate vaccine strains are derived directly from uncharacterised and uncontrolled cell lines collaborative studies have been initiated to investigate the growth and yield of influenza viruses in different cell lines the efficiency and fidelity of influenza virus isolation and the suitability for vaccine manufacture of different cell substrates 7 growth studies with a wide range of potentially contaminating viruses have been conducted and risk assessments have been made comparing egg-derived and cell-passaged influenza viruses with regard to the risk of carrying adventitious viruses into vaccine manufacturing processes 8 9 these assessments indicated that in comparison to manufacturing in embryonated eggs the introduction of vero cells increases the risk of transmitting various viruses into the vaccine process whereas the use of mdck cells reduces the overall risk due to their limited permissiveness to viral growth mdck cell exert the same filter effect for human adventitious viruses as do embryonated eggshere we assess on the presence of co-isolated viruses in influenza virus isolates recovered from mdck cells this article provides more specific data about the kind and frequency of co-infecting respiratory viruses in human influenza virus-containing samples and about the fate of such co-infecting viruses during passage in mdck cellsnasal or pharyngeal samples from the 20072008 influenza season were provided by a clinical diagnostic laboratory located in stuttgart germany these samples from patients with acute respiratory tract infections were obtained by physicians mainly from southern germany and were sent to the diagnostic laboratory in liquid virus transport medium

independent conventional in-house qrt-pcrs or commercially available pcr methods were used to confirm resplex results with clinical specimens these methods and according references are summarized in table 5the total number of samples investigated was 468 positive results with the resplex ii v20 pcr were obtained with 370 79 samples due to 21 double and one triple infection in the same sample the total number of virus-positive results was 393 in the 370 samples of the positive results 317 857 were positive for influenza virus with an almost equal distribution between a and b subtypes 76 positive results with 66 samples indicated the presence of other respiratory viruses the proportion of the different viruses found by the multiplex pcr is shown in table 2
of particular interest were those specimens in which a double infection of an influenza virus together with other viruses was detected in 13 samples 14 positive and 2 questionable results for other viruses were found associated with influenza virus these associated viruses are listed below along with extra remarks about 2 samples that gave questionable results 100150 mfiadenovirus b and e  2 samplesbocavirus  1 sample plus 1 questionable bocavirus result in another samplecoronavirus nl 63 oc43 hku1  5 samples plus 1 questionable coronavirus 229e in a sample found positive for influenza and enterovirusenterovirus  3 samples 1 of which was positive for influenza- entero- and rhinovirusrhinovirus  3 samples 1 of which was positive for influenza- entero- and rhinovirus
these samples were passaged up to five times in mdck 33016 pf cell as described in section 2 in addition sample 750 compare table 3
 was also used for these passages as it was questionably positive for bocavirus and contained influenza b one other sample sample 670 positive for coronavirus hku1 in association with influenza virus b in the clinical specimen could not be cultivated because there was not sufficient materialas shown in table 3 the only virus that was detectable after 2 or 5 passages was influenza virus the other contaminating viruses were lost during passage the table also lists the total dilution of the original sample until passage 2 107 to 109 and passage 5 1022 to 1028 only one sample see sample 608 in table 3 in which no virus could be recovered was passaged at lower dilutions the order in which the detected viruses are listed in table 3 reflects the counts found in the resplex method most co-infecting viruses had lower counts than the influenza virus sample 635 had highest counts for an enterovirus and similar counts for rhinovirus and influenza virus sample 608 had higher counts for adenovirus than for influenza virus however it should be noted that the resplex method is not a quantitative methodin a similar way samples with positive and questionable multiplex pcr results only for viruses other than influenza virus were also cultivated for 2 or 3 passages in mdck 33016pf cells as shown in table 4
 only two passages usually were sufficient to eliminate the virus so that almost all samples tested negative only three of the 54 viruses detected in the original sample still gave a very weak resplex signal after the second cell culture passage one coronavirus with a signal just above the questionable level and an enterovirus and one rsv at the questionable level considering the total dilution from the original sample to the second passage of only 2  104 it is possible that the original sample contained more than 104 viruses and remained weakly positive during 2 passages without any virus growth when tested after the third culture passage representing a 110 dilution of the clinical sample these three samples tested negative by resplex ii indicating no virus growth and that the weakly positive test results from the 2nd passage were obviously due to residual virus from the original clinical sample
table 5
shows the results of confirmatory test of clinical specimens using independent conventional pcr methodsinfluenza virus reference seeds are produced by who on an annual basis to match drifting influenza strains 19 reference viruses are released to vaccine manufacturers after the who recommendations have been published these viruses are not subject to any specific testing for adventitious viruses the corresponding vaccine must be manufactured tested and distributed within only a few months in order to meet vaccination schedules 20 21 22 because of this short timeline conventional broad spectrum testing of the influenza virus seed for adventitious agents cannot be performed in time particularly if one considers that months may be needed to prepare virus from an independent source and specific antibodies against the same to neutralise the influenza virus for conventional egg-derived viral seeds it is commonly assumed and supported by historical safety records that many adventitious viruses are removed by egg passages because cell-derived influenza virus isolates are now being considered for use as starting material for vaccine manufacture information is needed about the behaviour of adventitious viruses during cultivation of influenza viruses in suitable cell substrates our studies contribute such information for a cell line that is qualified for influenza vaccine manufacturethe result presented here should be seen in context with specifically designed growth studies with a wide range of potentially contaminating viruses which along with the results of a systematic literature search on growth of viruses in mdck cells have been published previously 8 9 in those studies a standard amount of 106 infectious units tcid50 per 100 ml culture was inoculated into mdck 33016 cells and the cells were grown for at least 14 days 21 days for slow-growing viruses in cdm growth medium high dilution passaging was avoided but samples of suspended cells and medium were taken at regular intervals to be tested for the virus and an adequate amount of fresh medium was added after sampling to maintain cell growth the agents studied included three human adenovirus types 1 5 6 herpes simplex virus hsv epsteinbarr virus cytomegalovirus parainfluenzavirus 3 and sv-5 respiratory syncytial virus rsv type a and b human coronavirus 229e human enterovirus species coxsackie a16 coxsackie b30 echovirus 6 poliovirus type 1 two human metapneumo virus strains three different rhinoviruses mammalian reovirus-3 bk polyomavirus simian virus 40 sv-40 budgerigar fledgling disease polyomavirus avian c-type retrovirus rous sarcoma virus avian infectious bursal disease birnavirus two avian reovirus strains minute virus of mice mvm parvovirus and porcine circovirus furthermore the growth of mycoplasma hyorhinis and chlamydia trachomatis were assessed in those studies high virus growth was observed for parainfluenzavirus 3 sv5 and herpes simplex virus slow growth was seen with mammalian reovirus 3 and questionable results very low or no growth were noted for the two avian reovirus no growth was observed for the other viruses and agents tested infectious titers declined and were in most cases no longer detectable after 35 days of cultivation only for few very stable viruses such as sv-40 virus titers persited longerbased upon those studies and supported by the results of a systematic literature search applicable to standard adherently growing mdck cells mdck 33016 suspension cells support the growth of only a limited range of viruses in this context the relevant viruses are influenza virus parainfluenza virus reovirus and herpes simplex virus this permissiveness spectrum is very similar to that seen in embryonated eggs 7 therefore like embryonated eggs used in current influenza vaccine manufacture mdck 33016 cells should act as an effective barrier for a wide range of adventitious agents moreover mdck 33016 cells do not support the replication of many avian viruses this is of particular relevance if an avian virus contaminant is introduced into the process by prior passaging of the vaccine virus strain in embryonated eggsthe clinical specimens used for our studies were collected during the peak of an influenza season in february and march 2008 in order to gain more information about isolation rates in mdck 33016pf cells in suspension culture the results of those studies will be published elsewhere considering the selection of specimens the high percentage of influenza-positive results is not surprising but a significant number of samples 66370 or 178 also tested positive for other viruses such as adenovirus bocavirus coronavirus enterovirus metapneumovirus hmpv parainfluenza virus piv rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus rsv except for rsv and piv the same viruses were also detected as co-infections together with influenza virus such co-infections together with influenza viruses have also been published previously for rsv 23 24 25 piv 23 hmpv 25 26 and for adenovirus and bocavirus 24 although the overall frequency was comparatively low those previous reports were all based on pcr detection methods applying a more restricted virus spectrum than the resplex ii method we were unable to find reports about co-infections of influenza virus with other viruses identified via cell culture isolation methods although such double-infected study materials have certainly been used in high numbers this indicates that cell cultures selectively support replication of specific viruses and that in addition the virus identification methods used were less specific or less sensitive than pcr-based methodsfor the purpose of our studies the resplex ii multiplex pcr method was chosen because it combined detection of a wide range of relevant respiratory viruses with simple application one-tube assay rapid results from only one test run and particularly because it could be applied to the available small volumes currently limited information is available about the sensitivity and specificity of the resplex ii v 20 test kit we have compared the novel resplex iii assay and existing techniques for the detection and subtyping of influenza virus during the influenza season 20062007 27 the methodology must necessarily make some compromises for example with regard to amplification conditions during the first cycles with specific primers thus it is not expected that sensitivity will be the same as that of monoplex pcrs when compared to an in-house quantitative real-time pcr for influenza virus detection limit 110 tcid50ml of a fresh influenza virus harvest the resplexii v20 test appeared to be about 1 log10 step less sensitivethe majority of positive results obtained with the resplexii v20 test could be confirmed by other independent conventional published in-house qrt-pcrs or commercially available pcr methods which used other target regions of the viral genomes this applies to all 317 influenza positive samples 10 of 10 rsv a and b positive samples tested 6 of 6 adenovirus positive samples 3 of 3 bocavirus positive samples including one questionable resplex result and 13 of 14 positive coronavirus samples including 2 questionable resplex results differences were found for 2 parainfluenza virus 3 samples for which resplex results could not be confirmed likewise only 11 of 16 rhinovirus samples and 9 of 22 enterovirus samples tested negative in independent pcrs but were positive with the resplex method it remains to be determined whether the observed discrepancies are weaknesses of the resplex system or of the other independent pcrs however the manufacturer of the resplex method confirmed certain cross-reactivities between enteroviruses and rhinoviruses which have conserved 5 utr regions that were used as targets for the pcr primers since it is known that reovirus may grow in mdck cells 9 we also screened many samples with an in-house reovirus qrt-pcr specific for mammalian orthoreovirus 1-3 conserved region of the l3 inner capsid gene samples in which no other virus was detected by the resplex method were preferably used for the reovirus pcr no reovirus was found in 271 of the specimens for which sufficient material was still availablewhereas the specific virus growth studies summarized and discussed further above applied cell-culture adapted virus strains the studies reported here used unadapted field virus strains and technical conditions as applied for influenza virus isolation and passaging these studies confirmed that isolating influenza viruses in mdck 33016pf cells effectively reduced co-infecting viruses after only two passages and a 107 to 109 total dilution of the original specimen adeno- boca- corona- entero- and rhinoviruses were no longer detectable only influenza viruses were recovered and remained the only detectable virus upon further passage high dilutions of the inocula and short incubation periods of only 3 days until harvest or the next passage are conditions that are normally applied to effectively grow influenza viruses these conditions certainly contributed to the rapid loss of the contaminating viruses only viruses that are present at very high titers and which grow very rapidly without adaptation would be able to survive such passagingin a second series of passages we also monitored more than 50 specimens that did not contain an influenza virus but were positive for other respiratory viruses in these specimens interference by competing influenza virus growth was excluded the culture conditions differed as lower inoculum dilutions were used each sampleharvest was diluted 1100 into the culture which is the lowest standard dilution applied to recover very low-titred influenza virus also under these conditions 54 positive results for 8 different viruses became negative after only 2 or 3 passages and after a total dilution of the original specimen by a factor of 2  104 to 2  105 when similar passages were conducted with adherent vero cells vero who seed several positive samples adenovirus rhinovirus enterovirus metapneumovirus and bocavirus remained positive after 2 passages however except for adenovirus the counts did not increase but dropped data not shownthese results demonstrate that under practical conditions as applied to grow influenza viruses contaminating viruses can be effectively removed by passaging in mdck 33016pf cells in combination with their superior isolation efficiency 7 28 mdck cells appear highly suitable to be used as an alternative to embryonated eggs to isolate and propagate candidate vaccine virusesthe isolation of a novel coronavirus associated with an acute respiratory disease in alpacas alpaca coronavirus acov has previously been described 1 the virus was initially characterized as a alphacoronavirus cov based on gene sequencing of a small conserved region of the polymerase gene in the cov genome sequence analysis phylogenetically grouped the alpaca respiratory cov with several important animal and human coronaviruses including transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus of swine feline coronavirus fecov canine coronavirus ferret enteric virus and two common causes of upper respiratory disease in humans hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 the genotype classification additionally differentiated the respiratory alpaca isolate from the cov previously associated with new world camelids a betacoronavirus causing diarrhea and gastrointestinal disease 2 while coronaviruses have been well documented for decades as important respiratory and enteric pathogens of avian 3 and mammalian species 4 and coronavirus-like particles have additionally been described in association with reptiles 5 there has been a notable increase in the number of new coronaviruses detected in recent years with more than a dozen reported since the zoonotic sars virus a betacoronavirus was identified in 2003 67 the apparent emergence of new coronaviruses is believed in part to be associated with their genetic mutability and resultant adaptability to new host species 8 combined with better diagnostic tools among the rna viruses the coronaviruses possess the largest genomes ranging from 264 to 317 kb they are also among the most prone to homologous rna recombination due to their unique use of random template switching during rna replication as well as the innate infidelity of rna replication 67 these virus characteristics combine to generate significant diversity within genotypes of single cov species as well as allow coronaviruses to jump host-species and adapt to new ecological niches 7910 while alphacoronavirus transmission tends to be species-specific experimental exposures have demonstrated that viral replication and seroconversion can occur across species 1112131415 theoretically providing evidence of the first step for adaptation to and emergence as a pathogen in a new host species the extent and role of the novel cov in alpaca respiratory disease is not well understood though strong epidemiologic associations have been made between the virus and the emergence of an acute respiratory syndrome in alpacas 1 the purpose of this study was to complete genetic characterization of the novel alpaca respiratory cov through full genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis in order to better understand the emergence possible origins and evolution of the newly detected virus the acov genome genbank accn jq410000 is comparable to other coronaviruses in genome length acov consists of 27362 bases the presence of a poly-a tail and an overall 385 gc content coronaviruses range between 3742 gc 16 the genome organization consists of six to sevenmajor orfs and includes short untranslated regions utr at both termini figure 1 the major genes are ordered 5-replicase polyprotein orf1a and orf1ab spike gene envelope gene membrane gene and nucleocapsid gene as previously reported for hcov-229e the sequence uuuaaac was also present within the acov genome nt 1252612532 17 this sequence is the putative region for a ribosomal frame shift which creates orf 1ab regions corresponding to previously described orfs between the spike and envelope genes of other coronaviruses were present however the orfs were truncated andor disrupted a putative additional open-reading frame found between the nucleocapsid and 3utr designated orf x was partially created by a 146 nucleotide insertion not present in hcov-229e figure 1 a query of the orf x sequence within the ncbi nucleotide database using a blast analysis 18 returned similarities corresponding to proteins found in anopheles gambiae a malaria-transmitting mosquito 343 similarity and candida tropicalis a yeast present in the normal human flora 290 similarity most accessory orfs do not show homology to other viral or cellular sequences when queried in public databases their origin is unknown and accessory orfs do not seem to be essential for viral replication in tissue culture 10nucleotide similarity analysis of the acov full-length genome clearly placed the virus within the alphacoronavirus figure 2 within this group the acov was most similar to hcov-229e at the nucleotide level 922 and less than 70 similar to hcov nl63 also the acov had less than 50 genome similarity when compared to the previously reported coronavirus 2 associated with severe diarrhea in alpacas genbank accn dq915164 additional characteristics common to the acov and other alphacoronaviruses include the length of the genome gene organization a potential small orf downstream of the nucleocapsid gene and an transcription-regulating sequence trs with a core sequence cs sequence aacuaaa that was found throughout the genome 19 for example trs was found upstream of the spike membrane and truncated orf4a genes the same sequence was also found overlapping the beginning of the orf x gene while the sequence aucuaaa was found upstream of the nucleocapsid gene this transcription-regulating sequence with a core sequence coupled with the lack of a hemagglutininesterase he gene clearly supports the inclusion of acov into the alphacoronavirus groupdue to the overall similarity the acov genome was compared with the genes from the previously described hcov-229e genbank accession no af304460 figure 1 table 1 the nucleotide pairwise  identities ranged from 867942 nucleocapsid  lowest spike  highest the amino acid pairwise identities ranged from 871950 with the nucleocapsid having the lowest and the pol 1ab having the highest identity the acov spike gene is 3510 nucleotides in length and is preceded by the common transcription-regulating sequence trs with a core sequence cs sequence for alphacoronaviruses aacuaaa 20 the spike gene is predicted to encode a protein of 1170 amino acids a class i viral fusion protein 21 containing 30 potential n-glycosylation sites of which only 22 are predicted to be glycosylated figure 3 netnglyc 10 server 22 the pattern found in acov is essentially identical to the hcov-229e spike protein since hcov-229e utilizes the aminopeptidase n protein of their natural host as receptor a careful assumption is made that acov also uses the same receptor mechanism 8 a basic amino acid cleavage site was not detected within the acov sequence as has been reported for other coronaviruses 23due to the striking genomic similarity between the acov and hcov-229e a nucleotide comparison of spike gene sequences from different coronaviruses was performed again the acov was most similar to hcov-229e figure 4 nucleotide comparison of spike gene sequences from the acov and isolates of hcov-229e covering a span of five decades was analyzed and the acov was observed to be most similar to hcov-229e viruses isolated in the 1960s to early 1980s figure 5 the nucleocapsid protein one of the most abundant viral proteins is involved in replication processes assembly and immunity during viral infection 2425 the acov nucleocapsid gene is 1158 nt long encoding a protein of 368 amino acids a 133 nucleotide difference resulting in 129 amino acid differences were detected between acov and hcov-229e it is interesting to note that more differences were detected between the nucleocapsid genes of the two viruses than between the spike genes acov was isolated out of lung tissue of an alpaca with respiratory symptoms using a continuing feline renal cell line cytopathogenic effects were detected as viral plaques six days post inoculation in the first passage 1 virus was stored at 80 c until use in small aliquots viral rna was extracted from cell culture fluid containing the acov using the magmax-96 viral rna isolation kit life technology grand island ny usa or high pure rna isolation kit roche indianapolis in usa as described in the manufacturers instructionsa two-step reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr was used to produce overlapping dna fragments from the acov rna table 1 reverse transcriptase reactions were performed using the monsterscript 1st-strand cdna synthesis kit epicentre biotechnologies madison wi usa briefly 5 l of acov rna was mixed with 9 l of water and 1 l of acov genome specific primer 20 m and then incubated at 65 c for 1 minute followed by placing the tube on ice for 1 minute next 4 l of 5 premix was added to the mixture along with 1 l of rt enzyme the mixture was incubated at 42 c for 5 minutes and then 60 c for 1 hour the reaction was terminated by incubation at 90 c for 5 minutes the cdna was used immediately as a template for pcr or stored at 20 c for later use for pcr the failsafe pcr system epicentre biotechnologies madison wi was used briefly 1 l of cdna from a rt reaction was mixed with 925 l of water 1 l of acov fragment specific forward primer 20 m supplementary table 1 1 l of acov fragment specific reverse primer 20 m table 1 025 l of taq enzyme and 125 l of the predetermined best premix buffer for each reaction the pcr was performed using the thermocycling protocol of 95 c for 2 minutes followed by 3545 cycles of 95 c for 30 seconds 5060 c for 30 seconds 72 c for 13 minutes followed by a 7 minute elongation step at 72 c the specific annealing temperature and elongation times were fragment-specific and varied based on the calculated melting temperature for each primer set and the size of the fragment being amplified dna fragments representing the 5 and 3 ends of the acov genome were amplified using the firstchoice rlm-race kit life technology grand island ny usa per the manufacturers recommended procedure the primer sets used to amplify the acov overlapping dna fragments are listed in the supplementary table 1 the specific primer sets were designed to the full-length human coronavirus 229e sequence genbank accession  af304460 some of the primer sequences contain mismatches when compared to the resultant acov genome the rt-pcr amplification and internal sequencing primers sequences not shown were designed using freely available primer selection programs available through integrated dna technologies 26some rt-pcr fragments were cloned into pcr xl-topo life technology grand island ny usa following the manufacturers recommendations to facilitate dna sequencing and subsequent genome assemblythe overlapping dna fragments corresponding to the acov full-length genome were sequenced by automated sanger sequencing functional biosciences madison wi usa the genome coverage for the sequencing of the acov genome was approximately three-times coverage using sanger sequencing all dna sequence data assembly and phylogenetic analyses were performed with geneious pro 503 biomatters newark nj usathe novel alpaca coronavirus described here was isolated during an outbreak of severe respiratory disease and associated abortions in alpaca in 2007 following co-mingling of a large number of animals at a national exposition and sale 1 subsequent large outbreaks of the disease have not been reported leaving questions remaining as to the origins of the outbreak virus as well the persistence of acov in the national alpaca population similarities between the whole genome sequences of acov and hcov-229e a coronavirus first isolated around 1960 2728 are evident though speculative the similarities suggest a transmission event between humans and alpacas molecular studies suggest the possibility that hcov-229e was acquired by humans from a host switching event a few hundred years ago and most likely involved bats 29 therefore it is not surprising to find bat cov isolated from hipposideros bat species so closely grouped with the hcov-229e and acov viruses in the phylogenetic analysis of the nucleocapsid gene although it is possible that the speculative transmission event between humans and camelids was recent the evolutionary ancestor appears more closely related to hcov-229e viruses isolated around 1960 and acovs may more realistically have been circulating for decades at low levels in alpaca populations new world camelids were introduced into the us as recently as 1985 meaning associated health management and diagnostic medicine practices are still relatively new it is not unreasonable to assume that acov could have caused respiratory disease in individual animals and herds without accurate diagnosis for decades in the united states alpacas are generally maintained in small herds where exposure to new infectious agents would occur primarily when unrelated naive and actively shedding animals are co-mingled this occurred prior during the 2007 outbreak and helps to explain the large number of severely affected animals at a single point in time most alphacoronaviruses including acov utilize aminopeptidase n of their natural host as a receptor and host tropism differences of viruses are caused by the ability of their spike proteins to detect small species-specific amino acid differences in the aminopeptidase n 813 despite the host specificity of this receptor all of those viruses are known to bind and utilize feline aminopeptidase n suggestive of a common coronavirus ancestor infecting feline species 30 this would explain the ability to grow acov on feline origin cell lines such as crandell-feline kidney cells crfk 31 and the failure to propagate virus on numerous other mammalian cell lines 1due to the severe clinical signs associated with acov the camelid industry has expressed interest in the use of vaccination as a possible disease control option the question was raised if a potential use of the bovine coronavirus vaccine might protect camelid species from the respiratory acov evaluating the sequence data due to potential binding mechanism of the acov as a alphacoronavirus shows a completely different pattern compared to the enteric alpaca coronavirus and the bovine coronavirus both belonging in the betacoronavirus group betacoronaviruses are known for using mostly sialic acid binding activity for viral entry 32 whereas alphacoronaviruses can utilize aminopeptidase n binding as a mechanism based on genome sequencing information it is presumed that vaccines targeting betacoronaviruses will likely not prevent infection with alphacoronaviruses such as acov due to the different cell entry mechanismthe spike gene has the critical role of virus entry and membrane fusion processes in the host cell however work with chimeric viruses also shows the spike protein can influence tropism and pathogenesis of certain coronaviruses 333435 it is interesting to note that the spike genes which tend to contain hypervariable regions for the acov and hcov-229e are more similar to each other than the nucleocapsid genes evolutionary studies monitoring hcov-229e found only limited variation within the s gene nucleotide sequences in contrast to the evolutionary pattern of spike genes in other human coronaviruses 3637 suggesting the spike protein is evolutionarily stabile nucleocapsid sequence comparisons among feline coronavirus isolates suggest the mutation patterns can be associated with geographic origin rather than with virulence patterns 38 it would be interesting to compare nucleocapsid sequence of south american hcov-229e strains to the acov nucleocapsid strainthe acov described in this sequence analysis has several unique characteristics the virus has a truncated or disrupted orf 4a4b which has been reported for other but not all hcov-229e isolates 39 whether this orf truncation is real or a laboratory artifact in vitro growth in cell culture remains to be elucidated also as compared to hcov-229e the acov has an extra putative orf x overlapping the 3 end of the nucleocapsid gene further laboratory experiments will be required to determine if this gene is expressed and if so the proteins in vivo function it is critical to characterize and understand new and emerging viruses particularly in the context of zoonosis whether transmitted from animal to man or man to animal coronaviruses considered the most frequent source of the common cold in humans are also widely dispersed throughout mammalian and avian populations they have shown an ability to jump species resulting in mild to serious zoonotic disease threats the current acov genomic data provides strong evidence of an evolutionary relationship between hcov-229e and acov whether the virus represents a recent cross-species transmission or a more distant transmission between humans and alpacas is yet to be determined it would be interesting to analyze south american hcov-229e isolates that were obtained in different years to determine the genetic similarities to the acov this line of investigation might shed more light on the possibility of human to alpaca or alpaca to human transmission events and help to calculate when such an event might have occurred to understand the past and anticipate the future of sarscov2 we must think out of the box a detour will help us see how wrong it is to ask for the necessity of a unique origin this will allow us to evade the unfortunate consequences of contemplating only one virus whereas there is a continuum of variants likely to display a variety of disease phenotypes eg see yao et al 2020 as an illustration here is an answer to the straightforward question that of the origin of homo sapiens just a few days ago yet another study based on the analysis of the genomes of icelanders established that this population stemmed from h sapiens ancestors who had hybridized with another homo species homo neanderthalensis and that directly or possibly indirectly their mongrel ancestors had also some homo denisova genes and perhaps genes from yet another descent skov et al 2020 but the real situation is even worse and it necessarily makes our origins extremely fuzzy we have 46 chromosomes our ape cousins have 48 we know that our chromosome 2 is a headtohead fusion of two separate chromosomes in apes stankiewicz 2016 it is rather unlikely that this fusion event happened simultaneously in the matching chromosome pairs of a fertilized egg it must have been a single rare event in a gamete of a member of an ancestral ape group producing a single gamete hence with half the chromosome complement of most cells with 23 chromosomes instead of 24 following mating the parent animal produced an offspring with 47 chromosomes an unbalanced number which generated gametes with an uneven number of chromosomes assuming that this did not affect its fertility through mating the mutant ape produced a progeny half of which with the right number of chromosomes in its normal parent 48 and half with 47 again in a social group this led to a small but significant cluster of individuals with 47 chromosomes of both sexes mixing up with normal animals perhaps because of some tendency for homogamyafter all the animals with 47 chromosome may have displayed a recognizable phenotype morris 1999a couple with 47 chromosomes happened to mate assuming mendelian standard inheritance this initiated a progeny that carried chromosomes in the proportions 14 48 12 47 and 14 46 now the individuals carrying 46 chromosomes could mate with any of those members and after several generations a stable colony of members with 46 chromosomes could start developing progressively adapting to this new genome presumably across many generations the origins of these ancestral hominins cannot be ascribed to one particular individual it is a continuum and this led to the homo genus which evolved and further split into individual species that as we know now interbred further expanding the palette of the continuumthe same is much likely to be true when we look into the origins of the present sarscov2 population of viruses it comes from a continuum of viruses with related genomes besides bats joffrin et al 2020 a variety of animals have been suggested to be carriers of the immediate ancestor of the present virus including snakes zhang et al 2020a pangolins zhang et al 2020b and even bovines luan et al 2020 or dogs xia 2020 why is this so important obtaining biological insight into the phenotypes associated with each viral genotype is the most interesting corollary of a multiple origin but it may also answer a sociopolitical question that repeats itself over the years namely that which considers that the virus could have escaped deliberately or accidentally from a laboratory despite stringent biosafetybiosecurity precautionsthe idea that the virus escaped from a laboratory is not new in fact back in 2003 quite a few people in china were afraid that the virus had been constructed and released in their country by some rogue american foe the rumour was so widespread that it even reached the institute created in hong kong as a joint venture between the institut pasteur in paris and the university of hong kong the hkupasteur research centre ltd httpwwwnormalesuporgadanchinarchives-hkuprcexpo2001html to obtain evidence relevant to the rumour those working on the in silico floor of the laboratory were asked to study whether the virus genome displayed scars of recombination patterns to their great surprise they found that these families of viruses are likely to have suffered a considerable number of recombination events notwithstanding convergent evolution zhang et al 2005 this made the possibility that they were created by human manipulation extremely unlikely the exact same question about sarscov2 has been raised and the answer is again the virus is certainly of natural origin andersen et al 2020 importantly there appear to be observations that suggest that a virus causing severe cases of atypical pneumonia already existed in middecember 2019 in china guo et al 2020 possibly even in italy in france and in the united states in january 2020 not initially ascribed to covid19 it could well be that early ancestors of sarscov2 producing asymptomatic infections had already spread before causing clinicalcovid19disease forster et al 2020another confusing phenotype of sarscov2 viruses is that they propagate the disease according to quite different scenarios random person to person transmission riou and althaus 2020 transmission within clusters shim et al 2020 and superspreader transmission hodcroft 2020 these different modes may be characterized by differences in the way they channel evolution of each virus variant in particular we may anticipate two major scenarios of evolution competing forms of the disease between patients hosting different virus mutants and coinfection of a single patient with two or more mutants of the virus allowing it to generate recombinantsin wuhan hospitals the healthcare personnel observed that the clinical characteristics of covid19 patients at the onset of the disease became progressively different possibly as new coronavirus variants emerged and spread over time and generations among a variety of other studies a preprint published on march 2 by investigators working in wuhan showed that it was as if there had been competition between different forms of the disease assumed by the authors to result from infection by different strains of the virus two major strains infecting different people in wuhan chen et al 2020 this work established that sarscov2 was evolving gradually into two major forms one causing flulike symptoms and another causing subclinical infections and some asymptomatic carriers this was likened to a somewhat similar course of the sars outbreak in 2003 ng et al 2003 with apparently two epidemic courses with different transmission routes occurring in wuhan danchin et al 2020 such a course of the epidemic might possibly reflect a progressive attenuation of the virus but this interpretation requires investigation because a discrepancy in the way patients were officially recorded could have had the same effect alternatively the evolution of the disease might have been the opposite first following an asymptomatic course succeeded by cases with more severe outcomes the fact is if there is competition between virus variants at the population level the viruses might create population mosaics of disease characteristicsinfection fatality rates transmission immune status etc the apparent discrepancy between situations in different countries or regions may reflect virus evolution and viral variants so it is crucial to obtain a fine picture of the virus genome variations across countries eventually correlated with associated disease phenotypes it is also important when possible to get time series of the virus evolution within individual patients over the course of infectionsof course human polymorphism also plays a role in the spread and severity of the disease with hla involved in antigen presentation rubino et al 2020 and carbohydrate protein tagging associated with the level of transmission le mercier et al 2019 the blood group antigen h variants type o being perhaps less prone to be infected zhao et al 2020 and what about the lewis secretion system found to be important for merscov but not yet explored for sarscov park et al 2019 and perhaps even the gut microbiome gou et al 2020 in the context of human polymorphism competition between viruses would be more prevalent in populations sharing a common environment such as hospitals dormitories or care homes resulting in some form of mosaicism of the disease phenotypes associating genetic traits both of the virus and of the hosts if this type of scenario is responsible for disease mosaicism it could be essential to understand if we wish to design an effective vaccineat a finer level of granularity as the virus evolves within patientsat a rate that is not insignificant li et al 2020people in families may be infected by different variants creating family mosaicism a local competition could thus be initiated between virus variants exhibiting different phenotypes such as one causing more severe symptoms and another causing milder symptoms but having enhanced transmission here it is essential to remember that from the point of view of a virus success is not measured by severity of morbidityrapidity of mortality but by the ability to produce and transmit a sizeable progeny for a long time the sampling and viral sequencing of all members of households with an infected member is thus an important endeavour this is especially important as in the long term we can expect the virus to progressively attenuate as it slowly sheds its cytosine complement for metabolic reasons discussed elsewhere danchin and marlire 2020 this hopeful situation would however be drastically altered if the organization of social groups clusters in particular led to increase its propensity to recombinewhen the level of infection of a population becomes significanteither through natural transmission or when authorities try to enforce herd immunity and also in cases happening in situations of sizeable case clusterssome individuals become multiplyinfected with different variants of the virus in this condition there may be competition between the variants within an infected individual resulting in mosaicism of pathology within an individual most mutations have either no effect or deleterious effects affecting the fitness of the virus with very few promoting sustained or increased virus survival and propagation only the latter will survive however these will in the long term tend to attenuate the multiplicationvirulence of the virus there is nevertheless one family of mutations which may transiently during the course of the epidemic improve the fitness of the virus namely stealth mutations that result in loss of a character of the virus metabolism recognized by innate immunity cases in point are mutations that alter cytosine metabolism when loss of cytosines in the genome of the virus will make it somewhat more resistant to the antiviral interferoninduced protein viperin danchin and marlire 2020 this evolution which may be beneficial for the virus at some point cannot last over many generations and attenuation of the symptoms of the disease is likely to happen sooner or later as highly evolved variants replaced the initial populationattenuated viruses have traditionally been exploited for vaccination however while the generation of attenuated strains that could be deployed as vaccines was observed very early on in the case of yellow fever virus theiler and smith 1937 this took decades to be replicated for other viruses sabin and boulger 1973 determination of variant success over time could be instructive in this respectalready in 1935 muller remarked that spontaneous mutations in a species would progressively lead to decrease its fitness and its evolutionary landscape ending up in its demise muller 1964 thus when viruses evolve as separate entities without contact with other sources of genes they are doomed to suffer the constraints of mullers ratchet eg see fig 1 however it is known that coronaviruses are prone to recombine when a cell is coinfected by two or more viruses of different genome type lai 1995 graham and baric 2010 this has also been demonstrated with bacterial rna viruses chao 1990 thus coinfection of the same cell with different variants of a virus or even different viruses of the same family eg positivesense rna viruses may lead to recombination possibly restoring an ancestral phenotype this is a critical process to counteract progressive loss of fitness as mutations accumulateas discussed at the beginning of this article it is likely that recombination plays a key role in evolution of coronaviruses ie the sarscov2 virus is a mosaic that has recruitedis recruiting a variety of functions via integration of pieces of genomes from different sources this feature may prove to be a significant challenge in the search for the origin of the sarscov2 virus especially in hosts such as bats which host many different types of coronaviruses joffrin et al 2020 viruses multiply extremely rapidly wild animals are coinfected by many viruses simultaneously and this creates an enormous evolutionary landscape for viruses to explore this is consistent with the idea discussed in the case of the origin of h sapiens and especially because we do not have a clear index patient that there is not one origin of the sarscov2 but a continuum and this raises the question has early sarscov2 or a precursor of it been a member even transiently and even possibly a long time ago of the microbiomes of some members of the community especially workers in wet markets prior to mutating to greater pathogenicity and causing disease have attenuated variants of sarscov2 now become members of the microbiomes of some people only the testing of large numbers of asymptomatic members of society will answer this questionwe have tried to summarize here reasons to hope for a positive outcome of the outbreak of covid2 namely via progressive attenuation of the virus armengaud et al 2020 there is precedence in the epidemic that killed scores of pigs back in the 1980s the infective coronavirustransmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus tgevhas both enteric and respiratory tropism and causes an extremely severe disease a mutation with essentially lung tropism appeared in some herds laude et al 1984 pensaert et al 1986 after a few years of evolution this variant of the virulent tgev with a deletion in the tropismdetermining region of the spike protein that is used to bind specific receptors of host cells and trigger membrane fusion had lost its virulence while propagating worldwide and essentially acting as a natural vaccine schwegmannwessels and herrler 2006 this makes that tgev is no longer of major concern for pig breeding despite the recent emergence of yet another swine acute diarrhoea syndrome sads coronavirus coronavirus zhou etal 2019 thus besides this optimistic exit from the covid19 epidemic we should be concerned by the high recombination potential of the virus which may erase the mutations that allowed it to evolve towards attenuation because infection clusters allow for high levels of virus recombination it is critical to prevent as far as possible social activities that lead to creation of clusters of infection yong et al 2020 indeed at this very moment it seems clear that much of the difficulty to control the disease comes from the failure to break down clustersto investigate some of the scenarios we have sketched above we consider it will be useful to trace the sequence evolution of the sarscov2 virus from its earliest stages and associate genotype with phenotype and disease granularity for this it would be very useful to obtain information on virus sequence and viral loads inpreoutbreak clinical samples from asymptomatic individuals in wuhan where the outbreak occurred how to obtain these retrospectively potential sources might be stored buccal swab samples from patients presenting with pharyngitislaryngitis stored clinical samples taken from patients presenting for other conditions stored samples from postmortem examinations here viral loads in various organs would inform about tropism etc especially from people working in wet markets and their families if they existpreoutbreak clinical samples from asymptomatic individuals in countries where the outbreak is delayed focusing particularly on family members and friends of individuals showing symptomslongitudinal repeat sampling of symptomatic individuals over the course of the infection and of their household memberssampling of different organs of individuals having succumbed to covid19
bovine coronavirus bcov is widespread in cattle and wild ruminant populations resulting in neonatal calf diarrhea and winter dysentery in adult cattle as well as upper and lower respiratory tract infection bcov is associated with the bovine respiratory disease complex brd a leading cause of morbidity of young cattle worldwide with large economic costs due to mortality treatment and impeded growth performances and pose a threat to public health as a result of antibiotic use having a multifactorial etiology brd is a complex disease triggered by the presence of one or several viruses andor bacteria 1 favored by an altered state of the host immune system 2 and usually disturbed environmental factors 3 and several physical and biological stressors 245 viruses associated with brd are capable of initiating a cascade of events such as immune suppression 26 respiratory epithelium damage 7 and altering commensal microbiota and local biofilm 8910 thus leading to complex secondary bacterial infections 81011bcov is a pneumoenteric virus frequently isolated from the fecal samples of diarrheic calves 12131415 and from upper and lower respiratory tract samples during brd episodes worldwide 16171819 while both forms of bcov infection are widespread with high prevalence among cattle 1213152021 and wild ruminants 22 the putative differences between strains isolated from enteric and respiratory tracts are still not clear and it is unknown whether these differences are related to tissue tropism or simply to distinct times and locations of isolation some reports indeed suggest that all the bcov are similar at genomic and antigenic levels 1823 while others suggest that enteric and respiratory strains are genetically and antigenically different 2425 zhang et al highlighted molecular differences within a single host with intra-host quasispecies and enteric strains more prone to genetic changes than their respiratory counterparts 26 the global genetic and antigenic diversity of bcov is also poorly understood using a short variable region of the bcov genome and with sporadically collected samples from a few countries in europe asia and north america it has been suggested that bcov are segregated into european and american bcov lineages 17272829 with periodic introductions of north american bcov observed in asian countries for example in japan during the 1990s 30 highlighting global movement of bcov likely through cattle tradecoronaviruses are enveloped particles with a large non-segmented linear polyadenylated single-stranded positive sense rna

gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus and are known to infect birds and many mammals including humans 34 bcov are members of the betacoronavirus genus within the coronaviridae family which includes several important human pathogens of zoonotic origin such as the human coronavirus hcov oc43 hku1 mers sars-cov-1 35 and sars-cov-2 3637 and mammalian viruses including equine coronaviruses eqcov 38 canine respiratory coronaviruses crcov 39 swine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus hev 40 murine coronaviruses 32 and bat coronaviruses batcov hku4 hku5 and hku9 41424344 bcov are most closely related to members of the betacoronavirus1 embecovirus species phev oc43 and eqcov and share similarity in genome organization 32coronaviruses pose a constant public health threat due to their low replication fidelity and high genetic variability making them prone to a constant changing pattern often leading to emerging diseases 45 the intensive investigation that followed the emergence of

have emerged from an animal reservoir and very successfully jumped into human causing the current pandemics 3637 based on antigenic similarity it is thought that the human oc43 and canine respiratory

were collected from 16 calves exhibiting acute respiratory disease during 2014 in the southwest of france two respiratory samples per calf four samples per pool table 1 screening for other respiratory pathogens using real-time pcr resulted in the identification of co-infecting agents table 1 including p multocida m haemolytica m bovis and h somni all samples had at least one co-infecting pathogen with p multocida in 34 calves followed by m haemolytica brsv m bovis bpi-3 and h somni table 1 this suggests that the respiratory clinical signs were not due to bcov alone but to co-infecting pathogens a genetic focus was however made on bcov in the present study a greater proportion of bcov were detected in ns samples with lower ct values compared to bal in three out of four pools studiednucleic acids extracted from purified samples were subjected to ngs sequencing focusing on bcov genetic material arising separately from the upper and lower respiratory samples of infected cattle in total five complete and two partial bcov genomes were generated accession numbers mg757138-44 from which the nucleocapsid n gene and spike s gene sequences were extracted and utilized for subsequent evolutionary analysis supplementary tables s1 and s2 attempts of virus isolation in hrt-18g cells resulted in the successful isolation of one strain bcovfranceicsa17lba2014 collected from the bal sample of infected calf in 2014since coronavirus genomes are known to undergo recombination we inferred the occurrence of recombinant breakpoints along the n and s gene alignments of bcov collected since the 1960s and found one recombination breakpoint in the s gene at nucleotide 1101 with significant differences in evolutionary histories kh test between the two loci at nucleotide positions 11100 and 11014089 whereas no breakpoints were detected in the n gene these results suggest that a single phylogenetic tree may not accurately describe the evolutionary history of s gene and data were therefore partitioned for subsequent phylogenetic analysisphylogenetic analysis was conducted using 95 bcov s gene sequences including seven from the present study and 54 bcov n gene sequences including five newly generated sequences our sequence dataset was predominantly restricted to sequences originating from north america asia and europe highlighting the paucity of bcov surveillance and the lack of well curated sequence datasets from around the globe s gene alignments were partitioned at the detected recombination breakpoint to create s gene datasets ranging from nucleotide positions 11100 and 11014089 in both data partitions bcov circulating since the 1990s formed two broad spatially segregated phylogenetic groups in asia and europe respectively derived from mebus1972-like strain collected in north america figure 1 and figure 2 there were several topological differences between the s gene data partitions that occurred both during the emergence of lineages in europe and asia but we also identified topological differences within the asian and european clade suggesting continued recombination among co-circulating lineages following spatial segregation figure 1 and figure 2the asian lineage of bcov was predominated by strains collected in south korea during 20022010 and both s gene partition phylogenies suggest that these strains were derived from strains similar to those reported from north america during 19941998 estimation of tmrca of the south korean lineages showed that the mean tmrca of s gene loci-1 was significantly more recent during 1995 mean tmrca 1995 highest posterior density hpd 1992519987 than in data partition-2 which constituted two distinct lineages that diverged during 1986 mean tmrca 1986 hpd 19801991 however the tmrcas of the two co-circulating lineages overlapped with the tmrca of partition-1 highlighting the co-circulation of multiple lineages in south korea table 2 in addition two strains collected recently from cattle in china exhibited differences in origin between the s data partitions their first 1000 nucleotides appear to be derived independently from strains similar to those collected in north america during 19941998 whereas the second but longer partition was derived directly from south korean specimens collected during 20022010 these results suggest historical movement of bcov between the north america and eurasia landmasses as well as between asian countriesthe european lineage eu-lineage was represented by bcov collected from several countries in europe since the 1990s including france denmark germany italy and sweden however excluding france most bcov sequence data in europe derives from 20022010 there is also evidence that the eu-lineage evolved through recombination as the ancestral relationship of these lineages to m80844geissen-germany1989 differed between the two loci figure 1 and figure 2 indicating that the recombination event breakpoint at nt position 1100 may be at the origin of the distinct asian and european lineagesbcov sequences collected from calves in france between 20132014 revealed a greater genetic heterogeneity in s gene loci-1 11000 nt with evidence of co-circulation of two lineages that diverged as early as 2000 mean tmrca aug 2000 95 hpd 1998520098 figure 1 whereas loci-2 exhibited fewer differences between contemporary viruses and revealed a mean divergence of approximately four years mean tmrca mar 2009 95 hpd 2007520108 when looking specifically at the south-western french bcov sequences bcovfranceicsa21l32014 differed from its counterparts on locus 1 being closely related to a recent north-western french sequence bcovfranceepi-caen2013 but clustered with its south-western counterparts for the locus 2 figure 2 these results highlight a complex evolutionary history that is determined by migration and pervasive recombinationour n gene dataset comprised lower sampling outside of france table s2 all n gene sequences of bcov strains from france isolated since 2003 formed a monophyletic group with the mean tmrca of the contemporary bcov 20132014 isolates estimated during 2004 95 hpd 1999220092 indicating a result that overlaps with the tmrca of both s gene partitionswe estimated the evolutionary rate for the s and n gene datasets using the relaxed clock model and found a relatively lower rates of nucleotide substitution in bcov datasets ranging from a mean rate of 081  103 95 hpd 0508  103 for s gene data partition-1 10  103 hpd 0713  103 for s gene data partition-2 and a lower but with wide-confidence intervals for the n gene dataset mean rate 02  103 95 hpd 0104  103 these estimates were similar to those estimated for other coronaviruses for example the mean nucleotide substitution rate of mers was estimated at 11  103 95 ci 0814  103 69 estimates of the coefficient of variance of the relaxed clock model ranged from a mean of 061 for the s gene partition-1 to 07 for s partition-2 and the n gene datasets and hpd intervals of all datasets were lower than 1 indicating that there was significant variation in nucleotide substitution rates along the bcov branches and also suggesting that the relaxed clock model was more appropriate than using a strict clock modelthe tmrca of globally sampled bcov for the n and s genes was estimated during 1940 and 1964 suggesting the common ancestor for known bcov was about 51 to 75 years prior to the last included sequence date 2015 whereas the most common recent ancestor of the eu-lineage was 19781981 figure 1 and figure 2 the recombination event that likely led to the two main lineages with clear geographic distinction usasia and european lineages co-circulating today may thus have occurred in the 1960s1970sthe selection analysis for the s gene was conducted using two partitions the average ratio between the mean number of non-synonymous dn and synonymous ds nucleotide substitution sites dnds was estimated to be 0310 for the s gene with 28 positively selected amino acids from slac fel and meme table 3 amino acids 35 113 115 447 499 501 525 716 893 and 1239 were detected as positively selected in at least two of the three used models table 3bovine coronavirus is considered widespread in europe and worldwide in both its enteric and respiratory forms furthermore bcov is considered a main pathogen associated with pneumonia in feedlots in north america 15167071 although bcov is no less a very common pathogen in europe limited data is available on its epidemiology norwegian studies have revealed a high seroprevalence in cattle with 393 and 807 in calves and herds respectively in 2009 and 722 in herds tested in 2016 2172 in italy four respiratory disease outbreaks during 2006 were associated with bcov without concurrent detection of other known respiratory pathogen but with the detection of bcov in the intestines in two of the four outbreaks 19 in belgium seroconversion for bcov was detected in 30 of veal calves herds 73 in a retrospective study in ireland 20082012 bcov was the most frequently detected virus in cattle nasal swabs from respiratory disease outbreaks 74 in france bcov was detected in 1763 of respiratory samples collected in two independent studies 75 taken together literature on bcov in europe is limited but highlights the high circulation of the pathogen at the continental scaleit is so far unknown whether a unique or distinct bcov are responsible for respiratory and enteric infections 18232576 as recently observed in austria and slovakia 23 we did not succeed in identifying genetic determinants of tissue tropism nor between enteric and respiratory bcov strains based on published sequences nor between strains present in the upper and lower respiratory tracts based on the sequences generated within the framework of the present study in the absence of viral genetic determinants of tissue tropism the immune status of the animals at the time of the bcov infection infectious dose and route of inoculation oro-fecal versus aerosol may play a role in determining sites of infection 77 in addition the animals sampled in the present study suffered from respiratory disease but as both bcov and co-infecting pathogens were detected a direct link between bcov and respiratory signs cannot be made further studies are clearly warranted to understand the mechanisms behind the differential tissue tropism of bcovamong available bcov complete genomes a minority are of european origins in this study we therefore characterized respiratory strains of bcov from both upper and lower respiratory tracts at the genetic level despite recent efforts there are notable gaps in our understanding of bovine coronavirus dynamics and diversity our results show that the french strains described here cluster with all other europeans strains thus indicating a homogeneous evolution of bcov in europe whereas a greater mixing was observed between isolates collected in north america and europe this pattern of geographical and temporal distinction between strains was previously described for brsv for which distinct phylogenic groups with continent-specific strains were identified 787980 similarly bvdv also harbors a geographic clustering 81 this peculiar evolutionary process could be explained by the relative isolation of europe as far as cattle traffic is concerned according to faostat 82 cattle traffic involving europe is mainly unidirectional with export of live animals from france for the most part to other continents with a negligible importation activity on the other hand the importexport activity between north america and east asia is much more fluid in addition kin et al recently highlighted this important trade constraint on bcov spread at a global scale 28 it is however unclear whyhow bcov brsv or bvdv would spread differently than other bovine rna viruses influenza d viruses idv which primarily infects bovine hosts seem for example to have emerged recently but genetically and anti-genetically similar viruses circulate in europe and north america 2983848586 one may therefore hypothesize that different routes of transmission may be used for the different pathogens in addition human coronaviruses oc43 and 229e were shown to induce short-term immunity 87 if bcov led to similar responses in cattle herds with animals of multiple ages as seen more often in france than in north america might face re-infections with bcov and might maintain virus over long periods of time which would impact the virus evolutionrecombination likely drove the different evolutionary process taken by the asian and north american strains and the europeans strains in the first partition of the s gene dataset the strains m80844 giessen1989 clustered along with french strain d007311979 us strain af058942 ly138 utah1965 south koreans eu401988 sun51994 and eu401987 a31994 and north americans af220295 quebec1972 and u00735 mebus1972 suggesting a common ancestor of this cluster whereas in the partition-2 of the s dataset we noticed a change in the phylogenic scheme the m80844 giessen1989 clustered with all europeans strains while the more recent north korean year 2002 and recent chinese km985631 hljt42014 and ku886219 aks012015 clustered with the us strains of the 1990s suggesting a common origin the old bcov strains pre 1994 seemed to have the same origin irrespective of their geographic origin until an event of recombination led the european strains to evolve separatelyusing the different models constant population under strict and relaxed clock for all the strains and the constant population and bsp under relaxed clock for the european strains the mean substitution rates calculated for the spike genes ranged between 39 and 98  104 nucleotide substitution per site per year which is a very similar range as previously published 21-105  104 8889 the slower evolution of n than of s gene is also in line with previous reports from the literature 89 substitution rates were in the same range for other coronaviruses with 06  103 07  2  103 for hcov-oc43 and tgev respectively 9091 we observed a slightly faster evolution for european bcov than for the whole dataset an important bias in our analyses comes from the lack of sequence data and a timing difference between european and american bcov such that most north american specimens were at least ten years older than european strains in addition the production systems different numbers of animals per farms feedlots in north america but not in europe the virus prevalence and the vaccine coverages are likely different therefore the selection pressures must be different our selection pressure calculations unfortunately did not allow for highlighting any difference in selection pressure between the continents the 10 positively selected amino acids detected here table 3 were spread out over the whole spike protein and could not be linked to a biological function due to the limited research so far carried out on bcov no spike structure has so far been resolved comparison is only possible with the sars spike and no clear antigenic sites have been detected to the best of our knowledge further studies are thus warranted to understand the role of these positions in bcov evolutionas far as the tmrca is concerned our analysis with the new sequence data confirmed the values previously estimated 1978 95 ci 19101963 or 1944 95 ci 19101963 8889 here again more sequences available throughout the last few decades would allow for an increased precision in the tmrca we showed here for the first time that a recombination event may be at the origin of the viruses that evolved separately in europe on the one side and in americaasia on the other side this event likely occurred in the 1960s1970s when cattle exchanges between europe and the other continents was already very limitedtaken together our results showed that the bcov ancestor emerged in the 1940s and that two geographically distinct lineages diverged from the 1960s1970s with no genetic mixing detected thus far further studies are warranted to understand the mechanisms behind bcov tissue tropism improved surveillance and sequencing are needed to precisely estimate the evolutionary and epidemiological parameters of bcov circulation and to identify the recombinations in genomic evolutionthe nucleotide composition of genomic dna is very variable this variation is not limited to non-coding dna or influencing codon-usage it also results in changes to the amino acid composition of proteins for example the redundancy of the genetic code does not completely buffer the amino acid composition of orthologous proteins from vaccinia virus vacv an orthopoxvirus 65 at and molluscum contagiosum virus mocv a molluscipoxvirus 35 at the amino acid composition of the dna polymerases of vacv and mocv illustrate that the propensity for certain amino acids to be more common in proteins encoded by at or gc rich genes the vacv and mocv proteins contain the following percentages of lysine 71 29 arginine 59 96 alanine 40 95 leucine 93 122 and isoleucine 74 32 respectivelythere is also considerable variation in dna composition within a genome regions rich in repeated dna often have a nucleotide composition quite different to the genome average similarly all poxvirus promoters are very at rich regardless of the average genome nucleotide composition however it is less well appreciated that there is also a wide variation in the dna composition of individual genes the at range for individual genes in vacv and mocv is 551  723 and 240  518 respectively the driving force for divergence in dna composition among evolutionary related poxviruses is unknown as is the ancestral composition but range of dna composition among genes is determined by at least 2 components 1 the natural resistance of some genes to change because of restrictive amino acid requirements and 2 the acquisition of novel genes after speciation of the virusesother processes related to dna replication repair and transcription may also influence nucleotide biases of the two dna strands 1-5 for example since the coding strand of bacterial genomic dna tends to be purine rich 6 and majority of genes are transcribed in the same direction as the movement of the replication fork there is asymmetric nucleotide composition along the genome such that the dna composition may be used to predict the origin and termini of replication 7-9genomic variations in nucleotide composition have been successfully studied using several graph-based methods one such technique is to draw a cumulative skew diagram which plots the relative amounts of two nucleotides in a given dna sequence 10 a gc skew for example is calculated across a genome as the sum of a series of sliding windows of specified length the window size can be 1 or much larger for a complete genome the shape of the resulting cumulative dinucleotide curves have been correlated with important sequence features including viral origins of replication 11 and genome rearrangements in bacteria 12 the dna walk is another method used to study nucleotide distribution first described by lobry 713 and used to detect origins of dna replication in bacteria genomes to graph a dna walk a direction north south east and west is assigned to each of the four nucleotides and the sequence is then plotted on a graph beginning at 00 and moving one step in the direction specified by each successive nucleotidethis paper describes graphdna a new java software application that was developed as a platform-independent application to present dna skews and walks of multiple sequences in a single graph and thus assist in the comparative analysis of nucleotide composition asymmetryin a dna walk graph sequences are plotted starting at x  0 y  0 for each nucleotide from position 1 in the sequence to the end the position of the next point in the plot is calculated relative to the current position for nucleotide c g t or a the position moves north south east or west respectively if the current symbol is degenerate or a gap symbol the position is unchanged for a window size of k every kth point is actually drawn on the graph but the calculations still include every nucleotide a slider bar moves markers along the plots to locate specific regions of the sequences since the position of a particular nucleotide is solely dependent on the composition of the preceding nucleotide sequence not on the position in the sequencepurine skews are calculated from the first position in the sequence to the last for each nucleotide increment a counter if this nucleotide is a purine decrement it if it is a pyrimidine the effect is to compute the number of purines minus the number of pyrimidines from the first position to the current one the x-axis of the skew graph is the position in the sequence the y-axis is the value of the counter at this position keto and dinucleotide skews are calculated analogously with the obvious differences for a window size of k every kth position is drawnseveral other programs have been written to display dna strand composition asymmetries dnaskew 15 is a perl script limited to a command line interface genskew 16 and artemis 17 are java applications but are limited to certain nucleotide skews and cannot plot multiple sequences genometricians scooter 18 is able to perform dna walks and skews but is not open source or platform independent graphdna was written to overcome these limitations and also to be compatible with the vocs database 19 for access to viral genomesthe graphdna application has three basic graphing functions dna walks cumulative dinucleotide skews and cumulative purineketo skews the dna walk analysis is most effective when nucleotide composition trends extend over a considerable length for example dna walks have been successful in finding the origins and termini of replication in bacterial genomes 720an example of cumulative purineketo skews is shown in figure 1 which demonstrates that different regions of the ectromelia virus an orthopoxvirus genome have considerably different purine content it was observed that the w shape of the purine skew figures 1a and 1b was very similar to the pattern for transcriptional orientation of the viral genes along the linear genome figure 1c examination of the genes from multiple orthopoxviruses confirmed that the coding strand of poxvirus genes tends to be slightly purine rich 21 this information can be used to help annotate novel genes in poxvirus genomes in that if there are small orfs on both dna strands then the strand with the highest purine content is most likely to be the coding strand however purine content is only one of a variety of information sources used in the annotation process 22 cumulative skew analysis may also be pertinent to some eukaryotic dna sequences for example the coding strand of leishmania major strain friedlin chromosome 1 23 is associated with an excess of pyrimidinesthe cumulative dinucleotide skews display the abundance of one nucleotide relative to another across the length of a dna sequence that may represent a single gene or a complete genome the program plots the cumulative dinucleotide counts calculated in a series of windows which may be as small as 1 nt along the dna sequences graphdna offers all six possible cumulative skews gc ac gt tc ag and at gc and at skews have been widely used to predict termini and origins of replication in bacterial 19 and mammalian genomes 8 transcription start sites in plants and fungi 24 as well as transcription regions in the human genome 25 in poxviruses some skews for example the ga skew appear to be independent of the orientation of transcription and instead reflect the overall nucleotide composition of the genome figure 2 however when genomes are examined in more detail heterogeneities can be observed the ga skew of the 16  38 kb region of the crocodilepox virus genome from figure 2 is displayed in figure 3 genes 28 29 30 31 33 34 and 35 appear to make up an island of unusual skew this is interesting because genes 28 33 34 and 35 are distantly related and probably arose from ancient duplication events of all the genes in the region 28  35 only gene 30 has any similarity to other known proteins it is similar to dnaj-like molecular chaperones and has an ortholog in mocv another gc rich poxvirus the unusual overall base composition of this region may be the result of incorporation of foreign dna into an ancestral crocodilepox virus genome it is likely that this was through multiple events and an early smaller dna island may have served as an integration site for subsequent insertionssince the above analysis of crocodilepox genes indicated that dna composition signature can reflect evolutionary history even when protein sequences have diverged so far that reliable alignments are very difficult to generate and are limited to a very few essential amino acids alignment of crocodilepox genes 28 33 34 and 35 results not shown we looked at the relationship of sars-coronavirus to other coronaviruses using nucleotide skews when the sars-coronavirus was first sequenced it was reported that this novel virus was similarly and very distantly related to the three previously known groups of coronaviruses 26 subsequently it was reported that sars-coronavirus is slightly closer to the group 2 coronaviruses 2728 and that it probably arose through a series of recombination events 29 however an examination of composition skews revealed that for most skews sars-coronavirus and mouse hepatitis virus mhv a group 2 coronavirus are the most different for example see the keto ga and at skews in figure 4a 4b and 4c respectively only the ac skews are most similar for sars-coronavirus and the group 2 mhv figure 4d several skews and especially the purine skew figure 4e indicate that the sars-coronavirus genome is the most variable with regard to consistency of nucleotide composition across the genome this is consistent with the ancient recombination events among ancestral coronaviruses proposed by zhang et al 29 after employing a battery of blast searches and 7 recombination detection techniques others have also examined nucleotide skews of coronaviruses but this has been limited to gc skews 3031 that show a depletion of cytosine relative to guanosine in the 10 kb at the 3 end of the sars-coronavirus genome both grigoriev 30 and pyrc et al 31 suggested that this resulted from the unusual transcription process of the coronaviruses but differed in their detailed modelsgraphdna is an easy to use java web start

to cause severe disease in older adults and patients with existing health conditions 34 moreover coronaviruses are well-known to mutate and recombine 5 the genomic sequence of sars-cov-2 has changed since it was first reported some scientists believe that these changes have enhanced the virulence of the virus and there are two circulating strains deadly strain l and less virulent one s 6 currently there are no specific antiviral treatments or vaccines available for covid-19 treatments are mainly focusing on symptomatic and respiratory support according to protocols issued by the health authority in each country where many countries are following who protocol 34 nearly all cases with severe symptoms accept oxygen in critical cases and life-threatening situations passive immunization through the convalescent plasma and immunoglobulin g transfusion can be used as a rescue treatment 7 given the current situation finding a treatment has become a global public health priority many companies are working on finding a medication or a viable vaccine for sars-cov-2 however this is not a short process scientists estimate the period to have one about 1218 monthsthe covid-19 is the third novel coronavirus to cause a large-scale epidemic in the twenty-first century after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 2003 8910 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012 111213 our knowledge and experience in fighting the previous two epidemics can be used for creating treatment strategies against this pandemic recently different medications and a combination of drugs have shown promising results for example the combination of chloroquine and azithromycin 14 furthermore the antiviral drug remdesivir and the malaria drug chloroquine have gained much attention globally as potential medications for covid-19 treatment on the other hand different companies are working on finding a treatment in a creative method antiviral rna for example 15given the lack of specific treatment for covid-19 many groups are working urgently to find an alternative strategy to control the replication and spreading of the virus we have explored different scientific databases searching for the most promising options for the treatment of covid-19 and provide an overview of our findings we are going to review the characteristics of coronaviruses its origin genome structure and replication to explain how each treatment strategy could act on preventing or slowing the viral infectioncovs members belong to the subfamily coronovirinae within the family coronaviridae and the order nidovirales based on their protein sequences and phylogenetic relationships members of the coronavirinae subfamily can be classified into four groups alphacoronaviruses betacoronaviruses gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses infect birds and might infect mammals but never reported to cause any illnesses in humans 2021 on the other hand alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses are capable of causing respiratory illnesses in humans and gastrointestinal illnesses in animals before december 2019 six common coronaviruses members of alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses were known to infect humans hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 and they belong to the alphacoronaviruses hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 belong to lineage a betacoronaviruses and the two deadly viruses sars-cov and mers-cov belong to lineages b and c of betacoronaviruses respectively 20 the genomic analysis found that sars-cov-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus group lineage b 45covs are zoonotic pathogens originating in animals and can be transmitted to humans through direct contact all covs that caused epidemics including covid-19 are believed to be originated in bats bats are hosts of many coronaviruses 1722 however in most cases these viruses were transmitted to humans through an intermediate animal host sars-cov started through direct contact with market civets cats 23 mers-cov transmitted directly to humans from dromedary camels 111213 the covid-19 is suspected to be emerged in the seafood market in wuhan china 120 most of the early reported cases have been in that market which was closed later by the chinese authority evolutionary analysis of covid-19 virus revealed that it is most similar to the bat sars-like coronaviruses and for the similarity it was named sars-cov-2 in summary most of the scientific report believes that sars-cov-2 was originated in bats and transmitted to humans through intermediate animal host in the seafood market 5 nevertheless researchers are yet to find a definitive answer to which animal serves as an intermediate hostthe covs genome is a single-stranded positive-sense rna ssrna molecule the genome size ranges between 2732 kbp one of the largest known rna viruses figure 1 2024 the genomic structure of covs contains at least six open reading frames orfs the first orfs orf1ab located at the 5 end about two-thirds of the whole genome length and encodes a polyprotein1ab pp1a pp1b 25 other orfs are located on 3 end encodes at least four structural proteins envelop glycoprotein spike s responsible for recognizing host cell receptors 26 membrane m proteins responsible for shaping the virions 27 the envelope e proteins responsible for virions assembly and release 28 the nucleocapsid n proteins are involved in packaging the rna genome and in the virions and play roles in pathogenicity as an interferon ifn inhibitor 2930 in addition to the four main structural proteins there are structural and accessory proteins that are species-specific such as he protein 3ab protein and 4ab protein 24 once the viral genome enters the cytoplasm of the target cell and given it is a positive-sense rna genome it translates into two polyproteins 1a b pp1a pp1b these polyproteins are processed into 16 non-structural proteins nsps to form a replication-transcription complex rtc that is involved in genome transcription and replication consequently a nested set of subgenomic rnas sgrnas is synthesized by rtc in the form of discontinuous transcription 24sars-cov-2 primarily infects ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type ii pneumocytes where it binds to the surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 through s glycoprotein found on its surface figure 2 2313233 when s glycoprotein binds to the ace2 the cleavage of trimer s protein is triggered by the cell surface-associated transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 and cathepsin s glycoprotein includes two subunits s1 and s2 s1 determines the host range and cellular tropism and facilitates viral attachment to the target cells s2 is a unit that mediates the fusion of viral and cellular membranes ensuring viral entry through endocytosis 31 the affinity between the viruss surface proteins and its receptors is a critical step for viral entry understanding the mechanism of sars-cov-2 could provide more insights into the viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets a recent study showed that the affinity between s glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 and ace2 binding efficiency is 1020 fold higher than that of sars-cov which could explain the highly infectious ability of sars-cov-2 434although many drugs have been reported to show promising results against sars-cov-2 none of these drugs have gained much attention like the antimalarial drugs chloroquine cq and hydroxychloroquine hcq 144950 hcq is a cq analog that has the same mechanism of action with a safer profile making it the prioritized drug to treat malaria viruses and autoimmune conditions 51 there are several potential molecular mechanisms of hcq action against sars-cov-2 that have been postulated generally hcq is a weak base drug that accumulates in the cell acidic compartments such as lysosomes and endosomes this accumulation increases the ph and inhibits the maturation of these endosomal compartments therefore hcq might be interfering with the endocytosis of sars-cov-2 and subsequently affecting the virus entry and exit from the host cell 750 moreover hcq might reduce glycosylation of ace2 interfering with sars-cov-2 to bind effectively to the host cell 51 on the other hand a recent publication hypothesizes that hcq reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 ifn-alpha and tnf thereby inhibiting various immune pathways that might lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 52 currently the use of hydroxychloroquine is approved by many of covid-19 treatment protocols especially in combination with other antibiotics and antiviral drugs where others seriously considering it 144050remdesivir is an adenosine nucleoside analog drug showing antiviral activity against ebola and marburg viruses and other rna viruses 53 it acts through interfering with the viral rna polymerase and evades proofreading by viral exoribonuclease leading to a decrease in viral rna production 5455 a recent report found that a combination of remdesivir and chloroquine inhibited sars-cov-2 in vitro 56 very recently the drug gained more attention after a recent clinical trial found that remdesivir is highly effective in stopping the replication mechanism of sars-cov-2losartan and telmisartan are drugs that belong to the angiotensin ii receptor antagonist group they block the substances that cause blood vessels narrowing which lowers blood pressure and improves blood flow by relaxing the blood vessels it has been suggested that losartan can be used to reduce the aggressiveness and mortality of sars-cov-2 575859 the fact that these drugs could block the ace2 receptor should mean the ability to interfere with the entry of sars-cov-2 to the target cell using this drug group to treat covid-19 seems vital at this point particularly in combination with other antiviral drugsbaricitinib is a drug used basically for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis it acts as an inhibitor for janus kinase jak us food and drug administration 2018 inhibition of the jak pathway might interrupt the virus entry and the virions intracellular assembly by interfering with the endocytosis process 42it is a combination of both lopinavir and ritonavir drugs that have been used for hiv treatment and prevention these drugs act by inhibiting the hiv protease enzyme through forming an inhibitor-enzyme complex 60 a recent study showed that combination of these drugs reduced sars-cov-2 viral load and improved the clinical symptoms during the treatment of covid-19 patients 43darunavir is a second generation of hiv-1 protease inhibitors it is a non-peptidic inhibitor of protease that enters itself in the active site of protease through several hydrogen bonds 61 a recent report of an in vitro experiment indicated that using darunavir at a concentration of 300 m significantly inhibits sars-cov-2 replication its inhibition efficiency increased by 280-fold in comparison to the control group 44camostat mesylate is a type ii transmembrane serine protease tmspss2 inhibitor 62 since that sars-cov-2 entry mechanism involving the use of cellular protease tmprss2 a protease inhibitor would block entry and thus could be a treatment option 45these are medications used as anti-malarial antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities those drugs showed significantly decreased viral rna yield in treated cells making them potential drugs for treating covid-19 infections 47passive immunization pi is a method to obtain instant short-term fortification against infectious agents by introducing pathogen-specific antibodies to patients these specific antibodies can bind to the pathogen antigens and block its interaction with a cellular receptor it is extremely applicable in the case of viral antigens that facilitate the attachment to the target receptors 63 after exposure to a viral infection the body of the patient creates antibodies to fight off the virus these antibodies in the blood of a recovered patient can be collected as convalescent plasma cp and transferred to the blood of a newly infected patient consequently it can neutralize the pathogen boost the immunity of that patient 64 cr3022 is a human monoclonal antibody previously isolated from a convalescent sars patient used to target a highly conserved epitope that enables cross-reactive binding between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov 65 cr3022 might have the potential to be candidate therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of covid-19 patients especially in life-threatening situations 66clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crispr is a family of repeated dna sequences that can be found in the genomes of bacteria and archaea these fragments are molecular remaining of bacteriophages infections and act as a defense mechanism to the prokaryotic cell they can detect and destroy specific foreign dna fragments most probably from similar bacteriophages subsequent infections crispr with chaperoning cas proteins is a powerful technique that has been derived from the bacterial defense mechanism and implemented in gene editing of our interest 67 currently there is an ambitious study suggesting that crisprcas13d system can be used to accurately digest the sars-cov-2 rna genome hence limiting its ability to reproduce 15 theoretically this approach is excellent not only against covid-19 but for the treatment and prevention of different rna viruses infections however we have no idea if it is practical or notthe covid-19 pandemic poses a significant threat to the global public health systems the increasing number of cases and deaths have put the international community on alert that the worst scenarios are possible despite our knowledge of the sars-cov-2 infectious cycle there is no clear strategy for covid-19 patients treatment based on recent experimental findings and recommendations physicians are investigating different potential drugs that showed antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 only time to tell which one of these drugs is going to work in the meantime scientists around the globe are working aggressively to find clinical therapies or vaccines against the viruswe downloaded 4 sars-cov-2 16 humancivet-sarsr-cov 63 bat-sarsr-cov and 2 pangolin-sarsr-cov genomes from genbank and gisaid httpswwwgisaidorg we also sequenced the complete genome of sars-cov-2 strain hk20 genbank accession no mt186683 from a patient with covid-19 in hong kong we performed genome phylogenetic and recombination analysis as described 11the 5 sars-cov-2 genomes had overall 998100 nt identities with each other these genomes showed 961 genome identities with sarsr-ra-batcov-ratg13 878 with sarsr-rp-batcov-zc45 876 with sarsr-rp-batcov-zxc21 853 with pangolin-sarsr-covp4lguangxi2017 and 738786 with other sarsr-covs including humancivet-sarsr-covs table 1most predicted proteins of sars-cov-2 showed high amino acid sequence identities with that of sarsr-ra-batcov ratg13 except the receptor-binding domain rbd region sars-cov-2 possessed an intact open reading frame 8 without the 29-nt deletion found in most human sars-covs the concatenated conserved replicase domains for coronavirus species demarcation by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses showed 929 aa identities threshold 90 for same species between sars-cov-2 and other sarsr-covs supporting their classification under the same coronavirus species table 2 1unlike other members of the subgenus sarbecovirus sars-cov-2 has a spike protein that contains a unique insertion that results in a potential cleavage site at the s1s2 junction which might enable proteolytic processing that enhances cellcell fusion sars-cov-2 was demonstrated to use the same receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 hace2 as does sars-cov 7 the predicted rbd region of sars-cov-2 spike protein corresponding to aa residues 318513 of sars-cov 12 showed the highest 97 aa identities with pangolin-sarsr-covmp789guangdong and 741777 identities with humancivetbat-sarsr-covs known to use hace2 table 1 moreover similar to the humancivetbat-sarsr-cov hace2-using viruses the 2 deletions 5 aa and 12 aa found in all other sarsr-batcovs 10 were absent in sars-cov-2 rbd appendix figure 1 of the 5 critical residues needed for rbd-hace2 interaction in sarsr-covs 13 3 f472 n487 and y491 were present in sars-cov-2 rbd and pangolin sarsr-covmp7892019-rbdphylogenetic analysis showed that the rna-dependent rna polymerase gene of sars-cov-2 is most closely related to that of sarsr-ra-batcov ratg13 whereas its predicted rbd is closest to that of pangolin-sarsr-covs figure 1 this finding suggests a distinct evolutionary origin for sars-cov-2 rbd possibly as a result of recombination moreover the sars-cov-2 rbd was also closely related to sarsr-ra-batcov ratg13 and the hace2-using cluster containing humancivet-sarsr-covs and yunnan sarsr-batcovs previously successfully cultured in veroe6 cells 45to identify putative recombination events we performed sliding window analysis using sars-cov-2-hk20 as query and sarsr-ra-batcov ratg13 pangolin-sarsr-covp4lguangxi2017 sarsr-rp-batcov zc45 sarsr-rs-batcov rs3367 and sarsr-rs-batcov longquan-140 as potential parents figure 2 appendix figures 2 a similarity plot showed that sars-cov-2 is most closely related to sarsr-ra-batcov ratg13 in the entire genome except for its rbd which is closest to pangolin-sarsr-covmp789guangdong and shows potential recombination breakpoints moreover different regions of sars-cov-2 genome showed different similarities to pangolin-sarsr-covp4lguangxi2017 sarsr-rp-batcov zc45 sarsr-rs-batcov rs3367 and sarsr-rs-batcov longquan-140 as supported by phylogenetic analysis appendix figures 2 3sequence alignment around the rbd supported potential recombination between sarsr-ra-batcov ratg13 and pangolin-sarsr-covmp789guangdong2019 and the receptor-binding motif region showing exceptionally high sequence similarity to that of pangolin-sarsr-covmp789guangdong2019 this finding suggested that sars-cov-2 might be a recombinant virus between viruses closely related to sarsr-ra-batcov ratg13 and pangolin-sarsr-covmp789guangdong2019despite the close relatedness of sars-cov-2 to bat and pangolin viruses none of the existing sarsr-covs represents its immediate ancestor most of the genome region of sars-cov-2 is closest to sarsr-ra-batcov-ratg13 from an intermediate horseshoe bat in yunnan whereas its rbd is closest to that of pangolin-sarsr-covmp789guangdong2019 from smuggled pangolins in guangzhou potential recombination sites were identified around the rbd region suggesting that sars-cov-2 might be a recombinant virus with its genome backbone evolved from yunnan bat viruslike sarsr-covs and its rbd region acquired from pangolin viruslike sarsr-covsbecause bats are the major reservoir of sarsr-covs and the pangolins harboring sarsr-covs were captured from the smuggling center it is possible that pangolin sarsr-covs originated from bat viruses as a result of animal mixing and there might be an unidentified bat virus containing an rbd nearly identical to that of sars-cov-2 and pangolin sarsr-cov similar to sars-cov sars-cov-2 is most likely a recombinant virus originated from batsthe ability of sars-cov-2 to emerge and infect humans is likely explained by its hace2-using rbd region which is genetically similar to that of culturable yunnan sarsr-batcovs and humancivet-sarsr-covs most sarsr-batcovs have not been successfully cultured in vitro except for some yunnan strains that had humancivet sars-like rbds and were shown to use hace2 45 for example sarsr-rp-batcov zc45 which has an rbd that is more divergent from that of humancivet-sarsr-covs did not propagate in veroe6 cells 6 factors that determine hace2 use among sarsr-covs remain to be elucidatedalthough the wuhan market was initially suspected to be the epicenter of the epidemic the immediate source remains elusive the close relatedness among sars-cov-2 strains suggested that the wuhan outbreak probably originated from a point source with subsequent human-to-human transmission in contrast to the polyphyletic origin of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus 14 if the wuhan market was the source a possibility is that bats carrying the parental sarsr-batcovs were mixed in the market enabling virus recombination however no animal samples from the market were reported to be positive moreover the first identified case-patient and other early case-patients had not visited the market 15 suggesting the possibility of an alternative sourcebecause the rbd is considered a hot spot for construction of recombinant covs for receptor and viral replication studies the evolutionarily distinct sars-cov-2 rbd and the unique insertion of s1s2 cleavage site among sarbecovirus species have raised the suspicion of an artificial recombinant virus however there is currently no evidence showing that sars-cov-2 is an artificial recombinant which theoretically might not carry signature sequences further surveillance studies in bats are needed to identify the possible source and evolutionary path of sars-cov-2the outbreak of a new coronavirus 2019-ncov has spread internationally since the initial report of cases by wuhan municipal health commission china on 31 december 2019 1234 on 26 january 2020 who announced that there is a high risk of a 2019-ncov epidemic in china and at a global level 5by 31 january 2020 9720 confirmed cases 15238 suspected cases and 176 cures of 2019-ncov and 213 deaths from 2019-ncov had been reported by the national authorities in china 6 some confirmed cases had also been reported in thailand singapore the united states australia japan korea malaysia france vietnam nepal canada cambodia germany and sri lanka 7based on preliminary judgments the transmission of this coronavirus has particular distinguishing features 891011 first the epidemic first originated in wuhan and then spread to other places 1213141516 second the illness can spread from human to human 913141516171819202122 for example there have been several cases of human-to-human transmission in guangdong province during family gatherings 23 and several healthcare workers were diagnosed in the early period of the outbreak 24 additionally the 2019-ncov coronavirus can survive in an environment and on the surface of objects up to 14 days 8 the floating population ie the seasonal and temporary non-resident population of a geographic area is a potential carrier for virus transmission 1621 wuhan the epicentre of the outbreak has a large floating population and being in the centre of china is a major travel hub wuhan is a megacity with a population of over 11 million in 2018 which includes a floating population of 2243700 living there for six months or more 25 this floating population may have exposure history in wuhan and could contribute to the increase in transmission of 2019-ncov considering the features of 2019-ncov transmission and the large-scale regional travel that occurs over the spring festival holiday 26 the wuhan government announced the implementation of travel restrictions on 23 january 2020 27 however many migrant workers had already left wuhan by this date and returned to their hometowns in other areas of china 28 this floating population may therefore have transmitted 2019-ncov in their hometowns especially those members of this population within hubei provincethe dualistic structure of urban and rural populations in china is likely to exacerbate the 2019-ncov epidemic 29 many of wuhans floating population who are from rural areas but work in the wuhan metropolitan area may be susceptible for example wuhans huanan seafood wholesale market which is regarded as a possible point source of the virus is less than 600 metres from the hankou railway station 30 this district and railway station is a hub of migrant worker life and transport as individual members of the floating population must frequently work overtime hours are vulnerable to having poor nutrition and due to lack of resources have higher rates of poor health 2931 they may have lower resistance to 2019-ncov infection due to lower educational investment in this population it may be more difficult for individuals to identify preventive healthcare information which may cause misidentification of 2019-ncov infection as the common cold or flu compounding this issue most public medical resources are concentrated in cities but are relatively scarce in rural areas 2931 therefore prevention and treatment of 2019-ncov in rural areas will be more challenging if new phases of the epidemic emergeto determine the influence of the floating population on the spread of 2019-ncov we used data from china migrants dynamic survey cmds released by the national health commission of china to analyse the national distribution of the origins of wuhans floating population and provide reference information to predict the trend of the epidemic the purposes of this study were to estimate the distribution and scale of the migrants residing in wuhan after they returned to their hometown communities in hubei province or other provinces after the 2019-ncov outbreak the social characteristics of the migrants are also analysed in the study including age group educational level pattern of migration number of migrating family members per household type of household registration and reasons for migration in addition we assumed a quasi-experimental approach to estimate the epidemic prevention and control in various regions of china on the one hand these findings are conducive to epidemic prevention and control and on the other hand currently the predictive model of the 2019-ncov is not detailed enough because of the lack of relevant parameters therefore this study is beneficial for virologists epidemiologists and medical professionals to deepen the study of the virus transmission and improve the accuracy of model prediction the analysis object of this study was the floating population who have lived in wuhan for more than one month short-term migrants and students were not included distinct from other models of the dynamics of this epidemic we used the information of the respondents from the cmds and their family members to further explore the origins of wuhans migrant population such as their returning destination population characteristics family structures and other metrics this approach can provide practical solutions to prepare prevention strategies and approaches to assess resources for treatment and containment of the epidemicthe national health commission of china released a report on 27 january 2020 that stated that 2019-ncov could be transmitted not only via respiratory droplets but also via direct contact 2019-ncov has now spread nationally and worldwide and due to the lack of data on the size and origins of the floating population of wuhan it has been difficult for the chinese government to arrange real-time medical resources and implement effective public health interventionswe used data from the wuhan floating population monitoring survey to estimate the size and origins of the migrant population in wuhan we also described the socio-demographic characteristics of this population and compared confirmed cases from different regions to estimate the epidemic with modelling techniques we found that three-quarters of wuhans floating population are from hubei province and that nearly 85 migrated with nuclear families the number of members per family is 3 to 4 and most individuals are migrant workers from rural areas with low education levels by comparing the predicted and actual values obtained from the model we analysed the profile of the epidemic in various regions since january 25 and found that the spread of the 2019-ncov has varied greatly between regions and that the epidemic in some regions may be underestimated there may also be unknowns such as structural factors in some regions that deserve further attentionthe majority of the floating population left wuhan before the city was closed off by authorities so our analysis will be useful for estimating the key geographic areas for prevention and control the results indicate that the floating population of wuhan is centred in hubei province and the surrounding provinces so local government must quickly and effectively take steps to prevent further spread of 2019-ncov higher-level governments must also strengthen the assistance they are providing such as sending medical workers and medical supplies to these areas to avoid 2019-ncov becoming a new pandemic at the same time it is important to increase surveillance in areas where the epidemic may be underestimated and promptly identify prevention and control loopholes to reduce the burden of a new round of transmission china has been deeply involved in the globalisation process and even chinas central and western regions have become important links in the global production and trade chain therefore while our research is aimed at china in the current era of migration this research has practical implications for global public health and disease control as floating populations are increasing in size all over the world and relationships between countries are becoming increasingly close thus other countries should pay attention to the epidemic situation in specific geographic areas of china to prevent secondary and international transmission of the 2019-ncovthe data used in this study are based on the 20132018 china migrants dynamic survey cmds and the tabulated data of 5 million migrants in wuhan recently released by the wuhan municipal government this survey was carried out via a multi-stage stratified sampling method and collected data with structured questionnaires as survey data is limited to the mainland provinces municipalities autonomous regions and hainan province the population analysed in this study excluded the populations of hong kong and macao a total of 11999 samples of the resident floating population in wuhan from 2013 to 2018 were extracted from the survey datasetaccording to the survey design wuhans floating population was defined as the population from other cities and districts aged 15 and over residing for more than one month in wuhan and not registered in wuhan in table 1 the sample distribution of the resident population in wuhan over time is presented the sample size was 1999 in the year 2013 and 2000 for other yearsthe outbreak is considered to have originated in the huanan seafood market near hankou railway station in the jianghan district wuhan china a severely infected area was concentrated in the urban areas of hankou from the sample distribution in table 1 the floating population of wuhan is seen to be concentrated in the urban area of hankou the results indicate that the sample proportion of jianghan district and nearby jiangan district tongkou district and dongxihu district is approximately 516 therefore the samples used in this study are suitably representative and thus acceptable for assessing the spread of the 2019-ncov outbreak among the floating populationwe obtained data from the dingxiangyuan national real-time epidemic website on confirmed cases from 25 january to 31 january 2020 6 these data are compiled from open data released by authorities such as the national health commission and the provincial and municipal health commissions to ensure data comparability we collected the data daily from 1200 to 1400 every dayusing the information of the floating population and their family members in wuhan we analysed their return destinations and their structural characteristics by descriptive statistical methods in table 2 the distribution of the origins of wuhans floating population is presented at the provincial level over the past several years the sample size is quite stable for each province over time the province of origin for 75 of the floating population was hubei province which contains the city of wuhan and approximately 25 of the population originated in other provincesthe location information published in other historical survey data is limited to the province where household registration is located due to a lack of data for 2019 the data provided by the hubei provincial health commission in 2017 includes more detailed information of prefectures cities districts and counties the analysis was therefore divided into two parts the first part comprised an analysis of the origin of wuhans floating population at the provincial level using historical data the second part comprised an analysis of the floating population within hubei province based on 2017 data when analysing the floating population at the provincial level we used all samples from the previous yearsie the mean of 6 years of data collectionto ensure the robustness of the results in view of the stability of sample distributions in each province over timeaccording to the current infectious features of 2019-ncov which are that middle-aged and elderly people have a high risk of infection and transmission can occur between individuals families and communities we assessed several main variables these comprised age group educational level pattern of migration number of migrating family members per household type of household registration and reasons for migration we defined these variables in the following ways 1 age group was classified as under 20 2130 3140 4150 5160 and over 60 2 educational level was divided into junior high school and below high schoolsecondary school and college and above 3 pattern of migration was divided into independent migration nuclear family migration and extended family migration 4 number of migrating family members per household was classified as 1 2 3 4 and 5 or more 5 types of household registration were divided into rural and urban household registration 6 reasons for migration were working and doing business family relocation or other reasonsthe analyses assume a theoretical model of 2019-ncov transmission we considered a floating population of 5 million in wuhan who returned to their hometowns from 23 january 2020 as potential infected persons moreover we added factors of demographic characteristics the situation of medical diagnosis government prevention and control the number of confirmed cases and undisclosed data to our statistical model to estimate the dynamics of the epidemic after controlling for certain factors we analysed the factors that were not controlled such as government intervention and the number of statistical reports specifically we first analysed the correlation between the size of the floating population in wuhan and the number of confirmed cases per day then we examined the differences among regions and proposed a transmission rate as a reference to compare the differences in regions in the comparative analysis we focused on the probably underestimated number of cases and the virus transmission rate to determine the likelihood of epidemics existing in different regionsfinally we predicted the floating population of wuhan using statistical methods and compared it with the number of 2019-ncov confirmed cases in each region to identify regional differences of 2019-ncov infection furthermore we predicted the forthcoming epidemic trend at the prefecture- and province-level based on the proportion of wuhans floating population represented by people from these areas human-to-human transmission of the 2019-ncov has been confirmed four sets of factors that may influence regional differences appear to be involved 1 demographic factors such as short-term business travellers between wuhan and other regions college students in wuhan returning to their homes in other regions spring festival tourists from wuhan to other regions and trans-regional floating populations for spring festival family reunions from or across wuhan 2 intervention factors such as medical treatments and governmental preventative measures 3 information disclosure and the information release system and 4 other unknown factorswe considered all these factors and hypothesised the social environment of 2019-ncov transmission first although the government had taken the unprecedented measure of sealing off wuhan city on 23 january 2020 we assumed that at that time the entire floating population of wuhan all short-term business travellers to wuhan and all college students in wuhan had returned to their hometowns throughout china because 24 january 2020 was the spring festivals eve normally the 2020 spring festival holiday from january 24 to 30 moreover this spring festival vacation period started at least a week before this date time leaving plenty of time for these people to leave the city however the number of people in wuhan that travelled to reunite with their families in other cities during the spring festival vacation may be negligible for the sealing-off of the city and other preventive measures taken across the country may have prevented their travelling second the influence of the college students in wuhan was an invariant factor as college students are young and healthy have fixed travelling routes come from different regions evenly scattered across the country and travelled to return home on or around january 10 we would assume their influence on virus transmission to different regions to be the same third the medical treatment ability of regional medical centres of hubei province would also be the same as the breakout emerged so fast that these regional medical centres would have had the same level of emergency-preparedness finally the above factors will not change dramatically until the mass return of wuhans floating population after the conclusion of the spring festival vacationto estimate the floating population in the cities of hubei province and across the country we must determine the floating population residing in wuhan in 2019 as the statistics compiled by the wuhan city government from 2019 have not been released the data from previous years was used for this prediction the prediction of floating population in wuhan based on the statistics from previous years is presented in table 3 demonstrating that there were approximately 243 million migrants living in wuhan for more than six months in 2019however if the predictions of the statistical data were combined with survey data which was used in this study to estimate the origin of wuhans floating population that return to their hometowns there would have been a problem with inconsistent statistical strength this would have resulted from the fact that the floating population measured by the government statistics department reflects those who have lived in wuhan for more than 6 months but the respondents in the survey have lived in wuhan for over one month a shorter defined residence time would have therefore produced a larger estimate of the population and thus the total floating population in wuhan as determined from the cmds data was larger than the population as determined by the government statistics departmenton 22 january 2020 xinhua news agency an official government media source interviewed the mayor of wuhan and reported that more than 5 million members of the floating population had returned to their hometowns before the spring festival holiday this number stated over 5 million was more than twice the predicted value in this study 243 million indicating that the statistical strength of the news report was based on a shorter period of residence and this was consistent with the data we used to determine the floating population residing in wuhan for over one month thus in the absence of more rigorous and authoritative total data we used 5 million people as wuhans floating population from which to estimate the scale and distribution of those members of this population who returned to their hometown during the festivalbased on sample survey data in table 4 the proportional estimation of the origins of wuhans floating population at a provincial level is presented as well as the results of statistical analysis based on a floating population of 5 millionthe national distribution of the migrants presents obvious spatial characteristics of circle layers and echelons at provincial level table 4 and figure 11 hubei province is the central area of origin of wuhans floating population accounting for 75 of the population with a 95 confidence interval of 7421 7576 based on a total population of 5 million people wuhans floating population with household registration in hubei province is approximately 375 million with a 95 confidence interval of 3710227 to 37881252 henan anhui jiangxi and hunan provinces belong to the first circle layer henan province home to a floating population of 337000 had the highest proportion with respect to its total population equating to approximately 67 and a 95 confidence interval of 315401 to 360712based on the analysis of city data in 2017 xinyang zhumadian shangqiu and nanyang cities in henan province accounted for 3882 2059 1294 and 1059 respectively of the floating population from henan living in wuhan accounting for approximately 83 of the total the floating population proportions of anhui hunan and jiangxi provinces were 27 25 and 24 respectively with corresponding floating populations in wuhan of 136000 126000 and 121000 respectively3 chongqing zhejiang sichuan fujian and jiangsu provinces are at the second circle layer with 165 139 139 100 and 092 floating populations respectively with corresponding populations of approximately 83000 70000 70000 50000 and 46000 respectively4 shandong guangdong hebei gansu guangxi heilongjiang shaanxi shanxi and guizhou provinces are at the third circle layer with a proportion of 019 to 062 and a corresponding population of 10000 to 300005 some provinces and municipalities including qinghai liaoning yunnan jilin and beijing are located in the fourth circle layer accounting for 008016 of the floating population equating to 40008000 people6 the remaining provinces and municipalities such as hainan xinjiang tianjin shanghai inner mongolia tibet and ningxia are at the fifth circle layer with a floating population proportion of less than 004 corresponding to 2000 peopleas presented in the table above this population is mainly 2140 years old but the scale of the susceptible high-risk and over 40 years old population is also very large the distribution is as follows1 the susceptible and high-risk population is concentrated in hubei province the size of the 4150 age group is more than 800000 that of the age group of 5160 is 180000 and the number of people over 60 is 400002 henan and anhui provinces have larger susceptible and high-risk populations of more than 100000 and nearly 40000 respectively3 six provinces and municipalities namely hunan jiangxi chongqing zhejiang sichuan and jiangsu have a high-risk population of 41 to 50 years old comprising 1400030000 people4 in 10 provinces namely fujian shandong guangdong hebei gansu guangxi shanxi guizhou qinghai and xinjiang the susceptible and high-risk populations are also concentrated in the 4150 age group with a population of approximately 150065505 the three provinces of northeast china namely heilongjiang jilin and liaoning have large susceptible and high-risk populations equating to approximately 7000 in heilongjiang and approximately 3000 in jilin and liaoninginfection of family members is a main means of transmission and the distribution of the characteristics of floating population family migration at the provincial level are detailed in table 5 the vast majority of the floating population migrates to wuhan in the form of nuclear families 8442 and most families comprise 34 members 7144 the distribution is as follows1 the number of nuclear family households in the wuhan floating population that originates from hubei province is 3425 million accounting for 6285 of the total floating population of wuhan and households with 3-4 family members number 2693500 accounting for 5387 of the total the high risk of 2019-ncov transmission within and by this population is self-evident2 families from henan anhui hunan and jiangxi provinces comprise a large proportion of those in the floating population of wuhan those from henan total nearly 300000 households and the number of these households with 34 family members is more than 240000 approximately 110000 families from the remaining provinces are part of the floating population of wuhan including nearly 100000 34 family-member households from anhui and more than 80000 from hunan and jiangxi3 the number of families in the floating population of wuhan from chongqing zhejiang sichuan fujian and jiangsu municipalities and provinces is 4000080000 and the number of households with 3-4 family members is 30000600004 the number of families in the floating population of wuhan that originate from 7 other provinces namely shandong guangdong hebei gansu guangxi heilongjiang and shaanxi is 1000030000 households and the number of households with 34 family members is approximately 20000 the remaining provinces comprise fewer than 10000 households jiangxicertain factors can easily spread the virus from homes to communities in rural areas such as a lack of medical resources and investment weak health prevention and control low awareness of health and insufficient awareness of infectious diseases in table 5 the floating population in wuhan is dominated by rural households 8514 and working or doing business is the main reason for their having travelled to wuhan 8429 therefore epidemic prevention and control in rural areas is of critical importance the distribution is as follows1 the joint distribution of the origins of wuhans floating population within hubei province is 6373 equating to a population of 3186500 and 6271 of these are migrant workers equating to 3135500 people2 henan anhui hunan and jiangxi province both have more than 100000 households with rural household registers and migrant workers in wuhan and the population of those from henan in wuhans floating population is approximately 3000003 chongqing zhejiang sichuan fujian jiangsu shandong guangdong hebei gansu and guangxi provinces together have a population of 1000080000 households with rural household registers in wuhan and less than 10000 in the remaining provinces of china notably guangdong gansu heilongjiang and liaoning have a larger proportion of the population with urban household registers and this is greater than the number of rural household registers in guangdong province virus transmission is related to individual health awareness which is affected by an individuals educational level so we also examined the educational level of the floating population in wuhan in table 5 60 of the population was educated to junior middle school and below 26 had senior high school or technical secondary school education and 14 had college education and above indicating that the overall education level of this population was low specifically 1 in the provinces of qinghai chongqing jiangxi anhui henan yunnan guangxi and xinjiang 60 or more of the population was educated to junior high school level or below2 approximately 5060  of the population of the provinces of hubei sichuan hebei fujian jiangsu hunan guizhou shandong shanxi tibet and gansu was educated to junior high school level or below3 the population in three municipalities including beijing tianjin and shanghai have a high level of education with over 66 receiving tertiary education the population of the remaining provinces had a medium-to-high educational levelabove all these data indicated that there is a large middle-aged and older high-risk floating population in wuhan their social characteristics include having travelled to wuhan in a nuclear family of 34 members being on a rural household register and often having a lower educational level these characteristics are consistent with conditions favouring the wide spread of 2019-ncovaccording to the foregoing analysis 75 of wuhans floating population have registered households in hubei province equating to approximately 375 million people that such a large proportion of the floating population of wuhan originate from elsewhere in hubei province has reduced the possibility of the epidemic spreading across the country but all regions in hubei province are facing tremendous pressure from the spread of the epidemic therefore we used the 2017 cmds data to analyse the distribution of the floating population in regions within hubei provincetable 6 and figure 2 present the distribution of the origins of wuhans floating population within hubei province the proportion of the floating population gradually decreases from east to west across hubei province and there are great differences between cities the distribution is as follows1 xiaogan wuhan and huanggang are in the first echelon the proportion of the floating population who originate from these cities is high accounting for 234 196 and 14 of the total respectively they are a cross-regional floating population of 734000 and a 95 confidence interval of 6589 8130 the analysis of districts and counties indicates that the members the floating population who originate from the outskirts of huangpi district and xinzhou district flow into the main urban area of hankou so the epidemic situation in the outskirts of huangpi district and xinzhou district needs special attention secondly the members of wuhans floating population who originate from xiaogan comprise the largest proportion equating to approximately 788000 people and a 95 confidence interval of 7981 9625 members of wuhans floating population who originate from huanggang comprise the third proportion equating to approximately 52549 people and a 95 confidence interval of 4606 5958 2 the three directly managed by province dmp cities xiantao qianjiang and tianmen and jingzhou belong to the second echelon each comprising approximately 330000 people and each accounting for approximately 9 of the floating population of wuhan with a 95 confidence interval of 28393 jingmen suizhou xianning and huangshi belong to the third echelon accounting for 35 of the floating population of wuhan equating to 130000170000 people4 xiangyang ezhou yichang enshi and shiyan belong to the fourth echelon accounting for less than 3 of the floating population of wuhan equating to fewer than 100000 peopleoverall the suburbs of wuhan surrounding xiaogan huanggang and the three dmp cities are the origins of the largest proportion 66 of the floating population of wuhan equating to approximately 2475 million peoplewe used district- and county-level variables to estimate the floating population within hubei province and the results are presented in table 7 the survey covered 94 districts and counties including huangpi xinzhou jiangxia caidian and hannan in wuhan as well as cross-region active migrants in some major urban areasthe top 10 districts and counties of hubei province in terms of floating population are huangpi hanchuan xiantao xinzhou hongan yunmeng honghu macheng xiaonan and xiaochang that is 100000 people from each of these districts and counties are part of the floating population of wuhan with the top 3 districts and counties huangpi hanchuan and xiantao having 200000 people in wuhans floating populationthese top 10 district and counties of hubei province are followed by jingshan yingcheng dawu guangshui tianmen lishui jianli anlu jiangxia and caidian which each have 60000100000 people in wuhans floating populationthe third tier is huangmei yangxin daye gongan tongshan jiayu zhongxiang qianjiang songzi huarong zengdu enshi liangzihu zaoyang dongxihu wuxue huangzhou hannan xianan xiangzhou zhijiang echeng luotian badong chibi chongyang hongshan shayang shishou suixian tuanfeng gucheng and xiangcheng these districts and counties each have 1000050000 people in wuhans floating populationthe remaining districts and counties have fewer than 10000 people in wuhans floating population in general these members of wuhans floating population originate from certain districts and counties of hubei province the cumulative percentage of the top 30 districts and counties exceeds 80 of these areas total population showing a clear exponential distribution trendwe then analysed the social characteristics of the migrants in hubei province by age type of migration number of migrants type of household registration and reasons for traveling to wuhan to become part of its floating populationfrom table 8 please see the last page we observe that in terms of susceptible and high-risk groups over 40 years old there are approximately 300000 people in xiaogan approximately 180000 people in wuhan cross-region migration and approximately 150000 people in huanggang there are also approximately 100000 people in the dmp cities and jingzhou respectively and 3000050000 people in jingmen suizhou xianning and huangshi fewer than 30000 people from each of xiangyang ezhou yichang enshi and shiyan have travelled to wuhanthe migration characteristics of the floating population of wuhan from hubei province are detailed in table 8 migration with a nuclear family is the main pattern accounting for nearly 80 of the total or 2985 million households the proportion of households with 34 family members ie nuclear families is approximately 67 or 253 million households specifically 740000 nuclear families originate from xiaogan 400000600000 nuclear families originate from the inner suburbs of wuhan and huanggang and approximately 260000 nuclear families originate from the dmp cities and jingzhou more than 100000 nuclear families originate from jingmen suizhou xianning and huangshi while fewer than 100000 nuclear families originate from xiangyang ezhou yichang enshi and shiyan the distribution of households with 3-4 members is similar to that of nuclear familiesit also presents the distribution of the origins of wuhans floating population who originate from within hubei province according to the statistical results rural household registers account for 83 equating to a population of approximately 312 million the proportion of the group who was working and doing business in urban areas is 77 and the population is 289 million the size of the population distribution in each city is similar to the aforementioned migration types and other variables and is not reported herein table 8 the overall educational level of those members of wuhans floating population who originate from hubei province is higher than the national level with approximately 52 having been educated to junior high school level and below approximately 29 to high schoolsecondary school level and below and approximately 19 to college and above however in those members of wuhans floating population who originate from the surrounding cities of wuhan which contribute a large number of people to the floating population of wuhan namely xiaogan huanggang huangshi suizhou dmp cities xianning and ezhou 50 of people have an educational level of junior high school and below with this being 60 in xiaogan this means that the awareness of health protection and timely treatment may be low in this section of the floating population of wuhan which will heighten the risk of large-scale transmission of 2019-ncovthe floating population in wuhan will serve as a sound predictor for the trend of the 2019-ncov outbreak the pearsons correlation coefficient between the proportion of the floating population in wuhan who originate from a certain region of hubei and the number of confirmed 2019-ncov cases in each region increased from 065 on 25 january 2020 to 084 on 31 january 2020 table 9 this indicates that when a region contributes a higher number of people to the floating residential population of wuhan more confirmed cases will emerge in this region we assumed that the effect of the floating population on the transmission of the 2019-ncov is consistent across hubei province and selected three prefectures that contribute the greatest number of people to the floating population of wuhan xiaogan huanggang and jingmeng as the reference prefectures to predict the epidemic trend of the 2019-ncov at prefecture level those prefectures can be divided into three groups since 28 january 2020 figure 3 1 prefectures with a rapid increase in confirmed cases comprising jingmen xianning xiangyang ezhou yichang and enshi 2 prefectures with a moderate growth in confirmed cases comprising huanggang suizhou huangshi and shennongjia and 3 prefectures with a slow increase in confirmed cases comprising xiaogan dmp cities and jingzhou our predictions of the epidemic trends of the 2019-ncov outbreak within hubei province are as follows 1 the epidemic growth model for jingmen predicts a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases in xiaogan dmp cities and jingzhou in other words if the epidemic pattern in jingmen is regarded as a typical evolutionary pattern of the spread of 2019-ncov the actual number of confirmed cases of 2019-ncov in xiaogan dmp cities and jingzhou have been greatly underestimated for example the number of confirmed cases in xiaogan on 31 january 2020 would reach 1190 but the number of officially announced cases was only 541 this could be attributable to a lack of sufficient diagnostic capabilities or undisclosed data from the government or both 2 the epidemic growth model for xiaogan predicts a rapid increase in the number of confirmed 2019-ncov cases in jingmen xianning xiangyang ezhou yichang and enshi if this is true large-scale outbreaks have occurred in these places but their regional governments have either not detected this or true figures are not available or revealed 3 the epidemic growth model for huanggang better fits the actual epidemic situation of the 2019-ncov outbreak based on the floating population and the intensity of medical intervention the outbreak in xiaogan dmp cities and jingzhou may be underestimated while the rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases in jingmen xianning and xiangyang may be affected by other unknown factors or uncontrollable random factors that need further investigationthe floating population of wuhan originated from outside hubei province may have promoted the spread of 2019-ncov table 10 compares the number of individuals travelling from wuhan to other provinces and the daily number of confirmed cases for those other provinces analysis revealed that the correlation coefficient at the provincial level was lower than at the prefecture level within hubei province but the correlation coefficient increased from 04 on 25 january 2020 to 063 on 31 january 2020table 10 also shows the ratio of confirmed cases in each province to the proportion of people in the floating population in wuhan who originate from each of these provinces on 28 january 2020 we divide provinces into two categories based on their short-term travel populations in wuhan and wuhans travelling population to other provinces during the spring festival holiday the first category comprises those provinces that have large-scale short-term business trips or tourist populations in wuhan during the spring festival holiday namely beijing shanghai tianjin and hainan obviously such a high level of inter-provincial population mobility may exacerbate the spread of 2019-ncov for example the high ratio of confirmed cases in guangdong province may be due to the large short-term travel populations visiting shenzhen and guangzhou and wuhan while the high ratio of confirmed cases in hainan province may result from the outbound tourist population from wuhan to hainan during the spring festival holiday in table 10 the results are divided into two parts the correlation coefficient of the first category of provinces which reaches a maximum of 096 and the correlation coefficient of the second category of provinces which increased from 056 to 07 this abovementioned second category comprise the other 25 provinces that have small short-term business trip groups or tourist populations in wuhan during the spring festival holiday we assumed that the effect of the floating population on the spread of 2019-ncov was consistent across the country the other 25 provinces are divided into three groups since 25 january 2020 figure 4 1 provinces with a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases namely zhejiang shandong guangxi shaanxi liaoning and yunnan 2 provinces with a moderate increase in the number of confirmed cases namely hunan chongqing sichuan fujian jiangsu hebei gansu heilongjiang shaanxi guizhou qinghai jilin xinjiang inner mongolia tibet and ningxia and 3 provinces with a small increase in the number of confirmed cases namely henan anhui and jiangxi in table 10 if we exclude the data of henan province and zhejiang province from the second category we find that the correlation coefficient on 31 january 2020 is 093we selected four provinces henan hunan sichuan and zhejiang as the reference provinces to predict the epidemic trend of 2019-ncov in each province we found that 1 the epidemic growth model of henan province does not fit the situation in most other provinces that is except in anhui and jiangxi the actual number of outbreaks in other provinces was higher than that predicted by the henan model as these provinces have large floating populations in wuhan the rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases in henan anhui and jiangxi may result from effective measures that have been taken to control the spread of 2019-ncov or the lack of sufficient diagnostic capabilities to detect suspected cases 2 the epidemic growth model for hunan and sichuan province predicts a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases in henan anhui and jiangxi provinces thus if the epidemic pattern in hunan and sichuan follows a typical evolutionary pattern the current numbers of confirmed cases in the three provinces of henan anhui and jiangxi are greatly underestimated for example the number of confirmed cases in henan on 31 january 2020 would be between 860 and 889 but the number in official announcements was only 168 in contrast the number of confirmed cases in zhejiang shandong guangxi shaanxi liaoning and yunnan provinces were higher than the predicted number which may be affected by uncontrollable local factors that need further investigation 3 the epidemic growth model for zhejiang province predicts a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases in most provinces especially jiangsu and fujian provinces that are adjacent to zhejiang it is important to investigate why there were so many confirmed cases in zhejiang and whether the outbreak in jiangsu and fujian province was not detected in a timely manner or whether all possible cases have not yet occurredoverall the predicted epidemic pattern for hunan and sichuan provinces fits best to the actual epidemic trend of the 2019-ncov outbreak however the current number of confirmed cases in henan anhui and jiangxi provinces is likely to be underestimated especially given that these contain extensive rural areas with large populations and limited medical resources the higher actual number of confirmed cases in zhejiang shandong guangxi shaanxi liaoning and yunnan provinces may be affected by other unknown factors or uncontrollable random factors that need further investigationto prevent or mitigate the spread of an emerging infectious disease and its negative effects public health interventions mainly aim at three types of population namely the population in the source area the floating population leaving the source area and the population travelling from the infected area to other areas the spring festival in 2020 is much earlier than in previous years at this time the possibility of human-to-human transmission of a new coronavirus had just been discovered when the wuhan municipal government decided on 23 january 2020 to close the city to control the outflow of population more than 5 million people had already left wuhan on the spring festival holiday and it was too late to control the entire potentially infected population in the epidemic area at present chinas high-speed railway and expressway transportation network has experienced great development this fast and convenient transportation has led to a floating population that can leave the source area to quickly reach every part of the country which makes it very difficult to quarantine the floating population leaving the source area through transportation stations in addition there is an incubation period after human infection further increasing the difficulty of quarantine at traffic stations which is also an important reason for the implementation of city closure control policies in many cities across the countryafter 2019-ncov was confirmed as being capable of transmitting from human to human the chinese government implemented top to bottom national mobilisation it fully investigated and isolated the population of wuhan and also publicised the severity of the epidemic and also increased awareness of the prevention of infectious diseases and raised peoples vigilance through messages on television mobile communications and the internet in addition according to the latest epidemic surveillance the incubation period of the coronavirus is 3 to 7 days with an upper limit of 14 days for this reason the central government has issued an executive order to extend the spring festival holiday from 30 january to 2 february 2020 many provinces are even requiring firms to not restart work until 9 february except those necessary for social operations related to the national economy and peoples livelihood extending the holiday is needed to avoid the returning people leaving home early and returning to work so as to minimise the risk of the epidemic spreading again due to population fluctuationsthere are limitations to this study first our analysis did not include other large-scale populations for example some are college students because wuhan is the city with the largest number 1 million of college students in china and the world the other parts include short-term business travellers transit passengers and tourists official media reported that the size of the populations during the spring festival holiday would reach more than 30 million this can be confirmed from the daily-confirmed cases of 2019-ncov infection although there is a small permanent population in wuhan whose household register belongs to provinces and cities such as beijing shanghai tianjin hainan and guangdong in fact shenzhen and guangzhou are two megacities these provinces and cities still have large-scale temporary floating populations from and to wuhan because of the large population and well-developed economy therefore the number of confirmed cases of 2019-ncov infection in these areas is far ahead of that in most other provinces that have a large floating population in wuhan second our sample has a certain deviation the data on the origin of wuhans floating population does not include hong kong macao or international migrants which makes our research unable to estimate the population size of these regions at present some cases have been confirmed in surrounding asian countries europe north america and australia third limited to interdisciplinary research capabilities our model does not include infectious disease analysis models such as sir to further analyse the potential and scale of 2019-ncov spread which may reduce the value of this research in the prevention and control of 2019-ncov infections finally the results of the study are mainly applicable to the end of the spring festival holiday and after the large-scale population comes back to work or study the spread of the epidemic will be more complicatedwe believe that the abovementioned limitations can be overcome using big data such as location information of transportation and mobile internet short-term floating populations can be included in the study to maximise the estimated population flotation and scale in wuhan unfortunately thus far we have not seen a rigorous study using big data to analyse the outflow of populations in the epicentre of an epidemic this means that there is still a long way to go for the research and application of big data in the field of national and global public healthat the time of writing this paper 29 january 2020 all provinces in china have reported confirmed or suspected cases of 2019-ncov every prefecture and city in hubei province has confirmed cases of 2019-ncov and transmission of 2019-ncov has spread from imported to inter-regional due to the fact that 5 million migrants had left wuhan before the closure of the city our research reveals a high correlation between the number of wuhans floating population and the number of confirmed cases fortunately the origin of wuhans floating population is highly concentrated in hubei province and its surrounding provinces of which the migrants with hubei household registers account for 75 and more than 80 of the population is concentrated in the top 30 districts and counties this means that some areas will face a very high risk of epidemic outbreaks but it is also conducive to centralised resources enabling prevention and control of the epidemic to avoid large-scale spread in other regionsmore than 5 million of wuhans floating population have returned to their hometowns as potential carriers of the virus and may become carriers of the viruss re-transmission due to chinas urban and rural dualistic structure most of these people are rural migrant workers with low levels of education the results find that 85 of the migrants have rural household registers these people who frequently work outdoors or work overtime are more likely to be susceptible because of their poor diet and nutrition at the same time most of these people travel with 34 family members and the susceptible and high-risk population over 40 years old accounts for a large proportion of this floating population which provides ideal conditions for the transmission of 2019-ncov within families to make matters worse the rural areas where these people return to have very limited medical and public health services and gatherings during the spring festival aggravate the risk of virus transmission in the communityso far confirmed cases of 2019-ncov continue to increase every day across china the results of our model analysis indicate that on the one hand the correlation between the size of the floating population and the number of confirmed cases in wuhan has continued to increase over time and by 28 january the correlation coefficient of these factors in hubei province had reached 078 which means that the size of the floating population in wuhan is an important parameter for predicting the epidemic on the other hand we also found that the effect of the size of the floating population in wuhan is heterogeneous across regions some areas have a large floating population in wuhan including henan anhui and jiangxi provinces and xiaogan city jingzhou city and the three county-level cities directly under the provincial government and yet the number of confirmed cases of 2019-ncov is apparently relatively small however we believe that the epidemic situation in these areas may be underestimated considering the serious consequences of delays in diagnosis and loopholes in infection control in suspected or confirmed cases of sars in the sars epidemic in 2003 it is necessary to strengthen surveillance in these areas to determine the causes of the fewer confirmed cases of 2019-ncov in these areas
