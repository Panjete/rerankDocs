safe treatments for covid-19 coronavirus disease a systematic benefit-risk assessment was designed and conducted to strengthen the ongoing monitoring of the benefit-risk balance for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in covid-19 treatment the overall benefit-risk of the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for covid-19 compared to standard of care placebo or other treatments was assessed using the benefit-risk action team brat framework we searched pubmed and google scholar to identify literature reporting clinical outcomes in patients taking chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 a value tree was constructed and key benefits and risks were ranked by two clinicians in order of considered importance results several potential key benefits and risks were identified for use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in covid-19 treatment for the benefit of virological clearance three studies were identified a significant risk difference rd between hydroxychloroquine and the comparator group standard of care was found for only one study rd058 95 ci 017 098 the risk difference was not significant for the other two studies rd-007 95 ci-075 061 and rd008 95 ci-074 091 in addition no significant risk difference between hydroxychloroquine and the comparator group standard of care was identified for the risk of abnormal liver function tests lfts rd007 95 ci -028 041 overall no conclusion can be made on the benefit-risk profile of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in the treatment of covid-19 compared to standard of care placebo or other treatments at this time whilst the availability of comparative data are limited the current framework summarises the key anticipated benefits and risks as further data from clinical trials and real world use on these benefits and risks becomes available this can be incorporated into the framework for an ongoing benefit-risk assessment  coronaviruses have circulated among humans and animals for many years of which several strains are highly transmissible and pathogenic in humans 1  severe acute respiratory syndrome sars emerged in 2002 and 2003 while middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov emerged 10 years later 1  in december 2019 a novel coronavirus emerged in wuhan china 2  subsequently called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 3  sars-cov-2 causes coronavirus disease coronaviruses predominantly cause respiratory tract infections in humans 1  specifically the main symptoms of covid-19 have been reported as fever cough and shortness of breath 5  with a less abrupt onset of symptoms compared to sars 6 7  data are still emerging regarding the epidemiology of covid-19 though initial reports estimate a transmission rate basic reproduction number r0 of 22 8 and a case fatality rate that increases among older adults 9  given the current pandemic there is an urgent need to identify effective safe treatments for covid-19 two such proposed treatments are chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine which are well-established medications predominantly used to treat malaria lupus and rheumatoid arthritis in vitro studies have shown that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are effective at inhibiting sars-cov-2 infection with the latter appearing to have more potent antiviral activity 10 11  thus repositioning of these drugs as antiviral therapies for covid-19 is of global interest however clinical data are limited and inconclusive currently there are multiple ongoing clinical trials for use of these treatments in covid-19 while the us food and drug administration fda has issued an emergency use authorization eua for oral formulations of chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate for patients hospitalised with covid- 19 12  to date whilst there have been many publications which have described the main effectiveness and safety concerns with these treatments there has not been a systematic benefit-risk assessment on the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 treatment using a structured descriptive framework a systematic benefit-risk assessment strengthens the ongoing monitoring of the benefit-risk balance for chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in covid-19 treatment for this assessment the benefit-risk action team brat framework is highly applicable as it allows identification of the key benefits and risks of a product in a defined disease context within a structured descriptive framework further quantitative assessments can then be applied and conducted according to the availability of relevant data at that time 13  the brat framework was also specifically designed to assist communication with regulatory authorities 14  the decision- cc-by-nd 40

publicly available information to date data-lock april 7 th 2020 it is however acknowledged that there is extremely limited data available from ongoing clinical trials at this timepoint to inform the debate expeditiously the benefit-risk assessment has been designed to be implemented regardless of the quantity of data available the intention is that the framework will subsequently be readily available to repeat the assessment as further data arise eg results from new clinical trials allowing for rapid decision-making to examine the benefit-risk profile of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in covid-19 patients compared to standard of care placebo or other treatments the overall benefit-risk of the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for covid-19 compared to standard

contribution to the wncb and risks have a negative contribution 17  the overall wncb would be considered positive benefit outweighs the risk where wncb 0 a sensitivity analysis can also be used to

potential key benefits were identified with use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in covid-19 treatment reduction in risk of death reduction in icu admission reduction in non-invasive ventilation

interactions cardiac toxicity is of particular importance for covid-19 patients both potentially the disease itself and anticipated treatment strategies with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine pose significant risk of cardiac arrhythmias 21  short term use as expected for the treatment of covid-19 is likely to pose a lower risk of cardiac toxicity nevertheless the risk cannot be overlooked as patients are expected to be on higher doses possibly concomitantly taking other qt prolonging agents in addition to having a potentially elevated risk due to the disease itself one of the most serious toxic effects of hydroxychloroquine chloroquine are ocular side effects notably retinopathy 22 23 24 25 26  although the risk for hydroxychloroquine is considered to be lower 27  both duration of use and weight-based dosing dose per kg are important parameters for the risk of developing retinopathy 26  the risk of retinal damage over a short time period may be negligible even with high doses 25  however given the seriousness of the outcome we have identified this as a key risk in the benefit-risk framework in addition whilst the most robust evidence for safety concerns associated with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is with longer term use although rare there have been case reports after  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has

opposed to longer duration of use with respect to adverse hepatic and haematological effects and hypoglycaemia 28 29 30  very few studies were identified that compared benefits and risks between those

the benefit of virological clearance three studies with very small sample sizes were identified these studies examined virological clearance at different time points as their primary outcome meaning results from these studies could not be pooled only one study revealed a significant risk difference between hydroxychloroquine and the comparator group standard of care though given the small sample size and biases in the study design this should be interpreted with caution for the risk of abnormal lfts only one studied was identified with a small sample size no significant risk difference between hydroxychloroquine and the comparator group standard of care whilst there is a paucity of comparative data from the literature search at this stage we identified a number of reports in

future benefit-risk assessments once an appropriate treatment comparator has been identified which should be an established treatment for covid-19 given the paucity of available data on benefits and risks with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine compared to standard of care placebo or other treatments we chose not to undertake a fully quantitative assessment of the benefit-risk balance at this time instead all available comparative data for key benefits and risks are presented in a summary table further data from clinical trials and observational studies are required in order to determine whether the benefit-risk profile of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in treating covid-19 is favourable an important point for discussion regardless of the benefits and risks of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for covid-19 treatment is the availability of these medicines inadequate  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a

guaranteed for those using these treatments for licensed indications or covid-19 this must be taken into consideration in addition to the benefit-risk assessment since there can be no benefit from a medication which is unobtainable sample sizes for each outcome were limited to those available in the original studies and may not have adequate power to detect differences in risk between groups especially where the outcomes examined were not the primary outcome of interest the benefit-risk assessment is limited by the availability of data in the published literature however this assessment can be subsequently updated once further data from clinical trials are available in addition given the public health urgency of the covid-19 pandemic it is important to provide a systematic assessment of the benefits and risks of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine treatments with evidence available to date and create a framework which can be used to rapidly update the assessment when further data are available data quality is not reflected in this benefit-risk assessment though all data included were extracted from peer-reviewed manuscripts of note a statement was issued by the international society of antimicrobial chemotherapy 32 regarding the gautret et al paper published in the international journal of antimicrobial agents 18  the paper was not considered to meet the societys expected standards and though it was peer-reviewed the editor-in-chief was not involved in this process 32  confirmation of causality was not a requirement for inclusion of data in the brat assessment patients may have been on other concomitant medications or had other medical conditions at the time of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine treatment finally we considered hospitalisation of patients to reflect severe covid-19 but we acknowledge that severity of disease may vary regardless of hospitalisation overall no conclusion can be made on the benefit-risk profile of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in the treatment of covid-19 compared to standard of care placebo or other treatments at this time whilst the availability of comparative data are limited the current framework summarises the key anticipated benefits and risks as further data from clinical trials and real world use on these benefits and risks becomes available this can be incorporated into the framework for an ongoing

for this preprint this version posted may 12 2020 no data -   commentary on hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of covid-19 results of an open label non-randomized clinical trial by gautret et al mondher toumi samuel aballea   this was a prospective open-label nonrandomized controlled trial conducted across five study centers one center institut hospitalo-universitaire mediterrane ihu administered hydroxychloroquine while four centers from the same region recruited the control patients it is unclear whether the control patients were part of the study or not in the protocol the reported sample size power calculation applies to a comparative 2-arm study however the abstract refers to a single-arm study and according to the protocol submitted to the eu clinical trials register clinicaltrialsregistereu id number 2020-000890-25fr the study was originally designed as a noncontrolled study thus it appears that the control arm was a later amendment of the study the intervention hydroxychloroquine alone or combined with azithromycin was used in addition to the standard of care for the treatment of coronavirus 2 the comparator was standard of care which is not yet standardized  this may introduce a bias the patients receiving the active treatment were enrolled in a specialized unit benefiting from high-level experts and the most up-to-date infrastructure in comparison control patients recruited through other hospitals such as brianon which is a remote hospital in the french alps would receive fair and good quality of care but not as specialized as in the ihu this raises the question of whether differences in management of patients between centers and therefore between arms might have influenced the outcomes of viral clearance management of these patients is intensive to help them survive by maintaining vital functions and preventing complications eg infections or heart or kidney failure however differences in patient management may not necessarily impact coronavirus carriage and clearance in addition an open study always raises the issue of observer bias ie the investigators knowledge of a patients treatment may influence the study outcome assessment when considering subjective outcomes it represents a very important source of bias however in this case the outcome measure is an automated biological measure it is very unlikely that the outcome measure might have been influenced by the open design development of the study product for a double-blind trial would have required several months to provide an appropriate formulation and relevant stability data as required by good manufacturing practicesgood clinical practices it is not a feasible option in the context of the ongoing crisis these important methodologic biases represent clear conceptual methodologic limitations and several could have been avoided but it is unlikely that avoiding them would have reversed the trend seen in the trial the study included hospitalized patients aged over 12 years with polymerase chain reaction pcrdocumented coronavirus 2 carriage from a nasopharyngeal sample at admission whatever their clinical status the patients who refused to receive hydroxychloroquine were used as control patients as were noneligible patients obviously this makes the comparability of participants between the control and active treatment arms highly questionable when comparing two treatment arms it is important to have comparable populations alternatively statistical methods should be used to control for differences in patient characteristics between arms there is an obvious selection bias as patients were not randomly assigned patients from the ihu were very different from those at the other centers and were channeled based on unknown drivers as expected the analysis of baseline characteristics showed clear differences between the treatment arms the hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were older 51 years vs 37 years were less likely to be asymptomatic 10 vs 25 and were more likely to present with pneumonia 30 vs 125 these differences are considerable even if nonstatistically significant but are probably a bias against the hydroxychloroquine intervention this suggests that the study provided conservative results when considering population differences indeed older and more severely ill patients are likely to have a weaker immune defense response to virusbacterial infection although this may have serious impact on the patient prognosis and survival it may have limited impact on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine on virus clearance it is unclear in the publication whether participants in both the active and control arm gave informed consent however as control patients were treated according to normal practice and the primary outcome assessment was not interfering with their normal care they may be considered an external standard-of-care control arm that may not be part of the study although this point requires clarification it is unlikely to affect the results carriage of coronavirus 2 is based on nasal and oropharynx sampling and assessed through a well-established technique to detect coronavirus 2 rna using real-time reverse transcriptase-pcr it is a reliable technique and should not raise significant objections however it appears the endpoint was changed during the study although the article is unclear about this the planned assessment time points were days 1 4 7 and 14 and the reported sample size calculation refers to a reduction in viral load at day 7 this contradicts the outcome section of the article in which the primary outcome is stated to be viral clearance at day 6 results are reported at days 3 4 5 and 6 it may be that 7 days was initially intended as the main assessment endpoint but the authors decided to report findings after 6 days when clear results were observed considering the urgency of the situation however these contradictions within the article as well as between the article and the protocol raise questions about the credibility of the article it is important to note that this endpoint is a surrogate endpoint and would not preclude clinical and survival benefit however with the lack of approved drugs to fight coronavirus 2 infection which can be fatal in some patients this information is of high importance the dosing of hydroxychloroquine is well reported in the methods section 200 mg three times a day for 10 days however the administration schedule of azithromycin is not reported in the description of the methods but rather in the results section it may also be noted that there is no mention of azithromycin in the summary protocol on the eu clinical trials register according to the abstract the patients receiving azithromycin were selected based on clinical profile but the specific profile is not reported there is no clarity on this point the review of the baseline results does not allow identification of clear criteria such as age lower respiratory tract infection or onset of disease the plasma concentration of hydroxychloroquine in this combination therapy arm is not different from the monotherapy treatment arm male patients were more likely to receive azithromycin male patients comprised 37 of the control arm 28 of the hydroxychloroquine arm and 66 of the combined hydroxychloroquineazithromycin arm there is an obvious imbalance however it is unclear how sex may be a confounding factor how this may have impacted the very high rate of clearance of covid-19 in this subgroup population still must be clarified although this constitutes poor practice in study reporting it is unlikely to introduce a significant bias in the reported results the use of the fisher exact test is appropriate but statistical methods for interim analyses and early interruption of clinical trials were not used19 it appears daily interim statistical analyses were performed and the trial was interrupted early without using methods to control for the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis of no treatment differences however the magnitude of difference appears to be so large that the hypothesis of no difference between arms would be rejected even if appropriate methods for interim statistical had been used a very important point concerns the population used to assess the primary endpoint the authors used the per-protocol population whereas intention-to-treat analysis is normally employed for clinical trials aiming to establish the superiority of a clinical treatment20 this is a particularly important point in this study as all patients who dropped out belonged to the hydroxychloroquine arm this imbalance requires a careful reanalysis of the results among the patients who dropped out three patients were transferred to the intensive care unit two were pcr positive and one was pcr negative at the time of transfer one died while being pcr negative one withdrew consent while being pcr negative and one stopped because of adverse event nausea while being pcr positive thus of the patients who dropped out 50 were negative at the time of dropout and 50 were positive by performing a statistical analysis using the last-observation-carried-forward imputation method to account for missing data a conservative methodology widely used by regulatory authorities21 we could assess the proportion of patients who were negative at 65 for hydroxychloroquine arm compared with 125 for the control arm which is still statistically significant p  00012 and very clinically relevant if we employ a very conservative method that assumes all dropouts were pcr positive at day 6 the proportion of patients who were pcr negative would become 54 for hydroxychloroquine arm compared with 125 for the control arm this is still statistically significant p  0096 and very clinically relevant finally it is informative also to consider separately the subgroup of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone among whom the proportion with viral clearance was 57 compared with 125 for the control arm this difference is again significant from statistical p  00187 and clinical perspectives although there may be uncertainty in the effect size ranging from 50 to 70 the intervention has shown a very large effect size that could not be undermined by statistical considerations the poor quality of medical writing is also an issue we identified more than a dozen inaccuracies imprecisions or mistakes in the abstract alone they are reported in table 1 this may be related to the time pressure to release the first non-chinese clinical results on coronavirus 2infected patients however this level of medical writing may compromise the perceived quality of the evidence reported and may lead readers to doubt the quality of investigational procedures used during the trial as well it is important that they be corrected in the final version uploaded in the journal
 this study has been poorly reported and the trial design introduces several biases some of these biases could have been avoided at the time of protocol development with thoughtful consideration the quality of medical writing is poor and suggests a quickly written manuscript and no support from a skilled methodologist the priority obviously was given to the fast communication of the results that may have a dramatic impact in a situation of a severe pandemic the authors could have significantly improved the quality of their manuscript and its public health impact by discussing in a more transparent way all the limitations of the study and invested additional effort in medical writing however none of these observations is of a nature to reverse the results these results appear to be acceptable in the light of the effect size these data may have been influenced by the several biases identified in the study manuscript but not to an extent to make the intervention ineffective it clearly works even if we cannot accurately specify the actual effect size in china 483 studies on covid-19 were registered on the national clinical trial registry22 the most studied intervention was chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as monotherapy or as part of combination therapy represented in 17 trials most results are not yet published but evidence has accumulated on the effectiveness of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine a recent review of 100 patients aggregated from several trials has been published and reports the benefit of chloroquine on clearing coronavirus 2 from infected patients23 however it does not provide details on patient disposition and outcomes it aims to be a signal to the community that evidence supports the use of chloroquine but details are to follow as these trials are not yet finalized the us centers for disease control and prevention provides information on the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in the usa to treat coronavirus 2infected patients they describe a multiplicity of different hydroxychloroquine regimens currently used in the usa it is also used as a prophylactic treatment for health-care professionals24 beyond chinese trials on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine several randomized trials are being conducted on efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine in the usa south korea norway and australia in coronavirus 2infected patients clinicaltrialsgov id nct04316377 nct04315896 and nct04308668 in addition two studies are ongoing assessing the prophylactic effect for health-care professionals exposed or not exposed to patients infected with coronavirus 2 clinicaltrialsgov id nct04318015 and nct04308668 all 8 of the treatment guidelines endorsed by the national health commission of china including a chinese expert consensus report recommended using chloroquine 500 mg twice daily for 10 days maximum table 2 2532 however one guideline recommended not using it in conjunction with azithromycin to avoid the risk of cardiac arrhythmia table 2
 the korean guidelines recommend the use of chloroquine 500 mg twice daily or hydroxychloroquine 400 mg per day33 the gautret et al study is consistent with the results of recent chinese studies not fully reported and is very consistent with current scientific knowledge there is a well-founded biological assumption to support the validity of the tested hypothesis real-world large-scale clinical practice in china and korea supports the experimental finding even though the exact contribution of the chloroquine in control of the outbreak cannot be accurately quantified at this time in either country all current evidence while not as robust as that from a double-blind randomized clinical trial points to the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in patients with coronavirus 2 infection evidence-based medicine teaches us to consider all evidence including case reports and expert opinions for decision-making in the specific case of available evidence on hydroxychloroquine used in coronavirus 2 infection the recommendation would receive an evidence level 2b or 2 c 3436 such evidence grading supports the recommendation for use of hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 infection especially in a crisis situation the overall knowledge around hydroxychloroquine should translate to policy decision-making to control the covid-19 pandemic especially as no alternative option currently exists in readily accessible quantities in france methodology tends to supersede all evidence if the methodology is not perfect the evidence is ignored this is very well illustrated by the debate between two major experts in the field jean luc harousseau and jean franois bergman both highly respected experts with extensive experience in policy decision-making in several governmental agencies37 in this context the poor reporting and the multiplicity of biases in this study prevent any french methodologist from considering the study while a careful assessment would have shown the limited impact of poor reporting and biases on the results french methodologists tend to disqualify studies but not to assess learning points despite biases and put them in the context of current knowledge the possible second scientific obstacle may be competition between scientists there is always a very high competition among scientists to be first some scientists succeeded in establishing the gautret et al study as a hypothesis-generation study and not a hypothesis-testing study several other experts were convinced that the biases and poor reporting invalidated the study results in addition a large european study discovery will be launched next week and will enroll 3200 patients in 5 arms including placebo remdesivir a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir with or without interferon beta and hydroxychloroquine apparently without azithromycin38 six hundred and fifty patients per arm seems large but no information is available at the time of writing concerning how the sample size was estimated depending on the population included results may just be negative little is reported at the time we submit this manuscript who is launching a similar but global study called solidarity to test the same interventions against placebo3 thus the decision on the recommendation of hydroxychloroquine may be delayed until several hypothesis-testing studies are reported while a lot of knowledge is available from chinese and south korean experience the low risk associated with a hydroxychloroquine recommendation to a specific population versus the potential high benefit would argue in favor of the use of hydroxychloroquine until more evidence brings definite results rather than waiting for new evidence it is very difficult for politicians to make the right decision in a crisis all decisions are scrutinized and criticized hydroxychloroquine has been presented as an unsafe therapy and the study has been widely criticized in the media the primacy of the precautionary principle primare non nocere after the extensive transmission of hiv via blood transfusion in france has left profound effects 3940 and decision-makers are driven by safety first when making decisions more recently the massive ordering of h1n1 vaccines and stockpiling of antivirals in france has provoked considerable public controversy41 the european public health decision-makers appear to be risk-averse this is very clear when comparing the us food and drug administration and european medicines agency regulatory approval decisions an important question will likely raise future controversy when evidence has accumulated why did we not start the recommendation of hydroxychloroquine prescription earlier the risk of serious adverse events with short-term administration of hydroxychloroquine is well below all the case fatality rate estimates in europe42 hydroxychloroquine may offer the potential to quickly control the covid-19 outbreak and associated social and economic psychiatric consequences as well as consequences for health-care professionals with adverse events that are manageable the current confinement strategy will probably have worse direct consequences on health eg severe psychiatric consequences43 it will also have indirect consequences on health as economic losses entailed by this strategy will impact future funding of health systems if a therapeutic option is available with limited evidence one should carefully weigh the benefit and the risk of that option versus alternative options hydroxychloroquine treatment with massive testing and limited confinement has successfully worked in south korea to control the outbreak with an impressively low rate of fatalities44 gautret et al conducted a quick and dirty study as methodologists would legitimately say with poor quality reporting and several biases however the critical review of this study suggests that it brings useful knowledge on the top of an already existing one that could have prompted quicker policy decision-making a temporary conditional approval known in france as recommandation temporaire dutilisation could have been granted to hydroxychloroquine and potentially saved lives assuming the ongoing studies return negative results everyone will consider it a good decision not to recommend hydroxychloroquine but if the results are positive which is highly probable then there will be furious discussion over why it was not taken earlier in that case we will learn about the risk of delaying decisions in an uncertain environment evidence-based medicine would likely allow an intermediate grade for recommending the use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of some specific cases of covid-19 so far european decision-makers have shown very little ability to learn from china 45 and south korea44 the only two countries that have been able to control the outbreak cultural differences language barriers and arrogance from the old europe may certainly explain why best practice knowledge sharing failed in this situation  hydroxychloroquine and covid-19 a cellular and molecular biology based update amit pal anil pawar kalyan goswami praveen sharma rajendra prasad   without a therapeutic vaccine or specific antiviral drugs and with a desperate attempt to find a cure against novel corona virus disease 2019 covid-19 1 the limelight was shifted to hydoxychloroquine derivative of chloroquine that has antimalarial antiinflammatory immunosuppressive and antiautophagy activities 2 3 upon a tweet by us president mr donald j trump on 21st march 2020 he tweeted hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin taken together have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine httpstwittercomrealdonaldtrumpstatus1241367239900778501langen however easier said than done initial studies of covid-19 patients treated with hydoxychloroquine with or without azithromycin were shown to have mixed results with more scrutiny being raised over the lack of proper design of these studies without clinical trials and robust methodologically correct scientific studies there is skepticism over benefits and efficacy of hydoxychloroquine against covid-19 till the writing of this article as per the information available on ncbi currently worldwide 1450 clinical trials are going on httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2resultscond22wuhancoronavirus22 and 180 different compounds are being tested against covid-19 httpspubchemncbinlmnihgovtabcompoundquerycovid-1920clinicaltrials though the exact mechanisms are still unclear however it has been established from scientific literature that at the molecular level hydroxychloroquine affects the activity of lysosomes and in turn autophagy and disrupts lysosomal membrane stability also it alters the transcriptional activity and signaling pathways at the cellular level also the precise mode of action of hydroxychloroquine is yet to be delineated based upon current understanding hydroxychloroquine has been shown to inhibit immune system activation suppression of immune system activation by hydroxychloroquine is achieved by reducing cytokine production and toll-like receptor tlr signaling pathways 2 3 the main aim of this review is to discuss the mode of action of hydroxychloroquine at cellular and molecular levels that potentially support the clinical efficacy and few adverse side effects observed in covid-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine which may further help in improving the clinical outcomes by modifying or altering the drug itself or its restricted use in certain individuals by enforcing strict inclusion and exclusion criteria the readers are referred to more holistic review for clinical use of hydroxychloroquine in other diseases like rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus antiphospholipid syndrome and primary sjgren syndrome 2 3 towards the end of year 2019 december 2019 chinese province of wuhan reported the emergence of covid-19 in humans characterized with atypical pneumonia fever dry cough and progressive dyspnea 4 novel coronavirus 2019 ncov-2019 officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was demonstrated to cause covid-19 5 within a span of around 3 months covid-19 spread worldwide forcing the world health organization who to declare it as pandemic on 11th march 2020 as per the who-covid-19 dashboard available at httpscovid19whoint as of 31st may 2020 there have been 5939234 confirmed cases of covid-19 including 367255 deaths worldwide it is now well established that respiratory transmission and direct contact transmission are the main routes for covid-19 transmission previously coronaviruses covs also have been responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers outbreaks 6 7 according to centers for disease control and prevention cdc usa available at httpswwwcdcgovcoronavirus2019-ncovsymptoms-testingsymptomshtml and recent literature covid-19 infected people demonstrate a wide range of symptomsranging from mild symptoms to severe illness most common symptoms of confirmed positive covid-19 patients were fever cough shortness of breath myalgia or fatigue and sore throat whereas headache chills new loss of taste or smell sputum production diarrhea and vomiting like symptoms may also occur 812 elderly people and people who have severe underlying medical conditions seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from covid-19 compared to young healthy adults 9 10 13 14 most of deaths due to covid-19 were due to severe respiratory failure pneumonia and multiple organ failure 10 initially a combination of computed tomography ct imaging electron microscopy and whole genome sequencing were used to screen and identify sars-cov-2 4 1519 confirmatory diagnosis of covid-19 relies on the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr method rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene of the orf1ab sequence e gene n gene and s gene of the sars-cov-2 genome is the basis of rt-pcr tests for the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 4 15 16 among the laboratory parameters most moderate covid-19 patients exhibited leucopenia lymphopenia high level of c-reactive protein crp and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 12 20 however severe covid-19 patients showed frequent lymphopenia with increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase crp ferritin alanine aminotransferase and d-dimer along with grossly higher levels of interleukins ils il-2r il-6 il-10 and tumor necrosis factor- 9 12 14 20 acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multiple-organ failure in covid-19 are thought to result from cytokine storm also known as cytokine release syndrome cytokine storm is an excessive immune response to an external stimulus cytokine storm in severe covid-19 cases if left untreated for a longer time results in an increased risk of vascular hyperpermeability multiorgan failure and eventually death 21 22 due to observance of cytokine storm in severe covid-19 cases some authors have suggested theoretical treatment strategies like use of il-6 and il-1 family antagonists tnf blockers and corticosteroid therapy among other strategies 22 23 hydroxychloroquine pubchem cid 3652 httpspubchemncbinlmnihgovcompound3652 molecular formula c18h26cln3o also known as plaquenil oxichloroquine oxychlorochin is a derivative of chloroquine exhibiting immunosuppressive anti-inflammatory antiautophagy and antimalarial activities due to these properties hydroxychloroquine is now most often used as an antirheumatologic agent in systemic lupus erythematosis and rheumatoid arthritis this is the reason that both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are classified under disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs dmards hydroxychloroquine is derived from chloroquine and differ from it by the presence of a hydroxyl group both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are weak bases and a half-life of around 50 days hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine belong to 4-aminoquinolines drugs class reviewed in 3 as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have almost similar structure and mode of action both drugs can be used against sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 24 25 as compared to chloroquine hydroxychloroquine is a better therapeutic agent in terms of safety index various modes of action have been postulated to explain the therapeutic uses of hydroxychloroquine but most of them are based on in vitro studies reviewed in 3 hydroxychloroquine which is administered as hydroxychloroquine sulfate has a lag time of 0085 h for 200 mg salt it is the time between oral absorption and its measurement in the blood it is usually absorbed in the upper intestinal region 26 and has an overall bioavailability of 0708 the concentration of hydroxychloroquine can vary not only in plasma blood and serum of individual patient but also among different patients 27 it is intriguing to note that hydroxychloroquine has a half-life period of approximately 1-2 months and the mean residence time of nearly 1300 h 28 the precise mechanism of action of hydroxychloroquine is not known till date and there is lots of research going on the existing knowledge gap using diverse advanced scientific tools like 3 computational biology 29 immunology 30 31 structural biology 32 33 modern molecular medicine 34 35 synthetic biology 36 37 and big data-driven public health science 38 39 hydroxychloroquine may suppress immune function by interfering with the processing and presentation of antigens and the production of cytokines acidic vesicles such as endosomeslysosomes which are essential for the membrane fusion act as major locations of action of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine 2 3 40 chloroquine accumulates in lysosomes lysosomotropism and by increasing their ph interferes with the glycosylation of cellular receptor of sars-cov-2 and thereby inhibits the infection of virus 14 40 an important feature of hydroxychloroquine is its capability to inhibit the innate as well as acquired immunity 41 hydroxychloroquine may also affect signaling of tlr receptors by changing the endosomal ph 42 as well as by inhibiting tlrligand interactions further research is required to know the exact mechanism by which this drug affects tlr activation additionally hydroxychloroquine by interfering the lysosomal activity and autophagy inhibits the antigen processing and presentation along with mhc-ii molecules and subsequently immune system activation reduced activation of cd4  t cells leads to decreased production of proinflammatory markers and cytokines 14 40 it has been suggested that autophagy is involved in autoantigen presentation mediated by mhc class ii molecules and activation of t-helper cells 43 because of immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties hydroxychloroquine can prove to be a better remedy for sars-cov-2 patients where cytokine storm has emerged as a potentially fatal condition 12 22 as an anti-inflammatory agent hydroxychloroquine is also used to treat various autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus and sjogrens syndrome 3 5 hydroxychloroquine also exhibits antibacterial property particularly against intracellular bacteria such as coxiella burnetii 44 however due to strong affinity of hydroxychloroquine for melanin it can deposit in tissues such as the skin and the eyes hydroxychloroquine retinopathy 3 hydroxychloroquine is thought to prevent the thrombotic complications by behaving like anticoagulant agents and hence can prove beneficial for cases with a secondary coagulopathy owing to systemic inflammation 45 this is done most probably by inhibiting the platelet aggregation 46 47 or inhibition of binding of antiphospholipid antibody in autoinflammatory diseases 48 hydroxychloroquine is found to be safe to use during pregnancy and various studies have shown that it checks the initiation of congenital heart blockage 49 50 possibly by reducing the expression of a type i interferon ifn signature 51 during combination therapy hydroxychloroquine may interfere the functioning of other drugs or vice versa because it is metabolized by the same enzyme cytochrome p450 cyp which is responsible for the metabolism of many other drugs 3 27 52 53 hydroxychloroquine increases the bioavailability of metoprolol in blood plasma by reducing its metabolism although similar effect is not observed for drugs such as dextromethorphan 54 and methotrexate 55 on the other hand bioavailability of hydroxychloroquine may be affected by the medicines that increase the ph of gastric juice 3 hydroxychloroquine can also interfere with drugs that affect the qt interval hence possibility of cardiac arrhythmia should be checked in such patients 56 57 combination therapy of breast cancer using tamoxifen and hydroxychloroquine may cause eye toxicity due to synergistic inhibition of enzymes in lysosomes of retinal epithelial cells 58 thus duration of such therapy should be monitored carefully some of the adverse outcomes of hydroxychloroquine usage are gastrointestinal effects including nausea vomiting diarrhea and abdominal discomfort 59 moreover hydroxychloroquine-associated cardiotoxic effects including rhythm disorders and cardiomyopathy in rheumatic patients have also been reported 57 60 hydroxychloroquine has attracted attention over the past few decades as a potential antiviral agent and currently as a possible treatment for covid-19 40 61 62 however whether hydroxychloroquine works in vivo against covid-19 remains to be seen conclusively the word of caution is that in randomized controlled trials against a number of viruses including influenza hydroxychloroquine havent work at all hydroxychloroquine is known to decrease the acidity in endosomes which in turn might avert the endosome from releasing the virus into the cytoplasm biggest limitation is the lack of preclinical data for hydroxychloroquine against covid-19 and its repeated failure against most viral diseases under in vivo conditions 61 another issue with hydroxychloroquine is adverse outcomes in certain patients with comorbid conditions who are on other medications 40 61 62 it has been reported that hydroxychloroquine can also interfere with drugs that affect the qt interval 57 one concern in the covid-19 patients receiving hydroxychloroquinechloroquine  azithromycin is the prolongation of qt interval which may possibly increase the risk of torsade de pointes tdp 63 and sudden cardiac death a prospective observational study of large cohort of covid-19 patients treated with chloroquinehydroxychloroquine  azithromycin has demonstrated no instances of tdp or arrhythmogenic death even though it was shown that use of these medications resulted in qt prolongation 64 due to its cellular and molecular effects as discussed in previous sections quite a few clinical trials are studying the effectiveness and safety of hydroxychloroquine also chloroquine for covid-19 httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2resultscond22wuhancoronavirus22 upon searching for interventional studies among clinical trials against covid-19 till the writing of this article we authors have found 885 interventional studies using various drugs among these 885 studies 51 studies were found to be using hydroxychloroquine alone table 1 and 104 studies are using hydroxychloroquine in combination with other antiviralnutritional supplementsprobiotics etc supplementary material 1 most of the studies for hydroxychloroquine against covid-19 are focussing on its safety and efficacy as well its use as a prophylaxis measure against covid-19 table 1 few of these clinical trials are also evaluating optimal hydroxychloroquine dose and its use in moderate and severe covid-19 cases and pregnant covid-19 positive women table 1 seven clinical trial registries were also found in chinese clinical trial registry httpwwwchictrorgcn for using hydoxychloroquine to treat covid-19 5 in a recent significant development on may 22nd 2020 an observational study published in lancet journal reported that hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine when used alone or with macrolide on in-hospital outcomes for covid-19

httpswwwicmrgovinpdfcovidtechdocv5revisedadvisoryontheuseofhcqsarscov2infectionpdf in its revised guidelines published on 22nd may 2020 icmr has expanded to include following personnel for use of hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis for sars-cov-2 infection 1 all asymptomatic healthcare workers working in covid hospitalnon-covid hospitalsnon-covid areas of covid hospitalsblocks 2 asymptomatic frontline workersparamilitarypolice personnel working in covid-19 containment zones and 3 asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory confirmed covid-19 cases covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 had become a pandemic and public health concern considering health and economy related challenges to combat and contain this disease due to sudden emergence of covid-19 the healthcare system was caught unaware without an effective and safe treatment for this infectious disease chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine both are weak bases that tend to accumulate in acidic compartments such as lysosomes and inflamed acidic tissues by raising the intra-lysosomal ph hydroxychloroquine impairs the autophagic protein degradation 3 more studies are required to understand the concentration distribution and effects of hydroxychloroquine in various tissues as well as interrelationship between given dose and response generated identification of exact molecular targets of hydroxychloroquine within the cell as well as on different microbes is the need of hour more importantly efficacy of anti-malarial compounds other than chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine should be monitored against sars-cov including sars-cov-2 newer compounds closely mimicking the hydroxychloroquine like hydroxyferrochloroquine have been synthesized in past and have shown to exert antiviral effects with some selectivity toward sars-cov infection 25 this approach can be further exploited andor reinforced to make newer compound with less toxicity and greater selectivity towards sars-cov-2 there are reports of high risk of thrombosis in patients with severe sars-cov-2 infection 66 and procoagulant pattern of patients with covid-19 ards justify the clinical reports of thromboembolic complications pulmonary embolism during the course of the covid-19 67 interestingly hydroxychloroquine has been associated with reduced risk of thrombosis in several in vitro and animal studies potential mechanisms by which hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine reduce the procoagulatory state in autoinflammatory diseases include inhibition of antiphospholipid antibody binding 48 or inhibition of platelet aggregation 46 47 68 notably in a mouse model of antiphospholipid syndrome hydroxychloroquine treatment was associated with improvement in endothelial function 69 70 the exact molecular mechanisms by which dmard hydroxychloroquine drug mediate their antithrombotic effects remain largely unknown and lay the platform for future prospective studies  effects of chloroquine on viral infections an old drug against todays diseases adrea savarino john boelaert r antonio cassone giancario majori roberto cauda   both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are weak bases that are known to affect acid vesicles leading to dysfunction of several enzymes extracellularly chloroquinehydroxychloroquine is present mostly in a protonated form that due to its positive charge is incapable of crossing the plasma membrane however the non-protonated portion can enter the intracellular compartment where in turn it becomes protonated in a manner inversely proportional to the ph according to the henderson-hasselbach law it is thus not surprising that chloroquinehydroxychloroquine is concentrated within acidic organelles such as the endosome golgi vesicles and the lysosomes where the ph is low and most chloroquinehydroxychloroquine molecules are positively charged4 chloroquinehydroxychloroquine is extruded to the extracellular medium mostly by exocytosis andor through the action of the multidrug resistance protein mrp-1 a cell surface drug transporter belonging to the atp-binding cassette family which also includes the more thoroughly studied p-glycoprotein5 6 7
 it is well established that weak bases by increasing the ph of lysosomal and trans-golgi network tgn vesicles disrupt several enzymes including acid hydrolases and inhibit the post-translational modification of newly synthesized proteins the chloroquine-mediated rise in endosomal ph modulates iron metabolism within human cells by impairing the endosomal release of iron from ferrated transferrin thus decreasing the intracellular concentration of iron this decrease in turn affects the function of several cellular enzymes involved in pathways leading to replication of cellular dna and to expression of different genes8 9
 some viruses enter their target cells by endocytosis this process targets the virus to the lysosomal compartment where the low ph along with the action of enzymes disrupts the viral particle thus liberating the infectious nucleic acid and in several cases enzymes necessary for viral replication chloroquine has been shown to inhibit different viruses requiring a ph-dependent step for entry such as the borna disease virus10 the minute virus of mice mvmp11 and the avian leucosis virus12 of particular interest for human pathology is the report that chloroquine inhibits uncoating of the hepatitis a virus thus blocking its entire replication cycle13
 for some enveloped viruses post-translational modification of the envelope glycoproteins occurs within the endoplasmic and tgn vesicles this process involves proteases and glycosyl-transferases some of which require a low ph in line with the ph-dependence of these events chloroquine was seen to inhibit budding of mayaro virus particles14 and to induce accumulation of non-infectious herpes simplex virus 1 particles in the tgn15 chloroquine also inhibits the replication of members of the flaviviridae family by affecting the normal proteolytic processing of the flavivirus prm protein to m16 as a result viral infectivity is impaired finally chloroquine induces the production of non-infectious retrovirus particles as shown with the avian reticuloendotheliosis virus rev-a and with hiv-117 the mechanism of inhibition seems to be inhibition of glycosylation of the envelope glycoproteins as will be discussed below the accumulation of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine in lymphocytes and macrophages results in anti-inflammatory properties and has led to its clinical use in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis lupus erythematosus and sarcoidosis the last being characterised by an overproduction of tumour necrosis factor  tnf by the alveolar macrophages18 chloroquinehydroxychloroquine reduces the secretion of these proinflammatory cytokines and in particular tnf as shown in a murine macrophage cell line19 and in primary cells such as mouse peritoneal macrophages20 human peripheral blood mononuclear cells21 and human whole blood22 several mechanisms have been evoked to explain the chloroquinehydroxychloroquine-induced inhibition of tnf production by monocyte-macrophages disruption of cellular iron homeostasis23 inhibition of tnf mrna expression20 inhibition at a pretranslational stage by a non-lysosomotropic mechanism24 or at a post-translational stage by blocking the conversion from cell-associated pro-tnf to a soluble mature form19 apart from inhibiting tnf production by stimulated monocyte-macrophages chloroquine also decreases the surface expression of tnf receptors in human monocytic cell lines and hence the receptor-mediated tnf signalling25 the results of such an impairment of tnf-mediated signalling are shown in figure 2
 the studies reviewed here show that chloroquine hydroxychloroquine has in-vitro antiviral effects and anti-inflammatory properties that may be of interest in those viral infections associated with inflammation andor immune activation before analysing the potential effects of a drug on a disease safety criteria have to be met to estimate the riskbenefit ratio chloroquinehydroxychloroquie has a well-studied toxicity profile the half-century-long use of this drug in the therapy of malaria demonstrates the safety of acute administration of chloroquine to human beings the use of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine in rheumatic diseases and for antimalarial prophylaxis showed a low incidence of adverse events during chronic administration of this drug for periods of up to a few years in these cases the most serious toxic effect is a macular retinopathy which depends on the cumulative dose rather than on the daily dose and permanent damage may be prevented with regular visual monitoring during treatment27 28 29 a recent study30 provided encouraging results on the safety of a high dosage of the drug up to 500 mg of chloroquine base per day even during pregnancy we conclude that chloroquinehydroxychloroquine administration presents limited and well-preventable toxicity and may thus result in a low riskbenefit balance at least when it is used in life-threatening conditions henceforth we will discuss the potential usefulness of this old drug in the treatment of two infectious diseases posing a serious threat to public health in the era of globalisationie aids and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars these diseases are both caused by enveloped rna viruses and share some clinical manifestations that are likely to be mediated by immune reactions of the host under testing conditions intended to mimic as best as possible clinical situations chloroquinehydroxychloroquine is capable of inhibiting hiv in vitro this ability was shown either by overloading the cells with high concentrations of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine before the infection17 31 so as to mimic the drug build-up taking place in the tissues of patients subject to chronic treatment or by keeping hiv-infected cells under constant incubation with concentrations of chloroquine detected in whole blood of individuals chronically treated with this drug32 33 the anti-hiv activity of chloroquine has been shown not only in cell line models but also in peripheral blood lymphocytes and monocytes31 33ie cell culture models in which cellular uptake of chloroquine is closer to the conditions occurring in vivo under these conditions it was possible to obtain levels of inhibition of viral replication above 90 that hydroxychloroquine has some antiviral activity in vivo has been reported by two phase ii clinical trials34 35 the first trial was a small randomised doubleblind placebo-controlled pilot study on 40 patients 20 patients per arm 27 of them being antiretroviral treatmentnaive hydroxychloroquine administration for 8 weeks resulted in a mean 06 log reduction in plasma hiv-1 rna copy numbers p002 as well as in a decrease in interleukin 6 concentrations whereas placebo did not have any effects on both hiv-1 rna and interleukin 634 the second trial was also a small randomised double-blinded trial comparing the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine with that of zidovudine monotherapy for 16 weeks in 72 patients 64 of whom being antiretroviral treatment-naive 35 in the hydroxychloroquine arm and 37 in the zidovudine arm hydroxychloroquine again significantly reduced the plasma hiv-1 rna copy numbersml baseline 39 456 31 000 post-treatment 16 434 11 373 mean log reduction 04 p002 though less than zidovudine baseline 42 709 33 050 post-treatment 11 228 7459 mean log reduction 06 p001 since eight of 37 people in the zidovudine group but none of the 35 individuals in the hydroxychloroquine group showed an increase in the hiv-1 rna levels and in the cultured virus levels during therapy these data are consistent with the hypothesis that resistance to hydroxychloroquine may not easily develop as opposed to the well-known development of resistance to monotherapy with other antiretrovirals such as zidovudine35 the results of larger clinical trials will be necessary for an accurate analysis of any possible discrepancies between the effects of chloroquine in vitro and in hiv-infected individuals some of us have recently shown that chloroquine at nontoxic clinically achievable concentrations has in-vitro activity against primary isolates belonging to different hiv-1 and hiv-2 clades33 the mechanism of the anti-hiv effects of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine is a reduction in the infectivity of newly produced virions reviewed in savarino et al2 the antiviral effects of chloroquine are associated with the reduced production of the heavily glycosylated epitope 2g12 which is located on the gp120 envelope glycoprotein surface and is fundamental for virus infectivity33 these effects are likely to be attributed to the increased ph in tgn which impairs the function of glycosyl-transferases involved in the post-translational processing of the hiv glycoproteins2 17 33 hiv glycosylation may therefore represent a new target for antiretroviral therapy as viral envelope glycosylation is mediated by cellular enzymes its inhibition may explain the broad spectrum of the in-vitro anti-hiv activity of chloroquine against all major subtypes of hiv-1 and hiv-233 the effect of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine on cellular rather than viral enzymes may also result in a low propensity to resistance development as chloroquinehydroxychloroquine probably inhibits viral replication by a mechanism different from those of currently used antiretroviral drugs its application has been studied in combination with other antiretroviral drugs the use of chloroquine in combination with other antiretrovirals is theoretically supported by the observation that chloroquine also shows anti-hiv activity in vitro towards isolates from patients in therapeutic failure with a multidrug-resistant profile36

 based on the effects of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine on several enveloped viruses and on immune activation we raise the hypothesis that this drug might be of some use for the clinical management of sars at present any attempt to treat this disease with known antiviral drugsnamely ribavirin and oseltamivirhas been inconclusive49 corticosteroids may be of some benefit in controlling the inflammatory response at the lung level50 but may also cause uncontrolled immunodepression resulting in pulmonary superinfection the causative agent of sars has recently been described as a new coronavirus51 52 recent studies support the idea that coronaviridae infect their target cells by an endocytic pathway and that chloroquine might inhibit their replication53 54 cells infected with the human coronavirus hcov-229e and treated with nocodazole a microtubuledepolymerising agent that blocks transport from early to late endosomes produced decreased amounts of hcov-229e antigens53 this result indicates that endosomal transport is needed for hcov-229e infection cells treated with chloroquine expressed decreased amounts of hcov-229e antigens53 preliminary data obtained from our group confirm these reports and show that chloroquine potently inhibits the replication of a canine coronavirus at therapeutically reachable concentrations c buonavoglia et al university of bari italy unpublished although the sars coronavirus is distinct with unique characteristics it is tempting to ask whether chloroquine might affect sars coronavirus replication as well the anti-inflammatory properties of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine should also be considered the clinical worsening of individuals with sars in week 2 is apparently unrelated to uncontrolled sars coronavirus replication but may be related to immunopathological damage55 a model taking into account the role of proinflammatory cytokines could help interpret this event figure 3
 this view is derived from the effects of the porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv which shares with the sars coronavirus the ability to cause a disease with similar histopathological features and symptomatology57 prcv induces severe lung damage through immune-mediated mechanismsie probably through an increase in the concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf and interleukin 6 whose role in inducing lung damage has been proved using adenoviral vectors in animal models58 on these grounds we think that the associations between tnf and interleukin 6 concentrations and disease severity should also be tested in stored samples from human patients with sars if confirmatory results are obtained then it would be reasonable to consider chloroquinehydroxychloroquine to suppress tnf and interleukin 6 production for this purpose efforts to develop an animal model for sars would be welcome such a model would help to clarify the immunemediated component of the symptoms of the disease as well as in testing of chloroquine and other immunomodulatory drugs these studies could also lay the groundwork for the suggestion that chloroquine be considered for the treatment of other viral infections which involve immunopathology at present it is difficult to answer the question of whether old chloroquine will be able to live a second youth due to its main effectie raising endosomal phthe drug has an exceptionally broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity that could be exploited in many infections results obtained in the prophylaxis of q fever indicate that chloroquinehydroxychloroquine can be successfully used in the clinical management of infections other than malaria59 as regards viral diseases what is clear is that the drug has antiviral and immunomodulatory effects that warrant particular consideration the effects on hiv infection are the best studied among the antiviral effects of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine and are being tested in clinical trials the anti-hiv effect of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine is modest by itself but is at least in vitro additive or synergistic when combined with selected antiretrovirals these in-vitro results warrant in-vivo confirmation in hiv-positive individuals by comparing the long-term antiviral effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy regimens with and without chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine if such studies provide encouraging results they may lead to a strategy whereby co-administration of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine allows lower doses of antiretrovirals lessening cost and possibly toxicity costlessening would of course be particularly welcome in developing countries moreover the potential ability of chloroquine to inhibit the replication of drug-resistant viral isolates could be important in the treatment of drugexperienced hiv-positive patients who have developed multiple resistance to antiretroviral drugs and thus have limited therapeutic options in the developing countries where malaria is endemic the concomitant administration of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine to a highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen may result at least where p falciparum is still susceptible to chloroquine in a decreased incidence of malaria episodes that have adverse effects in hiv-infected people especially during pregnancy60 moreover the anti-inflammatory properties of chloroquine may temper the noxious immune hyperactivation that is characteristic of hivaids61
 due to its broad spectrum of antiviral activity as well as to its suppressive effects on the productionrelease of tnf and interleukin 6 chloroquinehydroxychloroquine may also find a place in the treatment of other viral infections characterized by symptoms associated with inflammatory processes andor immune-hyperactivation we believe that further study should be devoted to the inhibitory effects of chloroquine on the infectivity of flaviviruses as one of the members of this family the hepatitis c virus is of great importance for human pathology and often co-infects individuals with hiv-1 flaviviridae also include several arthropod-borne viruses such as the yellow fever virus and the west nile virus which has recently caused an epidemic in north america finally we want to share with the scientific community the speculative hypothesis that chloroquinehydroxychloroquine due to its antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties may have some effect on sars we emphasise the need of testing in cell cultures infected with sars coronavirus the effects of chloroquine as well as those ofother substances possessing in-vitro activity against members of the coronaviridae family we should remember that the possibility of new outbreaks of sars cannot be excluded in the absence of effective inhibitors of sars coronavirus the possibility of an inhibition at least in vitro of the replication of this virus would represent a breakthrough in the knowledge of sars

to april 2020 eligible study outcomes included extubation or patient recovery relevant data were extracted and analysed by narrative synthesis our results included six studies in the review of which four studies were of good or fair quality all eligible studies included were for coronavirus involving the use of either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to treat common symptoms such as fever cough shortness of breath and fatigue outcomes most commonly reported were improved lung function viral clearance and hospital discharge strong evidence to support the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of covid-19 is lacking fast track trials are riddled with bias and may not conform to rigorous guidelines which may lead to inadequate data being reported the use of these drugs in combination with other medications may be useful but without knowing which groups they are suited for and when they may cause more harm than good  as the covid-19 pandemic has streaked around the plant the pursuit for therapeutic options has developed at a fast pace coronaviruses are not new in the past two decades the virus was responsible for previous outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers yet despite this experience no clear treatment pathway had been agreed in some countries therefore this current pandemic of a variant novel virus has taken the world by surprise with the only option of delivering empirical treatment at the early stages until a vaccine is available in a search to find effective

this the couple achieved remission on different weeks as the course of the disease differed due to individual risk factors patient one had metastatic breast cancer and recent exposure to

dosage guidelines on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine use from china south korea united states netherlands canada and belgium for the treatment of covid-19 using chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine 13  dosage recommendations for adults from each of these sources vary depending on the severity of the cases based on the results of the study the authors conclude that because of its limited side effects availability and costeffectiveness the drugs should be worthy for fast track clinical trials for treatment of covid-19 however another systematic review by sarma et al 14 found that when compared to conventional treatment there was no difference observed in virological cure death clinical worsening of disease or safety the main benefit was that treatment with hydroxychloroquine alone resulted in a lower number of cases showing radiological progression of lung disease additional benefits included less days to temperature normalisation and lowered total cough days compared to conventional treatment the authors recommended that more data is acquired before making a definitive conclusion on the safety and effectiveness of the drugs the results of this systematic review indicate a positive trend favouring the use of chloroquine singularly or the combination of hydroxychloroquine with antibiotic therapy regardless of added bacterial infection at the beginning of the

that immunosuppression may actually enhance treatment effectiveness by the use of the combination of hydroxychloroquine antibiotic therapy and darunavircobicistat in patients who started treatment seven days after initial symptoms these findings have implications for clinical practice and policy in the current pandemic despite the potential therapeutic effect of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine fears exist that excess demand may lead to a shortage for people with other diseases who are currently taking these drugs 19  chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are usually safe and well tolerated in normal dosage but can be extremely toxic in overdose potential adverse effects that should be considered before prescribing include prolongation of the qt interval especially in pre-existing cardiac disease or if combined with azithromycin hypo-glycemia neuropsychiatric effects drug-drug interactions and idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reactions 20  moreover chloroquine is not as widely available as hydroxychloroquine in some countries and is associated with greater adverse effects such as interaction with lopinavirritonavir resulting in prolongation of the qt interval 21 to our knowledge this systematic review is the first attempt to gather evidence from fully published studies that focus on the treatment to date of coronavirus outbreaks in human subjects contrasting to ours previous research explores the suitability of either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in treating coronavirus by relying on findings from animal studies and dosage recommendations from

lives around the world and caused enormous damage to society and economy cebm 2020 world health organization who has declared that the covid-19 is a pandemic and a public health emergency of international concern wee et al 2020 the novel coronavirus or sars-cov-2 has four transmission stages in line with other infectious diseases and is generally categorized into asymptomatic moderate extreme and critical sars-cov-2 exhibits different symptoms depending on the severity of the disease including fever dry cough dyspnea pneumonia hypoxemia encephalopathy heart failure and acute kidney injury there is currently no defined antiviral drug or therapy available for covid-19 treatment and mostly the disease is managed symptomatically yuki et al 2020 several medications are being tested in clinical trials for covid-19 including antiviral anti-inflammatory anti-malarial and other pharmacologically active drugs rabby 2020 however recently chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine are being positioned as a possible treatment for covid-19 presently multi-centric global clinical trials are underway to evaluate the therapeutic potential of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for novel coronavirus infection the food and drug administration fda usa has however approved both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 control and treatment for emergency purposes scholz  derwand 2020 in order to address the virus infection and replication it is critical to understand proteins involved in the process functionally sars-cov-2 consists of two different types of proteins which include structural proteins and non-structural proteins nsps the structural proteins are involved in the formation of the spherical shape of the virus which including spike protein trimeric membrane protein envelope protein and the nucleocapsid protein while sixteen non-structural proteins nsps are formed from the proteolytic cleavage of two polyproteins pp1a and pp1b these nsps are essential for the metabolic and molecular events include transcription and translation prajapat et al 2020 in this context key regulatory proteins and enzymes associated with the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 were selected as drug targets for chloroquine and its derivatives chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are anti-malarial drugs which are also used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus touret  de lamballerie 2020 these drugs are believed to be relatively safe when administered within the clinically advised limits with mild side effects furthermore chloroquine derivatives have been tested on pneumocystis pneumonia pcp for their therapeutic activity to repurposing antimalarial drugs for pneumonia gomes et al 2018 yeo et al 2020 pneumonia is a life-threatening symptom for advanced stage coronavirus infected patients and clinicians are using chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine to treat the disease currently these two drugs are being reused for the treatment of covid-19 since the infection involves pneumonia devaux et al 2020 recently treatment with the combination of both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has shown a significant improvement within the covid-19 patients gautret et al 2020 similarly patients treated with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have also shown significant recovery from covid-19 singh et al 2020 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is a cost effective drug that has long been a therapy of choice for malaria prophylaxis due to excellent results and good safety and tolerability recently world over chloroquine and its derivative analog hydroxychloroquine has garnered enormous attention as a possible treatment for sars-cov-2 infection although in this context the exact mechanism of action of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is still not known at the same time some reports have cautioned against the use of chloroquine due to the known dose-related toxicity of chloroquine and its derivative several adverse events mainly involving retinal and psychiatric symptoms are observed with chloroquine however such symptoms are dose-dependent and are observed when dosage levels exceed prescribed pharmacological dosage limits an understanding of sars-cov-2 disease biology indicates that it is important to target the viral replication in order to effectively control the infection also it is perceived that chloroquine and its derivative can prevent the disease onset in covid negative and healthy subjects and treat sars-cov-2 infection in healthy but asymptomatic carriers this can be effectively accomplished by understanding the detailed mechanism of action of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in preventing coronavirus infection the mechanism of action of these two drugs is not well known but it has been demonstrated in vitro that these drugs inhibit sars-cov-2 by elevating the endosomal ph and alter ace-2 terminal glycosylation there by leading to the interruption of virus receptor binding vincent et al 2005 however if chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine acts exclusively by elevating the endosomal ph then chloroquine should act as a broad-spectrum anti-viral agent since modulation of endosomal ph is a common strategy utilized by viruses for internalization this appears to be doubtful since chloroquine is not effective against most of the viral diseases like dengue tricou et al 2010 chickenguniya lamballerie et al 2008 and hiv savarino  shytaj 2015 however both chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine were shown to be of some use in countering the sars virus vincent et al 2005 it is a well-established fact that sars virus sars-cov and sars-cov-2 share almost 80 sequence similarity with this it can be postulated that chloroquine might be actively binding to one or more sars-cov-2 proteins to inhibit viral replication to study this multiple chloroquine derivatives reported earlier were screened for their binding potential to various sars-c0v-2 virus proteins important for its binding internalization replication and budding in the host cell using the molecular docking studies in this work we have demonstrated the capability of chloroquine and its derivatives reported for their anti-pcp potential earlier gomes et al 2018 for selective binding to different viral proteins this work aims at increasing the information for anti-viral mechanism of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine against the sars-cov-2 virus this research can support new anti-viral drug discovery against sars-cov-2 virus and at the same time can support drug repurposing efforts around chloroquine also these results can be used as a basis for modifying clinical dosage of chloroquine and thereby rendering it more effective against coronavirus infection post the approval of hydroxychloroquine by the food and drug administration fda usa the same has been used as a potential drug for the treatment and management of emerging disease covid-19 by using in-silico molecular docking studies the binding potential of chloroquine and its derivatives with different sars-cov-2 proteins involved in viral replication was evaluated the 2d-structures for chloroquine and its derivatives viz hydroxychloroquine chloroquine sulfate chloroquine mustard chloroquine pyrolidinyl were taken from

sequence break and their ligand association by using pymol molecular visualization system delano 2002 proteins 6m71 and 6svb with sequence break were subjected to homology modeling using the swissmodel server daina et al 2017 subsequently used for further studies liganded form of protein 6lu7 were identified retrieved and employed for validation of docking nimgampalle et al 2019 while non-liganded forms of proteins 6m71 6vsb 6vw1 6vxs and 6w4b were subjected to active site prediction using the castp server tian et al 2018 in this study molecular docking was performed at known active site of ligand form of proteins 6lu7 whereas both blind docking and predicted active site docking site-specific docking was performed to the remaining non-liganded form of proteins 6m71 6vsb 6vw1e 6vxs 6w02 and 6w4b to examine the binding affinities of chloroquine derivatives against each drug target of sars-cov-2 docking was performed using pyrx 08 software consist of autodock 42 morris et al 2009 the structures of chloroquine and its derivatives were organized as a compound library after subjecting them to energy minimization using the open babel module in the virtual screening software pyrx later the protein structures were refined for hetero-atoms and water molecules to demarcate active sites of proteins further the gasteiger charges and hydrogen atoms were added to each drug target to maintain coordination between various interactions by using ucsf chimera-1131 software huang et al 2014 then each drug target was saved in pdb format and the chloroquine derivative compounds under examination were also uploaded and saved in ligandpdbqt format the grid was set around the active site of the drug target for site-specific docking whereas the grid was maximized to surround the entire protein surface for blind docking to generate possible binding conformation of chloroquine derivatives empirical free energy force fields were applied to the lamarckian genetic algorithm lga with default parameters lga 2500000 - energy evaluations bommu et al 2019 the grid spacing was generated around the active site residues of each drug target and the grid parameters for each drug target are given in table 21 as supplementary file after completion of docking the dock results were saved for the observation of binding affinities and binding interactions between ligand-target were analyzed by ligplot software wallace et al 1995 prior to molecular docking studies all the synthetic derivatives of chloroquine were tested for their drug-likeliness properties based on lipinskis rule of five as shown in table 3 all the compounds used in the present study follow lipinskis rule of five molecular weight 500 hydrogen acceptor 10 hydrogen donor 5 and logp  5 without any exception these results demonstrate that all the chloroquine derivatives studied in this study are capable of eliciting pharmacological response through their absorption distribution metabolism and excretion the details of drug-likeness and relevant molecular properties of compounds are listed in table 3 it is important for a chemical compound to demonstrate drug-likeness properties since this would render the compounds towards efficient oral absorption aqueous solubility and membrane permeation in order to completely understand the binding potential of chloroquine and its derivatives to different sars-cov-2 proteins it is important to identify their natural active sites active sites of proteins can be predicted by ascertaining the geometric and topological properties of protein structures castp server was used to predicted active sites for the non-liganded form of proteins 6w02 6m71 6vsb 6vw1 6vxs and 6w4b the amino acids that form the active site of each viral protein and their exact position on the polypeptide chain are listed in table 4 it was presumed that chloroquine and its derivatives can bind to the active site of these viral proteins thereby inhibiting their natural function the active site of each protein identified by this procedure was used for further molecular docking studies our results demonstrate that hydroxychloroquine can bind to nsp3 with a binding affinity of 56 kcalmol and 73 kcalmol in both blind and site-specific docking respectively table 5 in parallel even stronger binding to nsp3 when compared to hydroxychloroquine was demonstrated by chemically synthesized chloroquine derivative cqn2h showing the maximum binding affinity of 84 kcalmol and 88 kcalmol in both blind and site-specific docking tables 5 and 51 supplementary hydroxychloroquine shows hydrogen bonding with the residues gly47 and leu126 whereas cqn2h forms hydrogen bonds with amino-acid residues asn40 gly46 and gly130 figure 1 overall chloroquine and its derivatives demonstrated a higher binding affinity for nsp3 viral protein when compared to other proteins included in this study thereby signifying their potential as inhibitors of nsp3 function the main protease is moderately inhibited by hydroxychloroquine with the binding affinity 48 kcalmol tables 5 and 51 supplementary amino acid residues of the main protease involved in the formation of five hydrogen bonds with hydroxychloroquine are leu4 thr24 thr25 thr26 and thr45 figure 2 however compared to hydroxychloroquine both cqn2h and cqn1b show considerable higher binding affinity 60 kcalmol to the main protease tables 5 and 51 supplementary the compound cqn2h shows hydrogen interactions with the residues of thr24 ser46 figure 2 our results indicate that some derivatives of chloroquine and its derivatives are capable of binding to the main viral protease the results obtained from both blind docking and site-specific docking demonstrate that hydroxychloroquine can effectively bind to rna polymerase with binding affinities 59 and 56 kcalmol respectively table 5 the amino acid residues asn52 and asn209 of rna polymerase are involved in formation of hydrogen bond with hydroxychloroquine figure 3 interestingly the compound cqn2h demonstrate strong binding with rna polymerase with the highest binding affinity in both blind docking 84 kcalmol and site-specific docking 70 kcalmol tables 5 and 51 supplementary cqn2h shows the ability to form hydrogen interactions with the rna polymerase residues thr319 and thr394 figure 3 the high binding affinity of cqn2h indicates towards its potential as an inhibitor of viral rna polymerase hydroxychloroquine exhibits considerable binding efficiency against spike glycoprotein during both blind docking and site-specific docking with binding affinities of 60 and 54 kcalmole respectively table 5 additionally the compounds cqn1b cqn2h demonstrated even stronger binding to spike glycoprotein with the binding affinities of 78 kcalmol and 73 kcalmol in both blind docking and predicted active site binding respectively table 5 interestingly only single amino acid ile472 of the viral spike protein is involved in the formation of hydrogen bond with hydroxychloroquine whereas cqn1b shows no hydrogen bonds formation rather it forms van dar waal interactions with various amino acid residues figure 4 the obtained results demonstrate that the compounds cqn1b and cqn2h may act as potential inhibitor of viral spike glycoprotein function our studies demonstrate that hydroxychloroquine can also bind to the receptor-binding domain with a moderate binding affinity 54 and 53 kcalmol in both blind docking and site-specific docking table 5 the amino acid residues of the receptor-binding domain involved in the hydrogen bonding are asp110 met112 phe197 and glu198 figures 5 and 51 supplementary on the contrary other chloroquine derivatives like cqn1a and cqn1b show a strong binding affinity 76 kcalmol to the receptor binding domain of the viral spike protein in both blind docking and site-specific docking studies table 5 the high binding affinities exhibited by these compounds represent their potential as inhibitors of receptor-binding domain cqn1a shows hydrogen interaction with the residues ile154 and asn163 figure 5 molecular docking studies with chloroquine and its derivatives with adp-ribose-1 monophosphatase demonstrated the ability of hydroxychloroquine to bind with the mentioned viral protein with binding affinity 62 kcalmol in both blind docking and site-specific docking studies table 5 a detailed analysis of the dock showed that hydroxychloroquine was able to form hydrogen bonds with leu126 ala129 and ala154 residues figure 6 two compounds cqn2e and cqn2i also show effective binding with adp-ribose-1 monophosphatase with the binding affinity of 74 kcalmol in blind docking table 5 the amino acid residues involved in the formation of hydrogen bonding with cqn2i are val149 and ala154 figure 6 the compound cqn2c also demonstrated a strong binding to adp-ribose-1 monophosphatase with the binding affinity 76 kcalmol in site-specific docking studies hydroxychloroquine shows moderate to minimal binding with replicase protein with binding affinities of 54 and 43 kcalmol in blind docking and site-specific docking respectively table 5 the residues of replicase protein val42 and pro58 are involved in the formation of hydrogen bonds with hydroxychloroquine figure 7 however another derivative of chloroquine compound cqn2h potentially inhibits replicase protein in both blind docking and site-specific docking with the binding affinities are 71 and 55 kcalmol respectively table 5 and forms hydrogen bonds with arg40 pro58 and thr68 residues of the replicase protein figure 7 in the present work with the use of molecular docking techniques the molecular interactions between chloroquine derivatives and selective sars-cov-2 viral proteins were studied since most of these viral proteins can be potential drug targets this study aims at understanding the potential role of chloroquine and its potent derivative hydroxychloroquine in inhibition of sars-cov-2 viral infection and replication by assessing the binding efficiency of chloroquine and its derivatives to various viral proteins these results obtained in this study can also be extrapolated to evaluate the therapeutic efficiency of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in controlling sars-cov-2 infection also in this study we have attempted to screen for derivatives of chloroquine that can bind to sars-cov-2 viral drug targets more efficiently than chloroquine with the hope that this can open a case for chloroquine remodeling for better inhibition of sars-cov-2 multiplication based on the recent reports some of the essential regulatory proteins and enzymes associated with the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 were selected as drug targets such as the spike glycoprotein that enables virus internalization rna dependent rna polymerase that supports replication of viral genetic material chimeric rbd receptor binding domain that interacts with the ace 2 main protease responsible for cleaving the viral polypeptide non-structural protein3 non-structural protein 10 non-structural protein 9 replicase protein and adp-ribose-1 monophosphatase in order to have a detailed understanding of interaction of chloroquine and allied compounds with sars-cov-2 viral proteins the potential active site of these proteins and the amino acid residues involved in formation of these active sites were identified with the molecular docking studies the hydrogen bonds and van der waals interactions formed as a result of binding of the drugs to the sars-cov-2 viral proteins were identified table 51 supplementary the normal function of sars-cov-2 proteins can be inhibited as a result of the binding of these drugs to the active site of these sars-cov-2 proteins our results clearly demonstrate that chloroquine and its derivatives can bind to sars-cov-2 proteins and thereby can disrupt the normal functioning of these proteins also it was found that some chemically synthesized derivatives of chloroquine are more efficient in binding to viral proteins when compared with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine however some of these derivatives can elicit toxicity and therefore better modeling of chloroquine can lead to the identification of an effective inhibitor of sars-cov-2 virus supplementary table 31 as we write this report extensive research is ongoing around the globe to discover specific and effective drugs or drug combination that can halt the spread of covid-19 pandemic with the help of computational methods for drug discovery and repurposing several natural compounds anti-viral compounds anti-malarial drugs antibiotics and pharmacologically active compounds have been screened and are being investigated for their ability to inhibit sars-cov-2 protein function elfiky 2020 fantini et al 2020 wu et al 2020 however to the best of our knowledge not much research has been performed to probe the effect of chloroquine hydroxychloroquine and their derivatives on various drug targets of sars-cov-2 virus post internalization of the virus in the host cell both non-structural protein 3  5 are involved in the formation of multi-domain m protease which plays a key role in the replication process stobart et al 2013 in this context the binding potential of chloroquine and its derivatives was assessed for binding to non-structural protein 3 as this interaction can disrupt sars-cov-2 multiplication within the host cell our results indicate that chloroquine and its derivatives can effectively bind to the nsp 3 moreover it was found that some of the chloroquine derivatives such as cqn1b 81 kcalmol cqn1a 85 kcalmol and cqn2h 88 kcalmol can bind even strongly to nsp 3 than the binding affinity of hydroxychloroquine 73 kcalmol to nsp3 the main protease is also a critical enzyme in the life cycle of sars-cov-2 virus involved in the cleavage of polyprotein pp at the c-terminal end and leads to the formation of non-structural proteins lindner et al 2005 targeting the main protease is one of the ways to prevent the replication of sars-cov-2 the obtained results clearly demonstrate that the chloroquine and its derivatives cqn2h and cqn1b can bind to the main protease and thereby can potentially inhibit its activity non-structural protein 12 acts as rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp it is a vital enzyme in the replication of rna viruses therefore it has been studied in various viruses including the hepatitis c virus and the zika virus elfiky 2016 ganesan  barakat 2017 recently the fda approved anti-rdrp drugs ribavirin remdesivir sofosbuvir galidesivir and tenofovir have shown potential inhibitory activity against the rdrp of sars-cov-2 elfiky 2020 in our study chloroquine derivative cqn2h demonstrated strong binding affinity to rdrp 82 kcalmol which is even stronger that that of hydroxychloroquine with rdrp protein these results can be valuable in repurposing and redesigning cqn2h as a potential inhibitor of rdrp function spike glycoprotein plays an essential role in the attachment of coronavirus with the ace2 on the host cell surface hence this protein is considered as an important drug target for drug discovery prajapat et al 2020 our results demonstrate that hydroxychloroquine can effectively bind to both spike glycoprotein and chimeric receptor binding domain along with compounds cqn1b cqn2h that can effectively inhibit spike glycoprotein besides the compounds cqn1a cqn1b can also potentially inhibit receptor binding domain these results point to the fact that the chloroquine derivatives can bind to spike glycoprotein which can potentially lead to disruption of spike protein interaction with the ace-2 on host cell surface however in another recent study is was demonstrated that both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can prevent the interaction of spike protein with sialic acids and gangliosides present on the host cell surface fantini et al 2020 matrosovich et al 2013 non-structural protein 9 nsp9 acts as a replicase protein rna-binding protein and its dimerization is essential for viral propagation prajapat et al 2020 therefore targeting the dimerization of nsp9 can be an effective strategy to control virus multiplication egloff et al 2004 hu et al 2017 our results show that chloroquine derivative cqn2h can bind to the replicase protein with higher efficiency than the hydroxychloroquine further the derivatives of chloroquine such as cqn2e cqn2i and cqn2c can also effectively inhibit adp-ribose-1 monophosphatase than the hydroxychloroquine from these results it is apparent that these chloroquine derivatives possess therapeutic activity against sars-cov-2 virus our studies clearly demonstrate binding of chloroquine hydroxychloroquine and their derivatives to various sars-cov-2 proteins however these results need to be substantiated with binding experiments to ascertain other drug-protein interaction parameters at the same time the specificity of these studies can be ascertained from the fact that one of the derivatives of chloroquine cqn2f did not show binding to any viral protein included in the study although chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are losing their popularity due to possible mutagenic activity our literature survey points to the fact that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have well established toxicokinetic properties and might only elicit dosage dependent toxicity also chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine represent an economical option to prevent the spread of covid-19 pandemic we believe that from our study informed approach can be taken to understand the drug-protein interaction and then further modify the drug structure which will have a minimal toxic burden and maximal inhibitory potential against sars-cov-2 viral proteins our results also enhance the basic knowledge of the interaction of chloroquine derivatives with the various drug targets of sars-cov-2 and point to a possible novel mechanism of action of the century old drug from our results it can be infered that hydroxychloroquine considerably inhibits all the drug targets of sars-cov-2 further it was found that hydroxychloroquine might not only enhance the endosomal ph but it could also interact with various proteins of sars-cov-2 chemically synthesized chloroquine derivatives reveal more effective inhibitory activity against all drug targets of sars-cov-2 than hydroxychloroquine among the various derivatives of chloroquine cqn2h and cqn1b show potential inhibition against all the drug targets our results could also be used for further constructive research on chemically synthesized chloroquine derivatives to identify successful drugs for the treatment of covid-19  efficacy and safety of current therapeutic options for covid-19 - lessons to be learnt from sars and mers epidemic a systematic review and meta-analysis han zhong yan wang zai-li zhang yang-xi liu ke-jia le min

tried according to the clinical experience from sars and mers 67 the broad-spectrum antiviral agent ribavirin 8 protease inhibitor lopinavir and ritonavir 910 and immune up-regulator interferon 1112 were most commonly used in addition in vitro or in vivo studies have suggested that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine 1314 remdesivir 15 and arbidol 16 are effective in inhibiting viral replication in sars-associated coronavirus cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 infections 17 however the efficacy and safety of these treatments for covid-19 remains unclear 4 few systematic reviews have previously summarized clinical trials of potential therapeutic agents for sars mers or covid-19 resulting inconclusive outcomes 418 19 20 21 herein we conduct this review to identify the efficacy and safety of

blinding of participants and the outcome assessors were absent or unclear in 4 studies 37384041 supplementary table s2 therefore we decided to identify these 4 studies with risk of bias in terms of observational studies the nos scores were 6-9 indicating most of the studies were of low risk of bias supplementary table s3 we performed a meta-analysis of the 10 studies 4282 patients demonstrating

and supplementary figs 715 because of inadequate inclusive studies we did not perform a sensitivity analysis to assess the influence of each included study we did not generate funnel plot to evaluate publication bias either with the same reason the quality of evidence is outlined in table 2
 the quality of findings relevant to mortality virological clearance radiographical improvement prevalence of ards intubation and mechanical ventilation were very low in addition the total aes leukopenia anemia thrombocytopenia diarrhea transaminitis increased total bilirubin had very low quality of evidence as well however the outcome quality of clinical improvement and increased creatinine were low while the bradycardia had a moderate quality of evidence hydroxychloroquine had earned a reputation for potential promising role in covid-19 42 increasing number of studies had been conducted and published 28323740 recently chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were demonstrated to inhibit sars-cov-2 in vitro ec50  547m ec50  072m respectively 3243 the underlying mechanisms were inferred as follows 1 as weakly alkaline chloroquine could increase endosomal ph therefore block virus infection 4244 2 as spike s protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 blocker chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine interfered with the glycosylation of cellular sars-cov receptor thus inhibit virus attacking 4 3 as immunomodulant chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could counteract pro-inflammatory cytokine storm in critically ill patients with covid-19 2845 unfortunately the outcomes of hydroxychloroquine in covid-19 patients were inconsistent in sars-cov-2 viral eradication gautret et al reported that hydroxychloroquine alone or combined with azithromycin observed better ability of sars-cov-2 eradication at day six post-treatment 100 of patients treated with combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin had been virologically cured compared to 571 in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone and 125 in control group 32 on the contrary chen et al and tang et al documented that the sars-cov-2 eradication rate were equal between hydroxychloroquine and standard care group 3740 therefore the meta-analysis generated no significant favored outcomes of hydroxychloroquine in virological eradication the authors speculated the reasons underlying these inconsistent results included 1 unsuitable population selection mild illness or later stage of covid-19 might not be target population to assess the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine 2 inappropriate endpoints viral load shedding rather than icu admission and negative rate of nucleic acid might be more sensitive endpoints 3 confounding effects antiviral agents used in standard care group might be confounders to weaken effect of hydroxychloroquine 4 small sample size of these studies 5 no valid in vivo evidences despite adequate encouraging in vitro proofs 3740 additionally the hydroxychloroquine therapy improved more radiographical benefit 28 despite accompanied with more aes especially diarrhea 40 up to date we could not recommend hydroxychloroquine superior to the standard care of sars-cov-2 infection and we need to wait for larger randomized trials with target population and sensitive endpoints to valid the value of hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 as an inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus hiv protease lopinavirritonavir was a major focus as it was recommended for patients with mers 27 or covid-19 46 it was reported lopinavir could inhibit sars-cov and mers-cov replication in vitro with ec50 at 171 m and 8 m respectively 47 lopinavir was also found to demonstrated antiviral effect against sars-cov-2 in vero e6 cells with ec50 at 261 m 48 ritonavir had no effect against coronavirus but prolonged bioavailability of lopinavir by inhibiting hosts cytochrome p450 3a4 enzyme 49 five studies had reported the effectiveness and safety of lopinavirritonavir alone or combination therapy lopinavirritonavir alone or in combination with ribavirin and corticosteroids did not show any mortality benefit however lopinavirritonavir-based treatments had observed inconsistent results of virological clearance with rr of between 097-293 lopinavirritonavir alone was revealed ineffective in lowering virus load of sars-cov-2 3638 while the lopinavirritonavir accompanying with arbidol or ribavirin augmented the eradication of sars-cov-2 273547 48 49 it was speculated that lopinavirritonavir 400 mg100 mg twice daily may reach the minimal lopinavir serum concentration at 94 m 72121 m which was inadequate for inhibition of sars-cov-2 50 nevertheless lopinavirritonavir accompanied with the other agents showing effects against sars-cov-2 might decrease the inhibitory concentration of lopinavir and produce synergy 48 furthermore lopinavirritonavir-based therapies documented notably better clinical and radiographical improvement and reduced incidence of ards or intubation take adverse reactions into consideration most of the aes rate were comparable between groups conversely lopinavirritonavir alone showed tendency of more diarrhea events while the combination of lopinavirritonavir ribavirin and corticosteroids reduced incidence of diarrhea significantly it was suspected that lopinavirritonavir alone did not show demonstrably beneficial effects for covid-19 but the lopinavirritonavir combinations might play roles in the eradication of sars-cov-2 21 the most extensively used therapies were ribavirin and ribavirin-based combinations ribavirin was reported to tightly bind to sars-cov-2 rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp with binding energy of -78 kcalmol and thus may be used to against covid-19 51 there were 9 studies reporting sars and mers patients treated with ribavirin or combinations with ribavirin the meta-analysis yielded inconsistent results for mortality with rr of between 038 and 082 while the combination of ribavirin and corticosteroids showed remarkable lower mortality compared with control group in addition patients treated with ribavirin-based therapies showed comparable rates of intubation and mechanical ventilation with control group of note the major problem of ribavirin was significantly higher incidence of adverse events especially bradycardia anemia and transaminitis compared with control group intriguingly the combination of ribavirin and interferon did not observe these problems summarily as the inconsistent benefit considerable safety concerns and very low quality of evidence it was hard to make a clear recommendation for the use of ribavirin and ribavirin-based combinations for covid-19 it was revealed that arbidol had in vitro antiviral activity in early replication stage of sars-cov 52 however the arbidol alone generated equivalent outcome in patients with covid-19 compared with control group while the addition of lopinavirritonavir showed better efficacy 27 furthermore interferon had been widely used through sars and mers epidemic 18 and there were 5 studies reported combinations with interferon unfortunately no difference was noted between treatment and control group in terms of mortality intubation rate and adverse reactions the recommendation of these treatments was uncertain because of the small sample size of study and other risk of low quality 122736 firstly to best of our knowledge this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis comprehensively summarized all available evidences from rcts and cohort studies for sars mers and covid-19 secondly it objectively and rigorously assessed the efficacy outcomes mortality virological eradication clinical improvements etc and safety outcomes aes leukopenia anemia diarrhea bradycardia etc of current anti-coronavirus therapies for sars-cov mers-cov sars-cov-2 infected patients with similar definitions of outcomes across studies moreover we evaluated the quality of the evidence in the meta-analyses by implementing the gradepro in attempt to verify the strength of the recommendation on the other hand there were some limitations among included literatures first of all some outcomes included a small sample size of patients such as clinical improvement radiographical improvement and leukopenia causing imprecision of outcomes thus downgraded the quality of evidence secondly the open-label design of most rcts included in this meta-analysis also restricted the quality grade of effects thirdly the variations in timing of treatment dosage administration route and co-treatments might influence our results for an instance one study administrated hydroxychloroquine approximately 16 days after symptoms onset while the time between onset of symptoms and inclusion hydroxychloroquine initiation were 0 to 10 days in another study the virological eradication results were quite difference between these two studies however we could not perform further subgroup analysis considering these influenced factors because of the limited number of studies finally the diversity of indications might add heterogeneity to results although sars-cov and mers-cov were closely related with sars-cov the results might not be directly extrapolated to sars-cov-2 infected patients thus further research would be required to confirm our findings given the latter strengths and limitations although we could not draw a clear conclusion for the recommendation of potential therapies for covid-19 considering the very low quality of evidence and wide heterogeneity of interventions and indications our results may help clinicians to comprehensively understand the advantages and drawbacks of each anti-coronavirus agents on efficacy and safety profiles lopinavirritonavir combinations might observe better virological eradication capability than other anti-coronavirus agents conversely ribavirin might cause more safety concern especially bradycardia currently growing trials related to anti-coronavirus agents were ongoing including 18 for hydroxychloroquine 13 for chloroquine 7 for remdesivir 6 for lopinavirritonavir 5 for interferon 3 for favipiravir 2 for arbidol and 13 for combinations the detailed information of registered trials is shown in supplementary table 4 these ongoing studies would facilitate our understanding of the optimal anti-coronavirus approach for covid-19 patients based on previous observations we provided some proposal and suggestions for further clinical trials as follows 1 larger-scaled rcts were utmost needed 2 severe covid-19 patients rather than mild or moderate patients should be favored investigated population 3 confounders such as anti-viral agents used in control group should be adjusted or balanced 4 the dosage and initial time of regimens should be standardized for instance the anti-coronavirus agents should be used at early stage of illness 5 specic endpoints such as mortality virological eradication or viral loading shedding and clinical outcomes including symptoms improvement radiographical results improvement intubation rate and icu admission should be estimated there was evidence of lower mortality better clinical and radiographical improvement in intervention group compared with control group in subgroup analysis ribavirin combined with corticosteroids lopinavirritonavir-based therapies and hydroxychloroquine showed some benefit in different outcomes however considering the very low quality of evidence the heterogeneity of interventions and indications we could not draw a clear conclusion for the recommendation of potential therapies for covid-19 our results may allow clinicians to comprehensively understand the property of each anti-coronavirus agent on efficacy and safety outcomes and thus may constitute a basis of drug treatment for covid-19 certainly it was of utmost necessity to conduct large-scale clinical trials to objectively assess the efficacy of antiviral treatment on the mortality virological and clinical outcomes of

coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 spread to most countries in the world within five months of initial reports in china as of 22 april 2020 more than 25 million infections and 178 thousand deaths had been reported1
 several drugs including remdesivir favipiravir ribavirin lopinavir-ritonavir used in combination and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine have been highlighted on the basis of promising in vitro results and therapeutic experiences from two other coronavirus diseasessevere acute respiratory syndrome and middle east respiratory syndrome2 however none of these promising results has yet been translated into clinical benefits in patients with covid-19 with a failed trial of lopinavir-ritonavir being the most recently reported3
 chloroquine and its hydroxyl analogue hydroxychloroquine best known as antimalarial drugs are prominent on the list of potential covid-19 treatments owing to potent antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 in the in vitro studies and news reports of promising results from some ongoing trials4

6 despite their unclear benefits chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are both recommended for off label use in the treatment of covid-19 by the chinese national guideline7 and the us food and drug administration recently authorised them for emergency use8 us president donald trump also recently recommended use of hydroxychloroquine such a presidential endorsement stimulated an rapid increase in demand for hydroxychloroquine which obscured the negative aspects of this drug deaths due to chloroquine overdoses have been reported in nigeria among people self-treating for apparent covid-199 retinopathy and gastrointestinal and cardiac side effects are well documented with the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of malarial and rheumatic diseases10 hydroxychloroquine is preferred in clinical applications owing to its lower toxicity particularly retinal toxicity10 and three times the potency against sars-cov-2 infection compared with chloroquine in a recent in vitro study5 no convincing evidence from well designed clinical trials exists to support the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with good efficacy and safety for the treatment of covid-19 rapidly conducting such trials with high quality is challenging in the face of a dangerous coronavirus outbreak in which healthcare workers have an overwhelming amount of work and the highest risk of developing covid-1911
 having encountered many challenges we conducted a multicentre open label randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine sulfate in adult patients with covid-19 the principal investigators qx gs gn and jq designed and initiated the study after approval of the protocol by the institutional review board in ruijin hospital on 6 february 2020 the protocol and approval documents are available in the online supplement all patients gave written informed consent the principal investigators invited hospitals with the capability to provide the current standard of care for covid-19 to participate in the study minimum requirements for the standard of care included the provision of intravenous fluids supplemental oxygen regular laboratory testing sars-cov-2 testing haemodynamic monitoring and intensive care as well as the ability to deliver concomitant medications the trial was conducted urgently during the outbreak of covid-19 in compliance with the declaration of helsinki good clinical practice guidelines and local regulatory requirements shanghai pharmaceuticals holding donated the investigated drug hydroxychloroquine but was not involved in the study design accrual analyses of data or preparation of the manuscript a contract research organisation rg pharmastudies was hired to assist in the study design data collection and cleaning and statistical analyses data were recorded by clinical research coordinators followed by queries from clinical research associates the study statistician then entered confirmed data into the openclinica database for statistical analyses performed by and reviewed by the senior statistician in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines data collection forms and statistical analysis plans are available in the online supplement an independent data and safety monitoring committee idmc periodically reviewed the progress and oversight of the study the interim analysis took place on 14 march and the results were presented to the idmc the rapid decline in eligible new cases of covid-19 in china at that time precluded recruitment of our targeted number of patients after a two round extensive review of the efficacy and safety data generated from the interim analysis the idmc endorsed an early termination of the trial members of the committee all agreed that the data from the trial are important for clinicians the public and the government to avoid inappropriate use of hydroxychloroquine in the clinical management of covid-19 particularly in areas with overwhelming patient numbers the report of the trial could be an important resource to facilitate better design of future trials the results of this clinical trial are reported in accordance with consort consolidated standards of reporting trials guidelines this study was a multicentre randomised parallel open label trial of hydroxychloroquine in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 patients were enrolled by the site investigators in 16 government designated covid-19 treatment centres in three provinces in china hubei henan and anhui no placebo was used and drugs were not masked we applied stratified random sampling to stratify all eligible patients according to disease severity mildmoderate or severe followed by random assignment in a 11 ratio in each stratum to ensure a balanced distribution of disease severity between treatment hydroxychloroquine plus standard of care and control standard of care only groups ll designed the randomisation rules together with the principal investigators and an independent statistician who was not involved in data analysis implemented them equal numbers of cards with each group assignment number randomly generated by computer were placed in sequentially numbered envelopes that were opened as the patients were enrolled all patients were managed with standard of care aligned with the indications from the updated national clinical practice guidelines for covid-19 in china patients in the treatment group were given hydroxychloroquine within 24 hours after randomisation with a loading dose of 1200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintenance dose of 800 mg daily for the remaining days total treatment duration was two weeks for patients with mild to moderate disease and three weeks for those with severe disease the dose of hydroxychloroquine was adjusted when adverse events were related to hydroxychloroquine as judged by investigators details of dose adjustment are provided in the study protocol available in the online supplement patients investigators and statisticians were not masked to treatment assignment laboratory technicians who did virological chemical and other routine measurements were unaware of treatment information inclusion criteria were age 18 years or older ongoing sars-cov-2 infection confirmed in upper or lower respiratory tract specimens with real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr willingness to participate and consent not to be enrolled in other clinical trials during the study period pneumonia on computed tomography of the chest was not mandatory for inclusion exclusion criteria were age below 18 years severe conditions including malignancies heart liver or kidney disease or poorly controlled metabolic diseases unsuitability for oral administration pregnancy or lactation allergy to hydroxychloroquine inability to cooperate with investigators due to cognitive impairments or poor mental status severe hepatic impairment for example child pugh grade c alanine aminotransferase more than fivefold the upper limit and severe renal impairment estimated glomerular filtration rate 30 mlmin173 m2 or receipt of continuous renal replacement therapy haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis in the original protocol patients with severe covid-19 were excluded considering that the anti-inflammatory property of hydroxychloroquine might favour disease regression we decided to include patients with severe covid-19 change approved by the ethics committee on 17 february 2020 the definition of disease severity of covid-19 was based on the fifth version of the chinese guideline for the management of covid-1912 mild disease includes patients with mild symptoms but no manifestation of pneumonia on imaging moderate disease includes patients with fever cough sputum production and other respiratory tract or non-specific symptoms along with manifestation of pneumonia on imaging but no signs of severe pneumonia defined as the presence of sao2spo2 below 94 on room air or a pao2 to fio2 ratio of 300 or lower specimens from the upper respiratory tract lower respiratory tract or both were obtained from each patient on screening day 3 to day 1 and during treatment and post-treatment follow-up at scheduled visits on days 4 7 10 14 21 and 28 the local centre for disease control and prevention or authorised health institutions or hospitals at each site measured sars-cov-2 by using assays approved by the national medical products administration measurements were performed according to the recommendations of the national institute for viral disease control and prevention china httpivdcchinacdccnkyjz202001t20200121211337html methods for extraction and amplification of total rna through rt-pcr were similar to those described elsewhere13 rather than quantitative data cycle threshold value reported from the rt-pcr assay we collected only qualitative data reported from our trial sites on the basis of a national recommendation we defined a cycle threshold value less than 37 as a positive test result and a cycle threshold value of 40 or more as a negative test cycle threshold values between 37 and 40 confirmed by retesting were reported as unclassified in addition to sars-cov-2 testing patients were assessed on each scheduled visit for vital signs c reactive protein erythrocyte sedimentation rate tumour necrosis factor  interleukin 6 complete blood cell count with differential blood chemistry coagulation panel pulse oximetry and respiratory symptoms records of administration of hydroxychloroquine and adverse events were reviewed daily to ensure fidelity to the protocol and more importantly patient safety computed tomography of the chest was assessed on screening and at the last visit of the treatment period day 14 for patients with mild to moderate disease and day 21 for severe disease computed tomography examinations of the chest could be exempted by the investigators if the participants could provide qualified examination results within three days before the start of the study more details on data collection are provided in the protocol available in the supplement the primary outcomes for this trial were whether patients had negative conversion of sars-cov-2 by 28 days and whether patients with severe covid-19 had clinical improvement by 28 days however as the trial was stopped early and only two patients with severe disease were enrolled results on clinical improvement are not presented we defined negative conversion of sars-cov-2 as two consecutive reports of a negative result for sars-cov-2 at least 24 hours apart without a subsequent report of a positive result by the end of the study we considered the date of the first negative report as the date of negative conversion in the original protocol the primary endpoint was prespecified as the negative conversion rate by day 10 approved by the ethics committee on 6 february 2020 however with the increasing knowledge of covid-19 from our clinical practice we realised that the duration of sars-cov-2 in respiratory samples of many patients was longer than 10 days recently highlighted by a detailed virological study14 we therefore modified our primary outcome to test whether patients had a negative conversion of sars-cov-2 by 28 days approved by the ethics committee on 17 february 2020 probability of negative conversion at day 4 7 10 14 or 21 was specified as a secondary outcome in the protocol but this does not appear on the trial registration list the listed secondary outcome in the trial registration was adverse events coded using the latest version of medical dictionary for regulatory activities coding dictionary recorded in standard medical terminology and graded according to the national cancer institute common terminology criteria for adverse events other prespecified secondary outcomes not listed in the trial registration but included in the protocol were the probabilities of alleviation of clinical symptoms improvement of c reactive protein erythrocyte sedimentation rate tumour necrosis factor  interleukin 6 and absolute blood lymphocyte count improvement of lung lesions on chest radiology all cause death and disease progression in patients with mild to moderate disease the time frame for these secondary outcomes was from randomisation to 28 days prespecified secondary outcomes for patients with severe disease are not listed here but are included in the protocol owing to the early termination of our study we could not justify the results from these analyses with an underpowered sample size and therefore decided not to emphasise them in this paper to avoid misinterpretation the only one presented here is the alleviation of clinical symptoms within 28 days which is an important outcome of interest prespecified in our protocol the definition of the alleviation of clinical symptoms was resolving from fever to an axillary temperature of 366c or below normalisation of spo2 94 on room air and disappearance of respiratory symptoms including nasal congestion cough sore throat sputum production and shortness of breath in the original protocol the target number of enrolments was set to 200 without type i error control in the updated protocol approved by the ethics committee on 10 february 2020 we considered type i and type ii error control and recalculated the sample size the sample size was calculated on the basis of the alternative hypothesis of a 30 increase in the rate of conversion to negative for sars-cov-2 as defined by virus nucleic acid negativity with the assumption that time to conversion follows an exponential distribution if the median time to conversion with hydroxychloroquine can be reduced from 10 days to seven days a total of 248 events would provide a power of 80 to detect a hazard ratio of 07 standard of care v hydroxychloroquine with a log rank test additionally we assumed a 75 day accrual period and a seven day follow-up after enrolment of the last patient so about 360 patients 180 per group would be randomised in the study an interim analysis was planned when around 150 patients were treated for at least seven days we applied the obrien-fleming cumulative  spending function by lan-demets algorithm to control for family-wise type i error005 we estimated the overall probability of negative conversion by analysing time to negative conversion of sars-cov-2 using the kaplan-meier method in the intention to treat population and compared groups with a log rank test we considered patients who did not reach the negative conversion of sars-cov-2 see definition in outcome section by the cut-off date of the analysis 14 march 2020 to be right censored at the last visit date all these patients remained in hospital and may have reached negative conversion after our last visit date but the specific timing of the event is unknown we applied similar approaches to the analysis of alleviation of symptoms we used the rate difference between groups to show the treatment effect size and estimated 95 confidence intervals by an approximate normal distribution and the standard error by the bootstrap method n1000 we used a cox model to estimate the hazard ratio hazard ratios greater than one indicate that the rate of negative conversion of virus or alleviation of symptoms was higher in the hydroxychloroquine plus standard of care group than in the standard of care only group safety analyses were based on the patients actual exposure to treatment we used sas version 94 for data analyses no patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures nor were they involved in developing plans for recruitment design or implementation of the study no patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results there are no plans to disseminate the results of the research to study participants or the relevant patient community of 191 patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 from 11 to 29 february 2020 41 did not meet the eligibility criteria the remaining 150 patients were randomised 75 patients were assigned to standard of care and 75 patients to standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine fig 1 the mean age of the patients was 46 years and 82 55 were male the mean duration from onset of symptoms to randomisation was 166 sd 105 range 3-41 days and 90 60 patients received concomitant drug treatment before randomisation among these 52 35 patients received antiviral treatment table 1 almost all 148 99 patients had mild to moderate covid-19 and only 2 1 patients had severe disease on screening table 1 shows baseline demographic epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the patients in the two groups by 14 march 2020 the cut-off date for data analysis the median duration of follow-up was 21 range 2-33 days in the standard of care group and 20 3-31 days in the standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine group nine patients in each group had completed 28 days of follow-up of the 75 patients assigned to receive standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine six patients did not receive any dose of hydroxychloroquine three withdrew consent and three refused to be treated with hydroxychloroquine concomitant treatments including antiviral agents antibiotics and systemic glucocorticoid therapy were similar in the two groups table 2 one patient with moderate disease in the hydroxychloroquine group progressed to severe covid-19 and no patients died during follow-up a total of 109 73 patients 56 standard of care 53 standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine had negative conversion well before 28 days and the remaining 41 27 patients 19 standard of care 22 standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine were censored as they did not reach negative conversion of virus the maximum duration for a patient with positive sars-cov-2 was 23 days by the cut-off date of our analysis overall the probability of negative conversion of sars-cov-2 among patients who were assigned to receive standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine was 854 95 confidence interval 738 to 938 by 28 days similar to that of the standard of care group 813 712 to 896 the difference in the probability of negative conversion between standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine and standard of care alone was 41 95 confidence interval 103 to 185

hazard ratio 085 95 confidence interval 058 to 123 p034 by log rank test fig 2 six patients who were assigned to the standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine group but did not receive hydroxychloroquine treatment were classified as hydroxychloroquine non-recipients in the safety population one patient in the standard of care group wrongly received 14 days of hydroxychloroquine treatment with an accumulative dose of 11 600 mg this patient was classified as a hydroxychloroquine recipient in the safety population fig 1 we compared safety endpoints between hydroxychloroquine recipients and non-recipients table 3 in hydroxychloroquine recipients the median duration of hydroxychloroquine treatment was 14 range 1-22 days between randomisation and the final visit 21 30 patients in the standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine group reported adverse events compared with 7 9 patients in the standard of care group table 3 no serious adverse events were reported in the standard of care group two patients in the hydroxychloroquine group reported serious adverse events due to disease progression and upper respiratory infection the patient with upper respiratory infection was discharged after finishing the 14 days of treatment with hydroxychloroquine and developed throat drying and pharyngalgia requiring readmission without evidence of pneumonia on computed tomography of the chest during the extended follow-up period the most common adverse event in the standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine group was diarrhoea reported in 7 10 patients which was not reported in the standard of care group hydroxychloroquine was discontinued in one patient owing to blurred vision and was adjusted to give a lower dose in one patient who reported thirst these two adverse events were both transient with a duration of one to two days probability of negative conversion by a specific time point4 7 10 14 or 21 dayswas also similar in the two groups supplementary

666 395 to 909 the difference between groups was 66 413 to 280 the median time to alleviation of clinical symptoms was similar in the standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine group to that in the standard of care group 19 v 21 days hazard ratio 101 059 to 174 p097 by log rank test fig 3 the negative results on the antiviral efficacy of hydroxychloroquine obtained in this trial are contradictory to the encouraging in vitro results and the recently reported promising results from a non-randomised trial in 36 patients with covid-194

6 participants in our trial had mainly mild to moderate disease with a median 16 day delay between symptom onset and hydroxychloroquine treatment so the negative results of our trial are applicable only to patients with persistently mild to moderate covid-19 covid-19 has overwhelmed hospital systems during the pandemic and many of these patients may be treated in the community and may finally be admitted to hospital because of a need for oxygen or owing to rapid deterioration of the disease data from our trial do not provide evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in this population particularly considering the increased adverse events discussed below our trial could not assess the antiviral efficacy of hydroxychloroquine at an earlier stage such as within 48 hours of onset of the illness the golden window for antiviral treatment in influenza15 however conducting such a trial is challenging in patients admitted to hospital and will be easier in outpatient or community settings the fact that antiviral treatment was not restricted in our trial should also be considered when interpreting our results seeing the antiviral effects of hydroxychloroquine when compared with a pure control arm would be more conclusive in the early dangerous outbreak of covid-19 in china however setting a restriction on drugs that could be potentially useful was not ethical nevertheless the use of antiviral drugs before and after randomisation was balanced between the hydroxychloroquine and standard of care groups and thus might have little effect on our primary endpoint moreover use of a higher dose of hydroxychloroquine than was used in our trial is not likely to have additional antiviral effects because the dosage of hydroxychloroquine that we chose achieves the 50 effective concentration ec50 of hydroxychloroquine against sars-cov-25 although we did not monitor the concentration of hydroxychloroquine in our study another important message from our trial is that the kaplan-meier curve crossed over with time suggesting a potential for a non-constant hazard ratio of negative conversion conferred by exposure to hydroxychloroquine therefore the hazard ratios presented in our trial should be interpreted as weighted results over time rather than as a definitive constant we will investigate this in the future further trials might also need to combat this problem when using the cox regression method taken together future studies could take advantage of our results to design trials in a more selective population at the earliest stage possible 48 hours from illness onset and using more sensitive endpoints such as viral load shedding hydroxychloroquine in our trial was given at a loading dose of 1200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintenance dose of 800 mg daily for a total treatment duration of two weeks or three weeks for patients with mild to moderate or severe disease respectively serious adverse events occurred in two patients and both were reported in hydroxychloroquine recipients the overall frequency of adverse events was significantly higher in hydroxychloroquine recipients than in non-recipients gastrointestinal events particularly diarrhoea were most commonly reported as they were in another study using a high dose of hydroxychloroquine16 transient blurred vision was reported in one patient whose symptoms recovered two days after discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine early development of retinal damage with a daily dose of 800 to 1200 mg was detected using sensitive retinal screening tests17 therefore the retinal damage could be underestimated in our trial events of cardiac arrhythmia such as prolonged qt interval18 were not observed in our trial possibly because of the relatively mild to moderate disease of patients investigated or the short term period of follow-up however with increasing interest in the combined use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin worldwide physicians should be cautious about the increased risk of prolongation of the qt interval and fatal ventricular arrhythmia with azithromycin and other antimicrobial agents19
20 drug-drug interaction should be taken into consideration when assessing safety and efficacy endpoints in future trials of hydroxychloroquine10 the effects of hydroxychloroquine in causing increased concentrations of digitoxin and metoprolol would be particularly relevant in patients with severe covid-19 and would therefore require close monitoring21
 this study provides the first and timely evidence about the benefit-risk profile of hydroxychloroquine derived from a multicentre randomised controlled trial which was started during the most challenging time of the covid-19 outbreak in china in such a situation our study has several limitations firstly the open label as opposed to double blind design introduces the possibility of biased investigator determined assessments and unbalanced dosage adjustment urgent production of placebos mimicking hydroxychloroquine and the management of a multicentre placebo controlled trial remain challenging during the pandemic secondly the use of sequential envelopes is inferior to the interactive web response management system for randomisation thirdly the setting of our trial among patients admitted to hospital precluded us from enrolling patients at the early stage of disease in addition we cannot provide evidence on the effect of hydroxychloroquine on disease progression or regression because 148150 99 patients in our trial had mild to moderate disease fourthly the results of our main prespecified outcomes are not entirely conclusive being based on an underpowered sample size due to the lack of enough eligible patients to enrol the recruitment of eligible patients was unexpectedly difficult with many clinical trials launched in the same period in response to the urgent call by the national health authorities for the exploration of effective treatment against covid-19 the rapid decline in eligible new cases owing to the successful containment of covid-19 in the middle of march 2020 in china precluded further recruitment to reach our targeted sample size the premature termination of our trial also led to increased censoring of data on our primary outcome we therefore reanalysed the probability of negative conversion in the two groups by using follow-up data to 27 april 2020 supplementary table b and the results were consistent with our reported results fifthly ensuring fidelity to the protocol by site investigators under highly challenging circumstances in the covid-19 treatment centres was difficult hiring a contract research organisation as we did in our trial can greatly support the conduct and oversight of trials sixthly population quarantine of wuhan and neighbouring cities nationwide travel restrictions and isolation of cases and contacts were also barriers to collecting and transferring data and paper files several prespecified secondary endpoints including the changes on computed tomography of the chest were therefore not finished by the cut-off date for analysis finally the specimens collected in our trial for virus rna determination were mostly from the upper respiratory tract rather than bronchoalveolar lavage fluid which could introduce false negative results22 however the prespecified definition for negative conversion of virus was two consecutive negative results at least 24 hours apart which can reduce false negativity the results of our trial did not show additional benefits of virus elimination from adding hydroxychloroquine to the current standard of care in patients with mainly persistent mild to moderate covid-19 adverse events particularly gastrointestinal events were more frequently reported in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine who were given a loading dose of 1200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintenance dose of 800 mg daily for the remaining days for a total treatment duration of two weeks in patients with mild to moderate disease and three weeks in those with severe disease overall these data do not support the addition of hydroxychloroquine to the current standard of care in patients with persistent mild to moderate covid-19 for eliminating the virus our trial may provide initial evidence for the benefit-risk profile of hydroxychloroquine and serve as a resource to support further research  a case of breakthrough covid-19 during hydroxychloroquine maintenance

infection 001 ranging from 072 to 451 moll28 the levels of hydroxychloroquine from serum and saliva of the patient tended to be higher than these ec50 values despite of a few reports of covid-19 cases which occurred during hydroxychloroquine use4 this is the first one which examined both concentrations of hydroxychloroquine from serum and saliva because antiviral agents in saliva is a potential barrier against respiratory virus9 the breakthrough covid-19 case in a patient who had effective concentrations of hydroxychloroquine is worth noting mounting evidences on the limited prophylactic effect of hydroxychloroquine45 is accordant with studies which reported negative results of hydroxychloroquine treatment for covid-19 we previously described limited in vitro activity of hydroxychloroquine against sars-cov-2 under concentrations which could be achieved by usual dosages10 in addition recent observational study or small randomized controlled trial could not show better clinical outcomes in hydroxychloroquine-treated group1112 there are several points which have to be considered when interpreting the present report because ec50 could be different at a different inoculum size the present report should be prudently interpreted because it was a single case with uncertain intensity of exposure also the possibility that the maintenance of hydroxychloroquine attributed to a mild course of covid-19 in this patient could not be ruled out the concentrations of hydroxychloroquine was possibly affected by increased dose for three days before the measurement however its effect might not be substantial when considering the delayed pharmacokinetics of hydroxychloroquine13 the present case raise concerns on the role of hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic agent against covid-19 taken together with the results of recent randomized clinical trial5 prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine should be limited  efficacy and safety of chloroquine or

pandemic drug repurposing may represent a rapid way to fill the urgent need for effective treatment we evaluated the clinical utility of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in treating covid-19 forty-eight patients with moderate covid-19 were randomized to oral treatment with chloroquine 1000 mg qd on day 1 then 500 mg qd for 9 days n18 hydroxychloroquine 200 mg bid for 10 days n18 or control treatment n12 adverse events were mild except for one case of grade 2 alt elevation adverse events were more commonly observed in the chloroquine group 4444 and the hydroxychloroquine group 5000 than in the control group 1667 the chloroquine group achieved shorter time to clinical recovery ttcr than the control group p0019 there was a trend toward reduced ttcr in the hydroxychloroquine group p0049 the time to reach viral rna negativity was significantly faster in the chloroquine group and the hydroxychloroquine group than in the control group p0006 and p0010 respectively the median numbers of days to reach rna negativity in the chloroquine hydroxychloroquine and control groups was 25 iqr 20-38 days 20 iqr 20-35 days and 70 iqr 30-100 days respectively the chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine groups also showed trends toward improvement in the duration of hospitalization and findings on lung computerized tomography ct this study provides evidence that hydroxychloroquine may be used effectively in treating moderate covid-19 and supports larger trials  the rapid spread of covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 has posed an enormous challenge to public healthcare across the globe 1 2 3  the world health organization who declared the outbreak of covid-19 as a pandemic on march 11 2020 4  by april 13 it had affected more than 17 million individuals as sars-cov-2 is a newly identified pathogen no target-specific antiviral drugs or vaccines are currently available the adoption of a crisis intervention approach will be required additionally if there is scientific merit the repurposing of existing drugs with mechanistic potential may provide a quick yet cost-effective treatment paradigm chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have gained broad attention as possible treatment options for covid-19 based on three main rationales first chloroquine has demonstrated broad-spectrum antiviral activity against viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus zika virus dengue virus and coronavirus oc43 5  after the outbreak of covid-19 in wuhan china wang et al screened existing antiviral drugs as potential treatments for covid- 19  the results showed that chloroquine phosphate has potent antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 in vitro 6  the drug also has a high selection index si at low concentrations 7 8  secondly concentrations of chloroquine in the lungs may be hundreds of times higher than those in plasma 9  this unique distribution pattern is conducive to the treatment of covid-19 we analyzed the reported ec 90 of chloroquine phosphate against sars-cov-2 in vero e6 cells reported by wang et al 6 and hypothesized that this reported ec 90 is potentially achievable in humans when the licensed dose of chloroquine phosphate is administered third chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are immune modulators that affect multi-aspects of the immune response 10  both compounds block the production of inflammatory cytokines such as interferon tumor necrosis factor interleukins and b-cell activation factor 5 10  additionally chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine inhibit the interaction between toll-like receptors 789 and nucleic acid ligands thus blocking the activation of innate immunity 8  these effects may also suppress the formation of cytokine storms in covid-19 pathogenesis 5 11  finally chloroquine may down-regulate the expression of coinhibitory molecules expressed by plasmacytoid dendritic cells such as ido and pd-l1 that suppress t-cell activation 12  chloroquine thus positively regulates certain aspects of immune function in addition to its broad immunosuppressive effects based on these rationales we investigated the therapeutic utility of chloroquine in treating covid-19 hydroxychloroquine is a derivative of chloroquine with an improved safety profile we designed this randomized open-label 3-arm prospective study to compare the effects of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with the standard of care for treating covid-19 the study was conducted at a hospital in wuhan during the study period the china national health commission published the 6 th 7 th editions of diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia both of which recommend the use of chloroquine 13 14  this single-center prospective study was to evaluate the effects of chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate in treating covid-19 in the original study design we had planned to recruit 100 subjects with confirmed mildmoderate types of covid-19 however the city of wuhan rapidly controlled the epidemic and we had to complete the study on march 30 2020 after enrolling only 67 subjects with mildmoderate covid-19 here we report our data on 48 patients with moderate type of covid-19 we provide evidence that patients treated with either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine showed a positive trend toward faster clinical recovery more rapid return to viral rna negativity and shorter hospitalization both molecules had manageable safety profiles at dosage regimens similar to those used to treat extraintestinal amebiasis or rheumatoid arthritis we hope that the data provided will serve as reference and justification for the further investigation and use of hydroxychloroquine by healthcare professionals across the globe who are fighting covid-19 which was

of covid-19 however the data must be interpreted with caution there were a couple of limitations in the study first due to the unexpected onset of this epidemic and the availability of active drugs only we were not able to conduct a placebo-controlled double-blinded study which would have been more objective and largely excluded the possible impact of open-label use on a given physicians assessment second because the chinese government implemented a robust intervention approach that effectively controlled the epidemic the study was terminated before full enrollment n40 each for the chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine groups n20 for the control group thus while we demonstrated positive results the study per se was underpowered we used a one-month study period and a sample size of 30 n18 for hydroxychloroquine vs n12 for control to conduct a post-hoc power analysis with the alpha level single-sided set at 0025 we would only expect 137 chloroquine vs control or 92

prescription label of chloroquine phosphate in china the drug is licensed for the treatment of malaria extraintestinal amebiasis and rheumatoid arthritis when treating acute infectious diseases such as covid-19 the key to achieve therapeutic efficacy may be finding a path to ensure that blood levels of chloroquine rapidly reach steady state because treatment with chloroquine may lead to cardiotoxicity we excluded patients with prior history of cardiac disorders and prohibited the use of medications eg quinolones that may lead to qt elongation or ventricular arrhythmia therefore in

up to 10 days at the time when we were preparing this manuscript there were no in vitro data or clinical data on the inhibitory effect of hydroxychloroquine with regard to sars-cov-2 however hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are highly similar in terms of molecular structure and mechanism of action hydroxychloroquine has a better safety profile and is prescribed more commonly therefore when we designed the study we included hydroxychloroquine for exploratory purposes without a solid understanding of the optimal dosing regimen because of safety concerns we used the 19  in a recently published study of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of moderate covid-19 200 mg bid 5-day treatment with hydroxychloroquine showed significantly improved ttcr compared with control treatment 20  nevertheless in our study hydroxychloroquine treatment did not appear superior to chloroquine treatment the effect of hydroxychloroquine compared with control treatment in shortening ttcr did not reach the pre-defined criteria for statistical significance this may be implicated by the following three factors first our sample size was small second we used kaplan-meier ttcr curveslogrank testing which is not a point estimation of efficacy but rather a rigorous statistical assessment third the regimen used for dosing hydroxychloroquine may require further optimization in our study we used the dose recommended for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis this dosing regimen has a good safety profile but may require more time to achieve all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission

that chloroquine may inhibit the production of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines however our results did not support such a mechanism we observed no significant difference in the levels of inflammatory cytokines before vs after treatment the patients enrolled in the study had moderate covid-19 with limited inflammation we did not observe changes in patterns of lymphocyte infiltration or

finishing treatment with hydroxychloroquine levels of altast declined in both patients the anti-covid-19 treatments were effective our study demonstrated that it is therefore feasible to treat covid-19 with chloroquine according to the dosage regimen approved for other indications as long as the patients safety is monitored eg altast measurement cardiac monitoring chinese diagnosis and

provides some evidence of the clinical utility of chloroquine the results need to be further verified by larger trials designed to determine the optimal dosing regimen we evaluated the effectiveness of hydroxylchloroquine in treating patients with moderate covid-19 our data suggest that chloroquine is likely to be effective in treating certain types of the disease at the dosage used hydroxychloroquine exerted effects similar to those of chloroquine however the magnitude of hydroxychloroquines effects was limited what is the current knowledge on the topic in vitro studies have demonstrated that hydroxylchloroquine can inhibit sars-cov-2 at the concentrations used for approved indications however the translatability of drugs in vitro activity into efficacy and safety in

but little evidence matthieu roustit romain guilhaumou mathieu molimard milou drici silvy laporte jean-louis montastruc jean-louis   chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are drugs that have shown in vitro activity on the replication of certain coronaviruses in the context of the sars-cov-2 epidemic the virus responsible for the novel coronavirus disease covid-19 these two drugs have been proposed as possible treatments the results of the first clinical studies evaluating the effect of hydroxychloroquine do not support any efficacy of this drug in patients with covid-19 due to major methodological weaknesses yet these preliminary studies have aroused considerable media interest raising fears of massive and uncontrolled use in the absence of evidence of page 2 of 17 j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f 2 clinical benefits the main risk is of exposing patients unnecessarily to the well-known adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine with a possibly increased risk in the specific setting of covid-19 in addition widespread use outside of any recommendation risks compromising the completion of good quality clinical trials the chloroquine hype fueled by low-quality studies and media announcements has yielded to the implementation of more than 150 studies worldwide this represents a waste of resources and a loss of opportunity for other drugs to be properly evaluated in the context of emergency rigorous trials are more than ever needed in order to have as soon as possible reliable data on drugs that are possibly effective against the disease meanwhile serious adverse drug reactions have been reported in patients with covid-19 receiving hydroxychloroquine justifying to limit its prescription and to perform suitable cardiac and therapeutic drug monitoring ace2 angiotensin converting enzyme 2  chloroquine nivaquine and its hydroxylated derivative hydroxychloroquine plaquenil   are old drugs with antimalarial properties the use of which has become progressively reduced with the appearance of chloroquine-resistant strains of plasmodium falciparum they also have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity by regulating the production of tumor necrosis factor tnf interferon and certain cytokines 1 2 3  these properties justify the use of hydroxychloroquine in certain autoimmune diseases such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis in addition since several decades these drugs have been shown to have an inhibitory activity on the replication of many viruses 4  although the mechanisms of these antiviral properties are not fully understood chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are weak bases which accumulate in lysosomes modify their ph and interfere with certain enzymes they thus have the capacity to inhibit the ph-dependent entry of certain viruses into host cells or even to block the replication of enveloped viruses by inhibiting the glycosylation of envelope proteins 5  these in vitro antiviral effects have raised a lot of hope opening-up consideration of the repositioning of these old and inexpensive drugs for the management of many viral infections against which there are no or few effective treatments or against which drugs exist but are not widely available especially in countries with limited resources 6  the demonstration of antiviral activity in vitro is obviously not synonymous with efficacy on clinically relevant parameters several studies have demonstrated an effect of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on the replication of hiv in vitro 7  however a double-blind randomized controlled trial comparing hydroxychloroquine at 400 mgday to placebo in 83 hiv positive patients not treated with antiretrovirals and having a cd4 level 400l showed after 48 weeks of treatment a greater decrease in cd4 and an increased viral load in the group treated with hydroxychloroquine compared to controls 8  such paradoxical effect was also observed in a double-blind randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of 5 days of chloroquine to placebo in patients infected with chikungunya besides the lack of effect of chloroquine on the viremia patients in the chloroquine group had significantly more arthralgia than those in the placebo group 9  despite an inhibitory effect of chloroquine on the replication of the virus in vitro 10  in the case of chikungunya this clinical versus laboratory discrepancy might be explained by the immunomodulatory effects of these drugs which modify the cellular and humoral immune response to infection 10  in other indications such as the treatment of dengue fever or the prevention of influenza chloroquine proved to be ineffective despite in vitro activity 3 11 12 13  finally activity against the hepatitis c virus hcv has been described 14  a pilot clinical trial conducted in a dozen patients with hcv genotype 1 who did not respond to the combination of pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin showed a reduction in viral load and in alt but this effect ceased on stopping chloroquine table 1  15  thus to date despite many promising in vitro leads chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine have never been shown to have any real clinical efficacy in the treatment or prevention of viral infections 16  several reasons may explain the discrepancy between in vitro and clinical results such as the validity of the experimental model or pharmacokinetic issues ie reaching sufficient inhibitory concentration at the site of infection in 2002-2003 the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov quickly affected many countries since then the hypothesis of chloroquine as a therapeutic option has emerged based on its antiviral properties and also on its immunomodulatory effect 6  this hypothesis was confirmed in vitro chloroquine inhibiting the replication of the sars-cov virus at concentrations close to those used in patients treated for malaria 17  subsequent work still in vitro confirmed these results and also suggested a possible prophylactic effect 18  in 2014 chloroquine was described as having in vitro activity on the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 19  however these results have not been followed by clinical trials demonstrating any clinical efficacy in the context of the current sars-cov-2 pandemic responsible for the novel coronavirus disease  the chloroquine question has resurfaced in vitro studies have shown that chloroquine 20  and also hydroxychloroquine exhibits antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 with a lower ec50 for hydroxychloroquine 072 m vs 547 m at 48 h suggesting more potent activity 21  in this same article the authors developed a pbpk model for these two drugs in order to simulate their diffusion in pulmonary tissue with several dosage regimens while taking into account the safety profile based on simulations they propose for hydroxychloroquine a loading dose of 400 mg twice on day 1 followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg twice a day for the next four days at these dosages simulations show apparently low plasma concentrations of the order of 01 gml but which could allow significant pulmonary exposure with very high tissue-free inhibitor quotients of about 85 from day 5 after the start of treatment 21 22  yet other reports have shown about 10-fold higher ec50 or a higher potency for chloroquine than hydroxychloroquine highlighting substantial variability between in vitro models 23 24  this stresses the difficulty to extrapolate that appropriate drug concentration at the site of infection will be reached with safe doses of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine based on these experimental data around twenty clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine on covid-19 had been started in china by mid-march 2020 25  while there were almost 150 trials registered worldwide at the end of april this frenetic activity originates from positive preliminary results obtained on one hundred patients which were announced without there being a formal interim analysis or a detailed report of these results published 26  they were followed by different studies of various methodological quality from single-arm non-controlled studies to cohorts with propensity scorematched controls and randomized controlled trials in france a pilot study published a few weeks later evaluated the effect of hydroxychloroquine on patients with covid-19 this non-randomized open-label study had as primary endpoint the presence of nasopharyngeal virus 6 days after inclusion the main result was a higher proportion of patients in whom the virus was no longer detected in the hydroxychloroquine group 600 mgd for 10 days than in the control group 70 vs 125 p  0001 in addition six patients who received a hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin combination had negative samples from day 5 d5 27  while they open up interesting perspectives the results of this work must be considered with the greatest caution due to major methodological weaknesses first as in any non-randomized study imbalances between the groups expose it to a major bias in this case the use of geographic controls does not protect against a possible selection bias in addition of the 26 patients who received hydroxychloroquine six left the trial prematurely among these three were transferred to intensive care and a fourth died an intention-to-treat analysis should not exclude these patients but should consider these cases as failures of treatment with hydroxychloroquine in the control group the result of the primary endpoint pcr on day 6 d6 was not available for 5 of the 16 subjects nearly 30 whom the authors considered to be positive ie carrying the virus another point concerns pcr results which were not reported in the same way for 10 patients in the control group compared to the 6 other controls and 20 patients in the group treated with hydroxychloroquine the results of these pcrs also seem to be very variable two patients in the control group negative on d5 were again positive on d6 and counted as such for the main endpoint however in the arm treated with hydroxychloroquine a patient found negative on d5 and for whom the data was missing on d6 was presumed negative by re-analyzing the data actually available on d6 the difference between the groups is no longer significant suggesting a possible risk of p-hacking which consists of multiplying the comparisons until obtaining a p-value below the significance threshold this obviously increases the risk of a false positive the article also concludes that azithromycin is effective but these results relate only to a series of 6 patients without randomization these results were supplemented by the pre-publication by the same team of a cohort of 1061 patients receiving a combination of hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin early after the first symptoms and followed-up during nine days or longer the results show a rate of poor clinical outcome prolonged hospitalisation transfer to intensive care or death of 43 and 075 mortality 28  ie close to that observed among infected people in france 29  however in the absence of a control group it is not possible to conclude to the efficacy of this association several studies based on data collected from routine care compared outcomes of patients with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection treated with hydroxychloroquine to those untreated and used propensity score-based methods to account for between-group differences inherent to non-randomized studies the first study conducted in four hospitals in france compared 84 patients with pneumonia requiring oxygen and who received hydroxychloroquine to 89 controls the results show no difference between the two groups regarding the risk of transfer to intensive care or death 30  a second study reports data from the department of veterans affairs in the usa among 368 patients 97 received hydroxychloroquine alone 113 had hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin and 158 were unexposed to hydroxychloroquine the results suggest a higher risk of death in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone without any difference between the three groups regarding the risk of ventilation 31  these two studies were later completed by two larger cohorts of patients admitted to the hospital in new york usa the first one n  1376 did not show any significant association between hydroxychloroquine use and the primary end point of respiratory failure hr  104 95 ci 082 to 132 32  of note almost 60 of patients receiving hydroxychloroquine in that cohort also received azithromycin while this proportion was 372 in propensity-matched patients not receiving hydroxychloroquine in the second large cohort n  1438 hydroxychloroquine used was not associated with a decrease in in-hospital hospital mortality whether associated with azithromycin or used alone 33  however the non-randomized nature of these studies exposes to bias and prevents from drawing clear conclusions few randomized clinical trials have been conducted and properly reported so far the summary of a small randomized trial conducted in china nct04261517 on 30 patients was published at the end of march 2020 the results do not show any difference between the group treated with hydroxychloroquine 5 days at 400 mgd and the control group neither virologically nor based on clinical criteria 34  another chinese study chictr2000029559 concluded to the superiority of hydroxychloroquine 5 days at 400 mgday over standard treatment in treating fever cough and associated pneumonia 35  yet we cannot exclude significant reporting bias since the outcomes the number of patients and the dose regimens reported in this study differed from those initially declared in the registry the largest randomized trial was an openlabel multicenter study including 75 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine compared with 75 patients receiving standard of care the dose was higher than on the previous trials loading dose of 1200 mgday for three days followed by 800 mgday for 2 or 3 weeks according to the severity of the disease the results do not show any difference in viral clearance at day 28 primary outcome symptoms were also comparable between the two groups 36  while some differences were observed in post-hoc subgroup analyses altogether available evidence is limited and most studies are biased to date the results of a live metaanalysis do not suggest any efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients with covid-19 37  nonetheless the media and societal excitement generated by very early announcements based on in vitro data and uncontrolled case studies are at the origin of a huge demand for and significant use of this drug in the absence of evidence of efficacy the first risk is to unnecessarily expose patients to adverse effects 38  while it is relatively safe at the doses used to prevent malaria 100 mgday chloroquine has well-known dose-dependent adverse drug reactions adrs the most common are abdominal pain or diarrhea described in almost 10 of users as well as pruritus and rashes headache ringing in the ears dizziness and tinnitus are also possible signs of cinchonism described with quinine psychiatric adrs are also reported ranging from anxiety disorders and insomnia to psychotic decompensations psychotic effects hallucinations delusions seem more frequent than thymic disorders depression regarding hydroxychloroquine serious psychiatric effects are relatively rare within the framework of the usual prescription however in the current context with the anxiety-provoking nature of the epidemic and the confinement of the population these adrs are potentially more likely to appear chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine also have well-known cardiac adrs linked to their inhibitory effect on herg potassium channels which repolarize the action potentials of cardiomyocytes by potassium efflux in phase 3 of the action potential ikr potassium current this property increases the risk of prolonging the corrected qt interval qtc of the electrocardiogram ecg 39  although this adr is dose-dependent and therefore more frequent in the event of an overdose serious arrhythmias have been reported at therapeutic doses among the risk factors for qt prolongation that can facilitate or precipitate such arrhythmias are a slow heart rate 55 bpm being female 40  and especially hypokalemia and combination with other qtc-prolonging drugs such as macrolides 41 42  besides this effect on ikr current hydroxychloroquine may reduce heart rate by inhibiting if-current in phase 4 of the action potential 43  among patients receiving hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 about 10 had to discontinue due to ecg modifications 44  in the largest randomized trial adverse events were observed in about 30 of patients who received hydroxychlorquine vs 9 of patients who did not 36  qtc 500 ms was observed in 11 to 20 of patients receiving a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin 45 46  this proportion reached 25 with the highest dose of hydroxychloroquine 1200 mgday for 10 days in a doubleblinded randomized trial comparing two dose regimens in combination with azithromycin 47  among 40 patients with severe infection admitted to intensive care units who received either hydroxychloroquine or hydroxychloroquine  azithromycin there was an increase in qtc in 37 of 40 patients 93 after drug administration qtc prolongation defined as qtc 60 ms or qtc 500 ms was observed in 14 patients 36 48  the risk was significantly lower yet significant when hydroxychloroquine was used alone 46 48  this is consistent with observational data collected from patients with rheumatoid arthritis in whom the combination hydroxychloroquine  azithromycin was associated with an increased risk of 30-day cardiac mortality while hydroxychloroquine alone was not 49  details about the cardiac effects of hydroxychloroquine and other drugs used in covid-19 have been reviewed recently 50  in the light of what was known about the cardiac adrs of hydroxychloroquine before the pandemic all these results suggest an increased cardiac risk in patients with covid-19 this could be explained by frequent hypokalemia in these patients possibly due to a particular tropism of sars-cov-2 towards the ace2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 51  also diarrhea and vomiting can be associated with the infection it is therefore essential to monitor potassium level and to correct any hypokalemia before administering hydroxychloroquine which itself can cause diarrhea similarly the combination of azithromycin with hydroxychloroquine justifies reinforced monitoring with an ecg if possible before the start of treatment and within 3-4 h after the first administration and then twice a week for the duration of treatment or in the event of symptoms suggestive of a heart rhythm disorder another dose-limiting adr of hydroxychloroquine is the risk of retinopathy which could affect up to 8 of treated patients especially when the dose is high 5 mgkg or when treatment is prolonged 5 years 52  finally since hydroxychloroquine is metabolized by several isoforms of cytochrome p450 cyp in particular 3a45 2d6 and 2c8 there is an increased risk of adrs with drugs that inhibit these cyp in the context of covid-19 special care must be taken with other anti-infectives such as the combination lopinavirritonavir the latter being a powerful inhibitor of cyp3a in addition to the clinical surveillance mentioned above hydroxychloroquine use justifies therapeutic drug monitoring tdm which is also recommended in the context of autoimmune diseases 53  in the framework of prescription for the management of a sars-cov-2 infection high variability in concentrations tested is expected in view of the populations to be treated the elderly resuscitation or dialysis patients 54  with the possibilities of therapeutic ineffectiveness or adrs in addition given the proposed short duration of treatment a state of equilibrium is unlikely to be reached which increases the pharmacokinetic variability the pharmacology group -ac43 of the national agency for research on aids and viral hepatitis and the therapeutic drug monitoring group of the french society of pharmacology and therapeutics proposed at the end of march 2020 that a tdm evaluation should be performed 48 hours after the start of treatment to check the early attainment of an adequate residual concentration based on the data currently available the minimum threshold to be reached is estimated at 01 gml for a plasma assay and 03 gml for a whole blood assay tdm assays could then be proposed throughout the course of treatment to ensure that the threshold concentration considered as toxic 1 gml in plasma or 2 gml in whole blood is not exceeded recommendations for therapeutic drug monitoring of lopinavirr and hydroxychloroquine in patients treated for sars-cov-2 covid-19 infection available on the website 55  the available efficacy and safety results mentioned above are at high risk of bias which leaves a degree of uncertainty regarding the relevance of hydroxychloroquine use in covid-19 in addition the pandemic emergency has justified early publication of most of these results as pre-prints since these reports are not peer-reviewed they cannot be considered as validated information and thus should not guide clinical practice 56  in parallel we have recorded a growing request for reliable information on the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine from the population 57  on march 23 2020  in this context of public pressure the french high council of public health hcsp recommended not to use hydroxychloroquine except in severe hospitalized cases with the collegial decision of physicians and under strict medical supervision the hcsp insists that the prescription of hydroxychloroquine in the general population or for non-severe forms should be excluded this advice was followed a few days later by a decree restricting the use of hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 to health facilities nonetheless a majority of the french population favored the large use of hydroxychloroquine sometimes encouraged by healthcare professionals this has likely impacted rigorous clinical research penalizing the recruitment in randomized controlled trials indeed taking hydroxychloroquine or any other drug with antiviral properties over the days or weeks preceding randomization is usually a criterion for noninclusion in such trials in addition some patients refused to participate in randomized trials fearing to receive placebo instead of hydroxychloroquine which would have been perceived as not being given the best possible treatment 58  interestingly alternative designs have been proposed such as open-label randomized trials nested in a cohort with randomization derived from zelens method 59  although this approach prevents from the above-mentioned issue it raises several concerns 60  not being able to quickly conclude as to the efficacy of treatments is extremely detrimental in terms of public health in the context of an epidemic it is indeed difficult to correctly carry out and complete randomized controlled trials for example the only therapeutic trial of this type conducted during the ebola virus epidemic of 2014-2016 in west africa could not be completed leaving unanswered the question as to the potential efficacy of the humanized monoclonal antibodies zmapp  61  chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been shown to have activity on the sars-cov-2 coronavirus in vitro with possibly superior effect for hydroxychloroquine which is currently at the center of attention however mid-may 2020 available clinical data do not support any efficacy of these drugs in patients with covid-19 good quality randomized controlled trials are still underway it is essential to be able to include patients in these trials rapidly in order to have reliable data on whether these drugs are truly effective against covid-19 yet the chloroquine hype fueled by low-quality studies and media announcements has yielded to the implementation of more than a hundred studies with the risk of wasting resources and delaying rigorous trials pending their results the lack of evidence of a possible benefit must be weighed against the known adrs of hydroxychloroquine which may be magnified in covid-19 patients although relatively safe at a therapeutic dose and for a short period of time this drug has a narrow therapeutic index which requires regular cardiac and therapeutic drug monitoring serious adverse reactions of hydroxychloroquine have already been reported in patients with covid-19 especially when it is combined with azithromycin authors have no competing interest to declare   confidential protocol hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 pep version 12   efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for post-exposure

course of their illness sars-cov-2 is a coronavirus novel to the human population discovered in december 2019 it is currently the cause of a global pandemic 1 2 3  the world health organization who named the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 and the disease caused by sars-cov-2 covid-19 as of 08 march 2020 person-to-person transmission has occurred in china across temperate asia europe and north america and with sporadic cases in africa and the southern hemisphere accurate reporting is limited by availability of diagnostic testing the who declared the covid-19 pandemic a public health emergency of international concern on 30 january 2020 4  and the united states declared a national emergency on 13 march 2020 5  protocol hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 pep version 12 most deaths and severe pneumonitis have occurred in the elderly or in persons with underlying pulmonary or cardiac comorbidities or diabetes in healthy adults including pregnant women it can cause a febrile self-limited pneumonia infection appears less symptomatic in children and younger adults 6  nevertheless the burden of this pandemic to the global health and economic systems is expected to be substantial no acquired immunity to this novel viral infection appears to exist in the human population globally and no effective treatment or preventative agent is licensed at this time as with many infectious epidemics household contacts first responders caregivers and medical personnel attending persons with covid-19 are at high risk of infection the incubation time requires 14 days of quarantine for exposed individuals not wearing personal protective equipment 7  and on 03 march 2020 who declared a global shortage of personal protective equipment leaving doctors nurses and other frontline workers dangerously ill-equipped to care for covid-19 patients 8  extensive absences from the care network and health system will degrade the ability to care not only for those with covid-19 but also for routine healthcare issues as well pep is defined as taking antimicrobial medication after potential exposure to an infectious agent to prevent becoming infected pep should be started as soon as possible after a recent possible exposure to the infectious agent 9  at this time there is no known effective prophylaxis for covid-19 and thus there is equipoise for testing a non-active comparator eg ascorbic acid against a potentially active drug sars-cov-2 is a novel betacoronavirus of zoonotic origin similar to the coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers based on current evidence case fatality rate for sars-cov-2 is about 3 which is significantly lower than sars-cov 10 and mers-cov 40 10  however sars-cov-2 has potentially higher transmissibility r0 14-55 than both sars-cov r0 2-5 and mers-cov r0 1 10  our understanding of the viral pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 remains limited however it appears that the virus cell entry depends on binding of the viral spike s proteins to cellular receptors and on s protein priming by host cell proteases sars-cov-2 like sars-cov uses the same receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 on pulmonary epithelial cells for entry and the transmembrane serine protease 2 for s protein priming 11  the receptor binding domain of lineage b betacoronaviruses is a single continuous domain that contains all of the structural information necessary to interact with the host receptor fusion is mediated at the cell membrane delivering the viral nucleocapsid inside the cell for subsequent replication ace2 expression is found in the lung epithelial cells vascular endothelium renal tubular epithelium and epithelia of the small intestine viral shedding has been localized primarily to respiratory droplets and fecal samples 2  medications to treat andor prevent sars-cov-2 need to inhibit aspects of the viral life cycle ultimately blocking replication already-approved and available medications are ideal for confidential protocol hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 pep version 12 immediate evaluation for sars-cov-2 infection treatment and prevention two potential targets for anti-sars-cov-2 medications are viral polymerases and proteases 12  pilot clinical studies are already ongoing for sars-cov-2 using various repurposed antiviral medicines httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019global-research-on-novelcoronavirus-2019-ncov similarities between sars-cov-2 with sars-cov and mers suggest that antivirals with in vitro efficacy against sars-cov and mers may be promising agents as sars-cov-2 pep 12 13  chloroquine cq was discovered in 1934 by bayer and was used in 1945 as an antimalarial to become one of the most prescribed drugs globally prior to the emergence of widespread drug resistance in plasmodium falciparum 14  cq was found to be effective against rheumatoid tenosynovitis in 1951 15  hcq was licensed in the united states in 1955 as an antimalarial and as a drug for rheumatoid arthritis and it was widely marketed for the latter due to a favorable safety profile with chronic use 16  the mechanisms of action for hcq for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases are still not fully understood despite widespread use over the past 60 years 17  cq and hcq have been proposed as potential agents for treatment and prevention against other infectious agents beyond malaria 18 19  the mechanism of action differs according to the pathogen against intracellular bacteria and fungi by alkalinizing vacuoles containing the microorganisms restoring the activity of other antibiotics and against viral replication through alkalization of acidic organelles namely endosomes lysosomes and golgi vesicles cq is effective in vitro against sars-cov coronavirus in vero e6 cells with the ec50 8 m 20 and had shown evidence of prevention activity in vivo 21  hence these re-purposed drugs were obvious hits for testing against sars-cov-2 in vitro inhibition in vero e6 cells against the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 has been published in recent weeks wang et al 2020 showed that the ec50 and ec90 for cq in vero e6 cells is 113 m and 690 m respectively 22  yao et al 2020 showed that the ec50 for cq treatment of infected cells at 48 hours was 547 m whereas hcq appeared slightly more potent with ec50 of 072 m at 48 hours 23  these levels appear to be within the range of exposures that could be achieved with standard hcq treatment and likely prophylaxis due to concentrations of the drug achieved in the lung tissue 23  no in vitro data in the lung epithelial cells are available nor are any animal model data multiple observational and small investigator-initiated covid-19 pneumonia treatment trials using cq hcq and variety of other medications are ongoing in china httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019global-research-on-novelcoronavirus-2019-ncov gao et al reported anecdotal efficacy of cq as treatment for covid-19-associated pneumonia 24  the trial will test a daily regimen of hcq for 14 days after exposure to sars-cov-2 package insert appendix 4  daily dosing has the highest likelihood to achieve sustained required drug levels for viral inhibition as shown in the physiologically based pk pbpk modeling appendix 5  hcq is commonly used daily in doses up to 600 mg of hcq sulfate 465 mg  base per day for rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus initially with a usual  maintenance dose 200 mg 155 mg base for maintenance therapy hcq and cq are both  commonly used in a weekly dosing schedule for malaria chemoprophylaxis hcq is associated with a better safety profile for daily and chronic use than cq including 5 decades of experience with use in these dose ranges in adults and the elderly it is on the who essential medicines list for use in rheumatic disorders and is widely prescribed as an anti-inflammatory for rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune syndromes based on the limited in vitro data available hcq appears to be slightly more potent than cq against sars-cov-2 23  as the covid-19 epidemic remains very fluid and new data are emerging from observational and clinical trials daily this protocol is written to allow adaptation to incorporate additional medications beyond hcq to be tested as pep hqc is a long-acting drug with a terminal half-life of approximately 40 days it is well absorbed moderately protein bound and will accumulate in tissues including the lung heart liver and kidneys it is typically given with a loading dose of approximately 2-fold the standard dose to accelerate achieving steady state drug concentrations 25  since the drug will be used in those with a recent high-risk exposure to sars-cov-2 it is desirable to achieve adequate drug levels quickly a pbpk model was built simcyp simulator v18 using physical and chemical parameters of hcq obtained from the literature 26  pk parameters liver intrinsic clearance fa ka were determined from clinical data 27  this pbpk model was used to simulate hcq concentrations in plasma and lung fluid following 5 proposed dosing regimens in order to select an optimal regimen for the peking university third hospitals ongoing trial of hcq in china the combination of in vitro antiviral concentration-effect and predicted drug concentrations in this study were used to propose a loading dose of 400 mg hcq twice a day on day 1 followed by hcq 200 mg twice a day on day 2 through day 5 a second study bysy-dctc-cppo-hcq-pbpkar was undertaken to simulate hcq concentration-time profiles in plasma whole blood and lung in chinese healthy populations since elderly patients have reduced glomerular filtration rate gfr simulations were conducted using a healthy caucasian healthy population with renal injury gfr 30 to 60 mlmin and compared to a population with normal renal function to support the study design of prophylactic use of hcq in this analysis 3 dosing regimens were simulated modeling suggests a loading dose of 400 mg for 3 days followed by 200 mg daily for 2 weeks should result in a shorter time to pk steady-state appendix 5 the 2-week treatment duration represents coverage for the duration of viral incubation time this protocol will investigate a single dosage of hcq participants will receive a loading dose of 400 mg for 3 days followed by 200 mg daily for 11 days subsequent investigations will be encouraged to undertake a more rigorous exposure-response assessment to define optimal dosing including exploration of the lowest possible effective dose and possible alternate dosing schedules ie weekly instead of daily in healthy adults covid-19 infection is likely to express as a febrile disease with cough and fatigue but variability in symptomatology to include oligosymptomatic infection is a possibility 28  study participants will have already been exposed to sars-cov-2 likely with quarantine as a result so randomization is unlikely to affect future risk behavior with respect to sars-cov-2 symptom reporting may vary based on participants perception as to whether they are taking hcq or ascorbic acid 29  but the primary study endpoints of infection and viral shedding are not affected therefore use of a control is acceptable and ethical both for participants health and safety as well as ensuring the most rigorous trial design to evaluate pep for sars-cov-2 participants will be blinded to their allocation to the extent possible with a comparator of ascorbic acid used to provide a similar taste as hcq specifically tablets will not be labeled as either hcq or ascorbic acid and an ascorbic acid tablet that is comparable in size and shape to hcq will be used all participants from the same household will be assigned the same regimen so that comparisons cannot be made between the medications and to minimize crossover through drug sharing by household members the dose of ascorbic acid 500 mg for 3 days then 250 mg daily for 11 days is safe all participants regardless of assigned group will be able to take additional ascorbic acid eg over the counter vitamins or through food should they choose as there is no known maximum daily safe dose of ascorbic acid clinical trial evidence has demonstrated that ascorbic acid alone or in combination with other micronutrients does not substantially reduce the risk of upper respiratory infections or severe consequences of infectious processes 30 31  thus ascorbic acid is not expected to have a prevention effect for sars-cov-19 and is considered a placebo-equivalent product for this study 32  the quantity of the virus shed by an individual frequently predicts transmissibility and thus may relate to the likelihood of sars-cov-2 transmission index cases will be enrolled and a nasal swab collected for sars-cov-2 testing to ascertain whether the index case was shedding virus and the level of viral shedding the genotype of the virus shed will be investigated in a subset of participants evaluation of the paired samples index case and contact will provide evidence on whether the level of shedding is associated with sars-cov-2 transmission and whether subsequent infections among contacts were acquired within households genetic markers may be plausibly associated with sars-cov-2 acquisition recent studies indicate that ace2 could be the host receptor for sars-cov-2 a number of ace2 variants could reduce the association between ace2 and sars-cov-2 therefore the expression of human ace2 might be important for the susceptibility symptoms and outcome of sars-cov-2 infection 33  the association between plausible genetic markers and sars-cov-2 infection and disease will be assessed in this study can be unpredictable in its severity but a 34 mortality rate has been observed among clinical pneumonia cases the elderly 60 years and those with medical comorbidities are at highest risk of poor outcomes 1 2 3  moreover transmission in younger persons amplifies infection in communities putting susceptible persons at risk there is no proven preventive drug other than transmission avoidance through barrier and droplet precautions and in those likely exposed quarantine for 14 days beyond the viral incubation period is currently recommended hcq has an excellent safety record at the proposed doses for 60 years and potent viral suppression in vitro there is equipoise as to whether the in vitro efficacy of hcq or any other drug will translate into preventive efficacy from disease or even a reduction in viral shedding thus the potential benefit-to-risk ratio for testing hcq as pep is favorable in this population  the overarching goal of this study is to assess the effectiveness of hcq pep on the incidence of sars-cov-2 detection by polymerase chain reaction pcr to inform public health control strategies this is a randomized multi-center placebo-equivalent ascorbic acid controlled blinded study of the efficacy of hcq pep for the prevention of sars-cov-2 infection in adults exposed to the virus this study will enroll up to 2000 asymptomatic men and women 18 to 80 years of age inclusive at baseline who are close contacts of

close contact of a person index with known pcr-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection or index who is currently being assessed for covid-19 close contact is defined as a household contact ie residing with the index case in the 14 days prior to index diagnosis or prolonged exposure within a residencevehicleenclosed space without maintaining social distance b medical staff first responders or other care persons who cared for the index case without personal protection mask and gloves 4 less than 4 days since last exposure close contact with a person with sars-cov-2 infection to the index case 5 access to device and internet for telehealth visits 6 not planning to take hcq in addition to the study medication participants are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply  screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but are not subsequently randomly assigned to study treatment a minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants to meet the consolidated standards of reporting trials publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities minimal information includes demography screen failure details eligibility criteria and any serious adverse event sae individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study screen failure can be rescreened if there is a change in their eligibility each site will establish local recruitment and screening methods that operationalize protocol-specified requirements for eligibility determination in a manner that is tailored to and most efficient for the local study setting and target study population each site will use a variety of recruitment approaches including direct recruitment at clinics referrals from other providers and sars-cov-2 testing sites and laboratories and use of online and social networking websites and apps recruitment materials will educate participants about covid-19 transmission within households epidemiology in the community and the in vitro data on hcq limiting sars-cov-2 cell entry initially the study will enroll from 2 clinical sites western washington and new york which have established track records of high quality clinical research integrated into clinical care settings annual retention rates in clinical trials conducted in these sites exceed 80 to 90 the sites have large covid-19 epidemics with regulation limiting contact to reduce infectious spread close contact participants may be co-enrolled in other research studies provided that these are observational studies only any other exception requires approval of the co-principal confidential protocol hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 pep version 12 investigators the study team should be consulted for co-enrollment in studies that do not meet this guidance or if there are questions about eligibility for co-enrollment for any co-enrolled study combined blood draws should not exceed current red cross phlebotomy guidance index case participants may enroll at any point in another study study treatment is defined as any investigational treatments marketed products placebo or medical devices intended to be administered to a study participant according to the study protocol hydroxychloroquine sulfate ascorbic acid take 2 tablets for the first 3 days and 1 tablet for the subsequent 11 days for a total of 14 days of treatment take at approximately the same time of the day with a meal or a glass of milk if a dose is missed it should be taken as soon as possible if it is less than 4 hours before the next dose the dose should be skipped the medication for home delivery will be dispensed in an unmarked container with the study label the container will be labeled with a unique identifier the container will be packed in a standard box used for mail delivery of medications as needed to be determined to be determined the risks associated with pep reflect the adverse events aes related to hcq administration with tens of millions of doses administrated for malaria and autoimmune diseases the side effect profile of hcq is well described and the drug is generally well tolerated with short-term administration as opposed to chronicyear-long use in rheumatologic disease management the major aes are gastrointestinal nausea vomiting dyspepsia abdominal cramps and diarrhea and transient skin rashes the gastrointestinal symptoms may vary by specific generic manufacturer of hcq 35 and are best managed by taking the drug with food or a glass of milk appendix 6  a transient rash most commonly morbilliform or psoriasiform can develop in 10 of participants often with a sustained loading dose and is often managed by lowering the dose to avoid this potential side effect this protocol is using a short loading dose not a sustained one uncommonly idiosyncratic leukopeniathrombocytopenia can occur and the drug confidential protocol hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 pep version 12 should not be given to those with underlying bone marrow disorders lastly hypoglycemia can occur and those taking insulin or glucose-lowering drugs are at risk blood glucose should be monitored minor blurry vision may occur with acute hcq use is reversible dose-related and is generally not severe it may also be associated with mild headaches it is caused by deposition of hcq in the cornea or ocular muscle weakness and is not a predictor of long-term toxicity participants experiencing minor blurry vision may adjust to it with counselling and reassurance that it is reversible and not progressive more severe rashes including drug-related eosinophilia with systemic symptoms and stevens-johnson syndrome occur rarely long-term manifestations of hcq including retinitis renal and hepatic disease and cardiomyopathy appendix 4 are not likely in this 2-week pep exposure enrollment in this protocol will not impact the public health departments advice for self-quarantine that said quarantine is known to be stressful especially for healthcare workers enrollment may improve morale during public health quarantine since there is clinical equipoise regarding hcq efficacy on viral shedding participants will be counseled to follow recommendations for self-quarantine the recommended dose of hcq for chronic use in lupus erythematosus is 200 mg to 400 mg daily-a dose that is safely taken for years including among elderly patients 65 years the selection of 400 mg for 3 days then 200 mg daily for 11 days is likely to be safe with transient aes gastrointestinal symptoms and rashes that are self-remitting to limit the transmission of sars-cov-2 participants will receive visits via secure telehealth in order to limit the movement of persons with potential sars-cov-2 and leave clinical space free for patients seeking care also to limit exposure in waiting rooms and pharmacies clinical specimens will be self-collected and medications delivered to homes if a study therapy dose is missed it should be taken as soon as possible if it is less than 4 hours before the next dose the dose should be skipped

administration of hydroxychloroquine significant levels of three metabolites desethylhydroxychloroquine dhcq desethylchloroquine dcq and bidesethylhydroxychloroquine bdcq have been found in plasma and blood with dhcq being the major metabolite the absorption half-life was approximately 3 to 4 hours and the terminal half-life ranged from 40 to 50 days the long half-life can be attributed to extensive tissue uptake rather than through decreased excretion peak plasma levels of hydroxychloroquine were seen in about 3 to 4 hours renal clearance in rheumatoid arthritis ra patients taking hydroxychloroquine sulfate for at least six months seemed to be similar to that of the single dose studies in volunteers suggesting that no change occurs with chronic dosing range for renal clearance of unchanged drug was approximately 16 to 30 and did not correlate with creatinine clearance therefore a dosage adjustment is not required for patients with renal impairment in ra patients there was large variability as to the fraction of the dose absorbed ie 30 to 100 and mean hydroxychloroquine levels were significantly higher in patients with less disease activity cellular levels of patients on daily hydroxychloroquine have been shown to be higher in mononuclear cells than polymorphonuclear leucocytes the precise mechanism by which hydroxychloroquine exhibits activity against plasmodium is not known hydroxychloroquine like chloroquine is a weak base and may exert its effect by concentrating in the acid vesicles of the parasite and by inhibiting polymerization of heme it can also inhibit certain enzymes by its interaction with dna chloroquine resistance occurs  hydroxychloroquine sulfate does not prevent relapses of p vivax or p ovale because it is not active against the hypnozoite forms of these parasites for radical cure of p vivax and p ovale infections concomitant therapy with an 8-aminoquinoline compound is necessary see clinical pharmacology -microbiology prior to prescribing hydroxychloroquine sulfate for the treatment or prophylaxis of malaria consult the centers for disease control and prevention cdc malaria website httpwwwcdcgovmalaria hydroxychloroquine sulfate is indicated for the treatment of chronic discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus in adults hydroxychloroquine sulfate is indicated for the treatment of acute and chronic rheumatoid arthritis in adults use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to 4aminoquinoline compounds hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not effective against chloroquine-resistant strains of p falciparum see clinical pharmacology -microbiology irreversible retinal damage has been observed in some patients who had received hydroxychloroquine sulfate significant risk factors for retinal damage include daily doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate 65 mgkg 5 mgkg base of actual body weight durations of use 5 years subnormal glomerular filtration use of some concomitant drug products such as tamoxifen citrate and concurrent macular disease a baseline ocular examination is recommended within the first year of starting hydroxychloroquine sulfate the baseline exam should include best corrected distance visual acuity bcva an automated threshold visual field vf of the central 10 degrees with retesting if an abnormality is noted and spectral domain ocular coherence tomography sd-oct for individuals with significant risk factors daily dose of hydroxychloroquine sulfate 5 mgkg base of actual body weight subnormal glomerular filtration use of tamoxifen citrate or concurrent macular disease monitoring should include annual examinations which include bcva vf and sd-oct for individuals without significant risk factors annual exams can usually be deferred until five years of treatment in individuals of asian descent retinal toxicity may first be noticed outside the macula in patients of asian descent it is recommended that visual field testing be performed in the central 24 degrees instead of the central 10 degrees it is recommended that hydroxychloroquine be discontinued if ocular toxicity is suspected and the patient should be closely observed given that retinal changes and visual disturbances may progress even after cessation of therapy  use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate in patients with psoriasis may precipitate a severe attack of psoriasis when used in patients with porphyria the condition may be exacerbated the preparation should not be used in these conditions unless in the judgment of the physician the benefit to the patient outweighs the possible hazard skeletal muscle myopathy or neuropathy leading to progressive weakness and atrophy of proximal muscle groups depressed tendon reflexes and abnormal nerve conduction have been reported muscle and nerve biopsies have been associated with curvilinear bodies and muscle fiber atrophy with vacuolar changes assess muscle strength and deep tendon reflexes periodically in patients on long-term therapy with hydroxychloroquine sulfate suicidal behavior has been rarely reported in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate hydroxychloroquine sulfate has been shown to cause severe hypoglycemia including loss of consciousness that could be life threatening in patients treated with or without antidiabetic medications see drug interactions and adverse reactions patients treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate should be warned about the risk of hypoglycemia and the associated clinical signs and symptoms patients presenting with clinical symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia during treatment with hydroxychloroquine sulfate should have their blood glucose checked and treatment reviewed as necessary us e with caution in patients with gas trointes tinal neurological or blood dis orders  and in thos e with a s ens itivity to quinine antimalarial compounds should be used with caution in patients with hepatic disease or alcoholism or in conjunction with known hepatotoxic drugs a reduction in dosage may be necessary in patients with hepatic or renal disease as well as in those taking medicines known to affect these organs antimalarial compounds should be used with caution in patients with hepatic disease or alcoholism or in conjunction with known hepatotoxic drugs periodic blood cell counts should be performed if patients are given prolonged therapy if any severe blood disorder such as aplastic anemia agranulocytosis leukopenia or thrombocytopenia appears which is not attributable to the disease under treatment consider discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine sulfate hydroxychloroquine sulfate should be administered with caution in patients having glucose-6phosphate dehydrogenase g-6-pd deficiency dermatologic reactions to hydroxychloroquine sulfate may occur and therefore proper care should be exercised when it is administered to any patient receiving a drug with a significant tendency to produce dermatitis concomitant hydroxychloroquine sulfate and digoxin therapy may result in increased serum digoxin levels serum digoxin levels should be closely monitored in patients receiving combined therapy as hydroxychloroquine sulfate may enhance the effects of a hypoglycemic treatment a decrease in doses of insulin or antidiabetic drugs may be required hydroxychloroquine sulfate prolongs the qt interval and should not be administered with other drugs that have the potential to induce cardiac arrhythmias also there may be an increased risk of inducing ventricular arrhythmias if hydroxychloroquine sulfate is used concomitantly with other arrhythmogenic drugs hydroxychloroquine sulfate can lower the convulsive threshold co-administration of hydroxychloroquine sulfate with other antimalarials known to lower the convulsion threshold eg mefloquine may increase the risk of convulsions the activity of antiepileptic drugs might be impaired if co-administered with hydroxychloroquine sulfate combined use of methotrexate with hydroxychloroquine sulfate has not been studied and may increase the incidence of adverse effects an increased plasma cyclosporin level was reported when cyclosporin and hydroxychloroquine sulfate were co-administered chloroquine has been reported to reduce the bioavailability of praziquantel antacids and kaolin can reduce absorption of chloroquine an interval of at least 4 hours between intake of these agents and chloroquine should be observed cimetidine can inhibit the metabolism of chloroquine increasing its plasma level concomitant use of cimetidine should be avoided in a study of healthy volunteers chloroquine significantly reduced the bioavailability of ampicillin patients should be informed of the early signs and symptoms of toxicity such as rash or visual changes patients must see their physicians promptly in case of the appearance of these or of any unusual effects periodic laboratory tests may be recommended in some patients patients should be fully informed of the potential risks of the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate especially in pregnancy and in children long-term studies in animals have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of hydroxychloroquine sulfate the mutagenic potential of hydroxychloroquine was not evaluated however chloroquine has been shown to be a catalytic inhibitor of dna repair enzymes topoisomerase ii and to produce weak genotoxic effects through this mode of action human pregnancies resulting in live births have been reported in the literature and no increase in the rate of birth defects has been demonstrated embryonic deaths and malformations of anophthalmia and microphthalmia in the offspring have been reported when pregnant rats received large doses of chloroquine caution should be exercised when administering hydroxychloroquine sulfate to nursing women it has been demonstrated that hydroxychloroquine administered to nursing women is excreted in human milk and it is known that infants are extremely sensitive to the toxic effects of 4-aminoquinolines safety and efficacy have not been established in the chronic use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate for systemic lupus erythematosus and juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children children are especially sensitive to the 4-aminoquinoline compounds most reported fatalities followed the accidental ingestion of chloroquine sometimes in small doses 075 g or 1 g in one 3-year-old child patients should be strongly warned to keep these drugs out of the reach of children see overdosage clinical studies of hydroxychloroquine sulfate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects however this drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function care should be taken in dose selection and it may be useful to monitor renal function the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate or other 4-aminoqunoline compounds because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure bone marrow failure anemia aplastic anemia agranulocytosis leukopenia and thrombocytopenia hemolysis reported in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase g-6-pd deficiency cardiomyopathy which may result in cardiac failure and in some cases a fatal outcome see warnings and overdosage

are very rapidly and completely absorbed after ingestion and in accidental overdosage or rarely with lower doses in hypersensitive patients toxic symptoms may occur within 30 minutes the symptoms of overdosage may include headache drowsiness visual disturbances cardiovascular collapse convulsions hypokalemia rhythm and conduction disorders including qt prolongation torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation followed by sudden potentially fatal respiratory and cardiac arrest treatment is symptomatic and must be prompt immediate gastric lavage until the stomach is completely emptied is indicated after lavage activated charcoal is introduced by the stomach tube within 30 minutes of ingestion of the drug may inhibit further intestinal absorption to be effective the dose of activated charcoal should be at least five times the estimated dose of hydroxychloroquine ingested consideration should be given to administering diazepam parenterally since studies suggest that it may be beneficial in reversing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine cardiotoxicity respiratory support and shock management should be instituted as necessary exchange transfusions are used to reduce the level of 4-aminoquinoline drug in the blood a patient who survives the acute phase and is asymptomatic should be closely observed for at least six hours fluids may be forced and sufficient ammonium chloride 8 g daily in divided doses for adults may be administered for a few days to acidify the urine this will promote urinary excretion in cases of both overdosage and

compound is necessary the recommended adult dosage is 200 to 400 mg 155 to 310 mg base daily administered as a single daily dose or in two divided doses doses above 400 mg a day are not recommended the incidence of retinopathy has been reported to be higher when this maintenance dose is exceeded the action of hydroxychloroquine is cumulative and may require weeks to months to achieve the maximum therapeutic effect see clinical pharmacology 400 mg to 600 mg 310 to 465 mg base daily administered as a single daily dose or in two divided doses in a small percentage of patients side effects may

sars-cov-2 is a novel coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 an infection characterized by flu-like symptoms progressing in some cases to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 1 2 or myocarditis 36 covid-19 was classified as a pandemic by the world health organization who on march 11 2020 the disease has reached nearly every country as of april 16 2020 there were 2090110 confirmed cases worldwide with 139469 deaths 7 the death and disability from covid-19 combined with the lack of approved treatments have created an unmet need for efficacious therapies as researchers and pharmaceutical companies race to develop vaccines and antivirals some have turned to remedies with little to no supporting evidence at least 300 iranians have died and 1000 have sustained blindness and brain damage from methanol poisoning in the mistaken belief that alcohol could prevent coronavirus infection 8 social media have propagated the misinformation that snorting cocaine or bleach will prevent infection 911 the desperation of these acts speaks to an urgent unmet need for effective therapeutics against sars-cov-19 we intend for this review to familiarize readers with the toxicities of potential therapeutics for covid-19 and possible treatments for those toxicities this review draws on multiple sources combining news articles social media posts and peer-reviewed research we identified the substances included in this review based on discussion in the media and our experience as practicing physicians scientists and pharmacists we rely on industry or news reports if no other source of information was available our discussion here presents our knowledge of novel therapeutics as publicly known in early april 2020 this article will discuss some therapeutic options against sar-cov-2 using the life-cycle of sars-cov-2 to understand the mechanism and toxicity of each agent we will discuss 1 viral cell entry inhibitory eg chloroquine hydroxychloroquine apn01 2 viral replication inhibitors eg protease inhibitors nucleotide analogs 3 nucleic acid vaccines and 4 miscellaneous medications azithromycin ace inhibitors and ibuprofen sars-cov-2 is an enveloped non-segmented positive-sense rna virus that belongs to the coronaviridae family to date seven coronaviruses are known to infect humans 229e nl63 oc43 hku1 mers-cov sars-cov-1 with three sars-cov-1 mers-cov and sars-cov-2 causing severe disease in humans 3 the genetic sequence of sars-cov-2 closely resembles that of sars-cov-1 a beta-coronavirus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic in 2003 much of our current understanding of sars-cov-2 is based off in vitro and in vivo experiments conducted to investigate the pathogenesis of sars-cov-1 coronavirus spreads between humans through respiratory droplets sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 gain entry when the spike protein on the surface of the viral capsid binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme ii ace2 on type ii alveolar cells leading to fusion of the viral and host cell membranes and injection of the viral rna into the host cytoplasm 12 once inside the cell the virus replicates its genetic material and then releases newly created virus particles virions each of these steps is an opportunity for treatments to disrupt the normal coronavirus life cycle researchers are currently investigating treatments for covid-19 by developing vaccines and novel drugs as well as testing existing medications a vaccine against sars-cov-2 may be clinically available in 1218 months 13 medications approved by the food and drug administration fda for other purposess such as chloroquine are being repositioned to treat covid-19 therapeutic repurposing ie repositioning is an expedited drug-development strategy to reuse currently fda-approved therapeutics for new medical indications on march 28 the fda granted emergency authorization for the use of chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate to treat covid-19 14 the european medicines agency recommended restricting their use pending the outcome of clinical trials 15 the american academy of clinical toxicology aact the american association of poison control centers aapcc and the american college of medical toxicology acmt recommended in a joint press release that use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine should occur only under the direction of a medical provider for an fda-approved indication or as part of a trial for the treatment of covid-19 or as part of an approved hospital protocol 16 our discussion does not cover all drugs and is not intended to be exhaustive in the absence of direct evidence we expect drugs of a similar class to have similar toxicity chloroquine is a 4-aminoquinoline primarily used to treat malaria an infectious disease caused by several plasmodia species chloroquine concentrates in acidic environments such as the digestive vacuole of plasmodia spp or the golgi apparatus of human cells chloroquine prevents plasmodia from crystallizing heme to hemozoin 17 leading to a buildup of heme that becomes toxic to the parasite the golgi apparatus is a collection of vesicles where post-translational modifications such as glycosylation occur chloroquine freely diffuses into vacuoles the acidic environment of the vacuole favors the protonated charged form which cannot freely diffuse away ion trapping leading to a buildup of chloroquine in the vacuoles chloroquine alters the glycosylation of ace2 which decreases the affinity of ace2 for the coronavirus spike protein reducing sars-cov-2 entry in vitro 18 additionally chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine inhibit the toll-like receptor tlr pathway the tlr pathway is involved in pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling 19 chloroquine was found to inhibit sars-cov-1 infection and he sequence and structure homologies between sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 suggest that chloroquine could reduce sars-cov-2 infectivity 18 indeed one in vitro study demonstrated that chloroquine inhibits sars-cov-2 entry 21 guangdong province recommended 500 mg chloroquine twice a day for 10 days for any person diagnosed with covid-19 without contraindications to chloroquine 20 one abstractcommentary suggests efficacy but cites an audio transcript of a press conference in guangdong china the supporting data for which is not available 22 doses greater than 5 grams of chloroquine are associated with mortality due to ventricular dysrhythmias and hypokalemia 23 cardiovascular collapse and profound hypotension  can occur within 13 hours of overdose sodium channel blockade results in qrs widening on ecg 24-26 neurologic effects include seizures and cns depression 27 oxidative stress can lead to hemolysis particularly in patients with g6pd deficiency potassium channel blockade can result in prolonged qtc interval and torsades de pointes and clinicians should avoid using qt prolonging agents if chloroquine toxicity is present in this current pandemic a man in arizona died after ingesting chloroquine phosphate a form of chloroquine used for treating aquariums using it to self-medicate 24 and cases of chloroquine poisoning have been reported in nigeria 25 it is important to store chloroquine safely to avoid secondary harm as little as 10 mgkg of chloroquine in children which could be 12 pills requires medical evaluation 27 mgkg was the lowest fatal dose in toddlers 28 hydroxychloroquine is a derivative of chloroquine it is considered less toxic the difference in mechanisms of action between chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is not fully understood chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are dealkylated into desethylchloroquine by cyp3a45 and 2c8 29 hydroxychloroquine is also dealkylated into desethylhydroxychloroquine by 2d6 19 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine inhibit 2d6 which can increase serum concentrations of metoprolol propranolol opiates antidysrhythmics antidepressants and antipsychotics 30 the minimum fatal dose of hydroxychloroquine is not well defined the minimum dose reported to elicit severe symptoms hypotension hypokalemia and ventricular dysrhythmias is 4 g 31 one case report from 1965 for which the full text is not available describes a 16 year old who died after reportedly ingesting 12 g of hydroxychloroquine 32 an 18-year-old girl who ingested 20 g of hydroxychloroquine developed hypokalemia hypotension and ventricular tachycardia but survived with intubation epinephrine infusion high-dose diazepam and potassium repletion 33 see treatment of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine toxicity section three other case reports describe a total of five severely symptomatic patients who survived overdoses of 2036 g of hydroxychloroquine with aggressive interventions including epinephrine and high-dose diazepam 3336 data regarding the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in treating covid-19 are limited one clinical trial that has not been peer reviewed suggests that in patients with a clinical diagnosis of covid-19 25 out of 31 who received hydroxychloroquine clinically improved after 5 days as compared with 17 out of 31 in the control group 37 in that study one patient who received hydroxychloroquine developed a rash without mucosal involvement and another developed a headache both resolved without intervention in 1988 riou et al published a prospective study of 11 patients who were anticipated to have a likely lethal ingestion of chloroquine greater than 5 g of chloroquine and compared them to 11 historical controls these individuals were treated with epinephrine infusion initial 025 gkgmin titrated to sbp  100 mmhg 2 mgkg of diazepam over 30 min intubation and nasogastric aspiration diazepam was continued at 12 mgkg per day over 24 days ten of these 11 patients survived to hospital discharge compared with 1 out of 11 patients in the control group 23 diazepam perhaps not intuitively was incorporated in this combination therapy due to animal 38 and human evidence that it may be beneficial in combined overdoses this study has largely shaped the recommended treatment of epinephrine and high dose diazepam though not without some controversy regarding its generalizability hypokalemia is a common finding in chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine overdose and is likely due to intracellular shift of potassium in a retrospective study of 191 patients with chloroquine toxicity a serum potassium lower than 30 mmoll was correlated with mortality and the serum potassium decreased as serum chloroquine levels increased 39 the linear relationship between serum potassium and chloroquine concentrations suggests that hypokalemia reflects an effect of chloroquine itself although the severely ill patients also received epinephrine infusions beta-adrenergic agonists can cause intracellular potassium shifts total body potassium stores are not expected to be depleted in the setting of chloroquine toxicity raising concern for rebound hyperkalemia as toxicity resolves as such some clinicians recommend less aggressive potassium repletion supplementing normal daily potassium with 80 meq per 24 h 39 though if severe hypokalemia is present it would be reasonable to replete while observing for rebound hyperkalemia the treatment for acute toxicity from hydroxychloroquine is thought to be the same as for acute toxicity from chloroquine qrs prolongation from xenobiotic-induced sodium channel blockade is often treated with sodium bicarbonate boluses and infusions administration of sodium bicarbonate may treat the cardiac sodium channel blockade but worsen hypokalemia so patient-specific characteristics must be considered when weighing the use of this therapy lipid emulsion therapy did not lead to return of spontaneous circulation when given during cardiac arrest for either a hydroxychloroquine ingestion or a combined ingestion of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine 40 two case reports suggest that lipid emulsion can reverse hypotension averting cardiac arrest 41 42 in the second case report one patient received lipid emulsion therapy and did not develop significant cardiotoxicity beyond a prolonged qtc interval although this patient ingested a smaller dose of hydroxychloroquine 5 g 42 extracorporeal circulatory support could be considered for severe overdoses refractory to other treatments 43 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can both lead to retinopathy it is rare for this toxicity to develop before 5 years of therapy 44 and is not expected with short-term use of 3995 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who ever used hydroxychloroquine 65 discontinued it because of eye complaints although probable or definite retinal toxicity was documented in less than 1 the risk of retinal toxicity increased by fivefold once lifetime exposure reached 1 kg 44 long-term use of hydroxychloroquine has also been associated with cardiomyopathy 45 46 clinicians should also be mindful of secondary effects of an increase in demand for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat covid-19 hydroxychloroquine is used to treat systemic lupus erythematosus sle some patients with sle have been unable to fill their prescriptions due to shortages 47 some state pharmaceutical boards have noted surges in prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine chloroquine and azithromycin written by physicians for either themselves or their family members a practice which the american medical association promptly denounced 48 apn01 apeiron biologics is a recombinant human ace2 protein first developed to treat sars 49 it may treat covid-19 by preventing sars-cov-2 entry and reducing acute lung injury it does so by acting as a soluble molecular decoy for sars-cov-2 preventing the virus from binding to cellular ace2 in a dose-dependent fashion 50 ace2 in vitro is the essential receptor for the sars-cov-2 entry 51 and also serves to maintain normal lung physiology when the virion binds to cell surface ace2 this lung protective signalingis lost by preventing ace2-mediated sars-cov-2 interaction and therefore restoring physiologic ace2 signaling apn01 may reduce acute lung injury 52 a randomized unblinded clinical trial is underway in china to investigate the efficacy of apn01 to reduce viral load and the duration of covid-19 symptoms 53 a phase i trial of apn01 from 2013 by haschke and colleagues was well-tolerated with no cardiovascular side effects in 22 healthy subjects toxicity from recombinant proteins in general arises from inadvertent activation of the immune system unintentional immunogenicity and binding of the recombinant proteins to other cell surface receptors triggering cellular signal transduction cascades that were not consciously targeted off-target binding unintentional immunogenicity can lead to the formation of anti-drug antibodies that can deposit in tissues as immune complexes for example immune complexes can deposit in the kidney impairing the kidneys ability to filter out toxins and recover electrolytes if the immune system treats the recombinant protein as an antigen treatment may precipitate serum sickness off-target binding of apn01 could modulate renin-angiotensin signaling altering blood pressure and organ perfusion one abstract provides evidence that up to 12 mgkg per day caused no immunogenicity or cardiovascular toxicity in three healthy human volunteers 54 leronlimab cytodyn is an investigational humanized igg4 monoclonal antibody against ccr5 receptors found on t lymphocytes chemokine receptor 5 ccr5 was first characterized for its role as a co-receptor in human immunodeficiency virus hiv viral entry into white blood cells 55 we now recognize that other pathogens such as dengue 56 or staphylococcus aureus 57 also use the ccr5 signaling pathway for entry or as a virulence factor leronlimab is being repurposed and investigated as a treatment option for patients with covid-19 who experience respiratory complications as a result of covid-19 a single-arm open-label multi-center clinical study is set to take place to investigate the clinical improvement in total symptom score ie fever myalgia dyspnea and cough currently leronlimab has a fast-track designation from the fda for hiv and metastatic triple-negative breast cancer 58 there are no serious side effects or adverse events reported so far leronlimab has successfully completed nine phase 1 2 and 3 clinical trials in about 800 patients for other indications and achieved primary efficacy endpoints 59 reasoning by analogy with approved therapeutics in oncology the acute toxicity from humanized antibodies can include 1 immunosuppression predisposing to opportunistic infections or viral-induced neoplasias 2 immunostimulation including the dramatic cytokine storm of fevers chills myalgias and acute lung injury similar to a severe presentation of covid-19 and 3 hypersensitivity reactions 60 the specificity of antibodies is likely to give rise to idiosyncratic side effect profiles and not all antibodies will cause the same degree of immunosuppression or immune cell activation we expect humanized antibodies to be less likely to cause serum sickness than antibodies raised in horse ie anavip or raised in sheep ie crofab anavip rare disease therapeutics inc and crofab protherics inc are antibody therapies used to treat envenomation by north american crotalids a humanized antibody is an antibody raised from non-human species and then modified to increase its similarity to naturally occurring human antibodies so as to provoke less of a humoral immune response in humans for example antibodies raised in mice can have their fc region replaced by human sequences to decrease immunogenicity 61 the overall goal of nucleotide analogs is to halt the production of new viral rna making it impossible for infected host cells to become manufacturing sites for new virions nucleotide analogs do this by incorporating a base into the replicating strand from which viral rna polymerase cannot elongate remdesivir gilead is a prodrug metabolized to an adenosine nucleotide analog it has demonstrated in vitro efficacy against sars-cov-2 21 favipiravir toyama chemical mimics adenosine and guanine leading rna-dependent rna polymerase to make error-ridden nonfunctional viral genome progeny 62 in the absence of data on remdesivir or favipiravir toxicity one can extrapolate from the toxicity reported for other nucleoside analogs metabolic acidosis can occur with therapeutic use usually after a month or more of treatment 63 though it has also been observed in acute overdose severe metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate is a toxicity of nucleoside analogs that has a high mortality peripheral neuropathy is a dose-related subacute phenomenon seen with stavudine 23-didehydro-23-dideoxythymidine d4t didanosine ddi and zalcitabine ddc 64 bone marrow suppression is seen in about 5 of patients starting 3-azido-23-dideoxythymidine azt treatment 65 pancreatitis and myopathy have been observed with several medications in this class 66 each of these toxicities are thought to reflect mitochondrial dysfunction in addition to inhibiting viral polymerase nucleoside analogs also inhibit mitochondrial dna polymerase-gamma leading to decreased mitochondrial dna and synthesis of mitochondrial proteins 64 if severe toxicity occurs the offending agent should be stopped there is no specific antidote though some suggest that treatment with mitochondrial cofactors such as thiamine riboflavin l-carnitine and vitamin c may help patients recover 63 additional idiosyncratic toxicities may also occur for example tenofovir inducing crystalluria 67 protease inhibitors prevent infected cells from forming competent new virions by binding to and inactivating viral proteases to halt viral replication viral proteases process the initial products of translation to make the final versions of viral proteins viral proteases are unique to each virus the crystal structure of the sars-cov-2 main protease has recently been identified 68 drugs that are effective against one virus are not expected to be effective against another virus unless the viruses proteases are sufficiently similar protease inhibitors that target hiv protease for example do not target hepatitis c protease even though both are rna viruses the crystal structure of the sars-cov-2 main protease has been identified and it closely resembles sars-cov-1 but not any known human proteases 68 screening of hiv protease inhibitors against sars-cov-1 found that nelfinavir but not ritonavir inhibited viral replication in vitro 69 although this study described the efficacy of nelfinavir it did not determine if nelfinavirs effects were specifically due to sars-cov-1 protease inhibition another screening study identified lopinavir but not nelfinavir as inhibiting sars-cov-1 and demonstrated that treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir abbvie and ribavirin reduced mortality and ards compared to treatment with ribavirin alone 70 ritonavir is added to lopinavir as a pharmacokinetic booster 71 ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome cyp 3a4 the enzyme that inactivates lopinavir the same regimen lopinavir-ritonavir with ribavirin was used as post-exposure prophylaxis for healthcare workers treating patients with severe middle east respiratory syndrome mers also caused by a coronavirus which showed a 40 decreased risk of infection and no severe adverse effects were reported 72 early experience in the treatment of sars-cov-2 suggests that patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir commonly experience nausea and vomiting as well as mild transaminase elevations 73 lopinavir-ritonavir seemed to hasten recovery in a case series of 10 hospitalized patients 74 but a larger randomized trial of 99 test subjects and 100 controls showed no difference in time to clinical improvement 75 in all three studies many patients receiving the combination left the study due to nausea vomiting and diarrhea acute overdose of protease inhibitors is uncommon but a large overdose of more than 50 g of lopinavir-ritonavir was generally well tolerated and managed supportively 76 ritonavir is a very potent inhibitor of cyp3a4 ki 059  012m and may slow the metabolism of drugs which are substrates of cyp3a4 leading to potential dangerous drug-drug interactions 77 lopinavir-ritonavir is associated with increases in transaminases in 310 of individuals being treated for hiv though clinically significant liver injury appears to be rare and resolves with drug removal 78 a cholestatic pattern of injury is sometimes observed which may be explained by lopinavir reducing expression of the bile salt export pump bsep in human hepatocytes 79 a latency period of 1 month or longer is common which may make this a less relevant feature in the treatment of sars-cov-2 there are genetic variations polymorphisms across patients such as a loss-of-function of cyp3a4 80 that can make patients more susceptible to metabolic toxicities 81 screening for these susceptibilities is not practical in the setting of short duration treatment for sars-cov-2 arthralgias may occur in 35 of patients 82 achilles tendinopathy has been reported in individuals taking lopinavir-ritonavir even in short-term use for post-exposure prophylaxis 83 protease inhibitors cause lipodystrophy characterized by central adiposity dorsocervical fat deposition buffalo-hump and extremity wasting when used to treat hiv multiple mechanisms may explain these metabolic derangements including inhibition of srebp-1 a master regulator of lipogenesis and adipocyte differentiation and direct inhibition of glucose transporter-4 79 s-trimer refers to a vaccine made to resemble the spike protein the protein on the capsid surface that binds to ace2 in alveolar cells to initiate viral entry the spike protein is an attractive target because it elicits an immune response and mutations in the spike protein may explain the virulence of sars-cov-2 the sars-cov-2 spike protein binds about ten times more tightly to ace2 than the sars-cov-1 spike protein does 84 the mutations also create the need for new therapeutics as that same paper noted that three monoclonal antibodies raised against sars-cov-1 spike protein did not strongly bind to sars-cov-2 spike protein the s-trimer vaccine candidate is expected to be tested in pre-clinical studies shortly the generation of antibodies against the spike proteins of sars or mers 85 was challenging because the spike proteins of coronaviruses are heavily glycosylated dna vaccines work by inserting dna plasmids that encode antigens into host cells this generates cellular and humoral antigen-specific immunity allowing the patient to mount an immune response to the target disease 86 87 studies are ongoing regarding the effectiveness and longevity of vaccine immunogenicity for several infections including hiv mers ebola and zika gls-5300 inovio pharmaceuticals inc geneone life science inc a dna vaccine for mers-cov is entering phase 2 trials mers-cov is the coronavirus that causes middle east respiratory syndrome gls-3500 encodes for the mers-cov spike glycoprotein and demonstrated an immunogenic response in non-human primates in phase 1 studies gls-5300 demonstrated local injection site symptoms in most patients along with headaches malaise and myalgia some patients developed mild creatinine phosphokinase elevations but no renal injury or myopathy developed 88 ino-4800 inovio pharmaceuticals inc is a dna vaccine that encodes the sars-cov-2 spike protein and is delivered intradermally 89 a phase 1 clinical trial ino-4800 started in early april to enhance uptake dna vaccines are administered via an electroporation device such as the cellectra 90 safety and tolerability studies of the cellectra did not identify severe adverse events though injection site pain mild elevations in creatinine phosphokinase and paresthesias were described 91 animals that received the vaccine produced antibodies and t cells against the virus 13 a phase 1 clinical trial ino-4800 has started beyond local tissue reactions dna vaccines raise the concern of adverse events from plasmid integration with host dna disrupting usual transcription in vitro studies thus far suggest that the rate of insertional mutagenesis is lower than the rate of spontaneous mutations in mammalian cells generally dna vaccines appear to be safe without apparent off-target effects or idiosyncratic toxicities 87 messenger rna mrna vaccines direct the production of antigens but unlike dna vaccines cannot integrate into the host genome lowering the risk of mutations 92 once in the cytosol mrna vaccines direct antigen production and then rapidly degrade moderna therapeutics in collaboration with the national institute of allergy and infectious disease announced that it launched a phase i trial of the mrna-1273 the mrna-1273 vaccine is a novel lipid nanoparticle encapsulated mrna-based vaccine that encodes for the prefusion stabilized form of the spike protein 93 the prefusion form refers to the spatial conformation of the spike protein before it binds to ace2 an antibody against the prefusion form could prevent viral entry as well as mitigate the spread of virions azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic used for its ability to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome it is also used to treat exacerbations of copd and reactive airway disease this second use may reflect azithromycins modulatory effect on immune cells it reduces respiratory syncytial virus rsv release by decreasing interferon signaling in vivo and inhibits proinflammatory cytokine release in airway smooth muscle and epithelial cells 94 a prospective trial in france of 22 patients noted that a combination of 600 mg hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin 500 mg on the first day and then 250 mg each day for the next 4 days reduced viral load more effectively than hydroxychloroquine alone 95 this trial broke randomization as those who declined treatment were analyzed as controls the main toxicity from azithromycin is qtc prolongation leading to cardiac dysrhythmias owing to herg an inward rectifying potassium channel blockade 96 in one cohort study a 5-day course of azithromycin led to a nearly three-fold increase in cardiovascular death as compared to other antibiotics 97 although a follow-up cohort study of similar size 2204100 prescriptions 98 and meta-analysis of prospective randomized controlled trials identified no increased risk in mortality 99 we expect the combination of azithromycin and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to be more likely to precipitate cardiac dysrhythmias than either alone azithromycin weakly blocks herg from conducting potassium ions across the cardiac membrane while chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine decrease the number of ions available for transit there is concern in the media that angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors may increase susceptibility to sars-cov-2 100 ace inhibitors can increase ace2 expression in human tissue 101 potentially creating more binding sites for sars-cov-2 the receptor-binding domain rbd of sars-cov-2 has a high affinity for ace2 however ace inhibitors have been shown to reduce viral entry by competitive inhibition of spike protein binding to ace2 in vitro 102 lastly alveolar cells infected with coronavirus express less ace2 on their cell surface than normal cells in vitro knocking down the expression of ace2 in uninfected mice creates acute lung injury histologically similar to that seen in sars suggesting intact ace2 function serves a lung-protective role 103 one could interpret these findings to suggest that those patients taking ace inhibitors may benefit from stopping them while those not taking them may benefit from starting at this time however there is no direct clinical evidence of any impact of ace inhibitors on the clinical trajectory of those with covid-19 a retrospective study from wuhan china identified hypertension diabetes and cerebrovascular disease as poor prognostic factors but did not isolate the relative risk attributable to taking an ace inhibitor 1 the worse outcome in this study of patients on ace inhibitors may reflect the generally poor outcomes of patients with multiple comorbidities no patient should abruptly discontinue an ace inhibitor except at the direction of a physician blood pressure rapidly rises in the first 48 hours after ace inhibitor discontinuation 104 which could precipitate hypertensive emergencies and subsequent acute pulmonary edema that same study stated that ibuprofen increases ace2 receptor expression but provided no supporting evidence neither the who 105 nor the fda 106 recommends withholding ibuprofen for symptomatic treatment of covid-19 convalescent plasma refers to pooled plasma or immunoglobulins from patients who have been infected and then recovered from a disease in ten patients seropositive for sars-cov-2 and hypoxic but not intubated one dose of 200 ml of convalescent plasma led to a nearly immediately undetectable viral load and improved oxygenation in 3 days 107 in five patients who were intubated with radiographic evidence of acute lung injury transfusion of 200250 ml of convalescent plasma on days 10 and 22 of admission reduced hypoxia in all five and three were able to be weaned from mechanical ventilation 108 risks commonly associated with plasma transfusion include 1 transfusion-associated acute lung injury trali 2 transfusion-associated circulatory overload taco and 3 allergicanaphylactic reactions other less common risks include 1 transmission of infections 2 febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions 3 rbc alloimmunization and 4 hemolytic transfusion reactions 109 a meta-analysis of studies that used convalescent plasma to treat sars and influenza a h1n1 reported no adverse effects beyond minor infusion reactions such as chills and fevers 110 four critically ill patients with sars-cov-2 had no significant adverse events when treated with convalescent plasma and supportive care 111 the unmet need for effective treatments for covid-19 has spurred pharmaceutical companies to develop or repurpose therapeutics against sars-cov-2 frontline providers may be unfamiliar with the usage of older therapeutics such as chloroquine or medicines typically used by subspecialists like dna vaccines protease inhibitors or convalescent plasma therapy in conjunction with effective infection control policies a combination of measured and reasoned repurposing of existing therapies development and vetting of novel drugs and guidance by medical toxicologists may reduce morbidity and mortality from covid-19 and avoid cases where the cure is worse than the disease  searching an effective therapy for the coronavirus pandemic do we see light at the end of the tunnel alexander muacevic john adler r munish sharma salim surani   coronaviruses have been long known to be pathogens in both humans and animals apart from causing community-acquired coronaviruses novel forms of coronavirus had been implicated in the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak in 2003 and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers in 2012 1-2 towards the end of december 2019 a novel type of coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of a cluster of pneumonia cases in wuhan city in china its rapid spread within china caused an epidemic that is believed to have peaked between late january and early february 3 initially referred to as 2019-ncov the causative agent is now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 as recommended by the coronavirus study group of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses 4 officially designated as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by world health organization who this novel coronavirus became a pandemic on march 11 2020 5 the total case counts around the world is increasing every day and the latest case counts can be found on the official website of who sars-cov-2 falls in the betacoronavirus subgenus similar to the sars coronavirus of 2003 and uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor for cellular entry the closest rna sequencing has been found to be similar to bat coronaviruses but it is unknown if there was transmission to humans through an intermediate host or through bats that could be the primary host 6 in the wake of this pandemic preventive measures to break the chain of transmission is being adopted the medical community around the world is also working hard to find effective preventive and curative therapy for those already suffering from this illness though difficult have we started to see some exciting results in our attempt to seek therapy for the covid-19 disease revisiting the medications from the sars and mers epidemics that have resurfaced in the context of covid-19 analysis of the full genomic sequence of the coronavirus that causes covid-19 has been shown to resemble the sars coronavirus of 2003 more closely than the middle eastern respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus of 2012 7-8 after the sars coronavirus outbreak in 2003 there were multiple attempts to find an effective treatment for the virus apart from meticulous supportive care experts could not recommend specific treatment 9 during the epidemic in 2003 a vast majority of patients were treated with glucocorticoids and received ribavirin too but these drugs were not found to have any immediate or long-term beneficial effects 10 glucocorticoids were associated with an increased risk of mortality and decelerated the process of viral clearance in mers coronavirus infection there was no mortality benefit but rather convincing evidence of harm in the short term and the long run in sars coronavirus 11 staying in lieu of these pieces of evidence who and centers for disease control and prevention cdc have recommended against the use of glucocorticoids in patients with covid-19 unless there are co-existing compelling indications for its use such as exacerbation of chronic obstructive lung disease or asthma 12 ribavirin a nucleoside analog that has broad antiviral activity was also used along with glucocorticoids at a high dose via the intravenous and oral routes to combat sars in 2003 systematic reviews published in 2005 and 2006 failed to establish any beneficial effects with ribavirin 9-10 in a prospective observational study that included patients who received ribavirin for 14 days along with glucocorticoids after initial improvement of fever and symptoms of pneumonia there was a resurgence of fever in 85 patients within mean 89 days while 45 had worsening respiratory symptoms after 86 days forty-five percent 45 of patients had newer lesions on radiographs while diarrhea was seen in 73 of patients after 75 days of medication use 13 despite these findings there has been a study going on to repurpose the utility of sofosbuvir a ribonucleic acid rna-dependent rna polymerase inhibitor used in the treatment of hepatitis c along with ribavirin in covid-19 patients data from sequence analyzing modeling and molecular docking from this study have shown the ability of sofosbuvir and ribavirin to tightly bind to the sars cov-2 rna-dependent rna polymerase indicating their potential use in the treatment of covid-19 patients 14 further data need to emerge from this study to be considered for clinical use lopinavir and ritonavir protease inhibitors were used along with ribavirin and glucocorticoids in an open-label trial during the sars outbreak in 2003 the treatment group was given lopinavirritonavir along with ribavirin and corticosteroids n41 it was compared with a control arm with patients treated with ribavirin and glucocorticoids only n111 patients included in the trial did not have acute respiratory distress syndrome due to sars coronavirus 2003 severe hypoxemia or death on the 21st day was the composite primary outcome in the treatment group 24 of patients had severe hypoxemia while there were no deaths in comparison to 225 hypoxemia in the control group with 63 deaths 15 due to the absence of definite treatment guidelines for covid-19 china international exchange and promotive association for medical and health care cpam issued a guideline in february 2020 they recommended using lopinavirritonavir along with interferon-alpha in nebulizer form for antiviral action against sars-cov-2 these recommendations were based on weaker evidence 16-17 a trial of lopinavirritonavir conducted in adult patients who were hospitalized with severe covid-19 failed to show any benefit beyond the standard care available 18 in this study 99 patients were treated with lopinavirritonavir while 100 patients received standard medical care there was no difference in time to clinical improvement hazard ratio 124 95 confidence interval 090-172 mortality at 28 days 192 vs 25 -58 difference with 95 confidence interval -173 to 57 and decrease in detectable viral load between two arms notably gastrointestinal adverse effects were more common in the lopinavirritonavir group that led to 13 patients stopping the medication 18 buoyed by its activity against the ebola virus remdesivir was also tested and was reportedly found to have some activity against the sars and mers coronaviruses 19 remdesivir is a nucleoside analog it is an investigational agent and not available commercially its manufacturer gilead sciences inc foster city california has provided it for compassionate use programs on the request of the treating physician and now is requiring institutions to be involved in the randomized trial though a clinical trial to determine the efficacy of remdesivir in patients with sars-cov-2 infection is ongoing and results may be expected in april 2020 pre-clinical trials have shown significant activity against the coronavirus the in-vitro study has revealed the potent antiviral activity of remdesivir against sars-cov-2 20-21 has the emergence of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine sparked some optimism chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine an analog of chloroquine have been traditionally used as anti-malarial agents and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs dmards in conditions like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis hydroxychloroquine is believed to disrupt vesicle function in the parasite by increasing the ph it also arrests various erythrocytes stages of the plasmodium to exert its anti-malarial effect it also inhibits acute phase reactants rheumatoid factor and various other enzymes for its immunosuppressive effect 22 the state council of china in a news briefing on february 17 2020 released the first positive experience regarding the use of chloroquine phosphate in patients with covid-19-associated pneumonia 23 this was a multicenter clinical trial conducted in 10 different hospitals in china as per the news briefing by the state council of china and a further letter published by gao j et al on february 19 2020 more than 100 patients were found to have a lesser exacerbation of pneumonia due to covid-19 improved radiological findings better virus-negative conversion and a shorter course of disease in the chloroquine phosphate treatment arm in comparison to the control group 23 as per the authors chloroquine has been recommended to be included in the next edition of official guidelines to be released by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china for the management of pneumonia caused by covid-19 23 the chinese expert panel has recommended chloroquine 500 mg twice-daily dosing for 10 days 24 besides china several countries based upon the benefits shown by limited in-vitro studies and anecdotal experiences are currently using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in patients with covid-19 pneumonia on march 17 2020 findings were released from an open-label study that investigated the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in hospitalized patients with covid-19 this study was conducted at the mediterranee infection university hospital institute in marseille france 25 only patients above the age of 12 years were included the polymerase chain reaction pcr technique was used to detect sars-cov-2 from the nasopharyngeal samples of the patients on admission the study enrolled 36 out of 42 patients meeting the inclusion criteria twenty-six patients received hydroxychloroquine while 16 patients were the control it has been reported that six patients were lost to follow-up due to the early cessation of treatment this study included asymptomatic patients 167 patients with upper respiratory tract symptoms urti 611 and lower respiratory tract symptoms lrti 222 the authors have confirmed that all cases of lrti had pneumonia confirmed on radiological findings of computed tomography ct chest all the demographic factors in the treatment and control arms were well-matched except that the average age of hydroxychloroquine-receiving patients was 512 years versus 373 years in the control group all 20 patients in the treatment arm were administered 200 mg of oral hydroxychloroquine three times a day for 10 days in the control arm six patients also received azithromycin at a dose of 500 mg on the first day followed by 250 mg daily for four days to prevent secondary bacterial infection the primary endpoint was virological clearance on the sixth day of the initiation of treatment the results of this study revealed that 70 of hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were free of the virus as compared to only 125 of patients in the control group interestingly all six patients 100 treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were cured one patient who received hydroxychloroquine only remained pcr-positive on the sixth day and was able to get rid of the virus on the ninth day after the addition of azithromycin on the eighth day 25 we also personally opine that the results of this study are promising especially in the current context of this pandemic where the entire world is struggling to find a definitive treatment apart from a cure for the existing patients this study opens avenues for further studies geared towards finding a prophylactic regimen also that can stop the emergence of new cases and limit the burden of this pandemic however we do have to acknowledge that this study is limited due to its smaller sample size restricted ethnic and geographic population and very short-term follow-up it also raises further queries and concerns regarding the six patients that dropped out of the study results look more promising in patients who received a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin but whether the combination of these two medications leads to potential cardiac-elated adverse events such as ventricular arrhythmias mainly due to the risk of qt prolongation is something that needs to be addressed in future studies another question this study raises is the possibility of the existence of certain resistant strains of sars-cov-2 that did not respond to hydroxychloroquine treatment in the united states as well clinical trials involving hydroxychloroquine are being planned for not only the treatment of mild moderate and severe covid-19 but also for pre and postexposure prophylaxis 26 quest for a vaccine there is currently no vaccine that has been approved for pre-exposure or postexposure prophylaxis there are various clinical trials that are being conducted in the united states and in other countries for postexposure prophylaxis 27 in the united states the first vaccine that is being evaluated for the prevention of covid-19 is using a technique that would promote the expression of viral protein which can potentially induce a response from the immune apparatus of the host 28 the entire world is looking forward to a breakthrough in terms of vaccines but we have to wait patiently for now in the wake of the pandemic caused by covid-19 the medical and scientific community around the world has been racing against time to find a cure for sars-cov-2 the sudden onset and unprecedented surge of this virus have instilled an urgency to seek preventive and therapeutic options for covid-19 the recent outpouring of data from the rather smaller studies and anecdotal experiences cannot be considered a major breakthrough but may be looked at as a silver lining further bigger studies are needed to be started immediately to consolidate the data obtained from these smaller studies we must make a careful choice while designing larger studies based on the preliminary data from smaller studies as we might not only risk treating patients with therapy that may not ultimately prove to be effective but may also miss the

used for this study are available from the corresponding author to other researchers upon reasonable request this study was approved by the institutional review board of northwell health which waived the requirement for individual informed consent from the start of the outbreak until april 4 2020 3180 patients have received combination hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin and 1181 patients received hydroxychloroquine alone for the treatment of covid-19 in 14 hospitals of the new york state northwell health system the present study is an in-depth prospective observational study from 3 of the hospitals all hospitalized patients 18 years of age with polymerase chain reaction confirmed covid-19 illness treated with chloroquinehydroxychloroquineazithromycin were identified from march 1 to march 23 the decision to treat with chloroquinehydroxychloroquineazithromycin was based on the clinical decision of the admitting physician and predescribed healthcare system guidelines healthcare system criteria for the use of chloroquinehydroxychloroquineazithromycin therapy placed on march 1 were as follows confirmed covid-19 polymerase chain reaction testing or high suspicion of covid-19 with test pending acute respiratory distress syndrome or severe illness characterized by systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria or clinicians judgment that the patient is likely to progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome or severe illness in the next 6 hours patients not meeting the criteria for therapy were excluded from the study patients chronically on hydroxychloroquine for autoimmune diseases such as lupus those with a documented hypersensitivity to any of the agents and any patient that refused the therapies were excluded from the study demographics inpatient medication lists values from the baseline ecgs including qrs duration qrs morphology and qt interval duration were collected on all patients before initiation of therapy inpatient medication orders were reviewed daily and any concomitant qt-prolonging agent usage was identified twice daily ecgs except for patients that received a mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry mcot patch biotelemetry malvern pa were obtained to assess the corrected qt interval qtc given the large number of covid-19 patients admitted throughout the health system and the limited amount of telemetry beds available the mcot patches were used to monitor for both qt prolongation and for arrhythmias in patients on nontelemetry units mcot patches were preprogrammed to transmit twice daily telemetry strips for qt interval measurements telemetry or mcot patch urgent alerts were reviewed for all patients and any cardiac arrhythmias were documented premature discontinuation of any of the medications due to qt prolongation was also noted all qt intervals obtained from an ecg or mcot patch were manually measured by a physician on the research team lead ii was utilized for the measurement of the qt interval on ecg if the t-wave could not easily be measured in lead ii leads v6 or i were alternatively used the end of the t-wave was defined as the tangent drawn from the steepest last limb of the t-wave to its intersection with the baseline if a baseline bbb was present the j-t interval was measured and 120 ms was added to obtain the qt interval duration bazett formula was used to calculate the corrected qt interval baseline qt interval measurements obtained from the mcot patch were compared with that of the baseline ecg utilizing lead i as the mcot patch provides a lead i strip to ensure accuracy serial ecgs were not obtained on mcot patients to decrease staff exposure given the observational nature of the study members of the research team measuring the qt interval were not blinded to the patient information or course all telemetry ecg and mcot patch monitoring findings and qt interval measurements were adjudicated by a senior board-certified cardiac electrophysiologist and a cardiac electrophysiology fellow board-certified in cardiovascular disease the primary clinical outcome of the study was qt prolongation resulting in tdp secondary outcomes included qt prolongation and qt prolongation that resulted in the need to prematurely terminate chloroquine hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin as well as arrhythmogenic death as this was a prospective observational study without a specific control population only a basic statistical analysis was utilized continuous variables were reported as the meansd and categorical variables were reported as numerical values and percentages the welch t test was used to compare ecg changes during treatment with the patients baseline ecgs a multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to test the impact of monotherapy versus combination therapy and gender along with the interaction between the 2 on the outcome of change in qtc fisher exact test was used to compare the number of patients with a qtc 500 ms in the monotherapy versus combination groups the sas version 94 cary nc statistical software was used for the analysis between march 1st and march 23 there were 201 patients that were treated for covid-19 with either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine at 3 hospitals in the northwell health system a minority of these patients 10 50 received chloroquine of the 201 patients on either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine 119 592 also received azithromycin the treatment regimens for these medications were as follows chloroquine 500 mg by mouth twice daily for 1 day followed by 500 mg by mouth once daily for 4 days hydroxychloroquine 400 mg by mouth twice daily for 1 day followed by 200 mg by mouth twice daily for 4 days and azithromycin 500 mg by mouth or intravenous daily for 5 days the

ecg was performed before initiating therapy for covid-19 for all patients a majority of patients were in sinus rhythm 177 881 with baseline heart rate of 805177 beats per minute the mean qrs duration for the population at baseline was 928190 ms with 46 patients 229 having an intraventricular conduction delay incomplete or complete right bundle branch block left bundle branch block or a ventricular paced rhythm serial ecgs were used to monitor qtc intervals for 84 patients and 117 patients 582 were monitored with an mcot patch the baseline qtc for the entire cohort was 4395248 ms and 8 patients 40 had a baseline qtc 500 ms the average maximum qtc during treatment for the entire cohort was 4633426 ms and the post-treatment qtc was 4548401 ms the average increase in the qtc after the 5-day course treatment was 1933421 ms table 3 the baseline qtc intervals for the monotherapy group were 4389250 ms and for the combination therapy group was 4399247 ms p079 the maximum qtc during treatment was significantly shorter in patients treated with chloroquinehydroxychloroquine monotherapy when compared with patients treated with a combination of either of these medications and azithromycin 4533370 versus 4704450 ms p0004 table 4 additionally there were no statistically significant effects of gender p0091 or an interaction between the effects of gender and medications on the difference between the maximum qtc and the baseline qtc p093 the overall trajectory of qtc change is represented in figure 1 the number of patients with a peak qtc 500 ms was 7 86 in the monotherapy group versus 11 92 in the combination therapy group p100 figure 2 further details regarding these patients can be found in table 5 in addition to qt prolongation there were 17 instances of new-onset atrial fibrillation that were discovered either on telemetry or an mcot patch seven patients had monomorphic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and 1 patient had sustained hemodynamically stable monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in the setting of likely viral myocarditis table 6 the primary outcome of qt prolongation leading to tdp was not observed in the entire population arrhythmogenic death was also not observed in the entire cohort the secondary outcome involving the need to discontinue hydroxychloroquine due to qt prolongation occurred in 7 35 patients with average qtc of 5044395 ms details regarding these patients can be found in tables 7 and 8 the trajectory of their qtc change is represented in figure 3 a complete list of arrhythmic events and interventions is listed in table 9 following the development and implementation of the northwell flow chart to minimize tdp in covid-19 inpatients on hydroxychloroquineazithromycin lidocaine was used to facilitate continuation of hydroxychloroquine in 2 other patients4 the first patients qtc increased from baseline of 458 to 594 ms after receiving hydroxychloroquine 400 mg for 2 doses followed by 200 mg for 3 doses and 2 doses of intravenous azithromycin 500 mg the patient was given a single dose of intravenous lidocaine 100 mg which improved qtc to 479 ms azithromycin was discontinued at this time while hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily was continued for the full 5-day course of note this patient was given a dose of intravenous amiodarone 150 mg 2 days before reaching the peak qtc during a rapid response for atrial fibrillation and acute hypoxic respiratory failure that required intubation two days after finishing the course of hydroxychloroquine the qtc prolonged to 601 ms of note the patient was receiving intravenous furosemide and pantoprazole which may have contributed to the qtc prolongation the patient appropriately responded to another dose of intravenous lidocaine the subsequent qtc improved to 551 mg and normalized to 500 ms on subsequent ecgs the second patients qtc increased from 456 ms to 620 ms after receiving 1 dose of hydroxychloroquine she was given a dose of intravenous lidocaine 100 mg which improved the qtc to 550 ms this patient went on to complete the 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine with no further prolongation of qtc the main limitation of this study is the absence of a control cohort of patients with covid-19 infections that were not treated with any of these medications although this would have provided a stronger analysis nearly every hospitalized patient with covid-19 received 1 of these medications during the course of their admission during this study period the number of patients with underlying cardiac disease in the study is small potentially limiting generalizability to that population the study is subject to the same limitations as other observational studies although baseline qt interval readings on mcot were correlated to the baseline ecgs subsequent qt intervals in the mcot subset obtained while on therapy were not this fact and the difference in filtering in mcot patches versus traditional 12-lead ecg are a limitation over 4000 patients across the 17 hospitals in the northwell health system have received one or both therapies as of april 4 2020 with no reported instances of tdt this statistic although very encouraging may be subject to reporting bias lastly our cohort of 201 patients from the initial phases of this pandemic represents a small fraction of the total patients we have treated further work is needed to confirm our findings in an even larger group of patients this is the largest reported cohort to date of patients with covid-19 that were treated with chloroquinehydroxychloroquine with and without azithromycin we observed a marked increase in the qt intervals of these patients during treatment that was more pronounced in patients treated with combination therapy despite this increase very few patients had the medications discontinued prematurely due to qt prolongation most importantly there were no cases of torsade de pointes or arrhythmic death in the entire population further study of the need for qt interval monitoring is needed before final recommendations can be made we thank the clinical pharmacists rubiya kabir thien doan and

sainz-gil natalia jimeno luis martn h zoraida verde   dear editor hydroxychloroquine has in vitro activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and other coronaviruses it is currently under investigation in clinical trials for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis of sars-cov-2 infection and treatment of patients with mild moderate and severe coronavirus disease 2019 covid-191 there are no currently available data from randomized clinical trials to inform clinical guidance on the use dosing interactions or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of covid-19 infection recently gautret and cols have reported that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load reductiondisappearance in covid-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin drug interaction2 preliminary results have confirmed that viral positivity in respiratory secretions was significantly decreased at day 6 in hydroxychloroquine treated covid-19 patients versus those with supportive care supporting the current choice of hydroxychloroquine as first-line treatment2 3 despite of limited studies nowadays hydroxychloroquine is recommended for hospitalized patients confirmed covid-19 patients with mild-to moderate disease age 65 years andor underlying end organ dysfunction lung heart liver etc diabetes coronaropathy chronic obstructive pulmonary disease arterial hypertension or severe disease general guiding principles are based on these considerations however the therapeutic window is quite narrow cardiotoxicityarrhythmia requiring caution for use at higher cumulative dosages taking also into account that therapy will be required mostly in older patients andor in case of severe disease in addition the slow elimination and the variable pharmacokinetics of hydroxychloroquine frequently lead to delayed actions and a variable clinical response it is possible that this variability arises partly from drug-drug interactions ddis and genetic differences in the capacity to metabolize hydroxychloroquine as has been shown for many other drugs4
 contradictory results of the inhibitory effect of hcq on cytochrome-p450 isoenzyme 2d6 cyp2d6 activity in vivo have been published in humans generally all drugs metabolized by cyp2d6 may inhibit each others metabolism because of the great variety of drugs metabolized by cyp2d6 antiarrhythmics antihypertensives -adrenoceptor antagonists monoamine oxidase inhibitors morphine derivatives antipsychotics and antidepressants characterization of potential interacting drugs affecting the activity of this enzyme is clinically important and can improve the safety of drug treatment4 on the other hand the p-glycoprotein p-gp transport system is an efflux transporter found most notably in gut luminal and blood-brain barrier endothelial cells hydroxychloroquine is an inhibitor of this transporterpump presenting also as a possible interaction5
 keeping in mind that hydroxychloroquine use is recommended in elderly patients the number of ddis should be monitored polypharmacy prevalence in elderly people is about 50 and is associated with an increased risk of ddis which impact on patient health and effectiveness of drugs including hydroxychloroquine6 in addition combinations of hydroxychloroquine with other qt-prolonging medications can increase the risk of developing a toxic arrhythmia such as ventricular fibrillation7 8 9 10
 we have developed a retrospective analytical study about most common medical prescription in older adults and potential drug interactions with hydroxychloroquine we have analyzed chronic medication data about 377 older adults recruited between october 2016 and may 2019 in the north of spain soria for previous studies6 potential drug interactions with hydroxychloroquine were identified and classified according to information published by liverpool drug interactions group11 or drugbank database data were analyzed using relative percentage frequencies of the classes of each variable to characterize the sample studied we have checked forty-seven drugs and elaborated a table of most common drugs in the aforementioned population and should be monitored in the patients treated with hydroxychloroquine of total we have included information about twelve ddis see table 1
 following recommendations five drugs should not be coadministered with hydroxychloroquine and seven may require close monitoring rifampicin phenobarbital phenytoin and carbamazepin could reduce the exposure of hydroxychloroquine anticonvulsans carbamazepine phenytoin phenobarbital induce many cytochrome-p450 and glucuronyl transferase enzymes and can reduce drastically the serum concentration of associated drugs which are substrates of the same enzymes with the attendant risk of related adverse effects12 13 we have only found one study about hydroxychloroquine and rifampicin interactions a case report about a women who due to the drug interaction suffered from toxicoderma and causing a systemic autoimmune disease due to the drug interaction14
 on the other hand amiodarone coadministered with hydroxychloroquine could increase the effect of the antiarrhythmic medication among its adverse effects pulmonary toxicity causing interstitial pneumonitis is the most dangerous without a causal treatment option15 moreover miranda-aquino reported that the long qt syndrome was present when amiodarone and hydroxychloroquine interacted16
 seven consumed drugs in older adults could cause potential interactions with hydroxychloroquine which may require close monitoring alteration of drug dosage or timing of administration hydroxychloroquine coadministered with digoxin dabigatran nortryptiline or apixaban could increase the effect of the comedication so similar to an overdose dabigatran and apixaban are direct oral anticoagulants substrates of p-gp and inhibitors of this enzyme that may increase bleeding risk the dose of the oral anticoagulants could be reduced to compensate for the potential interaction17 ido leden and cols observed that the digoxin concentration in plasma was reduced in spite of increased administration when hydroxychloroquine was coadministered18 in addition citalopram hydroxyzine nortriptyline salmeterol may require close monitoring alteration of drug dosage or timing of administration due to their relationship with qt prolongation associated with ddis in older adults19 20
 despite of limitations the selection criteria used to classify drugs aimed to be useful in the screening process for potential ddis during prescribing hydroxychloroquine in older adults there are numerous hydroxychloroquine drug interactions that are currently known and that are potential use of these agents with other drug therapy requires consideration for patient safety elderly patients are considered to be at increased risk for a more frequent and more severe covid-19 clinical course clinicians should be especially cognizant of these potential ddis in conclusion concomitant administration of hydroxychloroquine increases the bioavailability of several drugs in older adults and could getting worse this situation medication errors are known to compromise patient safety the clinical significance of the interaction of hydroxychloroquine with several drugs and as well as the potential interactions of hydroxychloroquine with other substrates of cyp2d6 would need to be evaluated  potential use of hydroxychloroquine ivermectin and azithromycin drugs in fighting covid-19 trends scope and relevance r choudhary ak sharma   covid-19 infection has become pandemic after its first outbreak in wuhan china in 2019 this infection is caused by novel sars-cov-2 virus which is distinct from its related type sars-cov the world health organization who has termed this disease as covid-19 coronavirus disease-2019 upto 09thapril 2020 1496055 cases have been confirmed globally with 89435 deaths while 336780 people got recovered across the world the most number of infected cases were from united states 432438 confirmed cases 14808 deaths and 24125 recovery of the patients followed by spain 152446 confirmed cases 15238 deaths and 52165 recovery of the patients italy 139422 confirmed cases 17669 deaths and 26491 recovery of the patients germany 113296 confirmed cases 2349 deaths and 46300 recovery of the patients france 83080 confirmed cases 10887 deaths and 21461 recovery of the patients and china 82883 confirmed cases 3339 deaths and 77678 recovery of the patients fig 1
 latter being the first epicentre of this disease this data suggests that infection due to covid-19 is spreading exponentially in new hotspots as compared to the first epicentre wuhan where new cases are in constant decline 1 at this point of time there is an urgent need of therapeutic strategy in order to control the spread of covid-19 as a disease numerous researchers across the world are working on finding the cure and chemoprophylaxis of this disease with many of them are even putting their efforts to develop the vaccine recently some of the reports on hydroxychloroquine 2 3 4 ivermectin 5 and azithromycin 6 have shown therapeutic effects against novel coronavirus infection however it was not reported that which drug has better efficacy in comparison to other or a combination of them can give life saving results therefore the present report has been able to provide the comprehensive view of combining the knowledge of these drugs altogether in the context of current health emergency around the world the first category of drug was chloroquine and its safer derivative hydroxychloroquine which may act as a therapeutic agent against covid-19 infection earlier both have been used widely for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus chloroquine was initially used for the treatment of malaria but plasmodium falciparum substantially developed resistance against it with the subsequent development of new antimalarials this drug is now being used for the prophylaxis of malaria in 1946 by the introduction of hydroxyl group into chloroquine a derivative was produced known as hydroxychloroquine and was found to have less acute poisoning than the former one 7 both the drugs otherwise share a similar mechanism of action and structure these drugs tend to increase the ph within intracellular vacuoles and act as weak base in addition they are known to alter processes such as protein degradation by acidic hydrolases in the lysosome assembly of macromolecules in the endosomes and post translation modification of proteins in the golgi apparatus 8 over the past few decades this drug has received wider attention as a potential antiviral drug chang and his colleagues in 2014 revealed that hydroxychloroquine activates the host anti-viral innate immunity 9 this drug accumulates in the cellular organelles creating acidic environment to inhibit the replication of different viruses by interfering with endosomelysosome trafficking or viral protein maturation during virions maturation fig 2
 during the recent pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 hydroxychloroquine was found to act as a potential drug in fighting against covid-19 some of the in vitro and poorly controlled or uncontrolled clinical trials revealed that this drug has activity against severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 sarscov-2 2 3 4 in china clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine are further in-progress for the treatment and management of covid-19 disease nct04261517 and nct04307693 another study revealed that ivermectin which is a broad spectrum anti-parasitic drug demonstrated its efficacy against covid-19 which comes as a second line of drug 5 ivermectin is fda approved drug known to have wide-spectrum antiviral activity against number of viruses under in vitro conditions 10 11 12 13 sars-cov-2 causative agent of covid-19 is a single stranded rna virus positive sense which is closely related to sars coronavirus sars-cov recent study on ivermectin against sars-cov-2 under in vitro conditions revealed that it can inhibit the viral replication the single treatment of this drug was able to reduce the virus up to 5000-fold in culture within 48h however no further reduction was reported with further increase in time period ie up to 72h moreover no toxicity was seen with the drug at any point of time 5 mechanism by which ivermectin responded against the cov-19 virus is not known and was believed to be working similarly as it acted on other viruses it was known to inhibit the nuclear import of viral and host proteins integrase protein of viruses and the importin imp 1 heterodimer was responsible for in nuclear import which further increases the infection fig 2 as most of the rna viruses are dependent upon imp1 during infection ivermectin acts on it and inhibits the import with the increase in antiviral response 5 14 third category of therapeutic drug is azithromycin which is a class of antibiotics known as macrolide used to treat infections like bronchitis pneumonia and mac mycobacterium avium complex infection with the spread of the sars-cov-2 viral pneumonia which started in wuhan china many countries of the world started developing countermeasures in order to decrease the spread of the disease researchers found that apart from hydroxychloroquine another fda approved drug known as azithromycin was shown to have therapeutic effects against covid-19 in a study done by a research group at new mexico university the researchers were able to prove that azithromycin acted as an acidotropic lipophilic weak base which modulate the ph of endosomes and trans-golgi network fig 2 this further led to in vitro effects on intracellular organelles similar to the one as conferred by hydroxychloroquine 6 this further indicates that this antimicrobial drug has an immense therapeutic value as far as the treatment of covid-19 patients is concerned clinical trials need to be carried out with this drug as it can act as a prophylaxis for declining the infection rate these drugs have been shown to have a potential broad-spectrum antiviral response in vitro against many viruses including coronaviruses however hydroxychloroquine has been found to be associated with dangerous side-effects in the past if the dosage is not carefully controlled there have been many cases of chloroquine poisoning reported in nigeria and the usa as well due to sudden rapid increase in demand of the above broad-spectrum drugs may lead to significant shortage for patients who rely on these drugs to treat their other disorders like malaria rheumatoid arthritis among others therefore adequate buffer stocks should be maintained for these drugs to overcome potential scarcity of the above-mentioned drugs all three categories of drugs seem to act against novel coronavirus infection however further research using large cohort of samples with randomized controlled clinical trials are urgently required for each drug alone and in-combination in order to find a concrete solution against covid-19 infection the author has no conflict of interest to declare  clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in

coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is resulting in fatal pneumonia treatments are urgently needed to prevent hypoxaemic respiratory failure and death1 hydroxychloroquine has received worldwide attention after an in vitro study reported its potential activity against sars-cov-22 and small studies have released promising results however the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for treating covid-19 is the subject of serious debate3 one uncontrolled french study included 26 hospital inpatients who were positive for sars-cov-2 pcr polymerase chain reaction on a nasopharyngeal swab the study suggested that 600 mgday of hydroxychloroquine was associated with a decrease in sars-cov-2 shedding and when combined with azithromycin it was more efficacious4 however another uncontrolled french study found no evidence of antiviral clearance with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in 11 patients admitted to hospital5 a recent study randomised 62 patients into two parallel groups a control group and a group receiving hydroxychloroquine 400 mgday for five days the study reported a shorter time to clinical recovery in the hydroxychloroquine group6 however these patients were not severely ill the clinical endpoints were not clearly defined and there was no stratification for comorbidities known to be associated with a poor outcome6
 based on the results of these studies and the negligible cost and known safety profile of hydroxychloroquine in treating rheumatic conditions this drug has been considered to be potentially useful in treating patients with covid-19 hydroxychloroquine has attracted attention in social and mass media and has also received us food and drug administration approval for patients with severe covid-197 however fears have increased about a shortage of this essential treatment for patients with rheumatic diseases including systemic lupus erythematus8 and questions have been raised about its safety in patients with covid-19 because of the lack of unbiased data and the urgency of determining the clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine to treat covid-19 we used observational data collected in a real world setting in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 who required oxygen we evaluated the clinical effectiveness of oral hydroxychloroquine at a daily dose of 600 mg on admissions to the intensive care unit or death by any cause secondary outcomes included the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in preventing acute respiratory distress syndrome and in reducing the duration of oxygen requirement we used data collected from routine care to assess the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 and who required oxygen9 physicians screened the electronic health records of all patients with covid-19 pneumonia admitted to four french tertiary hospitals between 12 march and 31 march 2020 patients were eligible for this study if they were aged 18-80 years had pcr confirmed sars-cov-2 infection supplementary data 1 and required oxygen by mask or nasal prongs corresponding to a who progression score of 5 exclusion criteria were the presence of a contraindication to hydroxychloroquine at 600 mgday including patients receiving dialysis hydroxychloroquine treatment started before admission to hospital treatment with another experimental drug for covid-19 tocilizumab lopinavir-ritonavir or remdesivir within 48 hours after admission organ failure that required immediate admission to the intensive care unit or continuous care unit acute respiratory distress syndrome at admission defined by the need for non-invasive ventilation with provision of continuous positive airway pressure or invasive mechanical ventilation10 discharge from the intensive care unit to standard care decision to limit and stop active treatments prescribed at admission and opposition to data collection by patients or their legal representative the study was performed in accordance with the declaration of helsinki as amended and received approval by the appropriate irb which included an amendment for the extension of follow-up no 2020060 hpitaux universitaires henri-mondor ap-hp we compared two treatment strategies starting hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 600 mgday treatment group and no hydroxychloroquine treatment control group the dose was chosen after publication of the first study on hydroxychloroquine for treating covid-194 patients in the treatment group could start treatment within a grace period of 48 hours after admission the decision of whether or not to treat patients with hydroxychloroquine was based on local medical consensus and the clinicians own opinion of its effectiveness the decision was made before patients were admitted to hospital and so their characteristics played no part supplementary data 1 provides additional information about the number of patients in each group in each hospital the start of follow-up baseline or time zero for each patient was the time of admission to hospital all patients were followed up from baseline until death loss to follow-up or end of follow-up on 24 april 2020 whichever occurred first the primary outcome was survival without transfer to the intensive care unit at day 21 secondary outcomes were overall survival survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome weaning from oxygen and discharge from hospital to home or rehabilitation all at day 21 patients who received hydroxychloroquine had qt prolongation assessed by a 12 lead electrocardiogram and corrected for heart rate by bazetts or fredericias formula at the start of treatment and for three to five days after an inverse probability of treatment weighting approach was used to balance the differences in baseline variables between treatment groups11
12 a non-parsimonious multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to estimate each patients probability of receiving hydroxychloroquine given their baseline covariates that is the propensity score variables of the propensity score model were planned and prespecified before outcome analyses several variables were included age sex comorbidities presence of chronic respiratory insufficiency during oxygen treatment or asthma cystic fibrosis or any chronic respiratory disease likely to result in decompensation during a viral infection heart failure new york heart association class iii or iv chronic kidney disease liver cirrhosis with child-pugh class b or more personal history of cardiovascular disease hypertension stroke coronary artery disease or cardiac surgery insulin dependent diabetes mellitus or diabetic microangiopathy or macroangiopathy treatment with immunosuppressive drugs including anticancer chemotherapy uncontrolled hiv infection or hiv infection with cd4 cell counts 200l or a haematological malignancy body mass index 30 or not third trimester of pregnancy treatment by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers13 time since symptom onset and severity of condition at admission percentage of lung affected 50 or not presence of confusion respiratory frequency oxygen saturation without oxygen oxygen flow systolic blood pressure and c reactive protein level all variables included in the propensity score model reflected knowledge available at baseline standardised differences were examined to assess balance with a threshold of 10 designated to indicate clinically meaningful imbalance14
 crude survival rates were computed by using the kaplan-meier method cox proportional hazards models were used to compute inverse probability of treatment weighting hazard ratios inverse probability of treatment weighting estimates of the relative risk were computed for binary outcomes outcomes are presented in the total population and in the subgroup of patients with a better prognosis at admission estimated by a quick sepsis related organ failure assessment score less than 215

 our causal contrast of interest was the per protocol effect and we compared participants who received hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours of admission with those who did not receive the drug because some patients subsequently received hydroxychloroquine after 48 hours we specified two additional comparisons firstly mimicking an intention-to-treat analysis all patients eligible for the study were analysed and those who received hydroxychloroquine after 48 hours were analysed in the control group secondly mimicking an as-treated analysis patients who received hydroxychloroquine after 48 hours were analysed in the treatment group we performed sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of findings firstly we conducted a trimmed analysis that was truncated at the region of common support defined as the overlap between the range of propensity scores in the treatment group and the control group patients with propensity scores outside the region of common support were excluded from this analysis secondly to account for time dependent bias we performed an analysis in which all patients from the control group who reached the primary outcome transfer to intensive care unit or death during the grace period were randomly assigned to one of the two groups given that their observational data were compatible with both groups at the time of the event17
 missing baseline variables were handled by multiple imputation by chained equations using the other variables available all statistical analyses were performed with the r statistical package version 361 or later r foundation for statistical computing httpswwwr-projectorg neither patients nor the public were involved in the conception or conduct of the study propensity scores ranged from 009 to 095 in the treatment group and from 001 to 091 in the control group with 96 in the region of common support propensity scores 009-091 supplementary data 2 after inverse probability of treatment

admission in the treatment group compared with six patients with confusion in the control group only one patient had chronic kidney disease in the treatment group compared with eight in the control group only one patient had chronic heart failure in the treatment group compared with five in the control group and only one patient had liver cirrhosis in the treatment group compared with no patients in the control group these four variables were therefore not included in the final propensity score model supplementary data 4 median follow-up for surviving patients was 325 days three patients one in the treatment group and two in the control group 2 were lost to follow-up after being discharged in good health and without oxygen two other patients had a follow-up of only 20 days at

admission for a population of 181 and including them in the treatment group mimicking an as-treated analysis or in the control group mimicking an intention-to-treat analysis did not change the results weighted hazard ratio 10 95 confidence interval 04 to 21 and 09 05 to 19 for the primary outcome respectively supplementary data 8 and 9 of the 84 patients who received hydroxychloroquine within the first 48 hours eight 10 experienced electrocardiographic modifications that required discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine at a median of 4 days interquartile range 3-9 days after it began which is in accordance with french national guidelines among these patients seven had a corrected qt interval prolongation of more than 60 ms including one patient with corrected qt interval prolongation 500 ms one patient who received no other drugs that might have interfered with cardiac conduction presented a first degree atrioventricular block after two days of hydroxychloroquine treatment one patient in whom hydroxychloroquine was started five days after admission control group was transferred to intensive care two days later this patient was then prescribed lopinavir and ritonavir and developed left bundle branch block on day 8 none of these patients was concomitantly treated with azithromycin our study has several limitations firstly although we used robust methods and statistical techniques to draw causal inferences from observational data treatment was not randomly assigned and potential unmeasured confounders could bias our results secondly four potentially important prognostic variables could not be balanced in the propensity score model because none or only one patient in the treatment group presented with these variables accordingly caution is required in interpreting these results especially for overall mortality for which only a few events were observed nevertheless this limitation did favour the hydroxychloroquine group and the absence of any difference between treated and untreated patients further strengthens our conclusions thirdly we did not take a centre effect into account in the propensity score model because the number of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine in centres was unbalanced some centres treated all their patients whereas others did not nevertheless that the decision to treat or not treat patients with hydroxychloroquine was based on local medical consensus rather than on their characteristics should reduce this bias fourthly our sample was limited to the number of eligible patients available at the time of analysis we cannot rule out the possibility that our findings are owing to a lack of power fifthly because we included only patients admitted to hospital we cannot reach a conclusion about the possible efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in preventing covid-19 or in preventing severe forms of the disease finally our study was not designed to assess the efficacy of the association of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin and no conclusion about its efficacy can be reached further research is ongoing in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 pneumonia who require oxygen hydroxychloroquine treatment seemed to have no effect on reducing admissions to intensive care or deaths at day 21 after hospital admission additionally hydroxychloroquine treatment did not have any effect on survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome at day 21 after hospital admission these results do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine in these patients  finding the dose for hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis

 there are  100 recruiting or not yet recruiting treatment studies listed on clinicaltrialsgov as of march 29 2020 although reports have surfaced regarding the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine drugs used in malaria the efficacy for covid19 remains uncertain hydroxychloroquine has known in vitro activity against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 virus however the half maximal effective concentration ec50 for sarscov2 virus is different than for malaria with a  20fold higher in vitro ec50 of hydroxychloroquine for sarscov2 vs malaria ec50 values for sarscov2 virus in the literature have ranged from 0721731 m with higher ec50 values generally associated with higher multiplicity of infections indicative of a potential need for greater systemic exposure for the higher viral loads

 hydroxychloroquine is also proposed as a prophylactic agent in those at high risk such as healthcare workers the immunocompromised and household contacts of infected individuals oral hydroxychloroquine was authorized for emergency use by the us food and drug administration fda on march 28 2020 to treat adult and adolescent patients who weigh 50 kg or more hospitalized with covid19 for whom a clinical trial is not available or participation is not feasible httpswwwfdagovmedia136534download it was not approved for sarscov2 prevention there are no scientifically established doses for sarscov2 although pharmacometric modeling and simulation has been used by several groups to propose potential regimens

 these are targeted for hospitalized patients with advanced disease and no models have specifically evaluated regimens in the context of prophylaxis what is known about the pharmacokinetics of hydroxychloroquine comes from use in indications outside of covid19 such as malaria rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus hydroxychloroquine has linear kinetics with a very high volume of distribution and readily distributes to a number of tissues

 because of the long halflife hydroxychloroquine concentrations are sustained for days after completion of the treatment course our team recently launched a nationwide clinical trial examining the efficacy of shortcourse hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis or early preemptive treatment against covid19 nct04308668 we are also in the process of launching protocols for preexposure prophylaxis in healthcare workers and organ transplant recipients choosing the correct dose for a clinical trial needs to consider the risk of toxicities but also ensure the best chance of successful achievement of therapeutic targets hydroxychloroquine doses used for malaria have been largely adopted for covid19 treatment and prophylaxis however our team sought to reevaluate those doses evaluate new doses and generate a rational approach for dose selection using simulation models to proposed efficacy targets we simulated potential dosing regimens for preprophylaxis and postexposure prophylaxis scenarios using hydroxychloroquine population pharmacokinetic parameter estimates derived from hydroxychloroquine plasma concentrations in 91 individuals 22 healthy volunteers and 69 patients with malaria

 the r package mrgsolve was used to build the population pharmacokinetic simulation in rstudio version 125033 rstudio boston ma the median and 90th percentile of hydroxychloroquine simulated concentrations n  1000 subjects over time were calculated the percent of subjects with troughs above the sarscov2 target concentration ec50 072 m

 and median time above target were reported for the preexposure simulations weekly troughs are reported whereas for postexposure simulations daily troughs are reported because prophylaxis would be given before high viral loads are achieved we targeted the lower range ec50 of 072 m
3
 and aimed to keep at least 50 of subjects above this target for the postexposure and preemptive treatment settings we simulated exposures over 14 days to represent a typical incubation time for sarscov2
8
 we simulated the current fda approved dosing for malaria treatment 800 mg followed by 400 mg at 6 24 and 48 hours after the initial dose a total of 3 days and prophylaxis 400 mg weekly and other regimens such as those tested in recent covid19 trials ie 400 mgday for 5 days or 200 mg 3 times daily for 6 days
9
 
10
 we also tested recommended regimens against an ec50 target of 144 m to account for potential differences in vitro and plasma protein binding

 the simulated concentrationtime data for the tested regimens are shown in figure

 and the cumulative time above ec50 over the simulated drug treatment period figures s9s16 first we examined the current prophylaxis preexposure and treatment postexposure doses for malaria simulations of onceweekly dosing predicted that only 3 of subjects would have troughs above the target per week once steadystate is reached table 

1
 for the fda recommended treatment dose of malaria 800 mg loading dose followed by 400 mg daily for a total of 3 days simulations predicted 89 of subjects would have troughs above the target on day 1 however this number dropped to 7 by day 14 postexposure after the start of prophylaxis table

 we next simulated modified dosing scenarios and found for preexposure prophylaxis that an 800 mg loading dose followed by a 400 mg dose given 2 or 3 times weekly maintains weekly troughs above ec50 in 4975 of the subjects table

ac after reaching steadystate in the postexposure setting simulations indicated that an 800 mg loading dose followed in 6 hours with 600 mg daily for at least 5 days maintains daily troughs above the ec50 in 50 or more of the subjects for at least 2 weeks the presumed viral incubation time table

 we also examined the treatment regimens tested in recently published reports 400 mgday for 5 days vs 200 mg 3 times a day for 6 days and found that only the latter regimen maintained daily troughs above target in  50 of subjects table 

1
 when ec50 of 144 m was targeted for the prophylactic setting twice and 3 times weekly dosing underperformed higher or more frequent dosing may be required table 

s1
 for postexposure regimens 5 days of 600 mg daily dosing  50 of patients were above target for 8 days daily dosing for 7 days would be required to maintain prophylaxis for almost 14 days in the absence of validated therapeutic concentration targets for covid19 prevention or treatment these simulations are meant to guide researchers in doseselection for covid19 studies our aim was to optimize exposures above the in vitro generated ec50
3
 it is important to note that in vitro to in vivo extrapolations could either underestimate or overestimate actual drug requirements however they are a reasonable starting point in the absence of other data notably therapeutic effect may be maintained even longer as preclinical models have demonstrated up to 30fold accumulation of hydroxychloroquine in lung tissue
12

 similar to what has been proposed for treatment by other groups

5
 our simulations suggest higher treatment and prophylactic doses for covid19 may be needed than those recommended for malaria this is consistent with the  20fold lower in vitro ec50 for malaria compared with sarscov2
13
 unlike with malaria where dosing is recommended to start 2 weeks before travel to an endemic area prevention for covid19 requires more rapid attainment of therapeutic concentrations thus supporting the rationale for a loading dose in the preexposure prophylaxis setting although in general hydroxychloroquine is a welltolerated drug increasing the dose may come with untoward effects that should be carefully monitored hydroxychloroquine systemic severe adverse effects include retinaltoxicity and cardiotoxicity however these toxicities are mostly associated with daily andor longterm use we chose to simulate total plasma concentrations as the in vitro generated ec50 was not proteinadjusted yet it was performed in the presence of protein
3
 previous studies have shown that in vitro protein binding can occur in the presence of added protein but may not be equal to plasma proteinbinding that may be observed clinically in humans
14
 therefore we also evaluated our regimens against 144 m ec50 which would assume no in vitro protein binding ie most extreme scenario and found that higher dosing would likely be required in the preexposure setting whereas the postexposure regimen performed reasonably although target concentrations were not maintained as long if higher ec50 targets are required dosing may exceed the therapeutic index although this is largely unknown for hydroxychloroquine in the context of covid19 notably for many infections eg malaria influenza and pneumocystis pneumonia dosing for prophylaxis are substantially lower than those used for treatment but yet are highly effective as of march 29 2020 two peerreviewed studies are available that examined the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of covid19 each testing a different dose and each reaching different conclusions

10
 first a clinical study from france tested 200 mg 3 times daily hydroxychloroquine for 6 days and reported a promising antiviral effect with polymerase chain reactionnegative nasopharyngeal swabs in 14 of 20 patients by day 6 compared with 2 of 16 controls
10
 however the authors noted that an additional six subjects on hydroxychloroquine were removed from analysis because they did not complete therapy five of whom were still polymerase chain reactionpositive at the time of dropout this modest success is consistent with our model simulations in contrast a study performed in china tested 5 days of 400 mgday and observed no difference between treatment and control groups with 13 of 15 vs 14 of 15 achieving viral negative swabs by day 7
9
 our simulations have shown that 5 days of 400 mg without a loading dose was not sufficient to maintain daily troughs above the ec50 in 50 of the subjects for 14 days furthermore patients with active covid19 disease may require a different efficacy target due to higher viral loads these simulations used pharmacokinetic data obtained from healthy volunteers and patients with malaria so caution should be taken in extrapolating to other populations especially those who may have organ dysfunction such as critically ill patients with covid19 or recent transplant recipients these data need

immune-mediated inflammatory diseases are a population with particular features that includes frequent use of biologic agents other immunomodulatory drugs or both this fact could increase the

tao zhou qin huang aichun chu zachary braunstein xiaoquan rao cong ye lingli dong   the pathogen causing covid-19 was identified as a novel coronavirus by sequencing of lower respiratory tract samples from affected patients this novel coronavirus shares 796 sequence identity with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov1 and has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 since its detection in december 2019 the virus spread rapidly to more than 200 countries and territories around the world and was declared a pandemic on march 11 2020 there is currently no specific treatment available for covid-19 although comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiac disease have been identified as risk factors for severe covid-192 whether patients with autoimmune rheumatic disease have an increased vulnerability to this infection remains unknown autoimmune rheumatic diseases are characterised by irregular functioning of the immune system and immune-mediated inflammation in target tissues patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases rely on immunosuppressive disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs dmards to control symptoms and disease progression and are therefore immunocompromised and more susceptible to infections than the general population3 however several dmards including hydroxychloroquine and baricitinib are being investigated for their antiviral effects in covid-19 and might affect the susceptibility of patients with rheumatic diseases to sars-cov-2 infection4 5
 the immune system has an important role in the defence against viruses and virus-associated tissue damage most patients with sars-cov-2 infection will completely recover as a result of effective immune responses thevarajan and colleagues6 noted that circulating concentrations of antibody-secreting cells and activated follicular helper t cells two important immune cell populations responsible for antiviral immunity were increased before symptomatic recovery of a patient with covid-19 and concurrent with the clearance of sars-cov-2 recent studies have also shown that antibodies against sars-cov-2 could be generated efficiently after recovery of covid-19 and might provide protection against covid-19 through convalescent plasma transfusion7 8 these results suggest that an antiviral immune response is crucial for viral clearance however hyperactivation of the immune response in covid-19 might also cause tissue damage in the lungs and other organs2 9 therefore several immunomodulating drugs including corticosteroids hydroxychloroquine and anti-cytokine agents are being used for the treatment of severe cases of covid-195 in the ongoing covid-19 pandemic there is an urgent need for timely research to assess the susceptibility of patients with rheumatic disease to sars-cov-2 infection and the potential risks and benefits of using anti-rheumatic drugs in covid-19 treatment 
research in context
evidence before this study
we searched pubmed sciencedirect and google scholar on march 15 2020 for studies reporting susceptibility to covid-19 in patients with rheumatic disease using the search terms covid-19 susceptibility or coronavirus disease susceptibility or novel coronavirus susceptibility and rheumatic disease or rheumatic condition we identified no published research articles reporting on the susceptibility to covid-19 in patients with rheumatic disease we also searched for studies assessing the effects of anti-rheumatic medications on covid-19 in patients with rheumatic disease using the search terms covid-19 or coronavirus disease or novel coronavirus and rheumatic disease or rheumatic condition and anti-rheumatic medication we did not identify any research articles assessing the potential effect of anti-rheumatic medications on covid-19 in these patients
added value of this study
to the best of our knowledge this is the first study based on a primary dataset of cases and close contacts to analyse the susceptibility of patients with autoimmune rheumatic disease to covid-19 patients with autoimmune rheumatic disease had a higher rate of covid-19 than their family members living in the same household during the outbreak 63 vs 34 this finding provides some insight into the risk of covid-19 in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases
implications of all the available evidence
our results indicate that patients with rheumatic disease might be more susceptible to covid-19 than the general population these findings can be valuable for strategic planning and management of patients with rheumatic disease during the ongoing covid-19 pandemic
 analyses of comorbidities in patients with covid-19 suggest that diabetes respiratory disease and cardiovascular disease might be risk factors for covid-1910 however the susceptibility to covid-19 among patients with low-prevalence disorders such as rheumatic diseases is difficult to assess in the general population we aimed to investigate susceptibility to covid-19 in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases in hubei province china we did a multicentre retrospective observational study of patients with rheumatic disease in hubei province the epicentre of the covid-19 outbreak in china the study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of tongji hospital tongji medical college of huazhong university of science and technology and was registered with chictrorg chictr2000031504 we did a telephone-based survey of patients with rheumatic disease to investigate their susceptibility to covid-19 the inclusion criteria were as follows a confirmed diagnosis of rheumatic disease including rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus sle sjgrens syndrome polymyositis or dermatomyositis igg4-related disease or undifferentiated connective tissue disease and a disease duration of at least 3 months the following patients were excluded from the study patients who were diagnosed with rheumatic diseases that do not require an immunosuppressive therapy such as gout osteoarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis in china most patients with ankylosing spondylitis are treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and a relatively small proportion about 10 in this study used immunosuppressive agents such as tumour necrosis factor tnf inhibitors patients with invalid contact information or who did not answer the telephone after three consecutive calls at an interval of 1 per day and patients who declined participation or discontinued before completion of the survey patient demographic information including age sex telephone number medical history and data on current medication use were retrieved from the smart system of disease management ssdm information about covid-19 exposure or diagnosis in patients and their families was collected by an automated telephone survey the answers were converted into text in a spreadsheet by an automatic speech recognition programme azure microsoft the following information was acquired through a subsequent telephone call carried out by medical professionals total number of family members residing at the same address during the outbreak infection status of covid-19 date of covid-19 diagnosis severity laboratory tests of sars-cov-2 rna hospital admission status admitted to hospital or self-quarantined after outpatient diagnosis past medical history and age and sex of infected individuals the use of current anti-rheumatic medications was also confirmed with patients during the survey to ensure the records in the medical system were accurate covid-19 cases among patients with rheumatic disease and their household members were identified by self-reporting of inpatient diagnosis or outpatient diagnosis in local designated hospitals through telephone surveys families with at least one household member diagnosed with covid-19 between dec 20 2019 and march 20 2020 were identified and all members of the household were considered to have direct covid-19 exposure history all patients with rheumatic disease and their family members without rheumatic disease residing at the same physical address during the outbreak were considered close contacts and tested for sars-cov-2 rna in designated local hospitals when there was a confirmed case in the family individuals who were diagnosed with covid-19 either self-isolated or were admitted to hospital after the diagnosis diagnosis of covid-19 was determined according to the guidance for coronavirus disease 2019 5th edition released by the national health commission of china either confirmed by a positive sars-cov-2 rna test or by clinical diagnosis close contact history plus covid-19 symptoms plus typical high-resolution ct imaging features of covid-19 all real-time pcr tests of sars-cov-2 rna were done in designated local hospitals for covid-19 for patients and their family members the incidence of covid-19 was calculated as the total number of infected individuals divided by the number of individuals with covid-19 exposure history all statistical analyses were done with graphpad prism version 830 graphpad software or spss version 25 ibm spss statistics descriptive and frequency statistics mean sd and percentages were used to describe baseline demographic information and clinical information age sex smoking history and comorbidities previously reported to be associated with covid-19 mortality2 10

method with ten imputations for each missing data value binary logistic regression analyses were done with spss version 25 to analyse the effect of rheumatic disease demographic factors or anti-rheumatic medications on covid-19 infection in individuals with exposure history conditional logistic regression was used to adjust for multiple potential confounders including the cluster effect of family when assessing the potential effect of rheumatic disease on covid-19 infection for this study patients with rheumatic disease and their family members were clustered at the family level

record system after exclusion of 5354 patients who were not receiving immunosuppressive therapy 10 343 patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases were contacted by telephone figure
 among these 10 343 patients 1215 had an invalid telephone number or did not answer the telephone resulting in a pick-up rate of 883 9128 of 10 343 2900 patients who declined participation or discontinued the study before completion of the survey were also excluded therefore we analysed data from 6228 patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases the characteristics of included and excluded patients are summarised in the appendix p 1 the mean age of patients was 459 sd 144 years and there were more female than male patients 5417 870 of 6228 vs 811 130 of 6228 the disease distribution and details of anti-rheumatic medications in these patients are summarised in table 1

covid-19 were on hydroxychloroquine medication there were no significant differences in age sex comorbidities and prescriptions for other immunosuppressive drugs between patients taking hydroxychloroquine and those who did not take hydroxychloroquine appendix p 4 however patients with sle tended to be prescribed hydroxychloroquine more often than patients with other rheumatic diseases therefore sle was included as a confounder when assessing the potential effects of anti-rheumatic medications on covid-19 nine 56 of 16 patients without covid-19 and with autoimmune rheumatic disease were taking hydroxychloroquine whereas seven 26 of 27 patients with rheumatic disease and covid-19 were on hydroxychloroquine treatment after adjustment for age sex smoking infection in family members comorbidities and sle patients with rheumatic disease taking hydroxychloroquine had a lower risk of covid-19 than those who were taking other dmards or 009 95 ci 001094 p0044 by contrast the

from 5 mg per day to 15 mg per day converted to dose of prednisone appendix p 5 we observed no significant differences in age sex smoking history comorbidities and the use of other dmards the risk of covid-19 in patients with rheumatic disease remains unclear4 although patients with rheumatic disease on certain medications are immunocompromised and vulnerable to infection several anti-rheumatic medications have been proposed to have an antiviral effect nevertheless data about the epidemiological characteristics of covid-19 in patients with rheumatic disease are scarce our study provides some insight into covid-19 susceptibility in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases rely on dmards to control autoimmune processes and disease progression because of their dysregulated immune function and the immunosuppressive effect of dmards patients on these medications have increased vulnerability to infections autoimmune rheumatic diseases are frequently complicated by primary immunodeficiency13 therefore an autoimmune disease itself can result in immunosuppression and increased risk of infection additionally the use of dmards is associated with increased risk of infection14 a recent analysis of clinical features of covid-19 in 21 patients with rheumatic diseases showed that patients with rheumatic diseases might be at an increased risk of developing respiratory failure if they develop covid-1915 some dmards such as hydroxychloroquine and baricitinib have been proposed to have antiviral effects in patients with sars-cov-2 infection biological dmards such as interleukin il-6 and il-1 inhibitors have also been suggested for treatment of covid-19 in a subset of patients with hyperinflammation16 a study from italy reported four cases of confirmed covid-19 and four highly suggestive cases of covid-19 in which all eight patients were taking biological or targeted synthetic dmards for rheumatoid arthritis or spondyloarthritis17 none of these patients developed severe respiratory complications and the authors suggested that these treatments might suppress the aberrant inflammatory and cytokine response that is responsible for severe respiratory complications in covid-1917 anakinra a biological dmard that blocks il-1 signalling has also shown beneficial effects in reducing covid-19 mortality and invasive mechanical ventilation rates in patients with hyperinflammation although clinical trials are required to confirm efficacy18 19 in an analysis of data from the covid-19 global rheumatology alliance physician-reported registry the use of tnf inhibitors in patients with rheumatic diseases was associated with reduced risk of hospital admission for covid-1920 therefore the overall effect of dmards on covid-19 infection might be complex in this study we evaluated the overall susceptibility to covid-19 in patients with rheumatic disease and the potential effects of some dmards on covid-19 we identified 27 patients with covid-19 from 6228 patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases the overall covid-19 infection rate of 043 in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases in hubei province was higher than the calculated overall infection rate of 012 in hubei province as of march 20 2020 67 800 covid-19 cases out of hubeis population of 58 500 00021 we identified another 16 families in which household members without rheumatic diseases had covid-19 together there were 42 families 43 patients with rheumatic diseases and 83 family or household members without in which at least one household member had covid-19 to assess the susceptibility to covid-19 in patients with rheumatic diseases we compared infection rates in patients with autoimmune rheumatic disease with infection rates in household members without rheumatic disease consistent with our previous analysis further analysis of families with covid-19 exposure history indicated that the rate of infection was higher in patients with rheumatic diseases than in their family members these results indicate that patients with rheumatic disease might be more vulnerable to covid-19 than the general population a large proportion potentially as high as 862 of covid-19 cases worldwide have been reported to be asymptomatic and might not have been identified without extensive contact tracing and testing22 and the incubation periods for most covid-19 cases in china were less than 14 days23 although all family members within the same household as a confirmed case were tested for sars-cov-2 rna in this study the identification of the first case in the family might have largely depended on the manifestation of covid-19 symptoms especially during the early stages of the outbreak therefore the overall infection rate calculated in this study might be an underestimate considering the number of unidentifiable asymptomatic cases future population-wide epidemiological studies with serology tests are needed to address this issue we also found that the risk of sars-cov-2 infection increases with age which is consistent with recent publications24 based on these findings patients with rheumatic diseases should take all necessary precautions to protect themselves from covid-19 and reduce the risk of sars-cov-2 infection chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were originally used as oral antimalarial medicines and are now widely used to treat rheumatic disease because of their mild immunosuppressive effects recent studies have shown that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could suppress sars-cov-2 replication in vitro at a concentration that is clinically achievable25 26 current investigations into the role of hydroxychloroquine in covid-19 are inconclusive although some reports suggest an improvement in symptoms27 28 after the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine other studies have reported no benefits29 30 31 or even hazardous or toxic effects32 therefore further randomised controlled trials are required to assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine in patients with covid-19 in contrast to trials done to assess the therapeutic effect of hydroxychloroquine in the general population27 28 29 30 31 32 only a small number of reports have evaluated the preventive effects of chronically administered hydroxychloroquine on covid-19 in patients with rheumatic diseases with inconclusive outcomes33 in the present study we retrospectively analysed the association between the use of hydroxychloroquine and covid-19 in patients with rheumatic disease we found that the rate of symptomatic covid-19 was lower in patients taking hydroxychloroquine than in patients taking other dmards notably however the benefits of hydroxychloroquine were observed in comparison with other immunosuppressive medications in patients with rheumatic diseases and so these findings are not generalisable to patients who do not require immunosuppression as reported in this study patients with rheumatic diseases were at increased risk of developing covid-19 which might be partially caused by immunosuppressants therefore the overall effects of hydroxychloroquine in the general population require further investigation due to the hyperactive status of immune activation in severe cases of viral infection corticosteroids have been used in many patients with coronavirus infections including severe acute respiratory syndrome middle east respiratory syndrome mers and covid-19 to control immune-mediated damage of lung tissue2 9 34 however the use of corticosteroids in such cases is controversial because of their rapid immunosuppressive effects which might affect the antiviral activity of the immune system arabi and colleagues34 retrospectively analysed 309 critically ill patients with mers and concluded that corticosteroid therapy did not improve 90-day mortality but instead delayed the clearance of viral rna in our study we did not observe a significant effect of corticosteroids on covid-19 this study has some limitations first because of the small number of patients with rheumatic disease who were not on medication we were not able to identify whether the vulnerability to covid-19 was associated with rheumatic disease or anti-rheumatic medications second the number of patients with exposure to hydroxychloroquine was small and the lower covid-19 incidence observed in comparison with patients taking other immunosuppressive medications should be interpreted with caution third since this is a retrospective observational study potential biases are inevitable for example some patients with rheumatic disease and covid-19 might have been unable to answer the telephone some of them might have already died of covid-19 or their health conditions might have limited their ability to participate in the study additionally a higher proportion of patients included in the study were on dmard treatment than those who were excluded 59 vs 43 and a lower proportion of patients included in the study had rheumatoid arthritis 44 vs 52 appendix p 1 future randomised controlled trials might provide better insight into these differences the fourth limitation was in relation to sars-cov-2 rna tests many factors such as specimen collection and the limit of detection for sars-cov-2 rna pcr tests can cause false-negative results and thus might potentially affect overall infection rates last the sample size of patients with rheumatic disease and with covid-19 was relatively small we did not apply propensity score weighting approaches because of the small sample size future investigations in larger studies are needed to gather more evidence in summary our data suggest that patients with rheumatic disease might be more susceptible to covid-19 than the general population access to de-identified data or related documents can be requested through submission of a proposal with a valuable research question necessary data protection

song siyan zhan roujian lu haiyan li wenjie tan dongyang liu xueting yao baoyin huang  main point hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine at inhibiting sars-cov-2 in vitro hydroxychloroquine sulfate 400 mg given twice daily for 1 day followed by 200 mg twice daily for 4 more days is recommended to treat sars-cov-2 infection abstract background the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 first broke out in wuhan china and subsequently spread worldwide chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating sars-cov-2 infection hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions we propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill sars-cov-2 infected patients currently there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in sars-cov-2 infection methods the pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using sars-cov-2 infected vero cells physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models pbpk were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data using the pbpk models hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drugs safety profile results hydroxychloroquine ec50072 m was found to be more potent than chloroquine ec50547 m in vitro based on pbpk models results a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for sars-cov-2 infection as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine to 4  25 inhibit sars-cov-2 in vitro  chloroquine is a widely used anti-malarial with immunomodulatory effects 1 2 3 4 5  in a recent in vitro study chloroquine was found to inhibit the growth of sars-cov-2 in vitro 6  this finding has been supported by clinical studies conducted in approximately one-hundred sars-cov-2 infected patients 7 8  hydroxychloroquine is an analog of chloroquine that has fewer concerns about drug-drug interactions in the previous sars outbreak hydroxychloroquine was reported to have anti-sars-cov activity in vitro 9  this suggests that hydroxychloroquine may be a potential pharmacological agent for the treatment of covid-19 infection however to date there is no clinical evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for sars-cov-2 infection the molecular mechanism of action of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine has not been fully elucidated findings from previous studies have suggested that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may inhibit the coronavirus through a series of steps firstly the drugs can change the ph at the surface of the cell membrane and thus inhibit the fusion of the virus to the cell membrane it can also inhibit nucleic acid replication 6  25 glycosylation of viral proteins virus assembly new virus particle transport virus release and other processes to achieve its antiviral effects 10  a reliable estimation of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine concentrations in the lung the target tissue may be used for guiding dose recommendations physiologically-based pharmacokinetic pbpk models are a mathematical modelling technique that can predict drug concentrations in human tissues in silico by integrating physiological and drug disposition parameters pbpk models are widely used in drug development to help identify whether a clinical trial is warranted as well as help guide the use of drugs based on predictions from well-validated models 11 12  in this study we aimed to i investigate the antiviral and prophylactic activity of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in vitro ii build a pbpk model for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine using data from literature and iii predict drug concentrations under different dosing regimens using the developed pbpk models chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate were purchased from beijing innochem science  technology co ltd the lyophilized powder was diluted in double distilled water to 10 mm hydroxychloroquine sulfate was readily soluble in water chloroquine phosphate was dissolved by shaking the solution at room temperature for 2 hours the chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine solutions were 7  25 filtered through a 022 m membrane and were then stored at 80c the clinically isolated sars-cov-2 virus strain c-tan-ncov wuhan strain 01 was propagated in vero cells the vero cells were derived from the african green monkey kidney and were grown in dulbeccos modified eagle medium dmem sigma aldrich boston ma usa supplemented with 5 fetal bovine serum logan ut usa the cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5 co2 at 37c the culture medium was replaced each day the anti-sars-cov-2 activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was investigated in vitro cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 110 4 cellswell and were grown for 24 hours the in vitro experiment was divided into two sections named i the treatment study and ii the prophylactic study drug pretreatment study vero cells were pretreated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for 2 hours and then were removed from the drug-containing 8  25 medium the virus-containing medium was then added to the infected vero cells as described for the treatment study for 2 hours following this the virus-containing medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium that did not contain drugs or viruses the supernatant was collected and the rna was extracted and analyzed by relative quantification using rt-pcr methods described in a previously published study 13 14  all experiments were conducted in triplicates the relative expression was estimated using the 2 - ct method a sigmoidal concentration-response function ybottom  top-bottom 110logec50-xhillslope was fit to the data using nonlinear regression the 9  25 ec50 values were calculated using prism graphpad software san diego ca usa the pbpk models for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were developed using simcyp simulator version 18 the chloroquine compound file was provided by simcyp limited a certara company blades enterprise centre sheffield uk and the hydroxychloroquine compound file was self-built physical and chemical parameters were obtained from the literature 15  pharmacokinetic parameters such as liver intrinsic clearance fa and ka were determined from clinical data 16  these data are summarized in supplement 1 the lung to blood concentration ratio for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine obtained from animal studies was used to predict the drug concentration in the lungs 17 18  published chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine clinical trial data were used to validate the developed pbpk models details summarized in supplement 2 16 19 20 21 22 23  data obtained from the literature in graphical form were extracted using plot digitizer version 226 getdata pharmacokinetic parameters that could not be sourced from the literature were estimated using extracted data in phoenix version 86 certara company concentration-time profiles were simulated under different published clinical trial 10  25 protocols using the developed pbpk models for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine 16 19 20 21 22 23  the simcyp healthy volunteer chinese healthy volunteer and pediatric virtual populations were used in the simulations as the clinical trials were conducted in caucasian chinese and children populations respectively simulated exposure data was compared to observed data the criterion to determine model accuracy was based on whether the observed data fell within the 90 confidence interval of the predicted values the ratio of predicted pharmacokinetic pk parameters eg cmax and auc to observed values was used to evaluate model performance the predicted values were considered reasonable if the ratio of predicted to observed data was within a 2-fold range 05ratio20 the exposure of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the lungs plasma and blood were simulated under different dosing regimens shown in table 1  using the validated pbpk models a correction factor for chloroquine base and hydroxychloroquine base was input into the model simulations chloroquine phosphate 500 mg is equivalent to 300 mg of chloroquine base and 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine sulfate is equivalent to 155 mg of hydroxychloroquine base the chinese healthy volunteers virtual population provided in simcyp was used for the simulations all simulations were performed with 10 trials and 10 subjects per trial virtual subjects were aged between 20 to 50 years of age and 50 of the subjects were male and 50 female the pbpk models were used to predict the lung tissue concentrations of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine under different dosing regimens  table 1  the lung trough concentration on days 1 3 5 and 10 were adjusted by the plasma unbound fraction fuplasma to obtain the free lung trough concentration the ratio of the free lung trough concentration to the in vitro ec50 values rltec was calculated and the results tabulated in a recent clinical trial 500 mg of chloroquine phosphate given twice daily was shown to be effective on study day 5 rltec day5 this dosing regimen for chloroquine was used as the target for dose optimization for hydroxychloroquine ie the rltec of hydroxychloroquine should not be lower than the rltec day5 of chloroquine at any time results from the in vitro study showed that both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have good antiviral activity chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were found to decrease the viral replication in a concentration-dependent manner the ec50 values for chloroquine were 2390 and 547 m at 24 and 48 hours respectively figure 1a  ec50 values for hydroxychloroquine were 614 and 072 m at 24 and 48 hours respectively figure 1b  hydroxychloroquine exhibited a superior in vitro antiviral effect in comparison to 12  25 chloroquine when drug was added prior to the viral challenge the ec50 values for chloroquine were 100 and 1801 m at 24 and 48 hours respectively ec50 values for hydroxychloroquine were 625 and 585 m at 24 and 48 hours respectively it was noted that with longer incubation times the ec50 values for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine tended to decrease the inhibitory effect of chloroquine was poor this was particularly evident at 24 hours whereby even at the highest concentration of chloroquine used in the study the inhibition rate did not exceed 50 figure 1c and 1d the predicted and observed plasmablood concentration time profiles for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is shown in figure 2  intravenous data was used to understand the distribution and elimination phase of the two drugs and oral administration data was used to understand the intracorporal absorption process most of the observed data fell within the 90 prediction interval the ratio of predicted to observed pk parameters cmax and auc were within the range of 05 to 20 details summarized in supplement 2 indicating that the prediction accuracy of the developed pbpk models was acceptable and could be used to simulate the different dosing scenarios the simulated lung blood and plasma concentration time profiles for chloroquine and 13  25 hydroxychloroquine under the different dosing regimens is shown in figure 3  it can be seen that the lung blood and plasma concentrations of chloroquine increased slowly after the first dose was given and was yet to reach steady state on day 10 the simulated chloroquine concentration in lung tissue was much higher than in plasma where the lung to plasma ratio increased with time and reached a ratio of approximately 400 the projected lung blood and plasma concentrations of hydroxychloroquine rapidly increased and reached steady state following the initial loading dose and subsequent maintenance doses figure 3b to 3f the free lung trough concentrations were also projected from the simulations the ratio of free lung trough concentration to ec50 rltec under the different dosing regimens is shown in table 1  the rltec values of hydroxychloroquine were found to be higher than the rltec values of chloroquine on days 1 3 5 and 10 this suggests that hydroxychloroquine may achieve ideal clinical efficacy under the simulated dosing regimens the rltec on day 1 was notably higher for hydroxychloroquine than for chloroquine this is likely to be due to the loading dose of hydroxychloroquine given thus enabling a faster clinical effect there was no significant difference between the once and twice daily maintenance dosing regimens regimen c and d respectively when 14  25 used from day 2 to day 10 hence the once daily dosing regimen may be preferred to improve patient compliance despite regimen f being a 5 day treatment regimen the lung trough concentrations were still above the target concentration on day 10 however if the treatment duration of regimen f was extended to 10 days ie regimen e it resulted in a higher drug concentration on day 10 overall regimen f may be the best regimen whilst considering both efficacy safety and patient compliance in this study hydroxychloroquine exhibited better in vitro anti-sars-cov-2 activity than chloroquine this was demonstrated by the ec50 values for hydroxychloroquine always being smaller than the ec50 values for chloroquine indicating that hydroxychloroquine has a more potent antiviral activity shown in figure 1  in the study by wang et al 6  chloroquine was shown to have an inhibitory effect on sars-cov-2 with an ec50 value of 113 m after a 48 hour incubation time these findings are comparable with our in vitro chloroquine results of an ec50 value of 547 m in addition an unpublished clinical trial has demonstrated the therapeutic effect of chloroquine in sars-cov-2 infected patients on the basis of hydroxychloroquines superior antiviral and prophylactic activity as well as its more tolerable safety profile in comparison to chloroquine we believe that hydroxychloroquine may be a promising drug for the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection 24  in our study we noted that the ec50 values for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine decreased with longer incubation times this suggests that incubation time may influence the drugs antiviral activity both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been reported to accumulate in cells 25  it is possible that a longer incubation time may provide more time for the drug to accumulate to higher intracellular concentrations and ultimately exhibit a better antiviral effect 26  another possible explanation is that the drug-induced cytotoxicity may take time to develop and hence the drug effect may increase with time 27  the pbpk model for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine was validated with in vivo pk data from humans rats and mice the model was able to reasonably predict drug concentrations in human lung tissue a permeability rate limiting model was implemented in the pbpk model to mimic the characteristics of both drugs in addition a high lung to plasma partition coefficient ratio kp ratio was used to imitate the drugs high accumulation in lung tissue the kp ratio for humans was assumed to be same as the ratio for rats because there was no human data available this assumption may be reasonable as the transportation of both drugs is completely via passive diffusion ie no transporters are involved in some patients it has been reported that their immune response to the sars-cov-2 virus results in the increase of cytokines il-6 and il-10 13 28  this may progress to a cytokine storm followed by multi-organ failure and potentially death both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have immunomodulatory effects and can 16  25 suppress the increase of immune factors 29 30  bearing this in mind it is possible that early treatment with either of the drugs may help prevent the progression of the disease to a critical life-threatening state in critically ill sars-cov-2 infected patients the use of corticosteroids may be harmful 31  whilst the use of immunosuppressants eg tocilizumab are not ideal either as it can suppress the immune system and lead to an increased risk of infection 32  in this setting hydroxychloroquine may be an ideal drug to treat sars-cov-2 infection as it can inhibit the virus via its antiviral effects and help mediate the cytokine storm via its immunomodulatory effects based on work conducted in our lab we recommend the concomitant use of low dose hydroxychloroquine with an anti-inflammatory drug to help mitigate the cytokine storm in critically ill sars-cov-2 patients several clinical trials are currently investigating the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat sars-cov-2 infection however it is worth noting that the dosing regimens used in these trials are mainly based on previous clinical experience raising the concern that adverse effects may occur in study participants supplement 3 in this study an optimized dosing regimen was designed for hydroxychloroquine to have a high loading dose and low maintenance dose based on its unique pharmacokinetics ie high accumulation in cells and long elimination half-life using pbpk modelling and simulation techniques the optimal dosing regimen for hydroxychloroquine was evaluated in in silico the simulation results demonstrated that regimen f was able to achieve treatment efficacy as well as have a good safety profile even considering 17  25 possible underestimation of drug efficacy to some extent however future clinical trials evaluating this regimen are required before it can be readily used in the clinic the combination of the in vitro antiviral activity data and predicted drug concentrations in this study are being used to support the design of dosing regimens used in a future clinical trial figure 1  the antiviral activities of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for treatment or prophylactic treatment against sars-cov-2 in vitro the antiviral activities of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for therapeutic and prophylactic use were tested on the vero cells infected with sars-cov-2 clinically isolate strain a and b for treatment group chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were added medium after the vero cells infected and cells were incubated with medium contained drugs for 24 or 48 hours c and d for prophylactic treatment group the vero cells were pre-treated with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for 2 hours and then viruses were added to medium to infect cells after that the medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium without drugs or viruses and cells were incubated for 24 or 48 hours the viral yield in the cell supernatant was quantified by rt-pcr   review on the global epidemiological situation and the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of covid-19 s saqrane ma el mhammedi   in mid-december 2019 in the city of wuhan in central china an epidemic of coronavirus was declared it is caused by a new type of coronavirus first named 2019-ncov then renamed sars-cov-2 never observed before its appearance in this metropolis of 11 million inhabitants chinese health officials officially announced the discovery on 7th january 2020 on 30th january the world health organization who declared a public health emergency of international concern on february 11 who gave a name to the disease caused by this new coronavirus covid-19 on 11th march who upgraded the epidemic to a pandemic the first triggered by a coronavirus 12 on this subject which worries the whole world several questions can arise on the coronavirus itself the world epidemiological situation and the effectiveness of using chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment answers to these questions will be found throughout this review covid-19 disease which appeared in china in late 2019 is caused by sars-cov-2 a virus that belongs to the great coronavirus very frequent they can cause a simple cold as well as a serious respiratory infection such as pneumonia causing fatal epidemics as it was the case with sras or mers and now with covid-19 for coronavirus disease 1 covid-19 is the infectious disease caused by the last coronavirus that was discovered this new virus and this disease were unknown before the outbreak appeared in wuhan china in december 2019 1 coronaviruses which owe their name to the crown shape of the proteins that coat them are part of a large family of viruses some of which infect different animals others humans they are likely to cause a wide range of diseases for humans these diseases begin with a simple cold to a severe lung infection responsible for acute respiratory distress 1 according to who after an epidemic outbreak in china in january-february the epidemic situation has changed globally since 23rd february 2020 with the intensification of outbreaks in south korea japan and singapore and the appearance of new outbreaks in iran and italy in these countries we are witnessing community dissemination with no identified link with cases imported from china two months after its appearance in china the epidemic seems to have peaked there in march 2020 the chinese authorities announced that the number of new cases was declining sharply in the country however all the countries of the european union are now affected by covid-19 1 especially italy spain and france on 16th march 2020 the who counted almost as many cases in china as outside of china 165 515 confirmed cases worldwide including 81 077 in china and 86 438 outside china in 143 different countries and 3218 deaths in china and 3388 outside china 3 who has therefore called these countries to act for contain the coronavirus which has killed more than 45 525 people and more than 896 450 cases of infection worldwide according to data reported by the authorities on 2 april 2020 3 the who regional director for europe said the number of cases is expected to increase further he urged countries to continue implementing a containment strategy while accelerating their efforts to fight the disease it is essential to act quickly and every day can make a difference 4 indeed on 31st march 2020 italy became at the top of the world ranking of deaths due to covid-19 followed by spain but is just behind the united states in terms of cases tested positive for the virus according to the newspaper the world in africa the sub-saharan countries remain until 28th march still little affected by the covid-19 in comparison with europe even if the number of cases increases rapidly indeed the african countries multiply the measures much more precociously than europe 5 in the maghreb the states take early measures going from the simple prudence to the closing of the borders and confinement 5 indeed the situation on the scale reported by who 02 april 2020 is shown in table 1 and fig 1 fig 2 3 the center of disease control cdc in a public document on its website published on 21st march 2020 informed that there are no us food and drug administration fda-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of patients with covid-19 at present clinical management includes infection prevention and control measures and supportive care including supplementary oxygen and mechanical ventilator support when indicated an array of drugs approved for other indications as well as several investigational drugs are being studied in several hundred clinical trials that are underway across the globe 6 very recent studies have tested and shown the effectiveness and use of two drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of covid-19 disease according to the us centers for disease control and prevention hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are oral prescription drugs that have been used for treatment of malaria and certain inflammatory conditions chloroquine has been used for malaria treatment and chemoprophylaxis and hydroxychloroquine is used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus and porphyria cutanea tarda who includes it on its list of essential medicines meaning it should be kept affordable and accessible at all times both drugs have in-vitro activity against sars-cov sars-cov-2 and other coronaviruses with hydroxychloroquine having relatively higher potency against sars-cov-2 7 8 9 studies revealed that it has potential broad-spectrum antiviral activities by increasing endosomal ph required for viruscell fusion as well as interfering with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of sars-cov 610 according to colson et al 2020 the activity of hydroxychloroquine on viruses is probably the same as that of chloroquine since the mechanism of action of these two molecules is identical and hydroxychloroquine was prescribed for long periods which would be therefore the first choice in the treatment of sars-cov-2 for optimal treatment it may be necessary to administer a loading dose followed by a maintenance dose 8 in systematic review appeared on line at march 2020 11 it was reported that a study published online 04th february 2020 was carried out by a chinese group on the effect of chloroquine in vitro using vero e6 cells infected with sars-cov-2 has a multiplicity of infection moi of 005 the study demonstrated that chloroquine was very effective in reducing viral replication with an effective concentration ec 90 of 690 m which can be easily achievable with standard dosage thanks to its favorable penetration in tissues including in the lungs 7 the authors described that chloroquine is known to block viral infection by increasing endosomal ph and by interfering with the glycosylation of the sarscov cellular receptor the authors also speculated on the possibility that the known immunomodulating effect of the drug could improve the antiviral effect in vivo 7 the article published online on 19th february draws its results from a clinical trial conducted in more than ten chinese hospitals in wuhan - epicenter of the epidemic - beijing and shanghai in particular to measure the effectiveness of chloroquine on treatment of pneumonia associated with covid-19 13 in this study it was confirmed that the anti-viral and anti-inflammatory activities of chloroquine may account for its potent efficacy in treating patients with covid-19 pneumonia according to chinese researchers a treatment of 500 mg of chloroquine per day for ten days would be sufficient according to chinese researchers a treatment of 500 mg of chloroquine per day for ten days would be sufficient chinese researchers point out that the results obtained so far on more than 100 patients have shown that chloroquine phosphate was more effective than the treatment received by the comparative group to contain the development of pneumonia to improve the condition of the lungs to make the patient negative for the virus again and to shorten the duration of the illness 13 however the brief study does not quantify this difference in effectiveness based on the results of this chinese clinical study the director of the mediterranean infection institute in 3eille 3eille center of expertise on infectious diseases assured tuesday 25th february 2020 to france-press agency fpa that an ordinary treatment with chloroquine a drug commonly used against malaria has shown signs of efficacy against the coronavirus he considers that the use of chloroquine is a preferred route according to him rather than the search for a vaccine which could not be available anyway for long months while opinions diverge and critics on the effectiveness of its treatment with chloroquine to treat patients with coronavirus a second study was published on-line on 27th march 2020 by the team of researchers from 3eille on 80 patients aged 18 and 88 and suffering from coronavirus 14 the objective of this study is to defend chloroquine and to prove the effectiveness of the protocol adopted and the relevance of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin according to this study 14 only one person 86 years old who received this treatment has died and another is still in serious condition the remaining 78 patients experienced clinical improvement in their medical condition and left intensive care after five days the majority 6580 813 of the patients had favorable results and were discharged only 15 required oxygen therapy 14 according to the newspaper capital critics of the study were however formulated by other scientists their main critic is that the study does not include a control group in order to make a comparison 15 the mediterranean infection institute in 3eille published on the same day on 27th march 2020 a new article demonstrated that the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has a synergistic effect in vitro on sars-cov-2 at concentrations compatible with that obtained in human lung 16 tested in china and partially in france and the united states chloroquine an antimalarial substance is carefully administered in switzerland as a treatment against the covid-19 pandemic the clinical effect is encouraging since the severity of the disease has decreased in the sample of patients subjected to the pilot experiment this treatment can be administered to patients who suffer from severe forms of covid-19 but should not be used for less severe forms warns public health france france which has long procrastinated on the use of chloroquine has just authorized its use on tuesday 245th march 2020 with very restricted conditions the united states has also approved the use of chloroquine which has shown very encouraging preliminary results 17 in morocco the technical and scientific committee of the ministry of health decided to prescribe chloroquine for all patients and not only severe cases with treatment dosage monitoring and control procedures to be carried out from 23rd march 2020 18 despite efforts in clinical trials to assess the efficacy of drugs previously used in other diseases for the treatment of covid-19 however given the current serious global

 91 92 93 one of the examples of successful application of drug discovery approaches is drug repurposing of the traditional anti-malarial drugs aminoquinolines namely chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine fig 3
 both are synthetic anti-malarial drugs with rapid absorption chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are water soluble the latter is more soluble due to presence of hydroxyl group and possesses plasma half-life of 900 h and 1300 h respectively 94 during chronic treatment the drugs gets accumulated in tissues 95 the selected anti-malarial drugs have been used for last 70 years they are economic have proven safety profile and are categorized as essential medicines by world health organization who 96 aminoquinolines have effectively reduced viral replication in zika virus chikungunya virus sars-associated coronavirus cov and mers-cov 97 98 99 100 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine has shown inhibition of sars-cov-2 replication 101 clinical trials have demonstrated the effective role of chloroquine phosphate dose 500 mgday against covid-19 102 the n-hydroxyethyl substituted derivative of chloroquine hydroxychloroquine is less toxic more soluble and has similar activity towards covid-19 inhibition there is continuous requirement to explore the molecular mechanism towards underlying antiviral action and clinical benefits of aminoquinolines and the toxicity profile the detailed outcomes will help to design the randomized clinical trials 95103 104 105 106 107 the present manuscript provides a systematic review of mechanism of action efficacy and safety of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of covid-19 for viral replication a stable acidic ph of endosomes lysosomes golgi complex of host is required the bioaccumulation properties of both the selected aimnoquinolines explain the antiviral mechanism of their action 108 chloroquine increases the ph of intracellular vacuoles in lysosomes it alters the catalysis of the protein degradation pathways through acidic hydrolases it also alters endosomal macromolecule synthesis and in golgi apparatus it affects post-translational modifications the antirheumatic response is produced by interfering with the antigen processing in macrophages and antigen-presenting cells 109 the mechanism involved for antiviral action is similar it decreases the ph and interferes with the viral fusion process in coronavirus chloroquine binds to the cellular receptors and changes the glycosylation 110 chloroquine possesses selective and reversible immunomodulatory effect through its action on human cd4 t-cells which is mediated by inhibition of jnk catalytic activity 109 hydroxychloroquine exerts similar mechanism of antiviral action and some of the key features are  i increase the ph ii modulation of activated immune cells iii downregulation of expression of toll-like receptors tlr iv downregulation of tlr-mediated signal transduction v decreased production of interleukin-6 vi reduces the formation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other mediators to control inflammation 105110111 the recent literature review helps to propose the possible mechanism of action of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine through three ways ie immunomodulatory effect zinc ionophore effect and binding with sialic acid 112 113 114 the three mechanisms are illustrated in fig 4
 when compared for pharmacological profile chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine possess equivalent anti-malarial activity the latter is preferred due to lower ocular toxicity 115 theoretically the antiviral activity for chloroqunie and hydroxychloroquine are similar but the reported clinical details for chloroquine are more in number 116 use of chloroquine is less due to some associated adverse effects and lack of availability in some countries in patients with covid-19 infection hydroxychloroquine is preferred as chloroquine when used in combination with lopinavir or ritonavir shows prolongation of the qt interval some of the other antiviral therapeutics that does not interfere with hydroxychloroquine is oseltamivir lopinavirritonavir robavirin interferons and immunoglobulins intravenous 117 the toxicological properties reported with use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are retinopathy neuromyopathy and cardiomyopathy both these drugs possess affinity for melanin and affect the macular cones the phagocytic activity of lysosomes is declined on the photoreceptors and they migrate towards central and peripheral regions as well as induces epithelial atrophy and irreversible alterations in photoreceptors 106 in the lysosomes hydroxychloroquine is protonated and accumulated due to its basic nature it inhibits the activity of lysosomal phospholipases causing vacuolization of cardiac and skeletal muscle cells 118 prolong use of hydroxychloroquine produces  i toxicity to retina tissue which may lead to irreversible retinopathy 119120 ii cardiotoxicity and cns toxicity with neuromyopathy symptoms and alterations in gastrointestinal tract 121 toxicity to liver cells genetic material 122 and genotoxicity 123124 studies have shown substantial increase in retinal toxicity with chronic treatment based on the hypothesis of bioaccumulation 125 some investigators report 2 incidences of retinopathy and more common in asian patients 126127 some studies failed to report cardiac complications and neuromyopathy and may be rare after long-term treatment 128129 the monitoring of side effects need to be continued even after discontinuation of treatment due to prolong half-life of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine the side effects keratopathy maculopathy may be delayed the current anti-covid-19 therapeutic regimen suggests longer duration of treatment with chloroquine than that as anti-malarial drug thus close monitoring of the adverse reactions pharmacological effects poisoning and toxicological mechanisms to provide help to the worldwide clinical work 110 consideration of clinical outcomes is essential to be monitored to design safe and effective protocol with prevention of toxicological effects for therapeutic use of the antiviral aminoquinolines chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine who has published a generic protocol to conduct randomized clinical trials for investigating the clinical role and safety of therapeutics for the treatment of covid-19 infection 130 as on 14 april 2020 approximately 961 clinical trials which are carrying on worldwide have been reported to who the essential ethical requirement is use of chloroquine in covid-19 patients with ethical trial approval or off-label timely availability of the clinical outputs to the biomedical fraternity is important considering the evolving outbreak and growing number of coivd-19 infected patients with availability of any specific licensed drug the use of chloroquine in the treatment of coivd-19 infection is considered by who as experimental in this regard use of chloroquine is associated with various concerns such as patient safety close monitoring of drug use etc the repurposing of the anti-malarial drugs need to follow ethical approaches and may raise concern about shortage of such drugs the outcomes of some of the reported in vivo in vitro and clinical studies carried globally have been documented here one by one approximately 100 clinical trials are in recruiting or pending approval and are ongoing at single or multiples centers with satisfactory primary outcomes but final outcomesresults are pending these are summarized in

section suggests administration of chloroquine 500 mg twice a day or hydroxychloroquine 200 mg per day for 10 days 5 to 20 days treatment depending on clinical severity 133another guideline as documented by the dutch center of disease control cdc recommended use of chloroquine to treat severe infections with requirement of oxygen therapy and optimal supportive care 134 the recommended dose for chloroquine base is 600 mg followed by 300 mg after 12 h on day 1 and 300 mg twice a day for 25 days and discontinuation of the treatment at day 5 to reduce the side effects 30 h half-life of chloroquine 500 mg of chloroquine phosphate  300 mg of chloroquine basein china more than two dozen clinical trials have been carried out for evaluating efficacy various anti-viral drugs in different disease severity to investigate dose and duration of treatment the studies have been coordinated by the chinese authorities through a prescribed regulating guideline 135 these trials are the first to report the characteristics and management of covid-19 infected patients but no details on use of chloroquine 136 137 138 139 140
 for therapeutic use of aminoquinolines chloroquine and hydroxychoroquine the important aspects are  i it will be administered to millions of infected patients with covid-19 ii it will be administered to medical workers as preventive measure iii during acute approach against covid-19 higher dose will be administered as compared to use during the treatment of chronic rheumatic diseases 141 following points can be concluded and to be considered during the use of aminoquinolines chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of covid-19 infection ihistory of previous or ongoing use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in malaria amebiasis rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupusiihigher risk of development of retinopathy in asian patientsiiiperiodical monitoring of patients with vision problems cardiovascular problemsivto measure central and peripheral visual acuityvdrug interaction with kaolin clay and antacids reduces antiviral and anti-inflammatory actionviregular monitoring for symptoms like ocular pruritus and cardiac arrhythmiasviiaminoquinolines decreases activity of immunosupressants and antibioticsviiiother aminoquinoline analog mefloquine is associated with increased risk of convulsionixthe toxicity is associated with the dose calculated by real weight and therefore dose should be suitable for patients with potential high risk of adverse effects cumulative dose 203 mgkg body weightday is under high risk category 142

 a less toxic aminoquinoline has an n-hydroxyethyl side chain in place of the n-diethyl group of chloroquine this modification makes hydroxychloroquine more soluble than chloroquine similar to chloroquine hydroxychloroquine increases the ph and confers antiviral effects in addition hydroxychloroquine has a modulating effect on activated immune cells downregulates the expression of toll-like receptors tlrs and tlr-mediated signal transduction and decreases the production of interleukin-6 6 although the antimalarial activity of hydroxychloroquine is equivalent to that of chloroquine hydroxychloroquine is preferred over chloroquine owing to its lower ocular toxicity 7 retinopathy is a dose-limiting adverse effect of hydroxychloroquine and a safe daily dose appears to correspond to 65 mgkg of ideal body weight and 50 mgkg of actual body weight 8 although there are more clinical data on the anti-coronaviral activity of chloroquine than that of hydroxychloroquine both of these agents are theoretically similar in their antiviral activity 9 moreover chloroquine is not as widely available as hydroxychloroquine in some countries in addition chloroquine is associated with greater adverse effects than hydroxychloroquine for example in patients with covid-19 chloroquine can interact with lopinavirritonavir resulting in prolongation of the qt interval hence it is necessary to consider hydroxychloroquine instead of chloroquine when the latter is not available for treating patients with covid-19 for example in iran there is a serious shortage of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can be recommended instead other therapeutic agents for covid-19 such as antiviral agents oseltamivir lopinavirritonavir ribavirin etc interferons and intravenous immunoglobulins that do not interfere with hydroxychloroquine are currently under investigation  urgent guidance for navigating and circumventing the qtc-prolonging and torsadogenic potential of possible pharmacotherapies for coronavirus disease 19 covid-19 john giudicessi r peter noseworthy a paul friedman a michael ackerman j   chloroquine and its analogue hydroxychloroquine have been used for nearly 80 years as prophylactic pharmacotherapies for malaria although still used as antimalarial agents in parts of the world with chloroquine-sensitive plasmodium falciparum protozoa hydroxychloroquine has found new life as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug for the management of conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis at the cellular level these antimalarial drugs accumulate in intracellular vesicles such as endosomes and lysosomes where they are protonated leading to increased vesicular ph7 this process in turn inhibits the activity of the ph-dependent proteases involved in the intracellular processing of secretory proteins with a number of immunologic and nonimmunologic effects including tumor necrosis factor  and interleukin 67 collectively a reduction in these secretory proteins is believed to result in 1 the accumulation of cytotoxic heme that poisons p falciparum protozoa and 2 modulation of immune cell behavior in a manner that attenuates inflammatory processes7
 in addition chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine possess antiviral properties in vitro3

8 both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are believed to act on the entry and postentry stages of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and sars-cov-2 infection likely via effects on endosomal ph and the resulting underglycosylation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors that are required for viral entry3

 based on this in vitro data it has been hypothesized that hydroxychloroquine more so than chloroquine may have therapeutic efficacy in the covid-19 pandemic by 1 preventing sars-cov-2 infection by inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme 2mediated viral entry ie preinfection prophylaxis and 2 attenuating the postviral cytokine storm observed in severe covid-19 cases via a multitude of immunomodulatory mechanisms ie treatment of active infectionpostviral sequelae promising in vitro data3

4 as well as anecdotal in vivo evidence of therapeutic benefit5 have led many institutions including mayo clinic to consider the use of hydroxychloroquine as a first-line covid-19 pharmacotherapy for the time being and spurred an array of clinical trials designed to assess the efficacy of repurposed hydroxychloroquine in both the prevention and treatment of covid-19 although the collective safety profiles of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are relatively favorable both drugs block the kcnh2-encoded hergkv111 potassium channel and potentially can prolong the qtc in at-risk individuals these so-called herg blockers can precipitate di-tdp or worse di-scd especially with long-term use table 1
 as a result the number of di-scds attributable to hydroxychloroquine in particular is not trivial table 1 with the theoretical possibility that a substantial proportion of the world population could receive hydroxychloroquine as first-line prophylaxis or treatment including an estimated 3 million individuals with congenital long qt syndrome lqts the number of hydroxychloroquine-mediated di-scds could increase precipitously unless appropriate qtc monitoring algorithms are instituted this risk of di-scd could be further amplified if multiple medications each with their own qtc-prolongingtorsadogenic potential ie chloroquinehydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin andor lopinavirritonavir are used in combination table 1 although some might argue that di-scds in the setting of widespread chloroquinehydroxychloroquine use represents acceptable friendly fire in the war on sars-cov-2covid-19 we believe that with the institution of a few simple and safe precautions the risk of di-tdp and di-scd can be mitigated ultimately it comes down to identifying the small subset of individuals who either secondary to an underlying genetic predisposition such as congenital lqts which is present in 1 in 2000 people andor by virtue of the presence of multiple modifiable and nonmodifiable qtc risk factors table 2
17 have excessive baseline qtc prolongation qtc 500 ms andor have an inherent tendency for development of an exaggerated qtc response ie qtc 60 ms following exposure to medications with the adverse effect of potential qtc prolongation figure 1
 although the percentage of individuals at risk is small given the pandemic nature of covid-19 in absolute terms the number of individuals potentially at risk for lethal adverse drug effects is large at least 4000 individuals of the 400000 covid-19positive patients worldwide are expected to be at increased risk for di-tdpdi-scd if treated with these medications this issue would be especially true if these medications are adopted for postexposure prophylaxis traditionally the qtc is calculated from either lead ii or v5 of the 12-lead electrocardiogram ecg and corrected for heart rate using the bazett or fridericia formula before any intraindividual or interindividual qtc comparisons are made unfortunately in the context of the covid-19 pandemic acquisition of the patients qtc by the 12-lead ecg which requires additional personnel exposure ie ecg technician and a necessity for serial ecgs which requires exposure of complex equipment multiple ecg wires could further strain the already limited supply of personal protective equipment ppe in many countries alternatively some fda-approved consumer mobile ecg devices are capable of generating accurate qtc measurements19 to this end alivecor inc just received emergency clearance from the fda for use of the kardiamobile 6l device fda-approved for atrial fibrillation detection for qtc monitoring of patients with covid-19 treated with qt-prolonging medications such as chloroquinehydroxychloroquine march 20 2020 115 pm cst similarly many telemetry systems are equipped with real-time qtc monitoring features that could be used for hospitalized patients for patients with covid-19 about to be treated with medications with the increased potential for di-tdpdi-scd figure 1 baseline qtc status should be obtained either by a traditional 12-lead ecg or perhaps preferably with the use of a smartphone-enabled mobile qtc meter using the simple infection control measures outlined in figure 2
to limit personnel exposures and conserve critical ppe on average the qtc values for otherwise healthy postpubertal males and females are around 410 ms and 420 ms respectively in contrast a qtc value that exceeds the 99th percentile value for otherwise healthy individuals ie 460 ms in both sexes before puberty 470 ms in postpubertal males and 480 ms in postpubertal females in the absence of any exogenous qtc-aggravating factors may signal an individual at increased risk for qt-related ventricular arrhythmias20

21 in contrast and as a frame of reference the average qtc value was 470 ms for the more than 1400 patients with congenital lqts who have been cared for in mayo clinics windland smith rice genetic heart rhythm clinic furthermore with very few exceptions amiodarone being one patients with a resting qtc of 500 ms or more whether secondary to congenital lqts or acquired qtc-prolonging drugs qtc-prolonging electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia or qtc-prolonging disease states as detailed in table 2 have a considerably greater risk for both di-tdp and di-scd22 23 24
 accordingly the baseline qtc value can be used to roughly approximate the patients risk of di-tdpdi-scd following initiation of a medication with qtc-prolonging potential for patients with qtc values less than the 99th percentile for agesex ie 460 ms in prepubertal malesfemales 470 ms in postpubertal males and 480 ms in postpubertal females figure 1 green light status the risk of di-tdpdi-lqts is low and chloroquinehydroxychloroquine or other qtc-prolonging covid-19 pharmacotherapies should be initiated without delay as outlined in the qtc monitoring algorithm remember whether by 12-lead ecg telemetry or smartphone-enabled acquisition of the ecg if the noted qt interval is less than one-half the preceding rr interval then the calculated qtc will always be less than 460 ms and the patient can be green light go for covid-19 treatments that may have qtc-prolonging potential in contrast those patients with a baseline qtc of 500 ms or greater are at increased risk for di-tdpdi-scd figure 1 red light status and every effort should be made to 1 assess and correct for contributing electrolyte abnormalities hypocalcemia hypokalemia andor hypomagnesemia 2 review and discontinue other unnecessary qtc-prolonging medications if present or transition to alternatives with less qtc liability andor 3 proceed with closer monitoring telemetry or even consideration of more advanced countermeasures such as equipping the patient with a wearable defibrillator eg lifevest zoll medical corporation if the decision is made to commence therapy in the setting of a qtc value of 500 ms or greater navigating and circumventing this qtc liability depends greatly on the risk-benefit calculus and the decision rests with the treating clinician and patient for example in younger patients with covid-19 ie 40 years who have only mild symptoms and a qtc of 500 ms or greater it may be reasonable to avoid treatment altogether because the arrhythmia risk may outweigh the risk of development of covid-19related acute respiratory distress syndrome however in patients with a qtc of 500 ms or greater presenting with progressively worsening respiratory symptoms or at greater risk ie 65 years of age immunosuppressed andor high-risk comorbid conditions for respiratory complications the potential benefit of qtc-prolonging covid-19 pharmacotherapies may exceed the arrhythmia risk therefore the ultimate goal of qtc surveillance in the covid-19 pandemic should not be to identify those who cannot receive these medications but to identify those with compromised or reduced repolarization reserve in whom increased qtc countermeasures can and should be taken to mitigate the risk of drug-related death from di-tdpdi-scd25
 ultimately much of the risk-benefit calculus awaits determination of the therapeutic efficacy of hydroxychloroquine with or without concomitant azithromycin until such information is available if the decision has been made to treat a patient with a red light designation figure 1 based on their baseline qtc of 500 ms or greater it seems prudent to start with hydroxychloroquine alone rather than combination drug therapy with azithromycin in addition if combination drug therapy with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was initiated in a patient with an initial green lightyellow light qtc status and the individual transitions to red light status after self-identification as a qtc reactor with a qtc of 60 ms or greater then consideration should be given to discontinuing azithromycin optimizing electrolyte status or intensifying countermeasures further placing on telemetry for continuous rhythm assessment ideally following a baseline qtc assessment therapy may be initiated with either qtc reassurance low risk for the vast majority 90 of patients or varying qtc countermeasures in place for those flagged as at increased risk the timing of on-therapy qtc surveillance will be dictated not only by the pharmacokinetics of the covid-19 therapies used but also by the practical logistics of an institutions method of qtc monitoring for the 12-lead ecg approach if qtc surveillance is deemed important then one machine should be designated for acquisition of the data and a limited number of ecg technicianspersonnel should be used to minimize ppe utilization and personnel exposure also the number of on-therapy qtc assessments should be constrained to minimize personnel exposure risk and ppe consumption in this scenario for those placed in red light status because their baseline qtc is 500 ms or greater an initial on-therapy qtc should be obtained around 2 to 4 hours after the first dose and then again at 48 hours and 96 hours following treatment initiation patients receiving either green light or yellow light status can probably forego the early qtc assessment and wait until 48 hours and 96 hours for their on-drug qtc determination if the on-therapy qtc is 500 ms or greater or the patient self-identified as a qtc reactor with a qtc of 60 ms or greater then the qtc countermeasures need to be reexamined or the medications stopped in an effort to neutralize the increased potential for di-tdp and di-scd figure 1 in contrast for medical centers able to implement the fda emergency-approved smartphone-enabled approach figure 2 or to determine the qtc from the telemetry strips ecg technician exposure risk and consumption of ppe by those individuals would be eliminated and the patients qtc could be obtained by the health care team already present for example with the qtc obtained per shift as another vital sign26 such increased qtc surveillance would enable discovery of the qtc reactor and implementation of countermeasures sooner and hopefully would thereby circumvent the potentially preventable tragedy of di-scd figure 1 finally for patients with a wide qrs complex from either ventricular pacing or rightleft bundle branch block a wide qrs complex qtc adjustment will need to be made otherwise patients will receive a red light signal inappropriately resulting in therapy delay discontinuation or avoidance altogether in this setting the simplest approach is to maintain the previously indicated qtc green yellow and red light thresholds and apply a simple formula to account for the wide qrs complex wide qrs complexadjusted qtc  qtc  qrs  100 ms for example if a patients left bundle branch block has yielded a qrs complex of 200 ms and a qtc of 520 ms this scenario would appear to activate the red light pathway figure 1 however the wide qrs complexadjusted qtc would be 520 ms  200  100 ms  520  100  420 ms which is not red light status at all but rather green light go status with much qtc reassurance that the patient is at low risk for di-scd as this coronavirus pandemic continues to spread and wreak havoc economic loss and more importantly the tragic deaths of thousands throughout the world we must all do our part in this war on covid-19 washing hands and physical distancing are core components of containment efforts to flatten the curve development of a coronavirus vaccine is progressing at unprecedented speed but is still at least 12 to 18 months away in the meantime there is hope that a long-ago discovered antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine may have lifesaving therapeutic efficacy against covid-19 and if it does we hope that this simple qtc surveillance strategy enabled by innovation and the fdas emergency approval will help prevent altogether or at least substantially reduce the number of drug-induced ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac deaths particularly if there is widespread adoption and utilization of these medications for covid-19

matthew pullen f radha rajasingham emily mcdonald g todd lee c ilan schwartz s lauren kelly e sylvain lother a oriol mitj emili letang mahsa abassi david boulware r   chloroquine was first synthesized in 1934 and has been prescribed extensively for the prevention and treatment of malaria as well as the treatment of autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus 4 5 hydroxychloroquine was later introduced in 1955 and quickly became favored due to its superior safety profile 4 the mechanism of action of these drugs against plasmodium parasites is believed to be partly related to its interaction with dna and through inhibition of the polymerization of heme 6 7 the immunomodulatory activity of hydroxychloroquine is related to a broad spectrum of immunoregulation networks discussed extensively in other work 5 8 9 in addition to activity against rheumatic diseases the two antimalarial agents have also shown therapeutic activity or immune modulatory effects in a wide range of other diseases including antiphospholipid syndrome amebiasis hivaids and some cancers 1013 these medicines are manufactured in tablet form for oral administration as chloroquine phosphate 500 mg equivalent to 300 mg chloroquine base and hydroxychloroquine sulfate 200 mg equivalent to 155 mg hydroxychloroquine base active drug per tablet respectively dosage varies by treatment indication table 1 and supplemental table 1 4 6 7 1419 doses as high as 2000 mg hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been used for the acute treatment of malaria both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are notable for their long terminal and elimination half-lives of 22 and 2060 days respectively 6 20 in the urine hydroxychloroquine has been detectable up to three months from time of last dose 6 hydroxychloroquine has been shown to reach peak plasma concentration within three-four hours 6 whereas chloroquine can reach its peak plasma concentration in half an hour 20 the most common adverse events of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are gastrointestinal upset along with nausea vomiting and diarrhea 1416 in a study evaluating the use of chloroquine nearly 24 of patients reported nauseaabdominal cramps and 17 diarrhea as side effects 17 up to 50 of patients receiving hydroxychloroquine report some gastrointestinal effect this appears to be dose-dependent and most often occurs with loading doses of 800 mg or higher 21 retinopathy is one of the most frequently observed severe and irreversible side effect associated with high-dose 5 mgkg and long-term use 5 years 19 chloroquine has a higher risk of retinopathy than hydroxychloroquine 22 however this is not a concern with short term dosing 23 the most severe and life-threatening complications from use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine include qtc prolongation and the resultant risk of ventricular arrhythmias 4 the incidence of qtc prolongation in this setting of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine use is largely unknown as it is highly dependent on baseline ekg findings with risk exacerbated by the use of concomitant qtc-prolonging medications in a study of healthy participants 600 mg chloroquine was associated with an average qtc increase of 16ms 95 ci 9-23ms while 1500 mg chloroquine was associated with a 28ms increase 95 ci 18-38ms with the most significant qtc prolongation four hours after the second dose 24 studies related hydroxychloroquine and qtc prolongation are largely limited to case reports of chronic use 25 26 ekg monitoring is not part of standard practice for malaria treatment nor for rheumatology use when used as monotherapy significant drug interactions with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine that should be avoided or require additional monitoring include digoxin antiepileptics antacids cyclosporine amiodarone azithromycin moxifloxacin insulin and antidiabetic agents tamoxifen and praziquantel 2728 the combination of azithromycin with hydroxychloroquine frequently prolongs the qtc interval in a clinically significant manner increasing over time in an 84 patient consecutive cohort 18 of patients qtc increased by 4060 ms and 12 increased by 60 ms with 11 overall having qtc 500 ms 29 other adverse effects from acute use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine include but are not limited to hypoglycemia in diabetic patients neurotoxicity in the form of tinnitus headaches and changes in mood and hemolytic anemia in those with g6pd deficiency 6 27 the mechanism of action of hydroxychloroquinechloroquine against sars-cov-2 has yet to be fully elucidated chloroquine was first studied in sars-cov 30 which was responsible for the 20022003 sars coronavirus epidemic sars-cov shares 79 genetic sequence similarity to sars-cov-2 but is thought to result in more severe infection with a case fatality rate of 10 vs 3 for sars-cov-2 31 32 based on studies initially performed on sars-cov it is believed that sars-cov-2 enters cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace-2 receptor and that chloroquine may prevent the virus from binding to this receptor by inhibiting terminal glycosylation 30 new research has proposed that hydroxychloroquine may additionally prevent sars-cov-2 from binding with gangliosides which in turn may inhibit virion contact with the ace-2 receptor 33 both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine additionally can incorporate into endosomes and lysosomes resulting in an increased ph of intracellular compartments these organelles normally require an acidic environment for homeostasis ultimately this increase in ph results in their dysfunction leading to defective protein degradation endocytosis and exocytosis needed for viral infection replication and propagation 34 prior work has also demonstrated that coronaviruses can use proteins on the surface of endosomes and endolysosomes for viral entry into host cells 35 entry into the endolysosome may be necessary for the viral genome to be released into the cytoplasm of infected host cells 36 however it remains unclear how changes in the endosomal environment particularly changes in ph may affect the integrity of the sars-cov-2 viral genome overall hydroxychloroquinechloroquine are capable of affecting several cellular pathways and therefore may have several mechanisms of action against sars-cov-2 prior to the 2019 sars-cov-2 pandemic in vitro studies investigated the ability of chloroquine to inhibit sars-cov viral replication in these studies researchers discovered that by pretreating cells with chloroquine at a concentration of 10m chloroquine inhibited sars-cov viral replication as determined by indirect immunofluorescence 30 when tested as a potential post-exposure treatment the 50 maximal effective dose ed50 of chloroquine was determined to be 44  1m 30 another study demonstrated that a chloroquine concentration of 88  12m could inhibit viral replication by 50 though the exact infectious viral dose used in this study was unclear 37 in 2006 biot et al demonstrated that chloroquine was more potent than hydroxychloroquine in vitro at inhibiting sars-cov replication in a vero cell model ec50 65  32m vs 34  5m respectively 38 since the current 2019 outbreak researchers have built upon this knowledge to assess whether or not chloroquine may inhibit sars-cov-2 earlier this march yao et al published results of an antiviral assay using sars-cov-2 infected vero cell lines in contrast to the above findings with sars-cov hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent against sars-cov-2 39 this experiment demonstrated that hydroxychloroquine was more effective at impairing viral replication compared to chloroquine when given post-infection with a 48-hour ec50 of 072m and 547m for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine respectively 39 moreover hydroxychloroquine was more effective than chloroquine at impairing sars-cov-2 viral replication when given prophylactically the 48-hour ec50 for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine were 585m and 1801m respectively 39 additional work focused solely on chloroquine denoted similar in vitro antiviral findings 40 41 to identify a potential drug regimen for use in humans physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling was employed by yao et al to consider drug administration route physiological parameters ie intestinal absorption and lung tissue penetration and drug biochemical properties the publication reported simulated lung fluid concentrations but did not provide all the details used in the model 39 the most promising regimen for the treatment of covid-19 based on this modeling was an initial dose of 400 mg hydroxychloroquine twice daily and a maintenance dose of 200 mg twice daily for four days 39 a 95 confidence interval for the estimate of the ec50 was not provided and thus this dosing regimen should be interpreted with caution as it may be an inaccurate estimate using a similar antiviral assay at four different multiplicities of infection as previously described liu et al demonstrated that chloroquine was more potent than hydroxychloroquine at impairing viral replication at all multiplicities of infection tested however the effect was only statistically significant at multiplicities of infection of 001 and 02 42 to assess sars-cov-2 specific virion entry into the endosome lysosome degradation pathway liu et al used a colocalization immunofluorescence assay they determined that cells treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine had significantly more virion localized to the early endosomes and fewer localized to endolysosomes when compared to untreated viral infected cells 42 together these findings suggest that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are effective at impairing sars-cov-2 replication in vitro as of april 6 2020 the published evidence of the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for the prevention and treatment of covid-19 in humans is limited to five small studies and one subjective report table 2 4348 in early march chen et al published the results of the first hydroxychloroquine study in patients with covid-19 43 in this small 30-person inpatient randomized controlled trial comparing hydroxychloroquine to the standard of care researchers found no statistically significant differences in time to viral clearance by day seven between those who received hydroxychloroquine 87 clearance versus those who did not 93 p  05 they also did not identify any difference in clinical outcomes ie duration of fever changes in lung imaging while they did not comment on the severity of illness of those enrolled those in the hydroxychloroquine and control arms had symptoms for approximately seven and six days respectively at two weeks all patients had negative viral nucleic acid tests on march 16 2020 gao et al extracted data from 100 patients with confirmed covid-19 from ongoing inpatient studies in china and reported patient improvement with the use of chloroquine 48 the authors claimed that chloroquine was superior to standard of care treatment in helping reduce time to clinical recovery and improving lung imaging findings however no data supporting these findings were published and no clinical information including the severity of illness and outcomes nor statistical analyses were presented in this brief report 48 on march 20 2020 gautret et al reported results from a non-randomized open-label study in france with absent blinding assessing hydroxychloroquine compared to standard of care treatment garnering much attention 44 twenty-six hospitalized patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine 600 mg for ten days six of whom received azithromycin 500 mg followed by 250 mg for a total of five days sixteen patients who did not meet study inclusion criteria served as study controls at the time of enrollment nearly 17 of all patients were asymptomatic 61 had upper respiratory symptoms and 22 had pneumonia or bronchitis-like symptoms in unadjusted analyses the authors found significantly reduced viral titers in those who received hydroxychloroquine at day six compared to those who did not 70 vs 125 p  001 however six participants in the hydroxychloroquine treatment arm 23 were excluded from analysis as they required intensive care admission died withdrew from the study or were lost to follow-up given the small sample size of the overall study and the exclusion of these six participants in the absence of an intention to treat analysis the results are significantly biased and no definitive conclusion should be drawn long term outcome data from this study were not available and the reported outcome of viral clearance may not be a good surrogate for important patient-centered outcomes such as the need for mechanical ventilation or mortality of the six patients who received azithromycin in addition to hydroxychloroquine all patients had a negative sars-cov-2 pcr test by day 6 without comparison to adequate controls gautret et al also recently released results of another open-label unblinded study assessing the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in 80 hospitalized patients using the same dosing regimen as previously described 44 47 six patients included in this analysis were included in the original study nearly 58 of these patients had at least one underlying chronic health condition four patients were asymptomatic at baseline whereas 41 had upper respiratory tract symptoms and 54 had pneumonia or bronchitis-like symptoms approximately 92 of patients had a low national early warning score indicating that the overall severity of illness in this population was mild they reported 83 of patients having undetectable nasopharyngeal viral loads on day seven however there was no comparison group and thus the results are nearly impossible to interpret in this study 81 6580 of patients survived to hospital discharge whereas three patients required intensive care one died and eleven were still hospitalized on march 31 2020 chen et al published results of a randomized parallel-group trial where 62 hospitalized participants were randomized to receive either 400mg hydroxychloroquine for five days in addition to standard of care or standard of care alone 45 no placebo was utilized in this study standard of care was defined as oxygen antiviral agents antibacterial agents and immunoglobulin with or without corticosteroids only patients with chest ct confirmed pneumonia and mild illness with sao2spo2 93 or pao2fio2  300 mmhg were allowed to enroll while the researchers found a more substantial proportion of those receiving hydroxychloroquine had clinical improvement of pneumonia 80 vs 55 p  04 as determined by day zero to day six chest ct the methodology was not described outcomes were likely based on subjective individual clinician opinion which may not have been blinded to the treatment allocation decreased duration of cough 20 vs 31 days p  001 and shortened time to clinical recovery were also reported for those receiving hydroxychloroquine when compared to the controls however only 48 1531 of those randomized to hydroxychloroquine and 71 2231 of controls had cough at baseline and it is unknown for what duration four patients in the control group were said to have progressed to severe illness though severe illness was not defined no underlying patient comorbidities were examined and this may have been an overall confounding variable additionally the specific antiviral and antibacterial medications utilized as a part of standard of care treatment were unspecified and may have affected the results overall similar to prior studies serious limitations exist and the results of this non-peer reviewed study should be interpreted with appropriate caution on april 3rd molina et al reported outcomes of a prospective cohort of 11 hospitalized patients in response to gautret et als work 46 these patients all received the same dose and duration of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as the gautret study eight patients enrolled had significant comorbidities and at the time of enrollment 1011 were receiving oxygen supplementation they found that 80 95 ci 4994 of patients alive by days five-six still had sars-cov-2 rna positive nasopharyngeal swabs in contrast to other findings that suggested reduced viral titers in this small cohort two patients were transferred to intensive care one patient died and one had the medications stopped due to qtc prolongation unlike the gautret study these sicker patients were included in the analysis importantly all six of these studies have several important limitations that preclude their incorporation into clinical guidelines all studies had small sample sizes 100 participants and were underpowered to demonstrate a clinical or statistical difference in outcomes only two studies were randomized controlled trials while two were a non-randomized non-blinded open-label study one was a prospective cohort and one included a combination of patients from ongoing clinical trials without any statistical assessment available four of the five hydroxychloroquine studies shared the same dosing regimen 400 mg hydroxychloroquine for five days but based on in vitro data doses as high as 800 mg if not higher followed by 400 mg for several days may be required for effective viral clearance in humans 39 only one of the six studies was officially peer-reviewed though concerns have been raised about this article 49 these studies should therefore be interpreted as solely hypothesis-generating and should not serve as supporting evidence for the widespread inclusion of hydroxychloroquinechloroquine in clinical guidelines given that all of these studies reported differences in the disease severity the overall patient populations may not be comparable moving forward researchers should report the severity of covid-19 illness based on symptom duration as well as using a systematic severity scale despite this dearth of evidence of efficacy in light of the pressure that covid-19 has posed on national health systems several official guidelines have already incorporated hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine into the suggested treatment of patients with covid-19 28 50 51 a subsequent surge in prescriptions has caused widespread shortages of hydroxychloroquine which has threatened the supply of this medication for patients with autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis the incorporation of these medications into national treatment guidelines has several consequences while hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are seemingly safe medications they are not benign and there are important side effects although side effects are not common with these medicines rare adverse effects of a medication that is prescribed commonly without a rigorous evidence base can be dangerous on a population level bluntly stated any significant side effect is not justifiable if the drug is not effective given these potentially deleterious consequences of widespread use of these drugs in the absence of robust data the european medicines agency has refused to approve chloroquine for covid-19 and has restricted its use to solely clinical trials or through national emergency use programs 52 to date there are no studies of hydroxychloroquine as treatment of covid-19 that are adequately powered to demonstrate efficacy or the absence of harm presently over 1 million cases of covid-19 have been identified if all patients had received hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine even if for example qtc prolongation and arrhythmia are seen in less than 01 of the population this would equate to 1000 adverse events which is arguably not acceptable if the medication is not effective of note gautret and molina examined the treatment of covid-19 with combination hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin which many clinicians have now started to prescribe together without evidence in the outpatient setting in these studies this combination was utilized in an inpatient environment presumably with some degree of cardiac monitoring both azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine alone but especially in combination can increase the risk of qtc prolongation and lead to malignant arrhythmias 4 6 in a retrospective population study of 60 000 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine for rheumatic disease researchers found an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality when hydroxychloroquine was used in combination with azithromycin 50 deaths when compared to hydroxychloroquine and amoxicillin 25 deaths hazard ratio 219 95 ci 122394 however all-cause mortality was the same hazard ratio 134 53 this risk can be significantly increased when considering other commonly prescribed medications with the potential for qtc prolongation like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors tricyclic antidepressants antipsychotics and various antimicrobials these small studies demonstrate insufficient evidence to therefore support the routine use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin outside of a clinical trial with adequate cardiac monitoring as a final consideration lopinavirritonavir a protease inhibitor broadly available for treating hiv infection with in vitro activity against sars-cov infection has been recommended by the chinese authorities to treat covid-19 a recent open-label randomized trial of 14 days of lopinavirritonavir therapy among severely ill patients hospitalized with covid-19 showed no clinical improvement and no reduction in sars-cov-2 viral load beyond standard care 54 despite these negative results lopinavirritonavir is still commonly used to treat covid in some settings often concomitantly with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine importantly lopinavirritonavir can potentially increase chloroquine plasma levels by inhibition of cytochrome p450 cyp2d6 enzyme metabolism therefore increasing the risk for malignant arrhythmias moreover other factors such as myocarditis and myocardial ischemia reported in the context of covid-19 55 or hypoxia and electrolyte abnormalities often seen in the acute phase of severe covid-19 can further contribute to the development of acute arrhythmias 56 thus this calls for prudent and well-informed use of lopinavirritonavir and qtc-prolonging medications like hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to treat covid-19 additional studies examining hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in preventing and treating covid-19 are desperately needed given the weak evidence available larger controlled trials are needed to more thoroughly assess if hydroxychloroquinechloroquine have a clinical benefit in covid-19 several ongoing randomized clinical trials are actively recruiting participants to better address this question these randomized trials are powered to show a reduction in meaningful clinical outcomes such as the development of covid-19 in prevention trials or the need for hospitalization critical care or death in treatment trials the results of these trials will be instrumental in determining whether or not these two antimalarial medications are at all efficacious and if so at what dose and for what duration they should be safely recommended in guidelines  acute respiratory failure secondary to covid-19 viral pneumonia managed with hydroxychloroquineazithromycin treatment alexander muacevic john adler r kenneth ng k mitchell ng k angelina zhyvotovska sahib singh ketan shevde   the severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is the cause of a global pandemic that began in 2019 with significant mortality for patients worldwide 1 the coronavirus disease of 2019 abbreviated as covid-19 by the world health organization who has relatively high mortality and transmissibility for a viral disease 2 the official fatality rates of 066 in the united states us as per the centers for disease control and prevention cdc and 23 as per chinese data are probably overestimated given the number of asymptomatic carriers but there is no doubt that covid-19 has overwhelmed healthcare systems globally 3 as of march 2020 there was no definitive vaccine or antiviral treatment despite ongoing efforts to develop these sars-cov-2 causes acute respiratory distress syndrome ards in those who are elderly or who have significant cardiopulmonary comorbidities 1 a recent published small clinical trial in france has shown that combination pharmacological treatment with hydroxychloroquine an old antimalarial drug and azithromycin an antibiotic led to decreased viral load and an average carrying duration in covid-19 patients 4 the french study was inspired by a smaller chinese study showing similar improvements 5 these studies have led many healthcare providers globally to utilize hydroxychloroquineazithromycin combinations to treat covid-19 patients in critical care settings 6 the state university of new york suny downstate medical center in brooklyn new york is designated as a covid-only patient hospital as per new york governor cuomos order on march 28 2020 covid-19 patients at suny downstate receive a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin this case report examines the clinical course of one of the first patients to receive the treatment an elderly african american male with ards secondary to covid-19 despite significant comorbidities the patient steadily improved throughout his intensive care unit icu stay and was extubated by the fifth day of his admission he was transferred to the medical floor for continued treatment for community-acquired pneumonia cap this case while anecdotal supports the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a safe and effective treatment for covid-19 the patient is a 74-year-old male living in a nursing home in new york that was a known focus of a covid-19 outbreak he has a past medical history significant for squamous cell carcinoma of the lung with the invasion of the esophagus status-post resection and chemoradiation seven years earlier a cerebrovascular accident with right residual weakness diabetes mellitus hypertension and peripheral vascular disease pvd he was brought to suny downstate medical center in septic shock with altered mental status fever tachycardia and hypotension the patients renal function was preserved with a baseline creatinine of 07 mgdl on presentation he was in acute respiratory failure with desaturation to 70 while on 6 litersminute of nasal oxygen he required intubation and mechanical ventilation upon transfer to the icu the patient underwent organ system-based management for sepsis and ards secondary to covid-19 viral pneumonia complicated by a secondary bacterial infection he was maintained on mechanical ventilation on volume control mode and sedated with dexmedetomidine drip during the first two days of admission he required vasopressor support with norepinephrine on the third day norepinephrine was titrated off and he remained hemodynamically stable without vasopressor support he had an episode of acute kidney injury aki which resolved with the initiation of free water flush of 200 ml every six hours and 125 ml per hour of intravenous iv normal saline which was later stopped his chest x-ray on admission showed bilateral lung opacities and focal right lower lobe consolidation consistent with viral pneumonia complicated by a bacterial superinfection covid-19 test on patients sputum performed by the new york department of health was positive blood cultures grew methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus mssa as per recommendations of the infectious disease id team the patient was one of the first at suny downstate to receive pharmacological treatment for covid-19 consisting of hydroxychloroquine 400 milligrams mg twice a day for one day followed by 200 mg twice a day for four days in addition to azithromycin 500 mg once the first day and 250 mg for four days this was based on a recently published study from france which demonstrated combination treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin led to improved outcomes in covid-19 patients measured by decreased viral count taken from nasal swabs 4 the patient was also started on iv vancomycin when blood cultures came back positive for mssa infection despite his poor prognosis on admission the patient steadily improved daily chest x-rays showed a gradual resolution of the bilateral patchy infiltrates and right lower lobe consolidation figures 1-3  the patient remained hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output and without the use of vasopressors the patients mental status improved and by day 3 he responded to voice and command at the bedside serial arterial blood gases showed improvement in oxygenation even as ventilator settings were gradually decreased with decreasing fraction of inspired oxygen fio2 positive expiratory end pressure peep and respiratory rate the patient passed a continuous positive pressure cpap spontaneous breathing trial on day 5 of admission with a rapid shallow breathing index rsbi  100 and was successfully extubated he was downgraded to a covid-only medical floor with appropriate droplet and contact isolation precautions pending discharge this case report documents the hospital course of a critically ill covid-19 patient who improved with critical care in the icu on a five-day regimen of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin it provides a demonstration of a highly positive outcome in a patient at high risk for mortality given his advanced age and numerous comorbidities the mortality rate for patients in this age group is 80 and given the patients numerous comorbidities his risk was likely higher 7-8 the patients relatively transient need for mechanical ventilation totaling five days rapid improvement in mental status rapid resolution of septic shock and resolution of his infection of radiological imaging support the potential efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a combination treatment for covid-19 while this case report is not a substitute for a randomized clinical trial to determine the efficacy of hydroxychloroquineazithromycin this patients hospital course is representative of a case series of least 11 other patients at suny downstate who received the hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin and recorded a positive outcome either downgrade from the icu or discharge from the hospital though the mechanism is not well-understood it is hypothesized that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin may work in several ways first hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine reduce the glycosylation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors which the sars-cov-2 use to enter host cells figure 4 7  second it is hypothesized that hydroxychloroquine decreases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines whose expression lead to the ards pathway 8 finally large amounts of the virus are known to enter host cells through endocytosis chloroquine accumulates in endosomes decreasing the space available for viruses like sars-cov-2 and also raises endosomal ph interfering with the entry and exit of viruses from host cells 9 although a potential mechanism for azithromycin is not well-defined it is noted that in the oft-cited french study showing decreased covid viral loads 70 of patients in the group who received hydroxychloroquine alone showed no viral load by day 6 while 100 of patients in the group who received hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin showed no viral load by day 6 versus 125 patients who received no treatment at all pointing to a synergistic effect with hydroxychloroquine 4 covid-19 is a novel viral respiratory illness that has caused a large pandemic with significant mortality in 2020 10 as of march 2020 there is no curative treatment for covid-19 with the first antiviral agents and vaccines anticipated to appear in the fall of 2020 to date the management of critically ill covid-19 patients is highly provider and institution-dependent in many hospitals including suny downstate where this case was documented the most common drug combination used is hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin this case study and the patients relatively rapid recovery adds to the body of evidence supporting the potential use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as empiric treatments for covid the safety of both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin is not likely a significant issue given both drugs have been safely utilized for decades for malaria prophylaxis and to treat community-acquired pneumonia respectively 11  in summary this case report highlights the course and recovery of an elderly covid-19 patient with many comorbidities typically associated with a high rate of mortality this case supports the need for further study on the topic of appropriate management a larger randomized clinical trial assessing the efficacy of a combination treatment hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin on covid-19 patients should be conducted  coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 spread and pharmacovigilance implications expert opinion peter yamoah thelma alalbila mpoku varsha bangalee frasia oosthuizen   the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 which started in china was declared a global pandemic by the world health organization who on march 11 2020 following its spread to several other countries across the globe 1 the outbreak in china began in december 2019 after some health institutions reported clusters of patients reporting with pneumonia of unknown cause that were epidemiologically linked to a seafood and wet animal wholesale market in wuhan hubei province 2 3 coronaviruses a large family of viruses have caused two pandemics in the past two decadessevere acute respiratory disease sars in 2002 4 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers in 2012 5 the sars coronavirus sars-cov-1 is similar to the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 and scientists believe that sars-cov-1 which is mainly found in bats could cause a future disease outbreak aside from pneumonia it has been observed that other clinical symptoms of covid-19 include fever dry cough and breathing difficulties dyspnoea disease onset of covid-19 may result in progressive respiratory failure owing to alveolar damage as observed by transverse chest computerized-tomography images and even death 6 according to the who covid-19 had spread to 180 countries and territories killing more than 50000 people and infecting about 1 million people with 202000 recoveries as of april 2 2020 7 the spread of the disease has forced many countries to activate their public health surveillance systems with the intention of tracing contacts of identified cases for quarantine and isolating and treating active cases to reduce the spread of the disease as covid-19 continues to rapidly spread efforts are being made to discover vaccines and other interventions to prevent and treat the infections as well as to flatten the infection curve to the barest minimum as soon as possible in the meantime some medicines in use for other conditions are being relied upon for the treatment of active cases based on anecdotal reports this paper presents the pharmacovigilance implications of the introduction of these medicines the development of vaccines and their remarkable success in preventing several infectious diseases such as ebola virus disease and the swine flu h1n1 infection has given mankind hope that infectious diseases could be controlled or even eliminated vaccines typically prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases in the uninfected population thus creating the opportunity to flatten the infection curve vaccines work by eliciting an immune response in the individual in order to fight the active infection should it occur in future 8 in most pandemics the media public research institutions pharmaceutical companies and other stakeholders focus largely on the design of vaccines rather than therapies to treat patients with the active disease this leaves healthcare professionals in a predicament as to deciding the best therapeutic agents to use in order to achieve optimal treatment outcomes as a result of the self-limiting nature of most viral infections physicians manage the symptoms and complications of infection while the patients are advised to rest and maintain good nutrition and hydration to enhance immune function 9 10 however with covid-19 there are emerging therapies which are purported to be associated with very good treatment outcomes the food and drugs administration fda of the usa for instance has sanctioned the compassionate use of chloroquine 11 a 4-minoquinoline medicine which has been used for many years to treat rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus and porphyria cutanea tarda even though its use in the treatment of malaria in sub-saharan africa was banned in the early 2000s due to the incidence of adverse reactions and resistance 12 this compassionate approval of chloroquine as well as a statement made by president trump on the possible benefits of chloroquine in the treatment of covid-19 has led many into believing that chloroquine is a magical covid-19 drug aside from the approval of the compassionate use of chloroquine by the fda the national institutes of health nih of the usa has recently published a new study that found hydroxychloroquine which is also a 4-aminoquinoline and a derivative of chloroquine as more effective and potent than chloroquine against covid-19 in vitro 13 moreover a recently conducted randomized controlled study by gautret et al in france showed that 100 of patients who received a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin tested negative and were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment 14 consequently large pharmaceutical companies are considering re-positioning themselves to manufacture chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in larger volumes and seeking to establish contacts with markets where profitability could be maximized with the resulting increase in the demand for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine bayer and teva pharmaceutical industries for instance have donated chloroquine products to the usa while mylan plans to restart production of chloroquine tablets 11 currently many countries have drafted their covid-19 treatment protocols using these medicines and there have been varying treatment outcomes which corroborate what another french study on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has found out-there is no evidence of rapid antiviral clearance or clinical benefit 15 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are associated with cardiotoxicity prolonged qt syndrome with prolonged use particularly in patients with hepatic and renal dysfunction these drugs could also cause immunosuppression aplastic anemia agranulocytosis retinal damage and peripheral neuropathy with hydroxychloroquine associated with a lower incidence of side effects 17 18 there has been a surge in the demand for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in many parts of the world in china there have been complaints about people ordering chloroquine from online drug stores and self-medicating at fatal doses moreover in nigeria west africa two cases of chloroquine poisoning have already been reported which have raised concerns among healthcare professionals 19 furthermore in the arizona state of the usa a man died after ingesting a high dose of chloroquine in an attempt to protect himself from covid-19 while the wife who also ingested the same drug was admitted at the hospital under critical care 20 the rush for these medicines because of the covid-19 scare could deny those whose conditions require their prescriptions patients with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus rely on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as part of their treatment regimen 21 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are particularly indispensable in managing the constitutional musculoskeletal skin and mild pleuritic symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus an autoimmune disease that is very challenging to manage the shortage of these medicines could therefore cause poor treatment outcomes with the current lock-downs being enforced in many countries across the globe to reduce the movement of people toward mitigating the spread of the virus the situation could be worsened by panic buying to keep these medicines for use at home as first aid pharmaceutical products to prevent covid-19 moreover the disruption in supply chain due to the restricted movement of humans and goods could aggravate the situation as the stocks of these medicines get depleted a recent scoping review conducted by phuong et al 22 has revealed that medication shortages resulted in negative patient clinical economic and humanistic outcomes consequently efforts must be made to curb this impending crisis the indiscriminate use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could lead to resistance of sars-cov-2 to these medicines in an event where the ongoing clinical trials establish that these medicines must be approved for the full-scale treatment of the disease resistance of the plasmodium parasite to chloroquine which used to be a potent medicine for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in the twentieth century resulted from the indiscriminate over the counter use a repetition of same could pose a challenge to covid-19 treatment and even complicate cases if the efficacies of these medicines are lost through their misuse given the fact that drug development is a long laborious and expensive process already existing therapies like chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine must be preserved the way forward in assuaging the situation is to intensify public campaign against the routine or over the counter use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the prevention of covid-19 all community pharmacists must adhere strictly to this recommendation and seize the opportunity to educate patients on methods of preventing the spread of the disease such as regular hand washing with soap under tap water the use of alcohol-based sanitizers with alcohol concentration not less than 60 vv eating balanced diet resting well and reducing stress 23 rather than self-medicating with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the bid to prevent the disease doctors must also ensure that only patients diagnosed with covid-19 are given prescriptions for these medicines this will require that laboratory tools are made available in all health institution to facilitate diagnosis as continual empirical treatment could lead to resistance of virus to the medicines lastly regulation of these medicines must be strengthened and enforced in sub-saharan africa for instance drug regulation has been very challenging over the years unapproved border trade of pharmaceuticals and drug counterfeiting resulting from high demand must be vigorously checked through the collaborative efforts of drug regulatory and security agencies this could save patients from taking sub-standard medicines and consuming medicines they do not really need in conclusion as covid-19 continues to spread and efforts are being made to flatten the infection curve the general population must be monitored and educated on indiscriminate medication use in an attempt to prevent the virus from infecting human hosts they must be made aware that current medicines are served on prescription basis at hospitals and covid-19 isolation and treatment centers and are not for covid-19 prevention rather they must be educated on approved methods of preventing the spread of the virus recommended by the who in spite of the global panic to quickly resolve the covid-19 pandemic scientists must be vigilant and ensure rational medicine use while repurposing old remedies  is hydroxychloroquine a possible postexposure prophylaxis drug to limit the transmission

to the editorwe read with great interest the study by yao et al 1 reporting that hydroxychloroquine has better antiviral activity than chloroquine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which is associated with a high lung-to-plasma concentration ratio and immunomodulatory effects moreover the authors highlighted that hydroxychloroquine half maximal effective concentration values tended to decrease with longer incubation times and that in the simulation model the lung trough concentrations were still above the target concentration on day 10 after a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine besides household contacts sars-cov-2 can be acquired in hospital settings with healthcare workers hcws attending at invasive procedures on the respiratory tract ie intubation endotracheal tube aspiration or bronchoscopy at the highest risk accidently infected hcws represent an important source of infection during the period that they are asymptomatic or presymptomatic as they can transmit the virus to household contacts and to patients seeking medical care for reasons unrelated to sars-cov-2 infection for these reasons we suggest preventive strategies for those accidentally exposed to sars-cov-2 such as preexposure or postexposure prophylaxis to avoid viral transmission as largely accepted for those exposed to other viral agents such as human immunodeficiency virus hiv 2 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are able to inhibit replication at early stages of viral infection increasing endosomal ph at the time of viruscell fusion as well as impairing the glycosylation of cellular receptors of many viruses including coronavirus 3 in contrast no similar effect on early phases of coronavirus infection has been reported for other drugs proposed for sars-cov-2 treatment which are able to interfere only after cell infection affecting protease cleavage protease inhibitors or viral genome replication remdesivir or ribavirin these effects of chloroquine on early phases of viral replication permit the attenuation of vertical transmission in an animal model of zika virus infection significantly reducing brain viral load and make cells refractory to sars-cov infection in an in vitro model 4 5 hydroxychloroquine the hiv protease inhibitors particularly lopinavir ribavirin and remdesivir are the most promising drugs proposed for coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 treatment but currently no drug has been proposed for postexposure or preexposure prophylaxis for those accidently exposed to sars-cov-2 6 on the basis of these investigations we believe that hydroxychloroquine can be effective in preventing respiratory tract invasion in hcws exposed to sars-cov-2 and that hydroxychloroquine administration as a prophylactic agent could be particularly useful for hcws attending to high-risk procedures on the respiratory tract in covid-19 patients hydroxychloroquines effectiveness profile its ability to inhibit lung viral replication for a 10-day period after only a 5-day cycle of therapy and the large amounts of knowledge in term of safety deriving from its use for malaria prophylaxis and rheumatologic diseases lead us to recommend its preexposure or postexposure use for those performing procedures at high risk of viral diffusion in patients with covid-19 pneumonia  covid-safer deprescribing guidance for

infection causes high morbidity and mortality in older adults with chronic illnesses several trials are currently underway evaluating the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for acute infection however polypharmacy predisposes patients to increased risk of drug-drug interactions with hydroxychloroquine and may render many in this population ineligible to participate in trials objectives we aimed to quantify the degree of polypharmacy and burden of potentially inappropriate medications pims that older hospitalized adults are taking which would interact with hydroxychloroquine methods we reanalyzed data from the cohort of patients 65 years and older enrolled in the medsafer pilot study we first identified patients taking medications with potentially harmful drug-drug interactions with hydroxychloroquine that might exclude them from participation in a typical coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 therapeutic trial next we identified medications that were flagged by medsafer as being potentially inappropriate and crafted guidance around medication management if contemplating the use of hydroxychloroquine this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved results the cohort contained a total of 1001 unique patients with complete data on their home medications at admission of these 1001 patients 590 589 were receiving one or more home medications that could potentially interact with hydroxychloroquine and of these 255 432 were flagged as potentially inappropriate by the medsafer tool common classes of pims observed were antipsychotics cardiac medications and anti-diabetic agents the covid-19 pandemic highlights the importance of medication optimization and deprescribing pims in older adults by acting now to reduce polypharmacy and use of pims we can better prepare this vulnerable population for inclusion in trials and if substantiated pharmacologic treatment or prevention of covid-19  the first cluster of cases of covid-19 disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was reported to the world health organization on december 31 st  2019 12 on march 11 th  2020 the world health organization declared covid-19 a pandemic 3 and at the time of writing greater than 43 million laboratory-confirmed cases have been documented globally with greater than 290000 related deaths 4 in response more than 600 interventional trials have been registered to investigate whether existing medications are safe and effective for the treatment of covid-19 disease 5 one class of medications that has demonstrated therapeutic properties in vitro are the antimalarial agents chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine 6 following results from the early emerging literature including several small clinical trials 7 8 9 10  an uncontrolled case series 11  and an open label non-randomized study from france 12  the us food and drug administration fda granted an emergency use authorization eua for hydroxychloroquine for hospitalized patients with covid-19 who are unable to participate in clinical trials 13 14 15 these studies were heavily referenced in the media despite inconclusive data and trials for use as prophylaxis and treatment are ongoing 12 16 more recently an observational study on hydroxychloroquine was published showing no improvement in clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized with covid- 19  17 at the present time the fda and the infectious disease society of america idsa recommend against its use outside of clinical trials 18 the results of randomized controlled trials are forthcoming and the medication may still be prescribed outside of a trial for lack of any alternative treatment this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved one population in critical need of effective treatments for covid-19 are older adults with comorbid conditions including diabetes hypertension and cardiac conditions studies suggest older adults are more susceptible to infection with covid-19 and are at a higher risk of severe complications when compared to the general population 19 20 outbreaks in long-term care facilities resulting in death have emphasized the vulnerability of this population 21 with increasing age there are higher rates of medical conditions observed leading to a higher prevalence of polypharmacy taking multiple medications 2223 as many as 567 of community dwelling north americans over the age of 65 are taking five or more regular medications 24 25 polypharmacy is harmful given the association with falls fractures and other adverse drug events 26 however we are now encountering another problem from taking multiple medications a substantial risk of drug-drug interactions with potential therapies for covid- 19  27 many of these interacting medications are potentially inappropriate medications pims which themselves carry an increased risk for adverse drug events ades and could be deprescribed stopped tapered or switched to a safer alternative 28 29 30 31 we hypothesized that due to polypharmacy and clinically significant drug-drug interactions many older adults with their current drug regimens will be ineligible for covid-19 therapeutic trials andor treatment with medications that are currently under investigation including but not limited to the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine this despite older adults being at an increased risk of complications as a result of covid-19 and representing a population most likely to benefit from different therapeutic options we postulated that many of these drug-drug interactions are due to pims which could be deprescribed proactively in light of a recent fda warning regarding risk of qtc prolongation we examined hydroxychloroquine 14 as a test case to estimate the prevalence of prescribed medications with drug-drug interactions in a cohort of hospitalized older adults with polypharmacy we aimed to better characterize the burden of pims that could be deprescribed with the impetus being the covid-19 pandemic the medsafer pilot study 32 was a large controlled before and after deprescribing trial that took place between september 2016 and may 2017 on 4 canadian academic internal medicine clinical teaching units the trial was designed to assess whether a computer-assisted medication review tool augmented the deprescribing of pims at discharge in a population of hospitalized older adults with polypharmacy the softwares algorithm identified pims and provided deprescribing recommendations for each individual patient by applying rules derived from widely available consensus documents for safer prescribing in older adults 30 31 33 details of the trial are described elsewhere 32 briefly patients were identified on admission via the emergency room to one of the designated units after discussion with the treating team to see if the met they broad inclusion criteria of 65-years and older and taking five or more medications patient data concerning medical conditions validated medications and some lab results were collected and entered into the medsafer deprescribing electronic decision support software which identified pims through drug-disease combinations drug-drug interactions or those that should be avoided or used with caution in older adults the medsafer system generated a report of the pim included a level of harm high risk intermediate risk or low risk but little added value the rationale for deprescribing and when appropriate a tapering protocol for the present study we re-analyzed the medsafer data as a representative sample of vulnerable older adults with polypharmacy we first searched the literature for medications with known drug-drug interactions with hydroxychloroquine by examining the product monograph 34  referring to drug-drug interaction websites 35 36  and reviewing the exclusion criteria for a currently enrolling fda and health canada approved hydroxychloroquine trial for covid-19 nct04308668 5 37 38 medications with known interactions with hydroxychloroquine were grouped according to the american hospital formulary service ahfs classification 39 table 1  and divided into two categories chronic medications and medications typically prescribed for a short course such as antibiotics we analyzed all patients in the medsafer study who consented to participate in the deprescribing trial and who had a complete medication reconciliation performed on admission we theoretically exposed this patient cohort to treatment with hydroxychloroquine minimum 5-days at a minimum dose of 600mg daily as in nct04308668 and identified possible drug interactions as well as potential harmful outcomes such as increased toxicity of hydroxychloroquine risk of qtc prolongation or malignant cardiac arrhythmia or risk of other adverse drug events requiring closer monitoring during therapy such as severe hypoglycemia table 2  from all interacting medications we ran the medsafer algorithms to determine the proportion of medications that were pims and that could be deprescribed we also identified the triggering condition associated with each pim eg atrial fibrillation heart failure dementia delirium or renal failure those that require monitoring if there is to be ongoing use and medications that likely cannot be stopped due to risk of an adverse drug withdrawal event the medsafer 32 cohort contained 1001 patients with complete data on their home medications the median age of the cohort was 80 years and approximately 50 were women more than half had hypertension approximately 40 had diabetes and close to 50 were moderately to severely frail as defined by the clinical frailty scale 40 all patients were hospitalized in a tertiary care hospital and were admitted to one of four general medical wards in one of 3 canadian academic centres in montreal ottawa and toronto we analyzed 1001 participants and found that 590 589 were prescribed one or more usual home medications that could potentially interact with hydroxychloroquine the most commonly prescribed drug classes with known interactions were anti-diabetic medications 3301001 33 the selective serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ssrissnris 1731001 173 antipsychotics typical and atypical 1361001 136 and antiarrhythmics such as digoxin and amiodarone 641001 64  table 3  the most common classes of antidiabetics were insulin 1381001 138 and sulfonylureas 901001 90  table   3  the most serious interaction identified was a risk of qtc prolongation torsade de pointes and sudden death a common but less severe interaction was a risk of hypoglycemia requiring increased monitoring lowering of the seizure threshold and pharmacokinetic interactions leading to increased hydroxychloroquine levels was uncommon we then determined how many pims as identified by the medsafer tool with known interactions with hydroxychloroquine presented an opportunity to be proactively deprescribed of the 5901001 589 of participants who were prescribed a medication that could interact with hydroxychloroquine 255 patients had the respective medication identified as a pim representing 432 of all patients with an interacting medication some common deprescribing opportunities that were identified included 1 too high a dose of digoxin for a patients renal function 2 antipsychotic use in patients with a known history of delirium or neurocognitive disorder risk of stroke falls confusion and 3 insulin and sulfonylureas in patients with a history of hypoglycemia andor tight glycemic control hgba1c 75  table 4  we prepared recommendations for the management of interacting medications in patients with covid-19 who may want to receive treatment with hydroxychloroquine if found to be effective examples include holding low doses of antipsychotics or antidepressants during therapy qtc monitoring and electrolyte optimization with continued use of qtc prolonging agents and glucose monitoring with concurrent diabetes medications we also highlight medications such as amiodarone that cannot be stopped on short notice for inclusion in clinical trials due to prolonged half-life table 2  we re-analyzed data from the medsafer pilot and found that 1 in 2 older adults with polypharmacy in our cohort have a chronically prescribed medication that could potentially interact with hydroxychloroquine half of which were pims that could be deprescribed the number of medical conditions and associated polypharmacy of the cohort places them at high risk of complications from covid-19 but also potentially at risk of harm from treatments we identified several common drug classes many of which are also pims that would preclude many older adults from enrolling in a trial a main finding was that many older adults were taking medications that carry a known risk of prolonging the qtc this finding should caution against routine prescribing of qtc prolonging covid-19 treatments outside of a clinical study as there is real potential for harm importantly more than 50 of interacting drugs were identified as a pim that could be proactively deprescribed rendering the person more likely to be eligible for a trial and increasing the generalizability of study findings to this population in this analysis we chose to focus on a specific drug hydroxychloroquine of note there is ongoing debate regarding the safety of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of covid-19 and studies into efficacy are still ongoing the risks associated with a medication such as hydroxychloroquine are likely higher for older adults with polypharmacy especially given how common co-administration of qtc prolonging medications is and the prevalence of underlying cardiac conditions 41 many patients in our cohort were also overprescribed oral hypoglycemic agents a1c 75 or a history of hypoglycemia which when co-prescribed with hydroxychloroquine could increase the risk of hypoglycemia older adults may have decreased oral intake as a result of covid-19 infection and subsequent dehydration electrolyte disturbances nausea and gi upset which are also common adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine and may further exacerbate severe cardiac dysrhythmias 42 we have identified medications that may interact with study drugs that could be deprescribed proactively or at the time of treatment eg off-label low dose quetiapine for sleep and agitation others if stopped abruptly could lead to serious adverse drug withdrawal events or uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms eg methadone or higher doses of ssris 43 finally some medications have long half-lives that require weeks to months to safely discontinue in order to avoid interactions in this case it may not be possible to stop the medication in time for treatment and thus the risk of interaction will not be reduced eg azithromycin 44  fluoxetine and amiodarone of note while there is a risk of potential interactions between medications this does not necessarily mean there will be any clinical manifestations currently the use of antimalarials for the treatment or prevention of covid-19 has extremely limited evidence 27 if robust evidence demonstrating efficacy in the treatment of covid-19 is established some clinicians might opt to continue certain medications that cannot be stopped abruptly or where symptoms of withdrawal are thought to be significant in most cases this would involve judicious monitoring of the qtc and minimizing other risk factors electrolyte abnormalities bradycardia while cardiac monitoring is generally available for hospitalized patients and perhaps at select nursing homes this is likely not the case for most outpatients finally it is important to take into consideration the half-life of the treatment medication to know how long symptoms should be monitored for and when it is safe to re-start medications hydroxychloroquine range 20-120 days mean 40 days 45 46 47 the risk of qtc prolongation may persist beyond the treatment period and remain clinically relevant for an unclear duration of note the optimal effective does of hydroxychloroquine is not known while our referenced study uses a daily dose of 600mg in practice doses are variable and some jurisdictions may prescribe lower doses of 400 mg daily and this may have an impact on the risk of drug interactions and of side effects the above considerations aside for medications that are pims their interactions with possible covid-19 therapies are yet another reason to evaluate these medications for safe deprescribing immediately 48 any concern for abrupt discontinuation can be avoided by deprescribing in advance of acute illness 48 while we used hydroxychloroquine as a test case this should not be interpreted as an endorsement of the medication the clinical scenario described herein is not limited to hydroxychloroquine other treatments including but not limited to lopinavir-ritonavir colchicine and dapsone have also been proposed these treatments similarly do not have significant evidence to support their use presently but also carry risks of serious drug-drug interactions 49 50 clinicians may be tempted and indeed are prescribing medications out of desperation to provide patients with some form of treatment for covid-19 but caution and a rigorous review of possible interactions is warranted especially in older adults with polypharmacy notably this population will often be underrepresented in clinical trials and even if proven effective harms may still outweigh benefits for some therapies and an individualized approach should always be taken presently while some medications have shown promise such as hydroxychloroquine and more recently remdesivir 49  no medication for the treatment of covid-19 has been proven to be effective and so we would suggest that outside of a clinical trial the potential harms of off-label prescribing likely outweigh benefits in the meantime it is important that we reduce the number of pims patients are taking as it may facilitate more treatment options once clinical evidence is established strengths of this study include a large cohort of older adults from a multi-site trial with polypharmacy a thorough review of the literature to outline potential drug interactions and clear instructions for medication management in the setting of drug interactions this cohort also reflects the latest fda recommendation that hydroxychloroquine should not be used outside of a clinical trial or a hospitalized setting 14 yet our study has several limitations as they were all hospitalized the patients in this study likely represent those that are most likely to experience harm as a result of widespread prescribing of hydroxychloroquine future work should focus on finding safe and effective treatments in long-term care facilities where the burden of polypharmacy is high there is an increased risk for covid-19 exposure and effective treatments may decrease the risk of hospitalization we chose to focus on hydroxychloroquine as a test case in order to provide realistic examples of harm that could result from widespread prescribing reviewing all potential therapies and their subsequent drug-drug interactions was beyond the scope of this paper however similar recommendations could be generated for other potential treatments and may be more complex for example interactions with the lopinavir-ritonavir are more extensive than we have outlined for hydroxychloroquine additionally the clinical significance of the interactions identified vary with cardiac complications with sudden death being the most severe whereas absolute risks of seizure or hypoglycemia are less well defined all patients in our cohort were on at least five medications this is the case for approximately 50 of older americans 24 25 for those on fewer medications the risk of drug-drug interactions is less on the other hand this study only looked at interactions with home medications patients who are hospitalized may have an even higher risk of interactions as they receive additional treatments eg concurrent antibiotics that prolong the qtc antipsychotics for the management of delirium insulin etc finally while the population of patients we analyzed is canadian the problem of polypharmacy has been widely described in the united states and countries across the world so the principles outlined in the discussion can be extrapolated to other jurisdictions polypharmacy has many unpredictable consequences there are well described harms eg falls fractures and cognitive impairment 23 but we describe an emerging concern in the era of covid-19 patients may not be eligible for covid-19 trials to study the effectiveness and safety of the medications under investigation others may be subject to harm as a result of offlabel prescribing due to the risk of drug-drug interactions now more than ever we should examine the medication lists of older adults with a focus on medication optimization and stopping pims particularly those which may interact with potential covid-19 therapies we wish to thank the patients who enrolled in the original medsafer study who agreed to participate in research into polypharmacy table 2 for potential triggering conditions metformin was not considered to be at risk of causing hypoglycemia for the

francischini antnio carlos de paula da silva henrique   since the first reports of novel pneumonia covid-19 in wuhan hubei province china considerable discussion on the origin of the causative virus sars-cov-2 also referred to as hcov-19 has emerged 1 infections with sars-cov-2 are now widespread and efforts to contain the virus are ongoing however given the many uncertainties regarding pathogen transmissibility and virulence the effectiveness of these efforts is unknown the fraction of undocumented but infectious cases is a critical epidemiological characteristic that modulates the pandemic potential of an emergent respiratory virus 23 sars-cov-2 is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans sars-cov merscov and sars-cov-2 can cause severe diseases whereas hku1 nl63 oc43 and 229e are associated with mild symptoms 4 it is improbable that sars-cov-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation of a related sars-cov-like coronavirus however the genetic data irrefutably show that sarscov-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone 5 the general symptoms are similar to sars and mers causing cough difficulty breathing fatigue and fever and if not treated properly eventually death 67 coronaviruses are enveloped structures positive single-stranded large rna viruses that infect humans but also a wide range of animals the first virus in the family was described in 1966 by tyrell and bynoe who cultivated the virus obtained of patients with common colds due to its morphology with spherical grooves with a central cap and superficial projections similar to a solar corona the name coronavirus from latin corona crown was designated the coronavirus has four subfamilies alpha- beta- gamma- and delta-coronaviruses while alpha- and beta-coronaviruses apparently originate from mammals in particular from bats gamma- and delta-viruses originate from pigs and birds the genome size goes between 26 kb and 32 kb among the seven subtypes of coronaviruses that can infect humans the beta-coronaviruses may cause severe disease and fatalities whereas alpha-coronaviruses cause asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections 7 during the process of infection there are two proteases that are essential in the process of maturation and infectivity of the virus in the case of sars-cov-2 sequencing of its genome revealed the papain-like protease plpro and the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease 3clpro also known as the main protease-mpro 8 mpro is one of the most studied therapeutic targets at the present time as a possible alternative to the fight against coronavirus proving to be an accessible target for the development of inhibitors 910 mpro is a cysteine protease composed of three domains i ii iii whose main functions are the maturation of viral particles and cleavage of the viral capsid thus releasing viral polypeptides to the body and contributing to the infection to occur in its active form mpro is a homodimer containing two protomers and presents a non-canonical cys-hys dyad located between i and ii 1112 mpro is also structurally conserved among the known varieties of coronavirus with several common characteristics of substrate shared among them where the amino acids of the substrates c and n termini are numbered as -p4-p3-p2-p1  p1-p2-p3- and the cleavage site is located between the p1 and p1 with the need for almost all substrates to have a glycine residue located at the position p1 1314 mpros active sites are highly conserved among the different varieties of coronavirus usually being composed of 4 sites usually referred to as s1 s1 s2 and s4 9 in this work considering the current pandemic of covid-19 around the world we propose use of drug design and lead discovery approaches as well including virtual screening admetox predictions and molecular docking 15 to design new compounds for inhibiting the protease mpro involved on the process of viral infection with sars-cov-2 thus preventing the viral peptide from being cleaved and thereby preventing smaller viral charge from being released into the hosts plasma 16 for such purpose we have compared some repositioned drugs in current clinical studies with sars-cov-2 and proposed novel compounds here designed using virtual screening in drug databases for virtual screening we downloaded structure files deposited in the protein data bank pdb

software genetic optimization for ligand docking performs docking simulations using a genetic algorithm to generate and select conformers of flexible compounds that bind to the receptor site of a protein or dna in addition to be able to use amino acid rotamer libraries in such simulations 17 first in order to proceed with the virtual screening experiments we validated our results by redocking calculating the root mean-square deviation rmsd between the crystallographic pose of the inhibitor and its docking pose for docking-based virtual screening we used the following coordinates for the center of the sphere x  1059 y  1388 and z  6856 also a radius of 125  was here considered two sars-cov-2 targeted libraries available by otava chemicals has been used which contain compounds with

favipiravir hydroxychloroquine lopinavir oseltamivir remdesivir and ritonavir as well as of our molecules selected from the two libraries of mpro inhibitors here used - sars-cov-2-target and

 the derek software deductive estimate of risk from existing know-edge was used to predict the toxicity of the molecules here investigated this software is an expert-system that uses a methodology capable of making qualitative predictions by searches for 2d similarity shared between the investigated molecule and other structures of the database which contain reported toxic moieties predicting by comparison the associated toxicity 20 the results are obtained in the form of alerts that are fired about a possiblepotential toxicity of the investigated molecule which would cause a certain toxic effect on the organism 21 dereks decisions are based on the knowledge-based expert system method for the most diverse and peculiar situations of toxicity including skin sensitization hepatotoxicity nephrotoxicity carcinogenicity mutagenicity and other specific toxicities or endpoints 22 molecular docking simulations between the selected molecules after the previous steps and the biological target mpro pdb 6lu7 were performed with the aid of the gold 20201 software as previously mentioned gold uses genetic algorithm to generate and select conformers of flexible compounds for docking we used the following coordinates for the center of the sphere x  1059 y  1388 and z  6856 and a radius of 125  of docking grid was considered the co-crystallized ligand ions and water molecules were removed from the crystal structure before the docking simulations prior to the calculations hydrogens were added to all the compounds while the respective atomic charges were calculated using the pm3 method for a better performanceaccuracy of the molecular docking the bindingdb webserver offers the possibility of calculating structural similarity 23 using the tanimoto coefficient tc 24 based upon jchem fingerprints resulting in a numerical value of structural similarity between them as we do not know the active conformation of the molecule here selected as a pivot 2d similarity provides satisfactory results for the virtual screening step the tc analyzed the similarities of the selected molecules after the results of the previous step with an fda library from the webserver itself containing 1091 drugs and classified them according to their similarity a file of this classification was generated and analyzed using the discovery studio software 24 from which a group of molecules with similar activity above or equal to 40 was extracted 25 virtual screening is the computational analogue of the high throughput screening hts and it is characterized as the computational screening of chemical compounds deposited in typically large libraries in order to find molecules that can complement biological targets of resolved structure selecting the most potent ones in potential 26 this technique has very low cost-effective as well as high speed to generate result giving enormous benefits to pharmaceutical research that needs urgency such as the sars-cov-2 pandemic there are different and possible protocols for virtual screening and a combined use of tools is important so that results could be even more robust reliable and more likely to be validatedconfirmed in in vitro assays many studies use this technique in the search for chemical entities for the treatment for example of cancer withdrawal syndrome neuropathic and inflammatory pain 27 28 29 the target structure here used in the screening was mpro pdb id 6lu7 which belongs to a family of enzymes that has been extensively studied from viruses such as the ns3 protease from dengue virus 30 the protease hiv-1 31 and others from different viruses that have proteases with known structure as well the two libraries here utilized contain compounds with predicted activity against mpro sars-cov-2-target and sars-cov-2-ml the first library has been designed using structure-based virtual screening flexible docking using crystal structure of mpro the second one has been designed using machine learning artificial neural networks and bayesian statistics based on compounds with known anti-sars activity from each library 100 hits were selected with highest values of affinity score with mpro and they are thus selected to the next stages of this work the infection caused by covid-19 is related to that of sars affecting the pneumocytes and macrophages of the lung which is its target organ also it appears to be related to the ace2 receptor which may protect the host against lung injury as well as to the tmprss2 protein related to facilitating the entry of the virus into the organism both present in the lung 32 this information presents us with the peripheral action of the virus being a requirement for its future therapeutic agent initially we analyzed the pharmacokinetic predictions of antiviral drugs as well as hydroxychloroquine currently available fig 2
 and also under evaluation of biological activity as well as clinical tests in the treatment of covid-19 table 1
 in order to obtain parameters for comparison among our molecules selected using virtual screening whose results are presented in table 2 table 3
 all the molecules here investigated showed results with median to high values for oral absorption as well as median aggregation to plasma proteins most of the evaluated drugs showed a prediction of high cellular permeability both in the results for intestinal cells as well as for renal cells pcaco-2 and pmdck with the exception only for cobicistat and remdesivir most drugs here evaluated using the qikprop software tend to not permeate the cns in potential cobicistat darunavir lopiravir remdesivir and ritonavir but have high cellular permeability darunavir favipiravir hydroxychloroquine lopinavir oseltamivir and ritonavir prediction is median aggregation to protein albumin for all drugs in addition to prediction of low oral absorption for cobicistat darunavir favipiravir oseltamivir remdesivir and ritonavir hydroxychloroquine although a drug indicated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases has been used with initial satisfactory results in the treatment of covid-19 and its pharmacokinetic profile in comparison to that of antivirals and hydroxychloroquine despite of indicating permeation to the cns has a high cellular distribution presenting less aggregation to serum albumin median aggregation in addition to high oral absorption similarly to lopinavir based on the pharmacokinetic profile of antivirals and hydroxychloroquine as well as knowledge of the viruss peripheral performance as well as due to their main clinical manifestations we were able to evaluate the screened molecules regarding the evaluation of the molecules sorted from the sars-cov-2-target library the 25 molecules with the best pharmacokinetic profiles predicted are shown in table 2 considering the number of stars all the results here obtained indicate high reliability indicating chemical similarity to known drug molecules of the qikprop software database such as for the permeability to cns we chose to work with those molecules for which there is a prediction to act at the peripheral level selecting the molecules that presented results for the three parameters evaluated cns qplogbb and psa with a prediction of not crossing the blood-brain barrier since peripheral action is sought due to the clinical characteristics of the disease it can be seen that compared to the profile of antivirals and hydroxychloroquine the profile obtained for molecules from the sars-cov-2-target library is even more satisfactory and adequate in potential cell distribution was predicted from median to high for caco-2 as well as mdck cells median binding to plasma proteins and median to high hoa evaluating the set of predictions made here the 17 molecules selected from the sars-cov-2-ml library and containing the best pharmacokinetic profiles are shown in table 3 considering the number of stars all molecules obtained highly reliable results all molecules selected from the sars-cov-2-ml library that not showed permeability to cns in potential showed indicative results for high oral absorption whereas for none of them high aggregation to plasma proteins was predicted such as for permeability to cns those with prediction to act at the peripheral level were selected following the three parameters evaluated cns logbb and psa for which the prediction was median to high cell distribution both for intestinal cells as well as pcaco-2 and pmdck cells in comparison to the predicted profile for antivirals and hydroxychloroquine it can be noted that the profile of cell distribution pcaco-2 and pmdck logkhsa and hoa of sars-cov-2-ml molecules is also superior young et al 33 reported in their study the result of the combined use of the antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir as pharmacological alternatives initially used to treat atypical pneumonia caused by covid-19 unfortunately among the group of patients evaluated there was no proven efficacy in the treatment with patients who had a clinical evolution to acute respiratory failure in addition to no reduction in viral charge which remained similar to that of untreated patients such information indicates the urgent need for a specific and effective pharmacological alternative against this pandemic disease computational tools used to predict the toxic potential of the most varied molecules can have a significant impact on the discovery and development of drugs and toxicity is one of the fundamental parameters for the continuation of research in drug design and development 34 zhang et al 35 revealed a high-resolution structure of -ketoamide bound to the protease responsible for a block of the viral rna replication they report that -ketoamide has a prolonged half-life in the blood plasma in addition they tested their main inhibitory compound in mice finding that inhalation was well tolerated and that the mice had no adverse effects they suggested therefore that since human proteases with a similar cleavage specificity are not known it is unlikely that this class of inhibitors will be toxic which results in a useful structure for the development of drugs to combat the new coronavirus in this study derek software was used to predict the toxicological properties of the drugs under study with sars-cov-2 cobicistat darunavir favipiravir hydroxychloroquine lopinavir oseltamivir remdesivir and ritonavir as well as the molecules selected from libraries of mpro inhibitors this software has a system that makes predictions from a qualitative point of view and thus alerts are fired about the possible toxic action of the analyzed chemical compounds being able to interpret toxicophoric substructures present in the compounds as possible inducers of certain types of toxicity such as mutagenicity carcinogenicity skin sensitization irritation reproductive effects neurotoxicity among others through correlation rules established by the software for the drugs here investigated the fired alerts are described belowcobicistat plausible hepatotoxicity probably due to the thiazole or derivative and carbamate group in addition to inhibition of the herg channelsdarunavir plausible hepatotoxicity probably due to the presence of the 4-aminophenylsulphonamide or

 favipiravir is an antiviral agent that selective and potently inhibits rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp from rna viruses favipiravir was discovered by hts screening of the chemical library for antiviral activity against the influenza virus by toyama chemical co ltd favipiravir undergoes intracellular phosphoribosylation to be an active form favipiravir-rtp favipiravir- rtp favipiravir ribofuranosyl-5b-triphosphate which is recognized as a substrate for rdrp that inhibits the activity of rna polymerase because the catalytic domain of rdrp is conserved among various types of rna viruses this mechanism of action supports a broader spectrum broad range of antiviral activities of favipiravir favipiravir is effective against a wide variety of influenza virus types and subtypes including strains resistant to existing anti-influenza drugs and is potentially promising for specifically intractable rna viral infections 36 on the other hand favipiravir presents a risk of teratogenicity and embryotoxicity therefore the ministry of health labor and welfare has granted conditional marketing approval with strict regulations for its production and clinical use 37 in a study by furuta et al 38 it was found that favipiravir has a potent and selective inhibitory activity against the influenza virus in an in vitro plaque reduction assay favipiravir showed potent inhibitory activity against influenza a b and c viruses with 50 inhibitory concentrations ic50 of 0013 to 048 gml while showing no cytotoxicity in concentrations up to 1000 gml in mdck cells hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are respectively used in the treatment of malaria and rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus and inflammatory rheumatic diseases and are considered weak bases these drugs interfere with lysosomal activity and autophagy interact with membrane stability and alter signaling pathways and transcriptional activity which can result in the inhibition of cytokine production and the modulation of certain costimulatory molecules these modes of action together with the chemical properties of the drug can explain the clinical efficacy and known adverse effects such as retinopathy and cardiac arrythmia of these drugs 39 cortegiani et al 40 systematically reviewed the evidence on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of covid-19 they found that chloroquine appears to be effective in limiting sars-cov-2 replication in vitro however in this present study hydroxychloroquine presented plausible hepatotoxicity probably due to the quinoline group inhibition of the herg channels carcinogenicity and irritation of the respiratory tract ethanolamine and ocular toxicity derived from 4-aminoquinoline demonstrating the high degree of toxicity of this drug reaffirming yam and kwok 41 cite that one of the main side effects of hydroxychloroquine is ocular toxicity which can adversely affect the cornea the ciliary body and the retina on the other hand recent studies suggest that the internal retina is not significantly damaged with the development of human hydroxychloroquine toxicity 42 toxicity of ethanolamine was studied by the toxicology committee in 1967 the study by weeks et al 43 indicated that skin and eye irritation in addition to immediate signs of irritability and restlessness followed by cns depression were the main adverse effects observed in experimental animals not anesthetized and exposed to ethanolamine at 1226 ppm for 24 h continuous exposure to 56 ppm produced some behavioral changes in the animals but only after 23 weeks of exposure sang et al 44 chose six approved anti-hiv-1 drugs to investigate their interactions with mpro as well as to assess the potential to become clinical drugs for the new coronavirus pneumonia covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 infection they found that darunavir has the best binding affinity for mpro among all tested inhibitors indicating that it has the potential to become a clinical drug to treat covid-19 however the results of the toxicological properties of this drug point out warnings such as hepatotoxicity and mutagenicity as well which deserve attention qamar et al 16 examined a database of medicinal plants containing 32297 phytochemicals as potential antivirals and selected nine promising drug-free and non-toxic natural products that can inhibit mpro activity and therefore virus replication the nine products are 5734tetrahydroxy233dimethylalyl isoflavone myrricitrin methyl rosmarinate 357345hexahydroxyflavanone3obetadglucopyranoside 2seriodictyol 7o6ogalloylbetadglucopyranoside calceolarioside b micricetin 3obetadglucopyranoside licoleafol and amaranth a study by singh and konwar 45 performed molecular coupling of the epigallocatechin gallate egcg and its analogs against the virus mpro enzyme previous reports have indicated egcg as an mpro inhibitor but with a low oral bioavailability thus stimulating its molecular optimization according to these reported data the analogues bound to the enzyme active site and these improved the pharmacological properties estimated in comparison with the egcg in predicting admetox of the analogs the study revealed that they have improved pharmacological properties fisher et al 46 computationally examined a library of 687 million compounds for binding to the crystal structure of mpro they evaluated the potential toxic effects of the compounds due to the interaction with 16 known drugs and then made a final selection of 11 compounds compounds with an improvement in binding free energy in contrast to the cocrystallized inhibitor were considered for their potential toxicity among the compounds evaluated the authors found that the natural compound containing the lowest value of free binding energy was taxifoline according to jo et al 47 coronaviruses have been the target of some flavonoids where it is assumed that the antiviral activity of some flavonoids against covs is directly caused by the inhibition of mpro regarding the screened molecules of 100 molecules selected from the sars-cov-2-target library 33 did not present any human toxicity alert table 4

evaluating the amino acids his41 and cys145 present in the active site of said protease protomer a 49 they were used with the purpose of comparing the docking results in addition to the amino acid residues that showed the highest number of interactions with ligands all the molecules interact with the amino acid residue cys145 with the exception of m74 however with the amino acid residue his41 only the hydroxychloroquine drug and the screened molecules m57 m113 m135 and m808 showed interactions molecular docking results indicated the lowest number of interactions for the drug favipiravir - 6 interactions being 1 hydrophobic and 5 hydrogen bonds with the amino acids gly143 ser144 cys145 and his163 and 5 interactions for m824 2 of which are hydrophobic and 3 are hydrogen bonds with the amino acids gly143 ser144 cys145 and met165 the observed score value was 383 for the drug favipiravir which is the lowest one observed among the molecules here investigated and 7018 for m824 hydroxychloroquine and m494 molecules showed the highest number of interactions 14 for each for the first 11 hydrophobic interactions and 3 hydrogen bonds were observed with amino acid residues his41 met49 gly143 cys145 his163 met165 and glu166 with a score value of 6607 each of the amino acid residues his41 met49 cys145 and met165 had at least two points of hydrophobic interaction with hydroxychloroquine and glu166 had two points of hydrogen bonding gly143 presented only one hydrogen bonding point and his163 had a hydrophobic interaction point with the inhibitor for m494 4 hydrophobic interactions and 10 hydrogen bonds were identified with the amino acid residues leu141 ser144 cys145 met165 glu166 arg188 gln189 and thr190 obtaining a score value of 7442 in this case the amino acid residues met165 and gln189 had two points of hydrophobic interaction with sars-cov-2-mlm494 while ser144 and cys145 had two points of hydrogen bonding the gln189 residue in addition to the two hydrophobic interactions also showed a hydrogen bond with the inhibitor finally the amino acid residues leu141 glu166 arg188 and thr190 presented a hydrogen bonding point with the inhibitor each one molecules with intermediate number of interactions were m74 8 m135 8 m351 9 m603 8 and m808 8 with satisfactory score values for the best pose equal to 753 6141 7036 6845 and 7355 respectively m74 did not interact with the amino acid residues belonging to the catalytic site unlike the m135 and m808 molecules that managed to interact with the his41 and cys145 residues the molecule that had the highest score value 8075 was m152 a total of 7 interactions were observed with 4 hydrophobic interactions and 3 hydrogen bonds in this case each of the amino acid residues met49 cys145 glu166 and leu167 presented only one point of interaction as an inhibitor these interactions being hydrophobic for met49 and cys145 and hydrogen bond for glu166 and leu167 the amino acid residue pro168 was the only one that showed multiple interactions with the m152 inhibitor two hydrophobic interactions and one hydrogen bond however there was no interaction with the amino acid residue his41 belonging to the catalytic site of mpro the m57 and m113 molecules stand out for having a satisfactory number of interactions and score value emphasizing that the first was the molecule studied that showed interaction with the largest number of amino acid residues 8 for m57 12 interactions were observed 6 of them hydrophobic and 6 of hydrogen bonds the amino acids leu27 his41 gly143 cys145 met165 glu166 pro168 and gln189 and the score value obtained for the best pose was 73 69 for m113 10 interactions were identified 9 of them hydrophobic and 1 hydrogen bond with the amino acids his41 met49 cys145 met165 glu166 pro168 and gln189 and a score value of 7257 it is important to note that both had score values higher than those obtained for the drugs studied considering the amino acids gly143 cys145 his163 his164 glu166 gln189 and tyr190 that bind with the crystallographic inhibitor n3 only the m494 molecule interacted with the tyr190 residue for the amino acid gly143 there was interaction only with the favipiravir hydroxychloroquine m57 and m824 molecules for the amino acid cys145 all molecules interacted with the exception of m74 the his163 residue interacted only with the favipiravir hydroxychloroquine m74 and m135 molecules no linker interacted with the amino acid residue his164 the amino acid residue glu166 showed interaction with all molecules except with favipiravir and m824 the gln189 residue on the other hand interacted only with the m57 m113 and m494 molecules the amino acid residues cys145 met165 pro168 and gln189 proved to be capable of making multiple chemical interactions of different nature with the inhibitors its multiple interactions are present both in the cases in which the inhibitors had the highest number of interactions with the target and in the case in which the inhibitor presented the highest score value among the twelve selected molecules therefore the amino acid residues met165 pro168 and gln189 showed their relevance in multiple interactions of different chemical natures between the inhibitor and the target in addition to the his41 and cys145 residues already belonging to the active site of mpro and we can select the m57 molecule as the most promising drug candidate for treatment of covid-19 fig 4

 there is no conflict of interest  ethical issues related to the hydroxychloroquine treatment prescription for covid 19 problmes thiques lis  la prescription de lhydroxychloroquine pour le traitement des malades covid 19 problmes thiques lis  la prescription de lhydroxychloroquine pour le traitement des malades covid 19 karima rhazi el latifa adarmouch   la pandmie de coronavirus 2019-2020 covid- 19  conduit au syndrome respiratoire aigu svre coronavirus 2 sras-cov-2  ce jour aucun mdicament na dmontr son innocuit et son efficacit dans des essais contrls randomiss pour les patients atteints de covid-19 bien que lassociation entre lhydroxychloroquine et lazithromycine manque de preuves solides plusieurs gouvernements lont adopte pour tous les cas de covid-19 confirms mme pour ceux qui sont asymptomatiques dans ce qui suit nous discutons certains des problmes thiques associs  lutilisation de cette association thrapeutique nous avons principalement essay de discuter les questions controverses suivantes est-il thique de ne pas traiter un patient alors quun traitement existe et est utilis pour dautres indications que le covid-19 pour lequel il nest pas encore prouv si oui un essai contrl randomis pour prouver lhydroxychloroquine pour le traitement covid-19 est-il ncessaire dans le contexte de la pandmie covid-19 si non le gouvernement a-t-il le droit de dcider du traitement  lhydroxychloroquine pour tous les patients de covid-19 et quelles devraient tre les attitudes des mdecins enfin quels sont les droits et responsabilits du gouvernement des mdecins et des patients le document conclut que puisque the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic  has led to major morbidity in the form of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and more than 265 862 deaths 1  to date and after the fifth months into the novel coronavirus pandemic no drugs have demonstrated safety and efficacy in randomized controlled trials for patients with covid-19 several agents such as hydroxychloroquine lopinavir ritonavir and azithromycin are being used under clinical trial and compassionate use protocols based on in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 or related viruses and on limited clinical experience 2 3  although the association between hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin efficacy lack of solid evidence-base it has been largely mediatized some experts are defending the efficacy of this association based on previous experiences on malaria and also based on some of their observations made upon covid-19 patients 4  who refuted all allegations for the effectiveness of any drug and recommended only symptomatic treatment and monitoring for covid-19 many developed countries as china european countries and the usa are still very cautious about any proposed drug and are waiting for many ongoing clinical trials to be over 5  despite the doubt and uncertainty about a drug effectiveness for covid-19 several governments have adopted the hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin association for all virology confirmed covid-19 cases even for those who are asymptomatic 6  this decision has raised many questions and some ethical issues related to the hydroxychloroquine treatment prescription might emerge during the covid-19 patients management in the following we aim to discuss some of these ethical issues associated with the use of this treatment association its admitted that all authorized drugs should be proven in the case of hydroxychloroquine it is not proven for covid-19 yet its labeled indication is for the treatment of malaria its use in the covid-19 is therefore off-label that is why its use in the context of covid-19 is rising many controversial questions is it ethical not to treat a patient while a treatment exists and is used for other indications than covid-19 for which its not proven yet if yes is a randomized controlled trial to prove the hydroxychloroquine for the covid- 19 first of all randomization is the best way to avoid selection and information bias and equipoise is the main justification for randomization it could be overlooked only when a treatment is clearly superior and in this case randomization will put one group of patients at a disadvantage many historical examples for effective treatment were based only on observational studies that were adequate enough to show effectiveness without recourse to randomization eg penicillin for bacterial infections smallpox vaccination  in the case of hydroxychloroquine and covid-19 we may ask if there is sufficient scientific and medical evidence to prescribe this drug as a treatment a recent systematic review on the efficacy and safety of chloroquine for the treatment of covid-19 7 concluded that there is sufficient preclinical rationale and evidence regarding the effectiveness of chloroquine for treatment of covid-19 as well as evidence of safety from long-time use in clinical practice for other indications 8 to justify clinical research on the topic based on this conclusion the question related to the prescription of this drug as a treatment for covid-19 is not answered yet however one could argue that the worldwide emergency the rapid spread of the disease and the high rates of disease mortality mainly at the beginning of the pandemic 9  are sufficient reasons for prescribing this off-label treatment for covid-19 patients if the answer is yes there remain the questions of what are the main ethical principles to be applied in this case and is there other evidence based pathway other than randomized clinical trial to support new purposes of this drug in the context of covid-19 pandemic characterized by a high case fatality rate cfr reported to be 15 in the initial period of the pandemic 9  health-care leaders and policy makers need such estimates of mortality and case fatality even they were changing all over the time 10 and between cases illness severity 10  to be guided in forming strategies at national level from a public health perspective including patient care strategy meuri monitored emergency use of unregistered interventions framework group stated that in such emergency situation it can be ethically appropriate to offer individual patients experimental interventions on an emergency basis outside clinical trials 11  this is even more true when the best available therapeutic option fails and patients demand new approach or new treatment and physicians promote patients interests by prescribing products off-label 12  and also when the use of the best available drug is supported by some expert opinion 11  which is the case of the hydroxychloroquine however the clinical use of such drugs should adhere to the meuri framework 11 and the four principles of medical ethics respect for autonomy beneficence non-maleficence and justice should be respected the ebola outbreak in the democratic republic of congo is a good example illustrating this reasoning where vaccine trials have been conducted under the scrutiny of the meuri method 13  some results from these trials suggest robust vaccine efficacy within 10 days and good tolerance when administered to healthy non-pregnant adults 14 while some authors deplore that none of the promising treatments used in ebola field trials could so far be convincingly confirmed as curative 15 and the meuri circumstances should not substitute for properly designed trials having said that agarwal propose a pluralistic evidence instead of a randomized clinical considering all available sources and types of data including laboratory studies on mechanisms of action in vitro experiments on human biopsies in vivo animal models quality of life data clinical trials of offlabel drug use etc 16  the pluralistic evidence approach may be feasible and acceptable in the covid-19 pandemic it can provide data of sufficient quality to fill the evidence gap for the efficacy and safety of such off-label medicine a more complete causal association while minimizing the potential biases and practitioners can be more confident and less reluctant for its prescription in modern societies the governments duty to provide healthcare is established by law does this mean that the government has the right to decide whether a treatment even not proven yet should be prescribed as a treatment in habitual situations authorities monitor off-label drug uses regularly collect and publicize information about off-label uses and consider proposals to regulate certain off-label uses as well as other proposed policy measures that could decrease risky and ineffective off-label prescribing 8 12  however in the covid-19 pandemic the government is promoting the off-label drug prescription in doing so decision-makers should be guided by any available scientific evidence about the intervention expected benefits and harms 11  when specific evidence is not available decisions should be based on reasoned and evidence-informed substantive arguments from analogous situations to the possible extent 11  however at some point in an emergency context decisions are still very difficult to make especially when it comes to the weight to be given to treat patients in pandemic context compared to other important public health priorities 17  this should not be a reason to not include clinicians and patients in this decision-making process otherwise this decision may be considered unacceptably paternalistic many doctors are currently facing the dilemma of a choice between the two options either prescribing not yet proven treatment with many unanswered questions on the one hand or to be limited to symptomatic treatment as recommended by who on the other they may ask what might be the ethical implications of doing so while the government has decided on the treatment prescription some doctors may feel forced to prescribe a treatment regimen of which they are not necessarily convinced and may feel double challenging should they strictly follow the therapeutic protocol as dictated by their government should they present that treatment to their patients as experimental or as therapeutic the physicians duty is to provide clear clinical information to his patient in accordance with the universal rules of ethics in addition in standard situation responsible off-label prescribing requires physicians to i evaluate whether there is sufficient evidence to justify an off-label use ii press for additional information and adequate evidence and iii inform patients about the uncertainties and potential costs associated with off-label prescribing 12  however explaining the risks and benefits in detail and explaining also that although this treatment has had good results in other indications its effectiveness for covid 19 is not yet proven is not an easy task in such context in addition some could argue that taking the time to explain all details about the complexities of off-label drug use in an emergency context could distract from shared clinical goals 18 19  this challenge is even more complicated in developing countries considering the context of multicultural specificity different dialects medical paternalistic decisions often required by patients the social vulnerability which is deepened more and more by the pandemic high level of illiteracy low socioeconomic level in addition because in some countries 6  the treatment has been recommended for all patients even for those who are asymptomatic some doctors argued that the treatment should be given only to moderate to critically ill patients such targeting of the treatment however may be viewed from a public health emergency perspective as to be less effective in reducing the spread of the disease in the contact patients and the whole population such attitude may undermine the public health goal as individual interests outweigh the collective ones the first concern when it comes to patients is related to the principle of beneficence and nonmaleficence to address this concern we need to answer two questions the first question is whether there is enough evidence as to the benefits of the hydroxychloroquine reluctancy regarding the use of this drug for the treatment of patients with covid-19 is justified by the absence of a high level of scientific evidence namely randomized controlled clinical trials proving the superiority of this drug for this indication as we discussed above in the presence of such a crisis waiting for the results of randomized clinical trials might be considered a luxury the second question is to what extent the risks related to hydroxychloroquine are acceptable and justifiable by the benefits it comes to how much we know about this drug safety and tolerance in the particular case of hydroxychloroquine the drug is known and has been used for so many years for malaria treatment and prophylaxis as well as some autoimmune conditions 3  this means it has been used among large patients populations and clinicians have long experience with prescribing it and monitoring its side effects in the effort of trying to address these concerns we would want to provide the best care for patients considering available knowledge and at the same time generate valid evidence for the future the off-label and unlicensed use of drugs is quite common in medical practice several reasons explain this phenomenon in a recent paper agarwal discusses a pluralistic method for ethical and efficient evidence generation for off-label medication use in a real-world situation 4  do not allow us to wait for generating high-quality evidence before proposing promising drugs a recent example is the recent ebola outbreak in the democratic republic of congo that has raised similar discussions the world health organization advised the monitored emergency use of unregistered interventions meuri 16  bhadelia et al also proposed a set of recommendations on how to choose among available options and to collect data to build the evidence 20  such perspectives and examples can be considered for translation in the situation of the covid-19 pandemic since the beginning of this pandemic scientists started exploring the available options 20 21  to date there is no proved vaccine or treatment for covid-19 but several papers supporting the rationale for chloroquine use have been published 22  some articles reported on preclinical data 4 or preliminary clinical data 23  in many countries the use of hydroxychloroquine is recommended by health authorities as this is the case in morocco 6  finally clinical trials are ongoing to provide further evidence 24  which will provide a supplementary argument for ethicists to solve this question the second concern is related to the principle of respect for persons with an emphasis on patients autonomy and healthcare providers transparency or veracity off-label prescription is considered legal and is quite frequent a common example is the prescription of many drugs among children because those drugs were not tested and evaluated among this population 7  another example is aspirin which was prescribed to prevent cardiovascular events for many years before it was licensed by the fda for this indication on the other hand it is recognized that off-label prescriptions can be dangerous and are generally more expensive thus it is important to emphasize informed consent and shared decision-making 25  in the case of chloroquine it is a cheap drug but the probability of side effects is present several arguments for requiring consent for off-label use were proposed including that it is a means to respect the patients autonomy to account for the potential risk to patients related to the lack of scientific evidence another set of arguments could be discussed for not requiring this consent the procedure of obtaining approval for all different uses might be considered not cost-effective for pharmaceutical companies the use of licensed drugs is not without risks it is also possible that discussing the off-label nature of the use confuses the patient 26  obtaining valid informed consent requires that the patients should be informed that the proposed treatment is not licensed for this indication with available rationale and data justifying its consideration for the situation appropriate information and consideration for the patients autonomy should lead to shared decision-making achieving informed consent and shared decision-making is the application of the principles of patient autonomy and veracity this paper highlighted some ethical issues related to the prescription of an off-label drug in the pandemic conditions in such context the limits between the governments practitioners and patients rights and obligations are not clear which could significantly endanger the universal ethical principles in clinical practice it could also undermine any attempt to develop serious clinical trials to prove the considered off-label drug since health authorities in some countries recommended this off-label use physicians are challenged by the requirement of veracity while providing care to their patients and the implications of such a requirement furthermore physicians are facing the challenge of balancing this guideline and their own conviction the fundamental principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence and respect for persons should underlie any reflection process to address this dilemma hence there is an urgent need for guidance to encourage proper off-label use of drugs in an emergency situation this step should be taken only considering grounded ethical and legal principles and if the important decisions about the drug prescription is taken through a process that is transparent inclusive and appropriately communicated to practitioners as well as the general public 27 with the development of culturally-sensitive communication strategies this may be achievable with relatively modest resources  when there is a pandemic there is no time to waste should we have hydroxychloroquine in our armoury against covid-19 infected patients dimitrios bogdanos p zoi daniil epaminondas zakynthinos konstantinos gourgoulianis lazaros sakkas i   there is no certainty that chloroquine andor hydroxychloroquine is efficacious for the severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 or covid-19-infected patients with pneumonia especially immunocompromised patients we wish to enter to the ongoing debate as to whether this well-known drug must be given to greek covid-19-infected patients especially those with pneumonia the available data thus far are limited originate mainly from china and are inadequate to reach to a safe conclusion it is generally accepted that no medication should be given to a patient unless it causes much more good than harm but at times of crisis as most leaders of the world state with regard to the covid-19 pandemic such rules may not apply httpswwwbbccomnewsworld-us-canada-51955450 based on the italian and spanish experience we anticipate that we will have a shortage of

 the safety profile of the drug specifically for covid-19 treated patients is also a topic of intense research the copcov french observational study will recruit 1000 participants and will address adverse events related to treatments used against sars-cov-2 including chloroquine in uk a randomised placebo-controlled prophylaxis study nct04303507 will assess the prophylactic effect of chloroquine chloroquine prevention of coronavirus disease covid-19 in the healthcare setting this study is a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial that will be conducted in health care settings it will include healthcare workers or other individuals at significant risk who can be followed up for 5 months 10000 participants will be recruited and the investigators predict an average of 200 participants per site in 50 sites a loading dose of 10mgkg of body weight will be given followed by 150 mg daily 250mg chloroquine phosphate salt which will be taken for 3 months or until they are diagnosed with covid-19 subsequent episodes of symptomatic respiratory illness including symptomatic covid-19 clinical outcomes and asymptomatic covid-19 infection will be recorded during the follow-up period clinical trials of this kind are initiated based on the urgent need for prompt anti-viral treatment and preliminary in vitro and in vivo data some experts think hydroxychloroquine is a promising start for the treatment of covid-19-related pneumonia the drugs anti-coronavirus activity has been demonstrated49 hydroxychloroquine appears to be more potent in vitro inhibitor than chloroquine in inhibiting sars-cov-2 infected vero cells10 and inhibits hcov-oc43 infected hrt-18 cells7 these data have also been corroborated by findings in infected mice7 but we still miss data on sars-cov-2 it also looks like chloroquine also exerts its anti-viral action by increasing endosomal ph required for viruscell fusion511 it also interferes with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of sars-cov and this may at least in part explain its potent efficacy in treating patients with covid-19 pneumonia5 chloroquine may also have an anti-thrombotic effect in covid-19 patients appearing with vasculitides or thrombotic episodes it may also play an inhibitory role in the cytokine storm phenomenon noted in covid-19 ards through the abrogation of pro-inflammatory cytokine release it is not clear though what the effect of the drug is on antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses against covid-19 immunodominant antigens
we suggest the following initiativesthe greek health authorities must secure large amounts of hydroxychloroquinechloroquine sufficient enough to cover the countrys needs before the extreme amplification phase of the pandemic very recently a greek pharmaceutical company imported a large amount of chloroquine and will provide for free 24 million doses to the greek health authorities for general hospital needs

 in conclusion the question of whether hydroxychloroquine is efficacious for the treatment of covid-19 associated pneumonia will be answered in the not too distant future in fact by the time this article is published we will probably have some answers  cardiovascular considerations in treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 dave dixon l benjamin van tassell w alessandra vecchi aldo bonaventura azita talasaz h hessam kakavand fabrizio dascenzo antonio perciaccante davide castagno enrico ammirati giuseppe biondi-zoccai michael stevens p antonio abbate   the first cases of pneumonia due to a novel betacoronavirus were first identified in december 2019 in wuhan china1 later named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has infected hundreds of thousands across 6 continents1 the overall case-fatality rate of covid-19 remains in flux but was initially reported to be 23 in mainland china while italy has reported a case-fatality rate of 7223 of note case-fatality rates have been reportedly higher in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease2 the transmission of sars-cov-2 occurs by person-to-person spread through respiratory droplets and self-inoculation after contact with virus on contaminated surfaces the disease has an incubation period of approximately 5 days4 the most common signs and symptoms of covid-19 include fever dry cough shortness of breath and myalgia however some patients present with gastrointestinal eg diarrhea nausea and vomiting or neurological eg headache hypogeusia and hyposmia symptoms56 cardiovascular complications such as myocarditis acute myocardial infarction and heart failure have been reported as has been previously observed with other acute upper respiratory infections eg influenza7 an extensive discussion of these complications and their relationship to covid-19 has been described elsewhere8 currently there is no established treatment or vaccine against sars-cov-2 several antiviral and immunomodulating therapies have been used and are under clinical investigation sars-cov-2 infection seems to lead to a more severe disease in patients who are elderly or have comorbidities9 in this review we provide an overview of the pharmacology and cardiovascular considerations with the most promising therapies being investigated for use in patients with covid-19 with a particular consideration on how the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection may be particularly challenging in patients with or at risk for cardiovascular diseases fig 1 while a complete understanding of covid-19 is lacking reports from china and italy describe 2 phases of the disease1011 the initial phase is primarily an infection characterized by predominantly lower respiratory symptoms of which most patients recover however some patients progress to an immune-mediated respiratory failure leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multiple organ failure which is associated with a very high mortality rate9 early approaches to treatment have involved antiviral therapies aimed at reducing viral replication representing the main pathogenetic mechanism at least in the early phase immunomodulatory therapies targeting the inflammatory response that leads to ards are also being explored it is important to recognize that at this time there are only low-quality data to support the use of any therapy for covid-19 and the field is evolving rapidly therefore this review should not be considered to be comprehensive a summary of the current approaches to prevention and treatment is described in figure 2 it is important to consider that the patients at greatest risk for covid-19related mortality and in whom aggressive treatment should be considered are also receiving concomitant cardiovascular therapies therefore drugdrug interactions must be considered and accounted for when managing cardiovascular patients with covid-19 table 1 the antimalarial agents hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are commonly used to treat autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis and disrupt immune activation at the cellular level by inhibiting both innate and adaptive immune responses in addition by impairing endosomal and lysosomal acidification which is required for viruscell binding these therapies may exert antiviral activity16
in vitro studies suggest that chloroquine may be more potent at inhibiting sars-cov-2 than hydroxychloroquine but hydroxychloroquine seems to be less toxic16 hydroxychloroquine is administered orally in a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg twice daily for 4 days17 electrocardiogram ecg monitoring is recommended to watch for cardiac arrhythmias including qt prolongation torsade de pointe and atrioventricular block8 a reduction in the dose or discontinuation should be considered with qtc 500 ms or an increase in qtc 60 ms and caution is advised if used together with other therapies that prolong qtc especially antiarrhythmics an antimalarial-induced hypertrophic restrictive cardiomyopathy can also occur but this is exceedingly rare and occurs with prolonged use which is not a concern given the short duration 5 days of treatment required for covid-1918 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine also inhibit cyp2d6 which may increase beta-blocker exposure and risk of bradycardia pr interval prolongation and atrioventricular block other potential adverse effects include severe hypoglycemia erythroderma hematological and psychiatric disturbances thus routine monitoring should include a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel a small pilot study19 randomized 30 patients to either the intervention hydroxychloroquine 400 mg daily for 5 days or conventional therapy only on day 7 patients were tested through respiratory pharyngeal swab for evidence of covid-19 nucleic acid there was no difference in the number of negative swabs between the hydroxychloroquine n  13 and control n  14 groups p  005 no favorable trends were observed in other secondary measures including duration of hospitalization body temperature regulation or radiological progression in another small single-arm study the effects of hydroxychloroquine 600 mg daily in hospitalized patients on the presence or absence of virus at day 6 were studied20 twenty-six french subjects received the protocol and 16 served as controls six stopped hydroxychloroquine therapy early due to either being transferred to the intensive care unit n  3 leaving the hospital n  1 death n  1 or nausea n  1 on day 6 of treatment 70 of hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were virologically cured compared with only 125 in the control group p  0001 the addition of the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more effective for virus elimination with a 100 cure rate suggesting this combination may be superior to hydroxychloroquine alone the same authors have published a preprint21 of a larger sample n  80 of patients who received the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin showing clinical improvement in all but 2 patients the authors report that only 15 of subjects required oxygen therapy 93 had a negative nasopharyngeal viral load on day 8 and the length of stay was limited to an average of 5 days despite the favorable outcomes reported in these observational studies a proper randomized controlled trial is warranted before any definitive decisions can be made regarding the role of these therapies in treating covid-19 although the mechanism of how azithromycin would be effective in patients with covid-19 azithromycin has been found to have antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects in both in vivo and in vitro studies202223 azithromycin also has activity against proinflammatory cytokines interleukin il-6 and il-8 which may reduce the development of cytokine storm but this warrants further study22 one potential concern however with concomitant antimalarial therapy with azithromycin is the potential for qtc prolongation warranting daily ecg monitoring24 although other macrolides have demonstrated similar effects azithromycin minimally inhibits cyp3a4 while others eg erythromycin and clarithromycin are strong inhibitors of cyp3a4 and not as well tolerated as azithromycin at this time the data supporting the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for covid-19 are very limited given the potential for significant toxicity use of this regimen should be considered with caution some have also suggested there may be a role for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine to be used for prophylaxis in high-risk individuals such as health care workers therefore chloroquine is being studied as a potential preventative measure against covid-19 in health care workers and other individuals in high-risk environments nct04303507 participants will be randomized to placebo or chloroquine loading dose of 10 mgkg followed by 150 mg daily for 3 months the primary outcome will be the number of covid-19 cases at 100 days at this time however there is little evidence for pharmacological measures to reduce the transmission of sars-cov-2 in health care workers or other high-risk individuals remdesivir gilead sciences inc foster city ca is a nucleotide analog prodrug with broad antiviral activity initially used against ebola25 in vivo and in vitro testing has shown to inhibit human coronavirus replication including sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov152627 remdesivir was initially only available for compassionate use but received orphan drug status from the us food and drug administration fda on march 23 2020 the recommended dosing is an initial single dose of 200 mg intravenously followed by 100 mg every 24 hours for the duration of the hospitalization up to 10 days25 several phase 3 clinical trials are underway in the united states south korea china and europe nct04302766 nct04280705 nct04292899 nct04292730 2020-000936-23 two of the larger ongoing multicenter clinical trials nct04292899 nct04292730 are evaluating remdesivir in hospitalized patients with moderate n  600 or severe n  400 symptoms not yet requiring mechanical ventilation patients in these studies are randomized to 5 or 10 days of remdesivir or to an additional standard of care arm in the moderate disease trial with a focus on discharge fever and oxygen saturation at 14 days patients with more severe symptoms requiring mechanical ventilation must pursue individual compassionate use protocols in to receive access to remdesivir importantly these trials have no cardiovascular-specific reasons for exclusion overall remdesivir is generally well tolerated but self-limiting hepatotoxicity has been observed nephrotoxicity is also possible thus its use is not recommended in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate 30 mlmin173 m2 or those on dialysis monitoring recommendations include a complete blood count with differential and a comprehensive metabolic panel there is limited information available at this time regarding the potential for drugdrug interactions with remdesivir information from a clinical trial protocol nct04280705 suggests that remdesivir is a prodrug that is metabolized to its active form as a substrate of cyp3a4 and remdesivir is a substrate for cyp2c8 cyp2d6 and cyp3a4 in vitro yet it also states that coadministration with drugs that affect these cyp isoforms is unlikely to significantly affect the metabolism of remdesivir lopinavir is a protease inhibitor primarily used for the treatment of hiv that is combined with ritonavir and another protease inhibitor that also inhibits cyp3a4 and is combined with lopinavir to enhance its potency28 from a cardiovascular perspective lopinavirritonavir does not induce endothelial dysfunction or insulin resistance however it can cause hypertriglyceridemia2930 a retrospective single-center study suggests that ritonavir-boosted regimens may worsen cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hiv and heart failure31 importantly these data are not sufficient to restrict the use of lopinavirritonavir in patients with cardiovascular disease or heart failure given the life-threatening potential of covid-19 and short-term 2 weeks duration of treatment there are notable drugdrug interactions with lopinavirritonavir and select cardiovascular therapies because ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of cyp3a4 and p-glycoprotein mdr132 this may result in increased concentrations of cardiovascular therapies metabolized through cyp3a4 such as rivaroxaban apixaban simvastatin and lovastatin all of which should not be used in combination with ritonavir3334 likewise ritonavir inhibits the bioactivation of clopidogrel and prasugrel which may decrease antiplatelet activity however this may not affect the antiplatelet activity of prasugrel making it still a reasonable option3536 ticagrelor should not be used with strong inhibitors of cyp3a4 such as ritonavir due to an increased risk of bleeding3536 the use of p2y12 platelet function assays may be appropriate to ensure adequate antiplatelet activity gastrointestinal symptoms eg nausea vomiting and diarrhea and elevations in hepatic transaminases can also occur routine monitoring includes complete blood count comprehensive metabolic panel and a baseline ecg is recommended when used with concomitant agents eg antiarrhythmics that prolong the qt interval recently 199 hospitalized patients with severe covid-19 disease were randomized to either a fixed dose of lopinavirritonavir 400 and 100 mg respectively twice daily for 14 days or standard of care28 the intervention did not improve time to clinical improvement or mortality although the study was underpowered to detect a mortality benefit gastrointestinal complaints nausea vomiting and diarrhea were also common and 138 of patients discontinued therapy due to adverse events additional clinical trials are ongoing including one clinical trial comparing lopinavirritonavir with hydroxychloroquine nct04307693 and another clinical trial comparing lopinavirritonavir with remdesivir 2020-000936-23 in patients with covid-19 of note interferon-beta may also be used in combination with lopinavirritonavir which has been shown to improve pulmonary function and reduce viral loads in marmosets and mice with middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus but this has not yet been evaluated in humans2637 patients with severe infection may progress to severe respiratory failure due to ards mediated by a catastrophic inflammatory cascade3839 early observations in china and italy led to widespread use of tocilizumab a fully humanized monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor il-6r4041 although originally fda approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis tocilizumab is routinely used in the treatment of cytokine release syndrome secondary to chimeric antigen receptor t-cell therapy in hematologic malignancies42 an observational series of patients with severe respiratory symptoms in china showed recovery in 1921 91 after treatment with tocilizumab 4 mgkg iv maximum dose of 400 mg43 other emerging treatment protocols recommend more aggressive doses 8 mgkg up to 800 mg and repeated doses at 12 and 24 hours for patients showing inadequate responses the primary risks of tocilizumab relate to immunosuppression through neutropenia and interruption of t-cell-mediated immunity infusion reactions and transient transaminase elevations may also occur frequently although tocilizumab significantly increases cholesterol levels and blood pressure a recent network meta-analysis found the cardiovascular risk with tocilizumab was comparable with other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs44 regardless given the high mortality rate among patients with covid-19mediated ards 50 the potential benefits of short-term tocilizumab use seem to outweigh risks of treatment for most patients the parallels in inflammatory pathophysiology between chimeric antigen receptor t-cell therapymediated cytokine release syndrome and covid-19mediated ards suggest that il-6 suppression is a key advancement in treatment of severe covid-19 infection sarilumab regeneron pharmaceuticals inc tarrytown ny is the only other il-6 blocker currently on the market if tocilizumab is unavailable however there is limited evidence to guide the selection and dosing of these agents at this time an urgent public health priority to combat covid-19 in the future is to develop a safe and effective vaccine widespread vaccination could also play a role in modulating the cardiovascular risk similar to what has been observed with influenza thus the importance of identifying a safe and effective vaccine45 the first phase 1 clinical trial nct04283461 evaluating a vaccine for covid-19 mrna-1273 began on march 19 2020 and is being sponsored by the national institutes of health the open-label study will enroll 45 healthy adults between 18 and 55 years over 6 weeks although 40 vaccine candidates are in the pipeline it is unlikely a vaccine will be available until at least 2021 there has been increased concern regarding the use of ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs in patients with covid-1946 this is due to the potential of ace inhibitors and arbs to upregulate ace2 receptors which are found in vascular endothelial cells of the heart kidneys and lungs and have been shown to be the host cell entry point for sars-cov-247 thus there is a theoretical increased risk for covid-19 in patients taking these medications it also seems that sars-cov-2 consumes ace2 and increases angiotensin2 at2 activity which activates an inflammatory response resulting in microvascular constriction and ischemic injury48 moreover the sars-cov led to downregulation of ace2 and more severe lung injury in mice which could theoretically be attenuated by administration of an arb49 mice lacking ace2 have also been shown to have worse outcomes with influenza h7n9 infection50 observational evidence suggests that ace inhibitors but not arbs may reduce the risk of pneumonia51 given the limited data available supporting either harm or benefit multiple professional organizations have released statements to provide guidance a joint statement from the heart failure society of america american heart association and american college of cardiology recommends not to add or remove any raas-related treatments beyond actions based on standard clinical practice and calls for further research in this area52 likewise the council on hypertension of the european society of cardiology also released a position statement recommending physicians and patients should continue treatment with their usual antihypertensive therapy because there is no clinical or scientific evidence to suggest that treatment with acei or arbs should be discontinued because of the covid-19 infection53 to help determine the potential role or harm of ace inhibitors and arbs 2 randomized multicenter clinical trials are underway patients with a presumptive positive test for covid-19 who require hospitalization and are not already taking an ace inhibitor or arb will be randomized to either losartan 25 mg daily or placebo nct04312009 the primary outcome of this study is the sequential organ failure assessment respiratory score which is used to determine the risk of mortality from respiratory failure a similarly designed study nct04311177 will compare losartan 25 mg daily to placebo in patients who test positive for covid-19 but do not require hospitalization the primary outcome of this study will be hospitalization rates at 28 days in addition to ace inhibitors and arbs ibuprofen was purported in a recent correspondence to also increase ace2 and potentially the risk of worsening covid-1946 despite no definitive evidence supporting this claim it was promoted by the french health minister on social media54 although the world health organization originally backed the claim they later retracted that advice and now do not recommend against nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug nsaid use55 the european medicines agency56 and fda57 have also confirmed the lack of evidence to support a link between nsaids and worsening covid-19 regardless nsaids should still be avoided in patients with cardiovascular disease especially those with heart failure and renal disease because they can increase bp and cause fluid retention it is well established that statins have vascular and myocardial anti-inflammatory effects which may exert some potential benefit in patients with acute viral respiratory infections58 observational studies have reported an improvement in cardiovascular outcomes and even mortality in statin-treated patients with influenza or pneumonia however a healthy user bias could be a contributing factor to these findings5960 the randomized controlled trial data are very limited and has found conflicted results6162 importantly there has been no reported harm associated with statin use in these patients which supports the continued use of statins in patients with an indication for statin therapy such as those with established cardiovascular disease diabetes or other high-risk features this is particularly true given the higher mortality rates observed in covid-19 patients with cardiovascular and cardiometabolic comorbidities as previously discussed however dose reductions or therapy substitutions may be warranted if patients receive lopinavirritonavir treatment while on statin therapy table 1 in rare instances patients with covid-19 may develop rhabdomyolysis or acute liver injury which would require prompt statin discontinuation the spectrum of covid-19 disease ranges from mild to severe and it has been well described elsewhere8 patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease are at particular high risk of severe illness and mortality9 myocardial injury as witnessed by elevation in troponin levels is common in patients with covid-193863 and is likely to reflect demandsupply mismatch type ii myocardial infarction or septic cardiomyopathy for which no specific therapy is recommended other than attempting to optimize oxygen supply delivery and demand as much as possible by intervening on the pulmonary hematologic cardiac and vascular systems increased troponin i identifies patients with severe covid-19 and is associated with very high mortality but whether myocardial injury reflects a specific pathologic mechanism of disease or a subgroup of patients with more severe disease is unclear64 anecdotal cases of myocarditis have been reported6566 but they seem to be rare an elevation in d-dimer levels38 suggests an activation of the coagulation cascade in patients with covid-19 however an increase in thrombosis or disseminated intravascular coagulation has not been widely reported regardless anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin in patients with markedly elevated d-dimer levels should be considered although precise recommendations are challenging given the lack of evidence recently the international society on thrombosis and haemostasis released a pragmatic statement recommending clinicians measure d-dimers prothrombin time and platelet count in all patients with covid-1967 furthermore they also recommend a prophylactic dose of low molecular weight heparin in all patients including those who are not critically ill barring any contraindications additional study is warranted to understand the anticoagulation needs of patients with covid-19 for patients with covid-19 who experience an acute coronary syndrome access to emergency coronary angiography can become restricted in some instances and fibrinolysis can become first-line therapy for lower risk st-segment elevation patients to preserve personal protective equipment and prevent spread of the infection across different areas of the hospital hospitals should also develop protocols for st-segment elevation management for patients with covid-19 in collaboration with their infection prevention departments to optimize patient management while reducing the risk for patient and health care worker transmission in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction a careful review of medical treatments should be considered in case of the initiation of the aforementioned investigational drugs to treat covid-19 when possible guideline-directed medical therapy should be continued but additional monitoring is warranted lopinavirritonavir may only modestly affect ace inhibitors and arbs while sacubitrilvalsartan levels can increase warranting close monitoring of bp lopinavirritonavir can increase levels of beta-blockers warranting ecg monitoring and potentially dose downtitration while hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine may reduce levels of beta-blocker and require a dose uptitration68 among mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists spironolactone can be safely used with lopinavirritonavir whereas eplerenone which is mainly metabolized by cyp3a4 should not be coadministered for the same reason coadministration of ivabradine and lopinavirritonavir should be avoided digoxin levels should be followed closely in patients on lopinavirritonavir hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine limited contact with others to minimize the spread of sars-cov-2 during the epidemic phase of the disease is advised this usually implies rescheduling routine follow-up visits options include the use of telehealth to conduct brief focused remote visits or postponement of visits for more stable patients regardless there are some additional considerations for managing these patients home blood pressure monitoring devices weight scales heart failure telemonitoring and other remote equipment should be offered when possible to augment telehealth visits such equipment may require training of the patients and health care providers but also may reveal unequal access to such resources reinforcing heart healthy lifestyle and stress management are also important given the inherent impact of social distancing and quarantine during a pandemic on daily routines and mental health additional medication-related considerations include ensuring patients have sufficient refills and prescribing a longer supply for maintenance medications these represent some of the potential challenges of social isolation during the pandemic in closing sars-cov-2 is a novel virus that has spread rapidly throughout the world causing a potentially life-threatening disease covid-19 causing disproportionally high mortality among elder patients with concomitant pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases although no approved therapies currently exist multiple collaborative efforts are underway to identify effective therapies and a vaccine to prevent future infection cardiovascular clinicians however may not be accustomed to the concomitant use of antivirals and immunomodulators in their patients thus the need to understand how these therapies might impact underlying cardiovascular conditions and medications despite the significant morbidity and mortality associated with covid-19 there is an immense opportunity to enhance our understanding of how to prevent and treat such emerging infections as well as improve our understanding of the relationship between infection immune response and cardiovascular disease  effect of chloroquine hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin on the corrected qt interval in patients with sars-cov-2 infection background the novel sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is responsible for the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic small studies have shown a potential benefit of chloroquinehydroxychloroquineazithromycin for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 use of these medications alone or in combination can lead to a prolongation of the qt interval possibly increasing the risk of torsade de pointes and sudden cardiac death methods hospitalized patients treated with chloroquinehydroxychloroquineazithromycin from march 1 to the 23 at 3 hospitals within the northwell health system were included in this prospective observational study serial assessments of the qt interval were performed the primary outcome was qt prolongation resulting in torsade de pointes secondary outcomes included qt prolongation the need to prematurely discontinue any of the medications due to qt prolongation and arrhythmogenic death results two hundred one patients were treated for coronavirus disease 2019 with chloroquinehydroxychloroquine ten patients 50 received chloroquine 191 950 received hydroxychloroquine and 119 592 also received azithromycin the primary

in coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 patients treated with either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in conjunction with azithromycin possible benefits of intravenous lidocaine raman mitra l steven greenstein a laurence epstein m   the rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic owing to a newly identified coronavirus sars-cov-2 originating in wuhan china has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality around the world early reports have shown improved clinical outcome and viral clearance with the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine1

 the results of a recent open-label nonrandomized clinical trial by gautret and colleagues3 suggest that the addition of azithromycin to hydroxychloroquine significantly reduced polymerase chain reaction detection of sars-cov-2 in nasopharyngeal samples by 6 days in 6 patients compared to 14 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone3 patients with baseline prolonged qt intervals were excluded from this study since both drugs are known to prolong the qt interval which may increase the risk of torsades de pointes tdp despite the drugs qtc-prolonging effects several reports suggest the risk of tdp is very low when either of these agents is used alone or in combination4

5 nonetheless these risks may be higher in critically ill hospitalized covid-19 patients with metabolic derangements with organ failure and on other medications increasing the risk of drug-drug interactions if this combination however proves to be lifesaving for covid-19 patients managing the qt interval to allow patients to receive combination therapy will be critical we describe an algorithm that may help manage this combination therapy to mitigate the risk of tdp and describe the possible use of intravenous lidocaine to permit combination therapy that might not otherwise be possible a 66-year-old woman with a past medical history of rheumatoid arthritis pulmonary fibrosis and asthma on chronic methotrexate and oral and inhaled steroids presented on march 16 2020 with fever and cough after a 2-week course of sinus and upper respiratory tract symptoms initially treated with doxycycline followed by levofloxacin as an outpatient owing to lack of improvement she presented to the emergency room and was found to be hypoxic computed tomography showed widespread ground-glass opacities as well as honeycombing of the right lung figure 1
 covid-19 was suspected and testing was eventually positive within 48 hours she developed profound respiratory failure and required intubation she also required adrenergic support with norepinephrine she was started on intravenous azithromycin on march 18 the decision was made to start hydroxychloroquine on march 21 however it was stopped after 1 dose owing to a qtc of 620 ms with a notched broad t wave figure 2a
 no ventricular ectopy was present serum potassium and magnesium were 44 mm and 29 mgdl respectively electrophysiology consultation recommended 100 mg intravenous lidocaine followed by a repeat 12-lead electrocardiogram this revealed a shortening of the qtc to 550 ms figure 2b it was recommended to restart hydroxychloroquine and begin a lidocaine infusion the patient was able to complete the course of hydroxychloroquine without an arrhythmic event despite receiving a full course of hydroxychloroquine she remained ventilator dependent and died owing to progressive metabolic acidosis and multiorgan system failure on march 25 by the time hydroxychloroquine was first initiated she had already been intubated for 72 hours and was in severe respiratory failure owing to several similar consults in covid-19 patients with borderline or increased qtc intervals we developed a flow chart that addresses qt interval management in order to help clinicians taking care of covid-19 patients who require chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin figure 3
 owing to the current covid-19 pandemic there is great interest in using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin to improve the virucidal efficacy against sars-cov-2 this is tempered with concerns of increased risks of qt prolongation and development of tdp which may be life threatening though it is generally recommended to avoid any pharmacological agent that prolongs the qtc 500 ms in the outpatient setting the benefit-risk ratio in a monitored intensive care unit setting may allow for short-term administration of lifesaving medications that exceed this limit although at first glance the combination of chloroquine with azithromycin may seem risky pharmacokinetic studies have also demonstrated no significant interaction between the 2 agents6 and this combination has been used in previous outpatient studies to treat resistant malaria with no reports of syncope or sudden death4

5 similar data are not available for the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in combination an observational nonrandomized clinical study in 2012 that compared the risks of cardiovascular death in patients treated with the antibacterial drugs azithromycin amoxicillin ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin vs no antibacterial drug reported an increase in cardiovascular deaths and the risk of death from any cause in persons treated with a 5-day course of azithromycin compared to persons treated with amoxicillin ciprofloxacin or no drug7
 this study led the us food and drug administration to issue a public warning in 2013 that azithromycin can cause abnormal changes in the electrical activity of the heart that may lead to a potentially fatal irregular heart rhythm8 those at higher risk included individuals with known risk factors such as existing qt-interval prolongation low blood levels of potassium or magnesium a slower-than-normal heart rate heart failure or ischemia and the use of antiarrhythmic drugs the deaths reported in this study however occurred during the 5 days of therapy after which the cardiovascular death rate was no different from the other groups9 this risk would clearly be less for an inpatient cohort on telemetry and not as relevant for covid-19 patients being treated in the hospital the low risks of azithromycin are also supported by real-world data which reveal a very low incidence of sudden death or syncope10

11 the risks were associated with patients above the age of 60 years concomitant use of other qt-prolonging drugs cardiovascular disease and female sex12
 most drugs that lead to acquired long qt syndrome lqts and tdp do so by blocking the herg potassium channel13 drugs such as lidocaine and mexiletine which can block the ina-l channel and thereby the late sodium current have been shown to slightly shorten the qt interval and suppress tdp in acquired lqts14 mexiletine has been successfully used to control tdp in patients with acquired lqts who continued to have tdp despite withdrawal of qt-prolonging medications electrolyte correction and magnesium infusions15 treatment with mexiletine slightly shortened the qt interval by approximately 15 we felt that this property would make lidocaine an ideal adjunctive agent in the intensive care unit to allow covid-19 patients to receive short-term dual therapy with azithromycin and chloroquinehydroxychloroquine for acquired lqts known therapies to mitigate tdp such as maintaining potassium and magnesium levels and heart rates 70 beats per minute are incorporated into our flow chart another option may be to use mexiletine in patients able to take oral medications unfortunately this patient died despite receiving therapy hydroxychloroquine was started late into her course 4 days after presentation and 3 days after intubation therefore it is uncertain whether she would have survived had hydroxychloroquine been started earlier her previous history of rheumatoid arthritis pulmonary fibrosis and asthma placed her at a higher risk for mortality as well in conclusion although the theoretical risk of acquired lqts and tdp is present with chloroquine hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin used alone or in combination previous reports of combined treatment in malaria patients suggest that the risk is very low in covid-19 patients who are hospitalized however there may be an increased risk of qt prolongation and tdp owing to previous or concurrent medications age sex or metabolic derangements ph hypoxia electrolyte abnormalities and multiorgan system failure as well as previous cardiovascular disease recent reports suggest that direct viral- or autoimmune-induced myocardial injury may also occur in covid-19 patients16 17 18
 certainly the use of combination therapy with azithromycin and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in patients with congenital or acquired lqts must be carefully weighed against the risks the use of late sodium channelblocking drugs like lidocaine or mexiletine and careful attention to serum electrolytes heart rate and monitoring of qtc intervals may allow administration of a full course of these drugs even in patients with a prolonged qt interval further data will be required to determine if this approach can be safely applied to the majority of covid-19 patients in need of such therapykey teaching points
the combination of azithromycin and chloroquinehydroxychloroquine has been shown in a small number of covid-19 patients to have effective virucidal potencyconcerns of qt prolongation and increased risks of torsades de pointes tdp with this combination have been raised since each agent can individually prolong the qt interval and patients with qt prolongation were excluded from receiving this therapycombination therapy with azithromycin and chloroquine has previously been found to be safe in the treatment of resistant malaria without reports of syncope or tdpthe addition of lidocaine or mexiletine may allow this type of combination therapy even in patients who have a prolonged qt intervalwe developed and provided a flow chart to manage the risk of qt prolongation and tdp while treating these patients in the hospital with combination therapy

  cardiac safety of off-label covid-19 drug therapy a review and proposed monitoring protocol niyada naksuk sorin lazar thoetchai peeraphatdit bee   we are in the middle of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic and it is predicted that nearly 500 million individuals worldwide will be infected1 as of april 2020 the mortality rate in each country ranges from 1 to 132 while large scale studies are being conducted in multiple countries their preliminary results on effective therapies are at least a few months ahead awaiting the results from clinical trials providers across the globe are using off-label and investigational drugs with unknown safety profiles emerging data have shown that cardiovascular comorbidities are very common in patients with covid-19 and such patients are at increased risk of death3 furthermore 1933 of hospitalized patients with covid-19 have concurrent cardiac injury46 the mechanism may include severe systemic inflammatory responses direct injury from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 hypoxia or microthrombi leading to microvascular damage7 however adverse effects from pharmacotherapy cannot be entirely excluded in addition concomitant cardiac injury from sars-cov-2 infection may increase the risk of adverse events from generally safe drugs8 for instance patients with cardiomyopathy andor congestive heart failure have reduced repolarization reserve and are at increased risk of drug-related proarrhythmic risk89 other specific concerns during the covid-19 pandemic may include lack of adequate cardiac testing giving a shortage of healthcare providers and ancillary staff as well as the intention to minimize the risk of exposure finally when using off-label medications to treat novel disease such as covid-19 drugdrug interaction can be underestimated among those investigational drugs antimalarial and anti-rheumatic drugs namely chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine respectively have gained broad interest in an in vitro study chloroquine 500 mg twice daily and hydroxychloroquine 400600 mg twice a day loading followed by 400600 mg blocked sars-cov-2 cell entry in vitro10 in addition an early study suggested clinical benefit in patients with covid-19 showing reduction in pneumonia severity length of hospitalization and viral shedding11 despite generally safe profiles of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine when used at low dose both drugs can have significant cardiovascular adverse effects reports from long-term users with a smaller daily dosage found a broad prevalence of cardiac toxicity in the form of mild to severe conduction disorders and irreversible cardiomyopathy the cumulative dose range 155040 g and duration of treatment 7 months 35 years vary greatly12 severe and irreversible cardiac damage has been reported hydroxychloroquine may have less toxicity but is not without risk chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are proarrhythmic and can cause significant qt prolongation as well as increasing the risk of torsade de pointes tdp even at therapeutic doses13 they are generally contraindicated in patients with congenital long qt syndrome or those who have a prior history of tdp other electrocardiographic changes may include t-wave inversion or depression in healthy animal models both agents especially chloroquine decreased excitability and conductivity of atrial and ventricular myocardium although the magnitude is much less than quinine or quinidine a related class i anti-arrhythmic drug14 nonetheless chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been shown to be effective in the acute suppression of wide ranges of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias13 a study of 28 patients taking 250 mg daily of chloroquine found qt qtc interval lengthened from 363388 milliseconds to 372392 milliseconds15 the dose recommended for the treatment of covid-19 is 500 mg twice a day therefore the risk of qt prolongation is expected to be higher furthermore case reports of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine toxicity observed widened qrs complex due to their excessive ina blockage property a study of 72 subjects with and without structural heart disease given acute chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine therapy for various types of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias observed one sudden death13 the dosage used in the study was slightly higher than that proposed in the treatment of covid-19 conclusively the american heart association has listed chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as agents which can cause direct myocardial toxicity and exacerbate underlying myocardial dysfunction16 current pharmacotherapeutic regimens for covid-19 may include investigational and off-label drugs such as a novel antiviral drug namely remdesivir with unknown clinical safety figure 1 lopinavirritonavir combination remains a treatment regimen for covid-19 in many countries although no clinical benefit was observed in a small study17 importantly lopinavirritonavir can cause qt prolongation and are cyp3a4 inhibitors1718 and cannot be used with major cyp3a4 substrates such as chloroquine prolonged qt interval due to favipiravir which is now being used for the treatment of covid-19 in some regions has been reported19 umifenovir and darunavir for the treatment of influenza have a safe cardiac profile however darunavirritonavir is a major cyp3a4 inhibitor20 tocilizumab and sarilumab are interleukin-6 il-6 inhibitors approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis both drugs are not associated with heart failure exacerbation or proarrhythmia interestingly case series observed shortening of the qt interval to 440 milliseconds in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were treated with tocilizumab for more than 3 months2122 while the mechanism was unclear it was thought to be from a decrease in inflammation in cardiomyocytes22 furthermore tocilizumab was used safely among patients with autoimmune disease and cardiomyopathy2324 the combination of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine or antiviral drugs with other antibiotics is a common practice careful qt interval monitoring should be performed when concomitant macrolide drugs such as azithromycin moxifloxacin are administered2526 furthermore piperacillin -tazobactam carries some risk of tdp especially when one of additional risks or tdp presents ie bradycardia hypokalemia hypomagnesemia use with concomitant qttdp drugs use with drugs that can cause hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are metabolized via cyp2c8 and cyp3a427 therefore caution should be focused on potential drug interactions figure 1 and patients with hepatic disease chloroquine is substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of toxicity may be greater in patients with impaired renal function although specific dosage adjustment may not be required chloroquine significantly reduces the bioavailability of ampicillin an interval of at least 2 hours between the intake of ampicillin and chloroquine is recommended28 hydroxychloroquine has a remarkably long half-life of 4050 days29 multiple drugs being used for the treatment of covid-19 are cyp3a4 inhibitors which can significantly increase serum chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine figure 1 in particular the combination of chloroquine and lopinavirritonavir or umifenovirritonavir is contraindicated20 many cardiovascular drugs such as ticagrelor rivaroxaban and apixaban are major substrates of cyp3a4 co-administration with cyp3a inhibitors may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring furthermore warfarin concentrations are decreased when co-administered with ritonavir it is recommended that the international normalized ratio inr be monitored more frequently when warfarin is combined cytochrome p450s are generally downregulated by infection and inflammation stimuli including cytokines such as il-6 inhibition of il-6 signaling treated with tocilizumab or sarilumab may restore cyp450 activities to higher levels leading to increased metabolism of drugs that are cyp450 substrates the effects may last up to one week following a single dose of il-6 inhibitor and are clinically relevant for cyp450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index in which the dose is individually adjusted such as warfarin our proposed work-up and monitoring protocol for drugs commonly used for the treatment of covid-19 is shown in figure 2 and for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in figure 3 respectively the algorithms are in line with the recently published guidance from the mayo clinic30 and from the american college of cardiology magazine which focus solely on hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin8 our protocol has extended those statements by taking underlying cardiomyopathy into consideration as well as covering other drugs currently used in the treatment of the pandemic generally drugs with potential qt prolongation should be avoided in patients with qtc greater than 500 milliseconds or 550 milliseconds with intraventricular conduction delay especially in the setting of moderate to severe structural heart disease and patients with high-grade atrioventricular block without a pacemaker andor implantable cardioverter defibrillator in place3132 in patients with baseline qtc greater than 500 milliseconds and normal or mild cardiomyopathy benefit may outweigh the risk and shared decision-making should be discussed the checklist shown in figure 2 should be applied for all patients this includes minimizing concomitant prolonging qt drugs and concomitant cyp3a4 inhibitors and substrates and maintaining normal serum electrolyte levels bradycardia can precipitate tdp and thus conditions or medications with the potential to slow the heart rate should also be avoided these following criteria should prompt dose reduction or drug discontinuation subsequent qtc interval greater than 500 milliseconds or 550 milliseconds with intraventricular conduction delay in those with baseline qtc less than 500 milliseconds qtc greater than 60 milliseconds3032 a preliminary report showed that the maximal change in the qt interval among patients with covid-19 treated with combined hydroxychloroquineazithromycin occurred between days 3 and 433 thus in a setting with limited resources qtc interval measurement may be performed on days 34 because chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can cause a broader spectrum of cardiac adverse effects including suppression of myocardial function and heart block the proposed protocol in figure 3 and criteria for dose adjustment are slightly different from other drugs in particular the qtc interval should be measured more frequently8 subsequent surveillance can be flexible and based on a underlying cardiac disease and function b baseline qtc interval c underlying conduction disorder and d other risk factors for tdp in addition to the above parameters qrs greater than 130 high grade atrioventricular block or newly developed left bundle branch block should prompt dose reduction or drug discontinuation while a 12-lead electrocardiogram ecg is considered the gold standard for qt measurement to limit the chance of viral transmission to healthcare providers using cardiac telemetry or a wireless device for calculating qt interval may be applied after initial comparison is acceptable3034 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may be used for the early treatment of patients with mild covid-19 who are stable and do not require hospitalization providers should ensure patients history without significant underlying cardiomyopathy or cardiac symptoms if a recent 12-lead ecg is not available a new baseline ecg should be obtained in addition liver function test serum creatinine and serum electrolytes may be considered in patients at risk figure 4 presents the proposed monitoring protocol with an initial checklist in patients with baseline qtc less than 500 milliseconds consider one-time qtc interval measurement after the second to fourth dose in order to limit the risk of exposure a mobile or wireless device should be considered for this purpose multiple pharmacotherapeutic agents including chloroquine hydroxychloroquine antiviral drugs and monoclonal antibodies are being investigated for the treatment of patients with sars-cov-2 infection based on available data chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can cause irreversible cardiomyopathy and worsen pre-existing myocardial dysfunction other known cardiac side effects include high-grade atrioventricular block bundle branch block qt prolongation and tdp furthermore favipiravir lopinavirritonavir macrolide agents and piperacillintazobactam can cause prolonged qt and tdp particular concerns in patients with covid-19 include underlying structural heart disease cardiac injury renal and hepatic dysfunction limited resource for cardiac monitoring and drugdrug interaction clear administration protocols should be in place in every hospital and clinic using these drugs for the treatment of covid-19 
multiple investigational and off-label drugs with uncertain cardiac safety profiles are currently used for the treatment of covid-19 which has caused infection in over 1000000 individuals worldwide this is an important topic because patients with covid-19 often have underlying cardiovascular disease and up to 33 of hospitalized patients have cardiac injurythe medication list includes anti-malaria and anti-rheumatic drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine respectively antiviral drugs as well as monoclonal antibodies in addition antimicrobial agents such as macrolides are frequently prescribedof the off-label drug regimens for the treatment of covid-19 chloroquine hydroxychloroquine favipiravir lopinavirritonavir and macrolides can cause significant qt prolongation and tdpfurthermore chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine directly suppress myocardial function and can cause heart block both agents are listed as a direct cause of cardiac toxicity by the american heart association
 the authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research authorship andor publication of this article  the immunology of covid-19 is immune modulation an option for treatment jixin zhong jungen tang cong ye lingli dong   in december 2019 hospitals in wuhan china began to report cases of pneumonia of unknown cause most of the initially identified patients were geographically linked to a local wet seafood wholesale market where living or slaughtered wild animals are sold the virus then rapidly spread to over 200 countries and territories resulting in 3 672 238 confirmed cases and 254 045 deaths globally according to a report released by who on may 7 2020 subsequent deep sequencing of lower respiratory tract samples identified a novel coronavirus distinct from the other strains of coronavirus known to infect humans subsequently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2a highly contagious virus that can be transmitted from person to person1 who designated the disease caused by sars-cov-2 infection as covid-19 similar to other diseases caused by coronaviruses the main transmission route of sars-cov-2 is via aerosolised droplets other possible transmission routes such as direct contact oralfaecal route and mother-to-child transmission have been proposed but further proof is needed with regard to these2 a retrospective study done at the beginning of the pandemic reported an incubation period of sars-cov-2 of approximately 514 days3 however a more recent report indicates that the incubation period could be as long as 24 days4
 there is no effective cure for sars-cov-2 infection and the most common treatment for patients with covid-19 is supportive care although multiple anti-viral drugs including remdesivir and lopinavir plus ritonavir have been used in clinical practice5 6 the safety and efficacy of these are still unclear and are under clinical evaluation immune-mediated lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards are associated with adverse outcomes in patients with covid-197 histological examination of lung biopsy tissue from a patient who died of covid-19 showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage and fibroblastic proliferation in airspaces and laboratory tests indicated a hyperactivated status of circulating cd4 and cd8 lymphocytes7 8 due to the hyperactive nature of the immune system in some patients with severe covid-19 several disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs dmards such as tocilizumab interleukin il-6 receptor inhibitor baricitinib janus kinase jak inhibitor anakinra il-1 receptor antagonist and the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine have been proposed as potential treatments for covid-19 in this review we discuss the immunological aspects of the sars-cov-2 virus infection and the potential implication of dmards in the treatment of patients with covid-19 coronaviruses are a group of highly diverse enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses that belong to two subfamilies coronavirinae and torovirinae in the family of coronaviridae these viruses were first discovered in the 1960s and can be further classified into four main genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus on the basis of their phylogenetic relationships and genomic structures9 among these four genera alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses primarily cause respiratory and intestinal infection in mammals whereas gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses mainly infect birds currently there are seven strains of coronaviruses that are known to infect humans including the recently identified sars-cov-2 human coronavirus 229e hcov-229e oc43 hcov-oc43 nl63 hcov-nl63 hku1 hcov-hku1 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov10 11 12 domestic or wild animals could have important roles as zoonotic reservoirs that enable virus transmission to humans on the basis of current sequence databases the origins of sars-cov mers-cov hcov-nl63 hcov-229e and sars-cov-2 are thought to be bats whereas hcov-oc43 and hku1 probably originated from rodents13 14 15 16 17 although most coronavirus infections cause only mild respiratory symptoms infection with sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 can be lethal sars-cov first appeared in southern china and quickly spread around the world between 2002 and 2003 this virus was identified as the causative agent of the global pandemic sars18 which led to substantial morbidity and mortality a decade after sars an outbreak of mers-cov emerged in 201219 most people with mers had no previous contact with bats leading to the identification of camels as an intermediate host20 patients with sars or mers present with a variety of clinical features ranging from asymptomatic or mild respiratory illness to fulminant severe ards with extra-pulmonary complications21 22
 sars-cov-2 belongs to the genus of betacoronavirus and on the basis of evolutionary analysis is most similar to the sars-like coronavirus from the chinese horseshoe bat with a nucleic acid homology of 843 10 sars-cov-2 also has 78 similarity with sars-cov and 50 with mers-cov at the nucleic acid level3 10 only 10 days after the release of the sars-cov-2 genome researchers found a similar coronavirus from fruit bats batcovhku91 based on evolutionary characteristics23 several later reports suggested that snakes mink and pangolins could be intermediate hosts based on codon preference and viral infection patterns24 25 26 at the onset of the covid-19 pandemic the main symptoms were fever 98 cough 76 and myalgia or fatigue 4427 about half of the patients developed breathing difficulty in one week and the severely ill patients soon developed ards acute cardiac injury secondary infections or a combination thereof27 the diagnosis of the disease mainly depends on sars-cov-2 rna detection in nasopharyngeal swab by real-time polymerase chain reaction epidemiological history clinical manifestations and lung imaging the invasion and pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 are associated with the host immune response the spike glycoprotein s protein on the viral envelop binds to its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 on the surface of human cells15 23 an analysis of the structure of the sars-cov-2 s protein and its binding affinity for ace2 using cryogenic electron microscopy and surface plasmon resonance showed that the structure of sars-cov-2 s protein is very similar to that of sars although with minor differences28 the affinity of sars-cov-2 s protein binding to ace2 is 10 to 20 times higher than that of the sars s protein suggesting that sars-cov-2 might transmit more readily from person to person28
 innate immunity is the first line of defence against virus invasion viral infection of mammals activates intracellular pattern recognition receptors that sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as double-stranded rna or uncapped mrna the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns results in subsequent cytolytic immune responses mainly through the type i interferons ifn and natural killer cells adaptive immunity also plays an important part in viral clearance via activated cytotoxic t cells that destroy virus-infected cells and antibody-producing b cells that target virus-specific antigens patients with covid-19 especially those with severe pneumonia are reported to have substantially lower lymphocyte counts and higher plasma concentrations of a number of inflammatory cytokines such as il-6 and tumor necrosis factor tnf27 29 30 another study29 reported that cd4 t cells cd8 t cells and natural killer cells were reduced in severely ill patients compared with those with mild disease symptoms moreover a substantial reduction of cd4 t cell and cd8 t cell counts in the peripheral blood was also observed in a patient who died7 notably the proinflammatory subsets of t cells including il-17-producing ccr4 ccr6 cd4 t-helper 17 or th17 cells and perforin and granulysin-expressing cytotoxic t cells were increased which could be partly responsible for the severe immune injury in the lungs of this patient7
 the anti-viral immune response is crucial to eliminate the invading virus but a robust and persistent anti-viral immune response might also cause massive production of inflammatory cytokines and damage to host tissues31 the overproduction of cytokines caused by aberrant immune activation is known as a cytokine storm in fact in the late stages of coronavirus disease including sars mers and covid-19 cytokine storms are a major cause of disease progression and eventual death7 32 33 huang and colleagues27 found increased plasma concentrations of both th1 eg il-1 and ifn and th2 eg il-10 cytokines notably patients admitted to the intensive care unit icu had higher plasma concentrations of il-2 il-7 il-10 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ifn-induced protein-10 ip-10 macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1 and tnf compared to those not admitted to the icu two other studies29 34 also showed that plasma il-6 concentrations were above the normal range in patients with severe symptoms of covid-19 compared with healthy individuals and those with milder symptoms mehta and colleagues35 suggest that secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis shlh could be associated with severe covid-19 cases hlh is a disease entity characterised by an uncontrolled cytokine storm and expansion of tissue macrophages or histiocytes that exhibit haemophagocytic activity36 hlh can result from genetic defects in cytolytic pathways familial or primary hlh or other diseases such as infection malignancy and rheumatic disease shlh37 in 1952 farquhar and claireaux first described cytokine storm in patients with hlh38 the characteristics of hlh including hypercytokinaemia unremitting fever cytopenias hyperferritinaemia and multi-organ damage are commonly seen in seriously ill patients with covid-1927 35 it is suggested that alveolar macrophages expressing ace2 are the primary target cells for sars-cov-2 infection these activated macrophages may play an important part in hlh-like cytokine storm during covid-1939 thus early identification and appropriate treatment of this hyperinflammatory status is important for reducing the mortality of patients with covid-19 35
 evidence has shown that asymptomatic covid-19 carriers can transmit the disease to others and that the virus has a wider range of incubation time than initially thought 024 days4 in addition the virus displays a high infectivity if the virus continues to mutate to lower its pathogenicity there is a high possibility that it might coexist with humans therefore there is an urgent need to develop therapies to treat sars-cov-2 repurposing of approved drugs is commonly employed to fight against newly emerged diseases such as covid-19 as these drugs have known pharmacokinetic and safety profiles due to the importance of immune imbalance in the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 infection several immune-modulating drugs that regulate different aspects of inflammation table
 are being tested for their efficacy in the treatment of severe covid-19 hyperinflammation is an important determinant of disease outcome in covid-19 and immunosuppression might be beneficial to reduce the mortality in patients with severe symptoms7 35 therefore early identification of such patients is crucial it has been proposed that laboratory tests of ferritin lymphocyte or leukocyte counts platelet counts erythrocyte counts and sedimentation rate could be used to screen patients at high risk of hyperinflammation application of the hscore used for the evaluation of patients with shlh was recommended by mehta and colleagues35 to identify patients with covid-19 at high risk of hyperinflammation the hscore combines both laboratory and clinical parameters including serum aspartate aminotransferase triglycerides fibrinogen ferritin cytopaenias body temperature organomegaly haemophagocytosis on bone marrow aspirate and signs of immunosuppression35 in addition evaluation of cytokine profiles and immune cell subsets has important implications for selecting appropriate immunosuppressants eg tocilizumab could be considered in patients with high concentrations of serum il-6 given the fact that anti-viral immunity is required to recover from covid-19 the pros and cons of using an immunosuppressant on these patients should be carefully considered the severity of the hyperinflammation and viral load or replication status needs to be taken into consideration one way to avoid the suppression of anti-viral immunity is to choose selective instead of broad immunosuppressive drugs the timing of treatment is also crucial to reduce the side-effects of immunosuppression unfortunately there is not yet any definitive evidence with regard to the appropriate timing of administration of these agents further studies are required to determine the appropriate timing and routes of drug administration il-6 is a key inflammatory cytokine that has a critical part in inflammatory cytokine storm and is elevated in patients with covid-1929 34 tocilizumab a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody against the il-6 receptor is widely used in treatment for autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis40 in patients with covid-19 il-6-producing cd14 cd16 inflammatory monocytes were significantly increased and numbers of these cells were further increased in patients with covid-19 admitted to the icu41 the authors of this study proposed that hyperactivated th1 cells producing granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor gm-csf and ifn in the lung promote il-6-producing monocytes through release of gm-csf suggesting that both il-6 and gm-csf might be potential therapeutic targets in patients with covid-1941 tocilizumab is a first-line drug for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome a rapid and massive release of cytokines into the blood from immune cells usually caused by immunotherapy especially in patients with comorbidities in terms of mechanism tocilizumab binds to both the membrane and soluble forms of il-6 receptor thereby suppressing the jak-signal transducer and activator of transcription stat signalling pathway and production of downstream inflammatory molecules42 43 there are many ongoing trials assessing the efficacy of tocilizumab in covid-19 appendix p 1 however animal studies have shown that il-6 is required for the clearance of viruses and control of pulmonary inflammation44 therefore clinicians should pay close attention to the possibility that blocking il-6 could interfere with viral clearance or exacerbate lung inflammation a recent observational study45 from china reported that tocilizumab treatment in severe covid-19 cases resulted in improvement in covid-19 symptoms peripheral oxygen saturation and lymphopenia within a few days a substantial remission of lung lesion opacity in chest ct scan was observed in 95 of patients 19 of 20 after 5 days of treatment and all patients were discharged after an average of 151 days of hospital stay45
 blockade of the il-1 pathway is used for the treatment of some hyperinflammation conditions the il-1 receptor antagonist anakinra is approved for rheumatoid arthritis stills disease and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome a phase 3 randomised controlled trial rct for severe sepsis reported that treatment with anakinra was associated with a significantly lower 28-day mortality in patients who were septic with hyperinflammation without increased adverse events46 a retrospective analysis47 of 44 patients with shlh who were treated with anakinra indicated that treatment with anakinra resulted in a 57 decrease of ferritin concentrations and early initiation of anakinra was associated with reduced mortality since il-1 was reported to be increased in some patients with covid-1927 blockade of il-1 seems a reasonable approach for the treatment of hyperinflammation in these patients35 several trials of anakinra are currently underway including a phase 23 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of anakinra and emapalumab ifn inhibitor in reducing hyperinflammation and respiratory distress in patients with covid-19 nct04324021 appendix p 1 baricitinib is a small molecule compound that selectively inhibits the kinase activity of jak1 and jak2 baricitinib can be used in combination with one or more tnf inhibitors and is approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis48 and psoriatic arthritis49 through searching the benevolentai database richardson and colleagues50 predicted that baricitinib might effectively reduce the ability of sars-cov-2 virus to infect lung cells51 as noted sars-cov-2 binds to the ace2 receptor on host cells and enters lung cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis ace2 is widely expressed in several tissues including renal vascular heart and lung high concentrations of ace2 expression on pulmonary at2 alveolar epithelial cells makes these cells particularly susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection52 ap2-associated protein kinase 1 aak1 regulates endocytosis via phosphorylation of the clathrin adaptor protein ap2 richardson and colleagues identified six high-affinity aak1 inhibitors from 47 clinical candidates in the benevolentai database baricitinib was then further selected based on its relatively mild side-effects and the feasibility to achieve effective concentrations in the blood in addition baricitinib can also bind to cyclin g-related kinases which also regulate receptor-mediated endocytosis the immunosuppressive function of baricitinib might also be of benefit to the hyperactive immune status in severe cases of covid-19 where immune-mediated lung injury and ards might occur ruxolitinib another oral jak1 and jak2 inhibitor approved specifically for the treatment of myelofibrosis has been used for the treatment of shlh ruxolitinib was shown to rapidly improve respiratory liver and haemodynamic function in an 11-year-old boy with refractory hlh53 and to substantially improve serum ferritin lactate dehydrogenase fibrinogen and liver function in a 38-year-old female patient with refractory epstein-barr virus-related shlh54 an open-label clinical trial55 showed that ruxolitinib was well tolerated and manageable for treating shlh with symptoms and cytopenias improved in all n5 patients within the first week of ruxolitinib treatment concentrations of ferritin soluble il-2 receptor and stat1 phosphorylation were also reduced after the administration of ruxolitinib55 animal studies showed that inhibition of jak1 and jak2 using ruxolitinib improved weight loss organomegaly anaemia thrombocytopenia hypercytokinaemia and tissue inflammation in animal models of both primary hlh and shlh by reducing stat1-dependent cd8 t-cell expansion56
 considering the similar hyperinflammatory nature of shlh and severe covid-19 jak1 and jak2 inhibitors such as baricitinib and ruxolitinib could be potential treatments for the hyperinflammation seen in covid-1950 several registered rcts are evaluating the efficacy of ruxolitinib and baricitinib in the treatment of covid-19 appendix p 2 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine initially used as antimalarial drugs have been widely used in several infectious hiv q fever and fungal infections rheumatological systemic lupus erythematosus antiphospholipid antibody syndrome rheumatoid arthritis and sjogrens syndrome and other immunological diseases57 the mechanism of action of hydroxychloroquine is diverse and includes anti-inflammatory action immune regulation anti-infection anti-tumour metabolic regulation and anti-thrombosis chloroquine has been shown to have anti-coronavirus effects in vitro based on this and the immunoregulatory actions of these drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were proposed in the treatment of covid-19 these drugs increase the endosomal ph required for sars-cov-2 endocytosis and cell fusion figure
 chloroquine also interferes with the glycosylation of ace2 which is required for virus attachment to host cells58 chloroquine was first reported in 2020 to be a potent inhibitor of covid-19 using an in vitro sars-cov-2-infected vero-e6 cell culture model59
 hydroxychloroquine is a derivative of chloroquine that has similar pharmacokinetics and mechanism of action as chloroquine but substantially fewer side-effects60 compared with other immunosuppressant drugs such as methotrexate the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine is associated with a reduced risk of infection even with chronic use61 62 therefore hydroxychloroquine is more commonly used in patients with rheumatic diseases and other conditions hydroxychloroquine has been used to treat hiv-1 in humans as early as the 1990s in a randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial of 40 asymptomatic patients with hiv-1 800 mgd hydroxychloroquine treatment for 8 weeks reduced the plasma concentration of hiv-1 rna preserved cd4 t-cell counts and proliferative responses and lowered serum il-6 concentrations compared with the placebo group63 although it takes 13 months for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to fully take effect in patients with rheumatic disease the drugs anti-viral effect is relatively rapid hydroxychloroquine treatment as short as 3 days was shown to accelerate virus clearance in patients with covid-19 and azithromycin reinforced the anti-viral effect64 there are a number of ongoing clinical trials testing the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in covid-19 appendix pp 25 although a recent randomised trial has shown that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine might improve pneumonia symptoms laboratory tests and decrease the progression to severe or critical conditions65 other studies reported either no benefits66 67 68 or hazardous effects after chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine treatment69notably treatment in patients with covid-19 might cause cardiotoxicity especially when used at a high dose70 71 therefore results from ongoing trials are required to assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine in covid-19 glucocorticoids and their synthetic analogues have been widely used in rheumatic disease to control autoimmune response72 due to their rapid immunosuppressive effect glucocorticoids are frequently used in hyperinflammatory syndromes such as ards in patients with ards glucocorticoid treatment improves oxygen saturation inflammatory markers icu length of stay and ventilator-free days although its effect on mortality was not consistent between trials73 74 75 in coronavirus disease inflammation-induced lung injury and ards are associated with adverse outcomes26 76 histological investigations showed severe lung inflammation and diffuse alveolar damage in patients with coronavirus disease7 77 therefore corticosteroids are commonly used in severe cases of coronavirus disease including sars mers and covid-19 to control immune-mediated damage of lung tissue27 30 78 79 however clinical evidence has not supported a beneficial effect of glucocorticoids in coronavirus illness in a retrospective study79 of 309 critically ill patients with mers after statistical adjustment for time-varying confounders corticosteroid therapy was not significantly associated with improved 90-day mortality and resulted in delayed clearance of the mers coronavirus rna in a systematic review of sars treatments that included 29 studies with cortiocosteroid use 25 studies were inconclusive with regards to the effect of corticosteroid in sars and four reported corticosteroids as causing possible harm therefore high-quality rcts are needed to provide conclusive evidence leflunomide is a low-molecular weight synthetic oral anti-rheumatic drug the mechanism of its action includes inhibition of pyrimidine synthesis inhibition of protein tyrosine stimulation inhibition of nuclear factor kappa beta and anti-tumour effects80 81 82 83 leflunomide has been widely used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis84 and due to its immunosuppressive function the drug is also used in organ transplantation85 another important function of leflunomide is that it inhibits virus replication in vitro studies have shown that the active metabolite of leflunomide a77 1726 protects umbilical cord epithelial cells and fibroblasts from infection with human cytomegalovirus80 86 electron microscopy revealed that the morphology of virions in the cytoplasm was abnormal and the assembly of virus particles could not be completed in cytomegalovirus-infected cells treated with a77 1726 indicating that leflunomide interferes with the assembly of virus capsid80 in a study87 of 17 patients with cytomegalovirus disease 88 15 of the patients clinically responded to leflunomide therapy 3 doses of 100 mgday followed by 20 mgdaya dose that maintains blood concentrations of 2550 ngml with viral clearance from blood and healing of involved organs therefore leflunomide is effective for treatment of cytomegalovirus disease88
 the anti-viral efficacy of leflunomide has also been observed in transplant recipients infected with bk virus89 and human papillomavirus hpv90 in patients with polyomavirus type bk nephropathy those that had blood a77 1726 concentrations higher than 40 gml had either cleared the virus or showed progressive reductions of viral load in blood and urine89 in another study90 leflunomide successfully cleared verrucae vulgaris and molluscum lesions in four renal transplant patients with cutaneous warts usually caused by hpv however it is worth noting that leflunomide has been associated with interstitial lung disease91 92 leflunomide-associated interstitial lung disease usually occurs within the first 20 weeks of leflunomide initiation there was a high mortality in patients with pre-existing interstitial lung disease diffuse alveolar damage or ground glass shadowing on high resolution ct91 the exact mechanism remains unclear but the presence of pre-existing interstitial lung disease cigarette smoking low bodyweight and the use of methotrexate are risk factors for leflunomide-induced interstitial lung disease92 it remains unclear if leflunomide would improve or exacerbate the pulmonary lesions in patients with covid-19 there is currently one clinical trial aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral leflunomide tablets against pneumonia caused by sars-cov-2 appendix p 2 another dmard thalidomide which has both anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative activity has also been used in viral infections animal studies have shown that thalidomide inhibits lung injury in mouse models of h1n1 influenza virus infection with improved survival reduced inflammatory cell infiltration reduced concentrations of cytokines il-6 and tnf and chemokines rantes and ip-10 and reduced nuclear factor kappa beta activity93 it was concluded that thalidomide could be an alternative treatment when new influenza viruses emerge especially before new vaccines are developed a uk study94 indicated that thalidomide has immunomodulatory and immune remodelling effects by inhibiting tnf another critical cytokine in covid-19-associated lung injury in addition some studies have shown that thalidomide can treat pulmonary interstitial fibrosis and combat cytokine storm95 96 these studies indicate a potential therapeutic value of thalidomide in viral infection in a case report97 a 45-year-old female patient with severe covid-19 and elevated concentrations of circulating cytokines including il-6 il-10 and ifn on admission was treated with oral thalidomide 100 mg once a day and low-dose methylprednisolone 40 mg intravenously every 12 h for 3 days and then 40 mg intravenously once a day for 5 days due to the severity of clinical manifestations and lack of response to other treatments the patients clinical condition including oxygen index fever nausea and vomiting resolved within 1 week after thalidomide treatment concentrations of il-6 il-10 and ifn all returned to normal range after 6 days of treatment sars-cov-2 tests in swab specimens were negative after 1 week of treatment and lung lesions disappeared 12 days after treatment97 although this is a single case it could provide some useful insight for further clinical investigation there are two clinical trials evaluating the therapeutic potential of thalidomide in patients with moderate or severe covid-19 appendix p 2 there are also many other immune-modulating strategies under clinical investigation for the treatment of covid-19 such as stem-cell therapy and convalescent plasma treatment mesenchymal stem cells mscs are of increased importance in inflammatory disease due to their anti-inflammatory properties animal experiments showed that msc treatment was able to reduce influenza a h5n1-induced acute lung injury in vivo98 stem cells are able to suppress the activities of viruses via chaf1a-mediated and sumo2-mediated epigenetic regulation termed proviral silencing99 several phase 1 and 2 clinical trials have confirmed the safety of msc therapy in patients with ards and have shown beneficial effects100 101 however several issues have limited msc use in clinic such as the lack of clarity with regard to optimal dose and route of msc delivery difficulties in large-scale production and cryopreservation and the potential for substantial variability there are several ongoing clinical trials testing the efficacy of msc in covid-19 appendix pp 56 convalescent plasma from patients who have recovered from sars-cov-2 infection has also been proposed as a potential treatment for covid-19 convalescent plasma has been used in many severe infections such as sars mers and ebola as one of the few therapeutic strategies in the absence of vaccines or other specific treatments102 the efficacy of such therapy especially in covid-19 is being evaluated in ongoing trials appendix p 6 sars-cov-2 has spread rapidly since it first emerged in december 2019 and covid-19 is characterised as a pandemic by who as a new emerging virus there is no approved effective drug or vaccine as of april 16 2020 several existing drugs are being repurposed for the treatment of patients with covid-19 with dozens of ongoing clinical trials assessing their potential efficacy dmards due to their immune-modulating nature could be a potential treatment option for severe covid-19 however there are several issues that need to be taken into consideration first the issue of hyperinflammation versus viral replication although effective anti-viral immunity is required for the clearance of pathogens hyperactivation of immune response causes tissue damage and organ failure similarly there are two sides of immunomodulation therapy in covid-19 and clinicians should determine in which circumstance to use such medications second there are questions about the timing for immunomodulation therapy as noted immunosuppressants could affect anti-viral immune response and the timing should be carefully considered although early intervention is considered as a key factor for the success of immunomodulation therapy in infection-associated hyperinflammation103 direct evidence from rcts are required to determine the appropriate timing for patients with covid-19 finally the pharmacokinetics of oral medications in crucially ill patients merit consideration as physiological alterations in these patients can substantially affect the pharmacokinetics some drugs will need to be given parenterally due to gastrointestinal failure eg chloroquine has been used parenterally to treat severely ill patients with malaria although it is absorbed reliably in these patients104 compared with the oral route parenteral administration of chloroquine results in rapid absorption and transient high plasma concentrations which is associated with increased risk of acute toxicity105 in addition impaired clearance of the drugs might be problematic in patients with hepatic dysfunction and renal failure therefore smaller and more frequent doses continuous intravenous infusion or choosing a less toxic drug eg using hydroxychloroquine instead of chloroquine should be considered in patients who are severely ill104 105 the many ongoing trials will hopefully provide a better understanding of the potential effects of immunomodulation therapy on covid-19-associated hyperinflammation 
two reviewers independently did a computerised literature search of pubmed ovid and web of science using the terms covid-19 or sars-cov-2 or 2019-ncov dmards or immunosuppressant or immunomodulation or anti-rheumatic drugs or immunotherapy and a combination thereof in english language we incorporated published and unpublished articles including preprint articles into this review from december 30 2019 to april 16 2020 we included publications cited in the papers when relevant we also referred to related scientific reports such as the official website of who and the chinese health organisation
  title enantiomers of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine exhibit different activities against sars-cov-2 in vitro evidencing s-hydroxychloroquine as a potentially superior drug for covid-19 author guanguan li jing sun yingjun li yongjie shi jincun zhao tony zhang y xumu zhang  affiliations  in all of the clinical trials for covid-19 conducted thus far and among those ongoing involving chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine the drug substance used has invariably been chloroquine cq diphosphate or hydroxychloroquine hcq sulfate ie the phosphoric or sulfuric acid salt of a racemic mixture of r-and s-enantiomer 5050 respectively as a result the clinical outcome from previous cq or hcq trials were in fact the collective manifestation of both r and senantiomers with inherent different pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties and toxicity liabilities our data for the first time demonstrated the stereoselective difference of cq and hcq against live sars-cov-2 virus in a biosafety level 3 laboratory s-chloroquine s-cq and shydroxychloroquine s-hcq were found to be 27 and 60 more active against sars-cov-2 as compared to r-cq and r-hcq respectively with these data and previous work on stereoselective metabolism of cq and hcq we recommend that future clinical studies should employ s-hcq as a potentially superior drug substance for the treatment of covid-19 for improved therapeutic index  in the last few months the virulence and lethality of coronavirus breakout have presented an unprecedented challenge to the medical community and world governments coronavirus disease 2019 covid- 19  first broke out in december 2019 caused by an infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 previously known as the novel coronavirus 2019 2019-ncov 1 2 it has now affected more than 184 countries and regions 1 3-6 becoming a global pandemic as declared by the world health organization who by may 25 2020  the cumulative number of confirmed cases of covid-19 infection has exceeded 54 million worldwide with more than 344997 recorded deaths a fatality rate of 63  approximately according to realtime data released by johns hopkins university 7 with the prospect of effective vaccines months away from being developed and launched scientists and physicians alike have turned to existing drugs with known toxicity and human pharmacokinetic data to deal with this global healthcare crisis numerous treatment regimens for covid- 19 have been proposed and tested in clinical trials with varying degrees of controls and sizes of subject enrollment with limited access to compounds and live virus for testing research institutions around the world have also resorted to tools like virtual screening and modeling to compile lists of potential drugs that may be efficacious for covid-19 8 9 10 many of these have been evaluated against sars-cov-2 in vitro these include some medications commonly used for decades such as chloroquine 11 12 13 arbidol 14 ribavirin 15 16 17 lopinavir etc 18 19 20 the list also contains some drugs in development for instance remdesivir 11 17 a previously studied drug candidate for treating ebola infection 21 22 among the most notable and also controversial repurposed drugs are chloroquine cq and hydroxychloroquine hcq as shown in figure 1a  with several initial promising results especially when combined with azithromycin or zinc supplement being reported 23 only to be followed by contradicting reports on lack of efficacy and presence of severe side effects especially among the higher dosed patients based on the preclinical results both cq and hcq have displayed inhibition of viral replication 11 12 13 the 70-year-old cq was first used in clinical practice as an anti-malarial drug and its indications were extended to treat systemic lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis and several infections 24 originally developed as a safer alternative to cq for treating malaria the analogous compound hydroxychloroquine sulfate 25 has become a popular drug for treating autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis ra and system lupus emphysema sle 26 27 in fact it is the 2 nd most prescribed medicine for rheumatoid arthritis in the united states with nearly half a billion tablets dispensed in 2019 both drugs have a long history as inexpensive and well-received treatment options for malaria autoimmune as well as infectious diseases even for women patients during pregnancy 24 although the us fda has granted emergency use authorization eua of cq and hcq for treating covid-19 on march 19 2020 we believe the verdict is still out on their ultimate safety and efficacy by the last account there are currently 141 and 296 ongoing or planned clinical trials clinicaltrialsgov against covid-19 involving the use of cq and hcq respectively while remdesivir another repurposed antiviral that has also generated enormous excitement in the global communities has also been approved by fda under an eua for treating covid-19 and is emerging as the standard of care its demonstrated efficacy is far from ideal the development of less expensive safer more effective and more accessible treatment options is still an urgent unmet medical need we noticed certain caveats about cq and hcq that are worthy of being taken into accounts by stakeholders first cq and hcq have been in use for decades by millions of patients with diverse health conditions since their approval in the mid-1900s hence a wealth of information about the adverse events is available 28 29 30 secondly unlike iv administered drugs including remdesivir cq and hcq can be taken conveniently as oral tablets thirdly cq and hcq are among the least expensive drugs being considered for covid-19 with an excellent prospect of accessibility for the global population should its safety and efficacy be proven by further and more definitive randomized and controlled clinical trials with more appropriate tailoring according to patient conditions time of intervention and dosing regimen last but not least all preclinical and clinical trials of cq and hcq for covid-19 thus far have been carried out using the common cq and hcq formulations 31 ie the phosphoric or sulfuric acid salt of a racemic mixture of cq or hcq respectively commercial chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine drug products are administrated as their respective racemates of a 5050 mixture of two enantiomers s-and r-isomers the r-and sisomers are in an enantiomeric relationship meaning that these two compounds have the same chemical compositions but are a mirror image relationship to each in the spatial arrangement as shown in figure 1b  compounds that cannot superimpose with their own mirror images are defined as chiral compounds life the biological system is chiral in nature as proteins are composed of amino acids of predominately that of the l-configuration and sugars of mostly d-configurations this predisposes different enantiomers of a chiral drug to interact with proteins differently and hence the different pharmacological effects would be expected as chiral drugs the two enantiomers of cq or hcq might exhibit distinct efficacy and safety profiles in patients these differences big or small can translate into performance variances that could potentially influence the decision process on whether either enantiomer of cq or hcq can ultimately become a viable therapeutic agent for covid-19 through further testing including clinical trials the clinical trials for covid-19 conducted so far have all been using a racemic mixture of either cq or hcq hence the observations were actually the collective manifestation of the two different albeit very similar optical isomers of these drugs although cq as racemic mixtures exhibited some antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 in vitro ec50 113 m in vero e6 cells and hcq was also active with less toxicity 11 12 13 31 the efficacy and possible toxicity of each individual isomer against sars-cov-2 have not been reported in any preclinical or clinical studies yet in this paper we wish to present the preliminary results on such a difference exhibited by the enantiomers of cq and hcq respectively when subjected to in vitro test against sars-cov-2 african green monkey kidney vero e6 cell line was obtained from american type culture collection atcc cat no 1586 and maintained in dulbeccos modified eagles medium dmem gibco supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum fbs at 37 c incubator with 5 co2 a clinical isolate sars-cov-2 virus genebank accession no mt1232901 was propagated in vero e6 cells and viral titer was determined by plaque assay all the infection experiments were performed in a biosafety level 3 bls 3 laboratory the racemic chloroquine diphosphate cas no 50-63-5 and hydroxychloroquine sulfate cas no 747-36-4 purchased from bidepharm were converted into free racemic chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine respectively under basic conditions the enantiomers of the racemic mixtures were separated by preparative chiral chromatography as free-bases with a shimadzu lc-20ad hplc equipment chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine was dissolved in isocratic nhexaneisopropanoldiethylamine with a ratio of 851501 vvv and the loading needed for cq and hcq was 240 mgml and 235 mgml respectively the resulting solution was loaded onto a chiralpak ay-h ayh0ce-vc001 chiral column which was then eluted with the same solvent system the preparation conditions were as follows the flow rate was 10 mlmin the detection wavelength was uv 254 nm and the temperature was 35  the fractions of each enantiomer were collected and combined the pure optical isomer was obtained by removing the solvent under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator the ee value of each enantiomer of both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was higher than 98 the spectral data were identical to those reported in the literature 32 33 these free-base enantiomers were converted to the enantiomerically pure diphosphate salt and sulfate salt respectively as described in the experimental section antiviral assays against sars-cov-2 in vitro were performed in a biosafety level-3 laboratory bsl-3 at the state key laboratory of respiratory disease guangzhou medical university guangzhou customs district technology center log phase vero e6 cells were plated overnight in 96-well cell culture plate greiner cat no655090 and then pretreated with the indicated concentration of compounds for 1 h each concentration had three replicates sars-cov-2 with a multiplicity of infection moi of 005 was subsequently added after 1 h the medium was replaced with a fresh drug-containing one 24 hours later the cells were fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 02 triton x 100 after blocking with 5 bovine serum albumin bsa at room temperature for 1 h the rabbit polyclonal antibody against sars coronavirus nucleoprotein np 11000 as the primary antibody was used to incubate the cells and then alexa 488 labeled secondary antibody donkey anti-rabbit igg1500 jackson was added the nuclei were stained with dapi sigma the plate was scanned using celigo image cytometer and fluorescence microscopy images were taken the inhibition rate was calculated using the mean intensity of a green channel versus a dapi channel the ic50 value for each compound was calculated using graphpad prism software version 70 using a non-linear regression equation from the chiral hplc separation of the racemic chloroquine the first eluting compound at 486 minutes was found to be dextrorotary  and thus assigned as the s-cq and the second compound at 533 minutes as r-cq with a specific rotation of 797 and -744 respectively as depicted in figure 2d -f for the case of hydroxychloroquine in figure 2a -c the first eluting compound at 1017 minutes was determined as s-hcq and the second compound at 1185 minutes was r-hcq with a specific rotation of 956 and -1078 respectively the enantiomeric excess value of each enantiomer for both hcq and cq was found to be higher than 98 as shown in figure 2b  c e and f in all cases baseline separation was achieved material recovery was 832 g for loaded 964 g of hcq case and 504 g for loaded 504 g of cq  results from the in vitro antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 in vero e6 cells showed that both cq and hcq and their enantiomers exhibited respectable antiviral effect in a concentrationdependent manner the ic50 values for the racemic chloroquine diphosphate rac-cq and its r and s enantiomer against sars-cov-2 in vitro were 1801 m 1975 m and 1761 m respectively as displayed in figure 3a  shown in figure 3b  the ic50 values for the racemic hydroxychloroquine sulfate rac-hcq and its r and s enantiomer were 1752 m 2445 m and 1444 m respectively in addition we tested the antiviral activity of azithromycin that was used as a combination drug with hcq for treating covid-19 in patients the single-dose of azithromycin afforded an ic50 value of 1575 m shown in figure 3c  the results from immunofluorescence microscopy of sars-cov-2 infection displayed visually a better antiviral effect of the s-enantiomers of both cq and hcq with a 27 and 60 improvement as compared to their r-enantiomer starting at the dose of 1 m respectively the data showed that the antiviral activity of s-cq was were relatively similar to the racemic cq  figure 4a  whereas the efficacy of the s-hcq was much better than its racemates  figure 4b  on the other hand azithromycin alone started to exhibit an antiviral effect at a relatively high concentration which is over 10 m  figure 4c  figure 3  at 24 h pi the infected cells were fixed and then incubated with the primary antibody rabbit polyclonal antibody against sars coronavirus nucleoprotein followed by alexa 488 labeled secondary antibody the nuclei were stained with dapi bars at 100 m r-and s-enantiomers are different substances and by definition should not be expected to have the same biological effect in a living system which is inherently chiral enantiomers often have different pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics behaviors and hence different therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles however the significance of this principle in drug development has not been fully appreciated at the time when cq and hcq were developed 70 some years ago one of the most notorious examples of drug chirality is thalidomide a chiral drug first marketed as a racemic form in 1957 in europe as an antiemetic for treating morning sickness and other ailments the drug was withdrawn from the market in 1961 amid the emergence of birth defects among newborn children of woman patients it was later determined that the two enantiomers caused distinctly different effects from one another and the s-isomer was attributed to being the culprit for the teratogenic properties 34 since the enantiomers of thalidomide interconverts in vivo efforts to develop a stable single-enantiomer thalidomide was thwarted eventually the racemic form was repurposed and launched for oncology applications under the brand thalomid strictly contraindicated for pregnancy the thalidomide tragedy brought up a lot of attention and concerns about the importance of chirality in the drug development process this eventually culminated in more specific guidance and regulations regarding chiral drug development by the fda in the 1990s cq or hcq would unlikely be approved as they had been submitted to a current regulatory authority who will likely demand the delineation of each enantiomers properties and demonstration of the non-inferiority of the racemate in the context of safety and efficacy before it is allowed for marketing approval unlike thalidomide cq and hcq are stereochemically stable and the interconversion between the two enantiomers has not been observed in vivo and is unlikely from a mechanistic point of view the separation of the r-and s-enantiomers of cq and hcq has not been reported until the early 1990s 35 36 as part of the metabolite profiling studies for hcq 35 with the enantio-discriminating analytical methods available for cq hcq and their respective metabolites several studies demonstrated varying degrees of differences of pharmacological properties between the two enantiomers of cq and hcq both cq and hcq have extremely long half-lives approximating 50 days predominantly due to their huge volume of distribution 37 with such a low metabolic rate the drugs accumulate excessively in tissues over time especially eyes skin brain heart and liver long term and higher doses other than the recommended maximal dose for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine 300 mgkg and 400 mgkg respectively according to the fda put the patients at risk of adverse effects such as irreversible retinopathy neuropathic and cardiac toxicities 24 26 27 38 one of the major adverse effects associated with the clinical applications of cq and hcq is ocular toxicity manifested as pigmentary retinopathy especially at higher doses while the mechanism remains unelucidated the pharmacokinetics differences between the two enantiomers of cq and hcq have been documented both in animals and human 28 37 39 40 in a study of hydroxychloroquine distribution in rabbits it was found that the r-enantiomer was stereoselectively accumulated in the ocular tissue with an rs-hcq ratio of 6040 after the administration of the racemates however with an opposite ratio of 4060 for the total plasma concentration implying a possibility for a more significant contribution of the r-isomer for the ocular toxicity 41 the results were consistent with the data of clinical pk study in humans where the whole blood concentration of the r-enantiomer was much higher than its antipode whereas the ratio of rs concentrations of the chiral metabolites was less than 1 besides the renal clearance for the s-enantiomer was twice greater than the r-enantiomer and a shorter elimination half-life was observed with the s-enantiomer 28 37 39 40 in vitro assays using human plasma indicated that r-and s-hcq enantiomers were 37 and 64 protein-bound respectively implying r-hcq would have a higher volume of distribution than s-hcq these results indicated a faster renal excretion andor more accentuated liver metabolism and lower volume of distribution of the s-enantiomer as compared to those of the r-enantiomer 42 thus a stereoselective elimination for the s-isomer and a stereoselective protein for the r-isomer were considered as attribution to the differences in disposition and distribution into tissues such as ocular compartment the pharmacological effects were also proven to be different between the two enantiomers of cq and hcq for various applications the difference in their antimalarial activities was reported in 1994 30 it was noted that by scientists at sterling winthrop inc that s-hcq was approximately 70 more active than r-hcq in the rat pleurisy macrophage model 43 later on s-and r-hcq were found to suppress hiv-1 replication to a similar extent and dose proportionally and were no more toxic than racemic hcq 44 since hcqs antimalarial and antiviral effects had been purported to originate from its ability to increase endosomal ph the authors demonstrated that both enantiomers of hcq increased endosomal ph to similar levels in a dose proportionally manner unlike the much-explored pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects of the racemates limited toxicity information has shown that s-chloroquine seems to be less toxic than the r-chloroquine 29 no further animal studies or clinical evidence was presented about the pharmacological activities of each enantiomer in the studies of malaria or autoimmune diseases the efficacy and safety of cq andor hcq for treating covd-19 need to be validated by larger and more definitive clinical trials the complicated effects of ages doses 45 disease states prior treatments underlying physiological conditions of enrolled patients should be taking into consideration for all of which can cause bias in the trial outcomes however running trials with a racemic drug represents one of the most significant variances ie with a drug substance of only 50 potency of the preferred isomer and will unnecessarily complicate the delineation of clinical outcomes contributed by each enantiomer fortunately racemic hcq is readily available with a worldwide production volume exceeding 300 metric tons and growing separation of a racemic mixture into pure enantiomer forms is industrially feasible and asymmetric synthesis is also very promising as long-term solutions there seems to be no excuse to continue running a trial using racemic cq or hcq other than ready availability with this backdrop we separated both racemic mixtures of cq and hcq by chiral hplc and tested the antiviral effects of r-and s-cq and hcq as well as the racemic cq hcq and azithromycin in parallel and the result is illustrated in figure 3 and 4 the most significant finding from this study is that both s-cq and s-hcq exhibited more pronounced activities than their respective r-enantiomer in the assay against sars-cov-2 in vitro specifically the result with s-hcq demonstrated significant enantioselectivity with a 60  more efficiency than r-hcq the ic50 of s-enantiomer of cq and hcq were 1761 m and 1444 m respectively compared with their r-enantiomers with a respective ic50 value of 1975 m and 2445 m the ic50 value of the racemic mixtures of cq and hcq was 1801 m and 1752 m respectively which fell between the two enantiomers as expected the ic50 of the racemic mixture of both cq and hcq indicated that at the testing conditions the s-isomers were the major contributors to the antiviral activities implying that the r-isomers were either coming for the ride being minor contributors to the antiviral activities providing hitherto unknown benefits such as cytokine storm management or contributing to untoward side effects with our preliminary data the antiviral potency against sars-cov-2 in vitro of both enantiomers from the racemates was differentiated in the presented condition this suggested that covid-19 may be treated with the more effective and safer s-enantiomer substantially free of the renantiomer that might introduce adverse effects and dilute the therapeutic efficacy the single senantiomer can be possibly administrated at a lower dose weight than that of the racemate for the same or improved therapeutic efficacy and fewer side effects as a potentially superior treatment for covid-19 with a broader therapeutic index since the mechanism of hcqs antiviral effect remains to be elucidated we remain cautious at explaining the synergies between the antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities without enantioselectivity data for the latter our data clearly indicated that r-and s-enantiomer of cq and hcq exhibited significantly different properties against sars-cov-2 this is the first time that the enantioselective antiviral activities of cq and hcq against sars-cov-2 have been demonstrated in vitro the senantiomers of both cq and hcq proved to be 27 and 60 more active than their corresponding r-enantiomers since we have demonstrated the in vitro antiviral activities mainly derived from the s-isomer it is reasonable to expect the drug dose can be decreased to half of that or even less than the racemates for a similar antiviral effect while eliminating the untoward side effects brought upon by the risomer moreover our data showed a more significant difference in antiviral activity between two enantiomers of hcq as compared to cq taken all these together with previous studies on malaria hiv and human pharmacokinetic data implicating greater ocular accumulation of r-isomers we opine a clear preference for the further development of s-hcq as an enantiomerically pure drug for treating covid-9 within this compound class in summary we have demonstrated unequivocally a pronounced difference in antiviral activities of enantiomers of cq and hcq racemate cq or hcq would be less preferred for covid-19 applications unless shown to be so by further pharmacological testing with the prospect of reducing or eliminating adverse effects attributed to the presence of r-hcq we strongly recommend further studies especially human clinical trials be conducted with pure s-hcq constituting the most expedient and highly probable way to double the therapeutic index of hcq the

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has generated a worldwide pandemic the interruption of its spread depends on a combination of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions initial sars-cov-2 prevention includes social distancing the use of face masks environmental hygiene and hand washing1 although the most important pharmacologic interventions to prevent sars-cov-2 infection are likely to be vaccines the repurposing of established drugs for short-term prophylaxis is another more immediate option some researchers have promoted chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment and prevention of illness from a variety of microorganisms including sars-cov2 hydroxychloroquine can inhibit replication of sars-cov-2 in vitro3 some observational studies have suggested benefits of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of covid-19 whereas other treatment reports have described mixed results4 boulware et al now report in the journal the results of a randomized trial testing hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis for covid-195 this is described by the investigators as a pragmatic trial in which participants were recruited through social media and almost all data were reported by the participants adults who described a high-risk or moderate-risk exposure to someone with covid-19 in their household or an occupational setting were provided hydroxychloroquine or placebo by mail within 4 days after the reported exposure and before symptoms would be expected to develop the authors enrolled 821 participants an illness that was considered to be consistent with covid-19 developed in 107 participants 130 but was confirmed by polymerase-chain-reaction assay in less than 3 of the participants the incidence of a new illness compatible with covid-19 did not differ significantly between participants receiving hydroxychloroquine 49 of 414 118 and those receiving placebo 58 of 407 143 although participant-reported side effects were significantly more common in those receiving hydroxychloroquine 401 than in those receiving placebo 168 no serious adverse reactions were reported this trial has many limitations acknowledged by the investigators the trial methods did not allow consistent proof of exposure to sars-cov-2 or consistent laboratory confirmation that the symptom complex that was reported represented a sars-cov-2 infection indeed the specificity of participant-reported covid-19 symptoms is low6 so it is hard to be certain how many participants in the trial actually had covid-19 adherence to the interventions could not be monitored and participants reported less-than-perfect adherence more notably in the group receiving hydroxychloroquine in addition those enrolled in the trial were younger median age 40 years and had fewer coexisting conditions than persons in whom severe covid-19 is most likely to develop7 so enrollment of higher-risk participants might have yielded a different result the trial design raises questions about the expected prevention benefits of hydroxychloroquine studies of postexposure prophylaxis are intended to provide an intervention in the shortest possible time to prevent infection in a small-animal model of sars-cov-2 infection8 prevention of infection or more severe disease was observed only when the experimental antiviral agent was given before or shortly after exposure in the current trial the long delay between perceived exposure to sars-cov-2 and the initiation of hydroxychloroquine 3 days in most participants suggests that what was being assessed was prevention of symptoms or progression of covid-19 rather than prevention of sars-cov-2 infection drugs for the prevention of infections must have an excellent safety profile when hydroxychloroquine was initially promoted as a possible solution to sars-cov-2 infection the safety of the drug was emphasized2 under closer scrutiny however the potential for cardiac toxic effects and overall adverse outcomes have been emphasized especially in persons with underlying coexisting conditions that increase the risk of severe covid-199 boulware et al report frequent mild side effects of hydroxychloroquine but cardiac toxic effects could not be assessed so what are we to do with the results of this trial the advocacy and widespread use of hydroxychloroquine seem to reflect a reasonable fear of sars-cov-2 infection however it would appear that to some extent the media and social forces  rather than medical evidence  are driving clinical decisions and the global covid-19 research agenda10 on june 1 2020 clinicaltrialsgov listed a remarkable 203 covid-19 trials with hydroxychloroquine 60 of which were focused on prophylaxis an important question is to what extent the article by boulware et al should affect planned or ongoing hydroxychloroquine trials if postexposure prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine does not prevent symptomatic sars-cov-2 infection with recognition of the limitations of the trial under discussion should other trials of postexposure prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine continue unchanged do the participants in these trials need to be informed of these results do these trial results with respect to postexposure prophylaxis affect trials of preexposure prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine some of which are very large eg the healthcare worker exposure response and outcomes of hydroxychloroquine hero-hcq trial involving 15000 health care workers clinicaltrialsgov number nct04334148 the results reported by boulware et al are more provocative than definitive suggesting that the potential prevention benefits of hydroxychloroquine remain to be determined  covid-19 chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease and anti-rheumatic treatments dieu-donn oudraogo wendlassida tiendrbogo joelle fulgence kabor honor ntsiba   since december 2019 the pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 raises a real public health problem 1 covid-19 appeared in wuhan hubei province in china covid-19 sars-cov 2 is a coronavirus with nearly 80 common nucleotide with sars-cov 1 2 it is manifested by fever dry cough rhinitis asthenia headache and dyspnea but often by acute respiratory distress syndrome that can lead to death 35 the mortality risk factors appear to be mainly diabetes high blood pressure coronary heart disease chronic obstructive lung disease and chronic kidney disease 6 although hypotheses are made the pathogenesis of covid-19 is not clearly elucidated choices of treatment are therefore empirical based on previous experience with sars-cov1 or milddle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov 79 antiretrovirals lopinavirritonavir remdesivir ribavirin have been tried in treating patients 1013 in addition drugs that have been used in rheumatology for decades seem to be effective in this infection and are for the most part being studied 8 1416 the rational of use of these anti-rheumatic drugs is based on the cytokinic storm hyperproduction of il1 il6 tnf  in the body by covid-19 in its severe form 7 14 17 18 rheumatologists with their experience in administration of these drugs could help improve their use 16 covid-19 therefore raises two major concerns for rheumatologists do chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases and their immunosuppressive treatment cause a risk of admission to intensive care units or high mortality in infected patient which anti-rheumatic drugs can be used to treat covid-19 coronaviruses covs are viruses of the subfamily of orthocoronavirinae from the family coronaviridae the name coronavirus from latin meaning virus with a crown is due to the appearance of virions under an electron microscope with a fringe of large bulbous projections that resemble the solar corona 19 coronaviruses have a viral envelope with a positive rna genome and a kilobase capsid shell which is incredibly large for an rna virus they are classified as nidovirals since all viruses of this order produce a nested set of sub-genomic mrna during infection peak envelope membrane and capsid proteins contribute to the overall structure of all coronaviruses these rna viruses are single-stranded single-stranded and positive baltimore classification group iv they can mutate and recombine cytokine dysregulation is a particular interest in patients with covid-19 infection 14 17 18 20 the host immune response is by one side essential for the resolution of covid-19 infection but it can also be crucial for the pathogenesis of major clinical manifestations of the disease the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 has been identified as the host cell-surface receptor for sars-cov2 envelope spike glycoprotein 21 ace2 is a type i membrane protein expressed on cells in the kidney heart gastrointestinal tract blood vessels and importantly lung at2 alveolar epithelial cells which are particularly prone to viral infection 22 sars-cov-2 infection leads to the downregulation of ace2 expression thus resulting in excessive production of angiotensin ii by the related enzyme ace it has been suggested that the stimulation of type 1a angiotensin ii receptor agtr1a increases pulmonary vascular permeability thus potentially explaining the increased lung damage when the expression of ace2 is decreased 23 sarzi-puttini et al hypothesized that the decrease in inf in covid-19 may suppress th1 and favor th2 7 some of the cytokines seem to be up-regulated especially in patients with more severe disease and t cell depletion huang et al found that il-2 il-7 il-10 g-csf ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1a and tnf- levels correlated with disease severity 24 diao et al found that disease severity correlated with tnf- il-6 and il-10 levels 25 thus documenting tnf- hyperproduction in the serum of covid-19 patients the regulation of this cytokine storm remains the challenge in the treatment of covi-19 infection and explains the use of chloroquine and its derivatives anti-cytokines anti-il1 anti-il6 anti-tnf and anti-jak the corona virus disease 2019 or covid-19 pandemic is responsible for high mortality in patients with risk factors such as age over 70 years diabetes cardiovascular history chronic respiratory disease chronic renal failure on dialysis cancers during treatment immune deficiency cirrhosis obesity and pregnant women 6 inflammatory rheumatism does not appear to be associated with admission to intensive care is a patient with chronic inflammatory rheumatism receiving immunosuppressive treatments not at risk for a severe form of vidoc-19 infection to date little data are available on chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases and covid-19 26 rheumatoid arthritis ra is associated with an increased risk of infection compared to a general population without ra 27 this increased risk of infection is correlated with the presence of risk factors that are identical to those reported in covid-19 27 28 on the other hand corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs by inhibiting the inflammatory response increase the risk of infections especially bacterial and mycotic infections 28 29 methotrexate treatment does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of infection other than a combination with corticosteroids 30 in contrast to methotrexate the biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs are responsible for an increased risk of infection correlated with advanced age female sex treatment with prednisone at a dose over 75 mgday and a high number of hospital stays 28 the particularity of the pandemic of covid-19 requires specific data for this infection monti s et al studied the clinical course of covid-19 in a series of patients with chronic arthritis treated with immunosuppressive targeted therapies 31 the authors have collected information on 320 patients female 68 mean age 55  14 years treated with bdmards or tsdmards 57 with rheumatoid arthritis 43 with spondyloarthritis 52 treated with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors 40 with other bdmards and 8 with tsdmards thirteen confirmed andor suspected covid-19 patients were diagnosed only one patient required hospitalization and was 65 years of age no deaths were observed 31 despite the small sample size in this study and the limited data on covid-19 and inflammatory rheumatism it seems to be a lower risk of severity and death in this group of patients apart from the usual risk factors diabetes mellitus hypertension obesity in this study it is also reported that in a reference center for the management of patients with covid-19 out of 700 patients no severe patient was under biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs 31 until further studies clarify the absence of higher risk in patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatism increased monitoring of these patients is necessary and application of barrier gestures is useful for all chloroquine or chloroquinine is an antimalarial drug of the 4-aminoquinoline family that has been widely marketed in the form of salts sulphate or phosphate it is a medicine used for so long in preventive and curative treatment of malaria for several decades chloroquine has been used in rheumatology for its immunomodulating effect particularly on systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis studies have also shown the antiviral activity of chloroquine in vitro on h5n1 avian influenza 32 chikungunya 33 zika 34 ebola 35 and sars-coronavirus 1 36 chloroquine acts by increasing the endosomal ph required for viralhost cell fusion and as demonstrated in studies on sars-cov it may also interfere with the glycosylation of ace2 receptors which may inhibit viral entry into the target cell 36 a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of chloroquine in the treatment of covid-19 involving six articles and 23 ongoing clinical trials in china concluded that chloroquine is effective in limiting the replication of sars-cov-2 in vitro 37 basing on the action of chloroquine on covid-19 through its in vitro efficacy and on the first results of open studies carried out in beijing hospitals in hunan province in central and southern china in guangdong province prof raoults team proposes that it be used in the treatment of covid-19 15 however the therapeutic efficacy and safety of chloroquine are still being discussed 38 39 for franck touret and xavier de lamballerie of inserm 1207 in marseille caution must be exercised in view of the previous antiviral failures of chloroquine in vivo and its deleterious effect during acute viral infections 38 however chloroquine appears to be effective in covid-related acute respiratory distress syndrome improves pulmonary radiological lesions accelerates the seronegativity of the virus and shortens the duration of the disease 39 chinese experts recommend that patients diagnosed as mild moderate and severe cases of covid-19 pneumonia and without contraindications to chloroquine be treated with 500 mg chloroquine twice a day for 10 days 40 since then chloroquine has been incorporated into treatment protocols for covid-19 infection in asia 40 and many other countries hydroxychloroquine is a derivative of chloroquine it differs from chloroquine by having a hydroxyl oh group at the end of each chain it has replaced chloroquine for many years in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis the pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using sars-cov-2-infected vero cells physiologically based pharmacokinetic models pbpk were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data using the pbpk models hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen while considering the drugs safety profile hydroxychloroquine ec50  072 m was found to be more potent than chloroquine ec50  547 m in vitro based on pbpk models results a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for sars-cov-2 infection as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine to inhibit sars-cov-2 in vitro 41 this study is confirmed by other authors who suggest that in addition to its anti-viral and immunomodulatory effect hydroxychloroquine had an anti-inflammatory effect that may mitigate the cytokine storm observed during covid-19 infection 42 zhou et al propose that hydroxychloroquine hcq which exhibits an antiviral effect highly similar to that of cq could serve as a better therapeutic approach hcq is likely to attenuate the severe progression of covid-19 inhibiting the cytokine storm by suppressing t cell activation they herein strongly urge that clinical trials are performed to assess the preventive effects of hcq in both disease infection and progression 43 in the same vein gautret p et al of professor raoults team in an open label non-randomized study of 36 patients infected with covid-19 showed a significant reduction in viral load at day 6 of inclusion compared to controls and a lower mean duration of viral carriage than in untreated patients in the literature azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination all patients in gautret el al study were proposed oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate 200 mg three times per days during 10 days 44 among hydroxychloroquine-treated patients six received azithromycin 500 mg day 1 followed by 250 mg per day the next 4 days in our experience of hydroxychloroquine use in treating systemic lupus erythematosus and some forms of rheumatoid arthritis 93 patients were included the average cumulative dose of hydroxychloroquine was 376 g  40548 with extremes of 7 g and 2336 g the average duration of treatment with hydroxychloroquine was 283 years  289 years with extremes of 008 years and 15 years maculopathy was extremely rare 21 45 using corticosteroids during covid-19 infection is highly controversial chen et al reported 19 19 patients treated with corticosteroids for 315 days and methylprednisolone 12 mgkg per day and recommend for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome that this treatment be of the shortest possible duration 3 for zhang et al adverse effects largely dominate the benefit of corticosteroids 14 wang et al reported 62 449 patients who received corticosteroid therapy without improvement 46 russel et al reported clinical evidence did not support corticosteroid treatment for covid-19 lung injury 47 these studies are supported by others that report no benefit from corticosteroid therapy during covd-19 infection 48 49 for ling et al the duration of viral rna detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group 15 days vs 80 days respectively t    2550 p    0013 and the duration of viral rna detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group 20 days vs 11 days respectively t    4631 p    0001 so these authors did not recommended glucocorticoids for treating covid-19 especially for mild disease 36 for zheng et al in severe covid-19 patients early and short-term use of low dose of methylprednisolone was beneficial and did not delay sars-cov-2 rna clearance and influence igg antibody production 50 due to the lack of evidences the interium guideline of who does not support routinely give systemic corticosteroids for treatment of viral pneumonia outside of clinical trials 41 a new randomized controlled trial rct recently registered by zhou et al that will compare methylprednisolone via

new york city takahisa mikami hirotaka miyashita takayuki yamada matthew harrington daniel steinberg andrew dunn evan siau   the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a pandemic that has impacted medical systems societies and economies worldwide the first case of covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 virus sars-cov-21 was reported in china in december 20192 the virus has spread globally at a rapid pace resulting in more than 2 million confirmed cases as of april 17 20203 in recent weeks new york city has emerged as an epicenter of the pandemic with over 120000 confirmed cases and over 13000 deaths due to confirmed or probable covid-19 death as of april 17 20204 studies of the clinical characteristics and epidemiologic characteristics of covid-19 have been conducted in countries experiencing outbreaks earlier than the usa511 large-scale observational data of the clinical characteristics and outcomes of covid-19 in the population of the usa are scarce in this study we describe the clinical characteristics of covid-19 in ambulatory and inpatient settings and identify risk factors associated with mortality in hospitalized patients a multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients with covid-19 patients was conducted using the medical records of the mount sinai health system a large urban health system of 8 hospitals and more than four hundred ambulatory practices in the new york city metropolitan area patients with a positive sars-cov-2 test result and an encounter with a healthcare provider for covid-19 between march 12 and april 17 2020 were included in this study a confirmed case of covid-19 was defined as a positive result on reverse-transcriptasepolymerase-chain-reaction rt-pcr assay of nasopharyngeal swab specimens the study population was dichotomized into ambulatory and hospitalized groups the former included patients whose encounter was an office visit emergency department ed visit or telehealthtelemedicine inpatients and ambulatory patients who were subsequently admitted to the hospital were included in the hospitalized group both groups were further subdivided into survivors and non-survivors ambulatory non-survivors were patients who had expired prior to presentation to the ed who had expired in the ed prior to admission to the hospital units or who had an office or telemedicine encounter and were later found out to be deceased ambulatory survivors included all other ambulatory patients hospitalized non-survivors were patients who had expired as of april 17 2020 hospitalized survivors were patients who had been discharged home or to other facilities as of april 17 2020 icahn school of medicine at mount sinai has waived informed consent and institutional review board approval

comorbidities and treatments continuous variables were reported as median with interquartile range categorical variables were expressed as proportions temporary changes of vital signs and laboratory values in survivors and non-survivors for the first 14 days after admission were assessed to illustrate the risk associated with changes in the continuous variables including vital signs and laboratory values multivariate generalized additive models were used to calculate the odds ratio or for mortality with each median value set as a reference ie or  1 the hazard ratio hr of each variable for mortality risk was assessed using univariate cox proportional hazard regression model to account for missing data values for laboratory results we introduced multiple imputation which is a procedure used to replace missing values with other plausible values by creating multiple filling-in patterns to avert bias caused by missing data using the dataset with imputed values univariate and multivariate cox model were fit to calculate hr the multivariate cox model was adjusted for the following variables assessed in the univariate cox model patients age sex race cigarette use history

analysis we excluded variables from the univariable analysis if their between-group differences were not significant if the number of events was too small to calculate hazard ratios or if they had collinearity with other significant values each hospital was considered by the clustering term in the cox proportional hazard model analysis where the clustering effect associated with hospitals was accounted for by the robust sandwich estimator preliminary confirmation of predictability of the cox proportional hazard model demonstrated the area under the curve auc to be 0808 95 ci 07900825 supplementary figure 1 to investigate the effect of hydroxychloroquine while addressing the imbalance among treatment groups we introduced inverse probability weighting iptw based on propensity scoring to control for observed differences in baseline characteristics between treatment group and control group iptw was calculated based on the same variables as used in the cox regression models except for hydroxychloroquine use we then fitted an iptw-adjusted cox with doubly robust methods survival curves with stratification for hydroxychloroquine were constructed using the kaplan-meier

from across the new york city metropolitan area the clinical characteristics described here represent the first large retrospective cohort study from the us population in a city at the epicenter of the pandemic early reports showed that covid-19 had a mortality rate among all confirmed cases of 212 which is significantly lower compared with that of 34 with mers13 and 10 with sars14 the mortality rate in hospitalized patients reported previously ranged from 4 to 282 79 11 the mortality rate of 259 among hospitalized patients in our study may be explained by more severe disease in our total cohort by a different reporting method or by geographic variation we identified several risk factors associated with mortality in hospitalized patients with covid-19 that have been previously reported including older age and male sex we report additional risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality including low sbp tachypnea low spo2 low egfr and higher levels of il-6 d-dimer and troponin levels the severity of coronavirus infection in humans has been previously described to increase during viral clearance suggesting pathogenicity arising from host immune response15 our study confirmed again that older patients with covid-19 hospitalization are at significantly higher risk of mortality we did not observe any independent association between in-hospital mortality and some of the common coexisting medical conditions including hypertension diabetes or cancer however using calculated gfr as a surrogate for ckd we observed that decreased renal function was a risk factor for in-hospital mortality a finding that is consistent with previous studies16 il-6 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines production are felt to be due to immune dysregulation rather than normal response to sars-cov infection17 18 our findings are consistent with this theory and we observed elevated il-6 as an independent prognostic risk factor with higher levels in non-survivors in hospitalized patients we saw fluctuating il-6 levels with a significant increase seen on day 1 of admission and an increasing level trend that was more pronounced in non-survivors thrombocytosis was associated with disease activity in sars and was thought to be secondary to the direct effect of the virus or effect of inflammatory cytokines19 we observed a greater thrombocytosis during hospitalization in survivors than in non-survivors a previous study of il-6 in primates revealed that there is a dose-dependent response of thrombocytosis induced by il-620 the discrepancy between high il-6 levels and lack of thrombocytosis in non-survivors could be explained by endothelial damage and subsequent platelet consumption from viral infection impaired platelet release from megakaryocytes in the lung or direct impairment of hematopoiesis21 this may suggest that the absence of reactive thrombocytosis may portend a poor response to sars-cov-2 infection elevated d-dimer in covid-19 patients has been described previously22 23 we report in this study its independent association with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality abnormal d-dimer alone is non-specific however the higher elevation in non-survivors suggests that coagulopathy particularly disseminated intravascular coagulation dic may contribute to mortality in covid-19 one of the functional receptors for pathogenic human coronavirus such as sars-cov is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace224 and these receptors are expressed in heart tissues25 this suggests that sars-cov-2 virus could directly affect the heart similar to the previous finding that showed an association of cardiac injury and a higher risk of in-hospital mortality26 we observed elevated troponin levels in hospitalized patients as a risk factor for increased mortality hydroxychloroquine is an analog of chloroquine a widely used anti-malarial with immunomodulatory effects27 in vitro studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine has activity against sars-cov-2 28 the clinical data of hydroxychloroquine in patients with covid-19 come from small studies that have shown mixed results chen et al randomized 30 hospitalized patients with covid-19 to receive hydroxychloroquine 400 mg daily for 5 days or placebo and found that 867 of the hydroxychloroquine group and 933 of the control group had negative throat swabs29 chen et al randomized 62 patients to hydroxychloroquine or placebo and reported shortened time to clinical recovery fever resolution and cough improvement in the hydroxychloroquine group30 mahevas et al reviewed 181 hospitalized patients with covid-19 data who received hydroxychloroquine 600 mg daily and reported no difference in outcomes including in icu admission andor death at 7 days follow-up31 another randomized trial of 150 hospitalized patients by tang et al did not show symptomatic improvement at 28 days or clearance of sars-cov-2 with hydroxychloroquine use32 we attempted to adjust for all known confounders between the groups who did and did not receive hydroxychloroquine using multivariate regression analyses and the iptw method which revealed that hydroxychloroquine use was associated with decreased risk of in-hospital mortality due to the inherent limitations of our retrospective study design there was no conclusive determination on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients with covid-19 more robust studies such as randomized clinical trials are needed our study has several limitations first we have no long-term follow up data for ambulatory and discharged patients hence the clinical outcome observed may not be reflective of the true eventual outcome particularly in the ambulatory group second we have patients who remained hospitalized at the time of our analyses and did not have our outcomes such as discharge or mortality and were excluded for our comparison of survivors and non-survivors third due to limitations and local testing policy during the study duration there are an unknown number of patients who were not diagnosed with covid-19 because of a lack of severe symptoms andor hospitalization fourth we are not able to adjust for unknown confounders that may affect the true treatment effect these limitations prevent any definitive conclusions on the efficacy of any treatment in this retrospective study of over 6000 ambulatory and hospitalized patients with covid-19 in the new york city metropolitan area age male sex tachypnea low systolic blood pressure low peripheral oxygen saturation impaired renal function elevated il-6 elevated d-dimer and elevated troponin were found to be risk factors for mortality hydroxychloroquine use was associated with decreased mortality  hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 -preliminary report effect of

mara farias carmen javier crespo  controlled double-blind randomized trial to assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine chemoprophylaxis in sars cov2 infection in healthcare personnel in the hospital setting a structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial abstract background sars-cov-2 infection presents a high transmission in the group of health professionals in spain 12-15 infected currently there is no accepted chemoprophylaxis but hydroxychloroquine hdq is known to inhibit the coronavirus in vitro our hypothesis is that oral administration of hydroxychloroquine to healthcare professionals can reduce the incidence and prevalence of infection as well as its severity in this group methods design prospective single center double blind randomised controlled trial rct participants adult health-care professionals 18-65 years working in areas of high exposure and high risk of transmission of sars-cov-2 covid areas intensive care unit

pregnancy or lactation any contraindication to hydroxychloroquine or evidence of unstable or clinically significant systemic disease continued on next page  interventions patients will be randomized 11 to receive once-daily oral hydroxychloroquine 200mg for two months hc group or placebo p group in addition to the protective measures appropriate to the level of exposure established by the hospital a serological evaluation will be carried out every 15 days with pcr in case of seroconversion symptoms or risk exposure primary outcome is the percentage of subjects presenting infection

that of subjects requiring admission to icu will be determined discussion while awaiting a vaccine hygiene measures social distancing and personal protective equipment are the only primary prophylaxis measures against sars-cov-2 but they have not been sufficient to protect our healthcare professionals some evidence of the in vitro efficacy of hydroxychloroquine against this virus is known along with some clinical data that would support the study of this drug in the chemoprophylaxis of infection however there are still no data from controlled clinical trials in this regard if our hypothesis is confirmed hydroxychloroquine can help professionals fight this infection with more guarantees participants this is a single-center study that will be carried out at the marqus de valdecilla

prevent infection with sars-cov-2 insights from a large healthcare database analysis omer gendelman howard amital nicola bragazzi luigi abdulla watad gabriel chodick   coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a generally mild but sometimes severe and potentially even life-threatening infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 sars-cov-2 previously known as 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov since late december 2019 the sars-cov-2 has quickly spread out from its first epicenter the city of wuhan hubei province peoples republic of china 1 and has shortly become a pandemic 2 epidemiological data are mainly available for those countries most hardly hit by covid-19 such as peoples republic of china 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 italy 10 and the usa 11 12 13 more limited information is available for countries like israel on the other hand these surveys mainly deal with clinical characteristics of covid-19 patients in terms of related risk factors or underlying co-morbidities whereas unsatisfactory information is provided regarding the therapeutic interventions adopted furthermore these studies are mostly clinical reports case-series or are designed as specific cohort studies targeting specific populations and are not conducted at the level of entire communities for example exploiting computerized clinical records and similar real-world data 14 a notable exception is represented by the report published by the chinese center for disease control and prevention that analyzed the characteristics of 72314 covid-19 patients even though only 62 of the entire sample consisted of confirmed cases 3 thus currently available data do not enable to address some crucial research questions especially in terms of therapeutics 1516 currently no effective vaccines or specific drugs exist that can be used to prevent or counteractmitigate the burden of covid-19 and so far countries have adopted behavioral non-pharmacological intervention npi-based strategies enforcing social distancing self-isolation quarantine and even lockdown of entire territories and communities since npis are resource-consuming being unfeasible and unsustainable for long periods in the western countries and given that the discovery of new vaccine candidates or new chemicalmolecular entities ncesnmes the design and the implementation of randomized controlled trials rcts are time-consuming procedures some scholars are attempting to repurpose already existing compounds hydroxychloroquine is an anti-malarial drug utilized also for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ra systemic lupus erythematosus sle and porphyria cutanea tarda patient 17 colchicine is utilized for the treatment and management of patients with gout and behets disease and for the prevention of pericarditis and familial mediterranean fever fmf being preferred over other possible therapeutic options such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs nsaids or steroids 18 contrasting findings have been reported in the existing scholarly literature concerning potential anti-viral effects of these compounds as such in this study we investigated whether a chronic baseline use of anti-inflammatory medications namely hydroxychloroquine and colchicine could provide a potentially beneficial effect in preventing or at least partially mitigating the burden of the sars-cov-2 infection therefore for this purpose we utilized a large israeli healthcare database maccabi health services mhs is the second largest sick fund in israel insuring and providing care to 23 million persons since 1995 mhs has maintained a computerized database which includes all physicians visits diagnoses hospitalizations medications dispensed all laboratory tests performed and other diagnostic procedures in the present analysis we included all individuals tested for sars-cov-2 the study protocol was in-depth reviewed and approved by mhss research ethics board in israel the first covid-19 case was confirmed on february 21st 2020 and since then the epidemic is on the rise using the mhs database we identified all covid-19 confirmed cases defined as positive for sars-cov-2 according to the result of the real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction rt-pcr-based assay of nasal and throat swab specimens between february 23rd 2020 index case in the mhs database and march 31st 2020 subjects negative for sars-cov-2 were used as the control group criteria for testing were established according to the guidelines published by the israeli ministry of health guidelines for coping with the novel coronavirus 2020 ministry of health israel 17 which included an acute febrile illness or respiratory symptoms cough or shortness of breath in people returning from abroad travels or who were in close contact with a confirmed or probable covid-19 case in the last 14 days the mhs database was also extensively mined to collect all available information on demographics the most recent documented body mass index bmi medical conditions dispensed and prescribed hydroxychloroquine and colchicine between january 1st 2020 and the date of first sars-cov-2 test furthermore the socioeconomic status ses was computed defined according to the poverty index of each member as specified during the 2008 national census which takes into account several parameters including household income education crowding material conditions and car ownership among others after visually inspecting data for potential outliers descriptive statistics was carried out continuous data were expressed as mean  standard deviation and categorical parameters were computed as percentages where appropriate based on the normality of data distribution students t-test or its non-parametric version and chi-squared test were conducted to compare parameters between covid-19 positive and negative individuals figures with p-values equal to or less than 005 were considered statistically significant statistical analyses were carried out by means of the commercial software statistical package for social sciences spss for windows version 240 ibm corp armonk ny usa an overall sample of 14520 subjects were screened for covid-19 their characteristics are summarized in table 1
 mean age of the cohort was 373  191 years with a slight male predominance 526 only 1317 907 resulted positive for covid-19 approximately 60 of which were males p-value 001 the age group distribution was similar among the subjects positive for covid-19 compared to controls even though the mean age was higher in cases 406  191 years versus controls average age 370  191 years p-value 001 the bmi group distribution differed among cases and controls p-value 001 with the former ones reporting more overweight and obesity than the latter ones the frequency of all co-morbidities was higher among positive subjects in more detail the prevalence rates of diabetes mellitus dm 87 versus 49 p  001 chronic kidney disease 79 versus 62 p  019 and hypertension 14 versus 109 p  001 were found to be statistically significant and higher among the covid-19 positive patients ischemic heart disease ihd instead was reported in similar percentages by cases and controls 3 versus 25 respectively p  245 of note more cases than controls 279 versus 127 p-value 001 lived in households that were of low ses concerning the baseline treatment hydroxychloroquine and colchicine were prescribed to subjects with sars-cov-2 infection compared to those without in rate of 023 versus 025 p  877 and 053 versus 048 p  817 of the populations respectively table 1 in the present study we have utilized real-world data to explore the associations between subjects positive for sars-cov-2 different underlying co-morbidities and medications which were not administered for anti-viral treatment purposes we demonstrated that some underlying co-morbidities dm hypertension and ckd but not ihd high bmi and male gender were associated with a higher susceptibility of contracting sars-cov-2 infection our results are in line with a recently published comprehensive meta-analysis pooling together 19 studies 18 from mainland china and one from australia the overall sample of which consisted only of confirmed patients according to the procedure of rt-pcr testing 5 more than half 56 of the patients were males and the major underlying co-morbidities were hypertension 186 cardiovascular disease 144 and dm 119 in a population-based study evaluating the clinical characteristics of 1482 patients hospitalized with covid-19 in the usa 19 the majority of patients were males 544 with a similar pattern of underlying co-morbidities most commonly hypertension 497 followed by obesity 483 dm 283 and cardiovascular disease 278 more than 70 of patients were older than 50 years in another cross-sectional study the same pattern of co-morbidities  hypertension 186 p  001 cardiovascular disease 144 p  001 and dm 119 p  001  and male gender predominance 56 p  001 were observed in a population with an average age of 52 years 11 thus it is noticeable that underlying co-morbidities and gender are similar among the different populations but a mean age discrepancy exists between our cohort average age of 406 years and the other mentioned studies this discrepancy might be due to the relative high percentage of young population in israel where the median age in 2020 is 305 years ten years younger than the populations in the usa and mainland china 20 this is even more noticeable in particular settings such as covid-19 endemic cities where population especially ultra-orthodox jewish populations with a high number of children per family is even younger with respect to the country furthermore more subjects positive for the covid-19 infection were of lower ses status compared to controls 279 versus 127 and more subjects negative for sars-cov-2 were of higher ses compared to positive subject 272 versus 364 this is not surprising given the well-known association between low ses and increased risk for infections 21 in the usa minorities like african americans and hispanics have higher rates of mortality compared to the caucasian population largely due to ses disparities 2223 concerning the alleged anti-viral activities of hydroxychloroquine 23 and its potential protective role against infections 24 the existing scholarly literature reports contrasting findings even though to date no rct has shown an unequivocal advantage in preventing or improving the major outcomes in covid-19 patients 2526 regarding the anti-inflammatory properties of colchicine results from experimental models found that the nlrp3 inflammasome can be activated and triggered by different sars-cov-2 proteins and subsequently can take part in the development of the severe adult respiratory distress syndrome ards a complication of the covid-19 infection 27 28 29 30 as a major inhibitor of the nlrp3 inflammasome 31 colchicine could be utilized for the treatment of covid-19 currently three clinical trials are ongoing 273233 however in our investigation we failed to detect a potential benefit of hydroxychloroquine and colchicine even though these drugs had not been administered for anti-viral treatment purposes we were not able to identify the main reason of such an administration on the other hand we can assume that patients receiving these drugs suffer from inflammatory diseases such as ra and sle in the case of hydroxychloroquine 34 and fmf and gout in the case of colchicine 3536 despite the use of a large healthcare database our study has several limitations that should be properly acknowledged first the relatively small number of patients who were documented to be a priori treated secondly the basic methodology of the study which is based on a computerized database which might be incomplete for instance the duration and the reason of the treatment as previously mentioned are lacking however this study should be considered as a preliminary pilot investigation providing a first glance on the characteristics of patients with sars-cov-2 infection in israel showing that 1 the median age of infected individuals is younger than their counterparts around the world which warrants further research and 2 that hydroxychloroquine and colchicine apparently provided no protection against the sars-cov-2 infection  systematic and statistical review of coronavirus disease 19 treatment trials juan siordia a michael bernaba kenji yoshino abid ulhaque sooraj kumar mario bernaba edward bergin   severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 sars-cov2 is a novel coronavirus responsible for causing coronavirus disease 19 covid-19 it quickly became a pandemic in the beginning of 2020 originating in wuhan china the virus rapidly spread to other countries of the world 1 on january 30 2020 the world health organization who declared sars-cov2 a public health emergency of international concern pheic 2 medications are quickly being tested to assess for a suitable treatment regimen for the novel virus the following systematic and statistical review assesses the current evidence regarding human controlled covid-19 treatment trials an electronic search compiled human controlled studies analyzing treatments for covid-19 medical therapies investigated included lopinavirritonavir arbidol hydroxychloroquine remdesivir favipiravir heparin glucocorticoids interferon ivermectin and convalescent plasma inclusion criteria included needing a control whether standard therapy placebo or another medication and testing among human subjects with covid-19 in vitro and animal studies plus those without controls were not included in the review databases included google scholar and pubmed key words included covid-19 sars-cov2 randomized controlled human retrospective prospective trial chloroquine hydroxychloroquine lopinavir ritonavir arbidol umifenovir tocilizumab favipiravir steroids dexamethasone glucocorticoids interferon ivermectin remdesivir azithromycin heparin and low-molecular weight heparin abstracts and titles were reviewed for relevancy studies that had human subjects and a control arm were included in the study otherwise they were excluded duplicated studies were removed the studies were organized based on the study medication some studies presented more than one study medication and were included in more than one group statistical analysis was performed if there were two or more studies showing information regarding positive-to-negative conversion rates number of days varied based on reported similarities among chosen studies if there were any common endpoints among the trials collected a meta-analysis would then be performed endpoints were related to viral clearance statistical analyses used the review manager version 53 the cochrane collaboration copenhagen denmark software program a forest plot was created using the program with the dersimonian and laird fixed-effects model to reduce heterogeneity the mean difference with a confidence interval ci of 95 was reported with the inverse variance method due to using a scale the value marking no significance via confidence interval was zero an i2 greater than 50 suggests significant heterogeneity if there was significant heterogeneity a random-effects model would be used instead a total of 1781 articles were found with the keywords selected a total of 57 studies were included initially based on title and abstract review a total of 26 studies were included in the systematic review four studies elaborated about lopinavirritonavir four studies studied arbidol six for hydroxychloroquine one for remdesivir six for tocilizumab two for favipiravir two for heparin and one for dexamethasone statistical analyses regarding positive-to-negative conversion rates were possible for lopinavirritonavir arbidol and hydroxychloroquine no human controlled trials were found for glucocorticoids interferons ivermectin or convalescent plasma statistical analysis regarding positive-to-negative conversion rates was possible for lopinavirritonavir two studies arbidol two studies and hydroxychloroquine four studies fig 1 four controlled trials exist regarding the treatment for covid-19 table 1 two studies are randomized controlled trials and two are retrospective controlled studies 36 the most recognized is the randomized controlled open-label trial by cao et al 3 the study showed no significant difference in terms of 28-day mortality or time of positive-to-negative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr conversion lopinavir-ritonavir did reduce the time to clinical improvement by 1 day but was considered marginally non-statistically significant this study had many limitations the study was organized as an open label and with lack of placebo about 14 of trial recipients could not complete a full 14-day treatment course due to adverse medication effects including nausea vomiting and diarrhea however the incidence of respiratory failure acute kidney injury and secondary infection was higher in the standard-care group positive-to-negative rt-pcr conversion was not significant with lopinavir-ritonavir fig 2 3 4 there was no significant difference between the study and control group at 14 days or 095 95 ci 050183 other retrospective studies suggest earlier clearance with lopinavir-ritonavir but did not report the results at 14 days 5 6 furthermore the two studies that did suggest clearance are retrospective studies while the other two are randomized controlled trials the most significant lopinavirritonavir side effects include loss of appetite nausea vomiting and diarrhea 3 4 diarrhea can possibly become severe 4 apart from elevated transaminase levels other laboratory markers do not significantly differ from the control group 3 4 there are currently four controlled trials discussing the use of arbidol for the treatment of covid-19 patients table 2 4 79 two of the trials are randomized while the other two are retrospective studies only li et al includes a comparison between arbidol and standard supportive therapy 4 the two retrospective studies include a comparison with lopinavirritonavir 8 9 chen et al compare arbidol with favipiravir 7 arbidol was commonly compared with lopinavirritonavir 4 9 while there is no difference in positive-to-negative conversion rates between the two medications at the seventh or 163 95 ci 076350 or 14th day or 537 95 ci 0358330 figs 3 and 4 of note for the 14-day comparison a fixed effect model would show arbidol having more viral clearance compared to lopinavirritonavir or 50 95 ci 1501664 however there was significant heterogeneity between the two studies i2  66 a random effects model was therefore employed to counter the heterogeneity resulting in a nonsignificant difference between the two medications adding arbidol with lopinavirritonavir did show significant conversion rates and ct scan improvements compared to lopinavirritonavir by itself 8 while favipiravir did not show any difference compared to arbidol regarding 7-day recovery rate it did show faster recovery from fever and cough there was no difference regarding oxygen and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation use between arbidol and favipiravir 7 arbidol side effects include nausea and diarrhea 4 arbidol demonstrated less hyperuricemia compared to favipiravir p  00014 both favipiravir and arbidol did not show any significant difference in abnormal liver function tests psychiatric symptom reaction or digestive tract reactions 7 six controlled trials exist comparing hydroxychloroquine versus standard therapy table 3 1015 three studies were randomized one was prospective and two were retrospective studies the data regarding hydroxychloroquine remains equivocal the three randomized controlled trials present conflicting information regarding significance in clinical improvement and positive-to-negative conversion 10 11 13 chen z et al observed conversion based on ct scan results but ct scans have a high negative predictive value for covid-19 during the pandemic 1619 the prospective trial by gautret et al showed earlier conversion with hydroxychloroquine 12 they included patients that took azithromycin with hydroxychloroquine in their study but that was not included in this analysis they have yet to present clinical status changes from their study a retrospective controlled study among veterans showed increased mortality with hydroxychloroquine use mechanical ventilation rates were similar among the two study arms 14 another retrospective review showed no difference in in-hospital mortality 15 the positive-to-negative conversion analysis fig 5 was performed at 67 days to include all the studies rt-pcr or ct scans were used to monitor time to covid-19 resolution hydroxychloroquine did not show significant effects on positive-to-negative conversion time compared to standard therapy or 216 95 ci 080584 with significant heterogeneity i2  56 a random-effects model was used analyzing the three randomized controlled trials only showed no significant difference between hydroxychloroquine and standard therapy or 150 95 ci 088257 fig 6 10 11 13 this was with nonsignificant heterogeneity i2  38 and therefore a fixed-effects model was kept cardiac complications including cardiac arrest were more common with hydroxychloroquine use especially when combined with azithromycin 15 gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea and elevated transaminase levels were mentioned with hydroxychloroquine but they were not statistically significant compared to the control groups 11 12 14 currently there is only one published controlled trial with remdesivir table 4 20 the randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial showed no difference in time to clinical improvement compared to the control arm hazard ratio 123 95 ci 087175 20 a limitation of the study however was that patients in both groups were permitted concomitant use of lopinavir-ritonavir interferons andor corticosteroids about 66 who received remdesivir reported an adverse side effect the most common side effects were constipation hypoalbuminemia hypokalemia anemia thrombocytopenia and increased bilirubin 20 six studies assessed the benefits of tocilizumab table 5 tocilizumab presents with mixed results half of the studies report no significant benefit compared to standard therapy 2123 while the other half report improvement for severe cases or improved hospital stay survival and freedom from ventilation 2426 no studies assessed the duration of positive-to-negative sars-cov2 conversion the following studies did not report any associated side effects with tocilizumab compared to standard therapy there are two controlled trials regarding the use of favipiravir table 4 7 27 the first is a randomized controlled trial comparing favipiravir to arbidol for covid-19 patients 7 arbidol effects are similar to standard therapy 4 the other is an open-label non-randomized prospective trial comparing favipiravir versus lopinavirritonavir 27 lopinavirritonavir is also similar to standard therapy 3 4 table 6 chen et al showed no significant 7-day recovery rate with favipiravir compared to arbidol the secondary endpoints of fever and cough relief did resolve significantly sooner with favipiravir compared to arbidol with fever resolving for all patients at day 4 versus days 78 and cough improving at day 8 versus day 8 there was no difference regarding oxygen and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation use 7 cai et al showed faster ct scan improvement and viral clearance with favipiravir compared to lopinavirritonavir at day 14 3235 9143 favipiravir subjects had improved chest ct scans compared to 2845 6222 lopinavirritonavir patients p  0004 viral clearance was sooner at 4 days with favipiravir compared to 11 days with lopinavirritonavir p  0001 27 favipiravir shows a similar side-effect profile as to lopinavirritonavir including nausea vomiting diarrhea rash and elevated transaminase levels 7 27 compared to arbidol it increases uric acid levels more while the side effect profile is similar to lopinavirritonavir the frequency of adverse effects is less with favipiravir 27 two retrospective controlled studies included data regarding heparin use table 5 28 29 these studies involved deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis dosing of unfractionated 15000 iuday and low-molecular weight 4060 mgday heparin table 7 tang et al showed no difference in 28-day mortality rates most patients received low-molecular weight heparin they note significant improvement in heparin users among those with severe sepsis-induced intravascular coagulopathy this was determined by a scoring system utilizing platelet count prothrombin time and sequential organ failure assessment sofa scoring 28 shi et al showed no difference in outcomes including clinical improvement and positive-to-negative conversion rate all patients in the study improved 29 the studies included in the review did not report adverse effects however all heparin medications have well-documented side-effects including hemorrhage osteoporosis renal tubular acidosis type 4 with hyperkalemia and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia 3032 adverse effects of low-molecular weight heparin are more common in patients with kidney injury 33 deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis presents with a lower rate of side-effects 34 one large randomized controlled trial the recovery trial found an overall benefit when assessing all covid19 cases together table 8 35 while there was no benefit for those without oxygen needs dexamethasone reduced mortality by one-fifth in patients requiring noninvasive oxygen therapy and by one-third in those requiring mechanical ventilation dexamethasone also reduced hospital length of stay and progression to needing invasive mechanical ventilation while the recovery trial does not report any adverse reactions compared to the standard therapy glucocorticoids have multiple side-effects adverse reactions from acute use include altered mental status hyperglycemia increased risk for infection hypertension arrhythmias and myopathy 36 37 the meta-analysis portion of the study has some limitations the first limitation is the small number of patients in the trials and therefore the overall analysis another limitation is the use of surrogate endpoints to complete the meta-analysis this is regarding the use of ct scan resolution for viral clearance in the hydroxychloroquine analysis chest ct scans have significant negative predictive value but is not directly comparable to rt-pcr 1619 the endpoints were not well-established among all reviewed medications making it difficult to compare them between studies regarding the systematic review publication bias influences the information presented favipiravir trials on covid-19 only involve those compared with other medications and not with a placebo or supportive therapy control arm the heparin and dexamethasone studies mainly involved the level of severity of covid-19 rather than having the infection itself current investigated medications do not hasten viral clearance time clinical improvement is equivocal with lopinavirritonavir arbidol hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir favipiravir shows faster viral clearance and clinical improvement compared to lopinavirritonavir and arbidol heparin shows benefit in patients with severe covid-19 infections  an update on current therapeutic drugs treating covid-19 renyi wu lujing wang hsiao-chen kuo dina ahmad shannar rebecca peter pochung chou jordan shanyi li rasika hudlikar xia liu zhigang liu george poiani j louis amorosa luigi brunetti ah-ng kong   the horrific pandemic outbreak of covid-19 coronavirus disease 2019 around the world caught the health care systems in every country by storm most if not all were caught off guard without proper defense mechanisms to cope with and to control such a pandemic covid-19 caused by a new and novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has recently been identified and characterized 1 coronaviruses are named for their crown-like spikes on their surface and there are four main sub-groupings of coronaviruses known as alpha beta gamma and delta 1 2 sars-cov-2 belongs to the beta sub-grouping and is one of the seventh coronavirus to date infecting humans 1 some coronaviruses such as 229e alpha coronavirus 3 oc43 beta coronavirus 4 nl63 alpha coronavirus 5 and hku1 beta coronavirus 6 were associated with mild clinical symptoms whereas sars-cov beta coronavirus 7 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov beta coronavirus 8 and sars-cov-2 caused severe diseases 2 sars-cov-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded rna virus with 29891 bases 96 identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus and shares 796 sequence identity to sars-cov 1 sars-cov-2 encodes spike s protein containing receptor binding domain rbd that binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 and promotes membrane fusion and uptakes of the virus into human cells such as the lung by endocytosis 1 911 upon entering the human cells sars-cov-2 like other coronaviruses will takeover or hijack the human cells protein synthesis machinery to synthesize the viral proteins and assemble the proteins and subsequent viral replication 12 once inside the human body viruses in general will trigger a series of good versus bad host responses including autophagy apoptosis stress response and innate immunity 13 fortunately majority more than 80 of sars-cov-2-infected individuals are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms most likely due to the activation of the good response these good responders would likely activate the bodys innate immune system by activating the bodys antiviral defense mechanisms including natural killer cells and antiviral t cells and induction of interferon ifn 1316 unfortunately in about 20 of sars-cov-2-infected individuals including the immune compromised elderly patients with underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular and pulmonary problems diabetics hypertension obesity chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or copd such as emphysema pulmonary fibrosis asthma and interstitial lung disease 17 18 would encounter more severe disease characterized by significant respiratory symptoms leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and even death an important consideration to note is that ards occurs later in disease progression and is preceded by acute lung injury ali 19 this distinction may inform treatment strategy in terms of drugs directed towards cytokine storm and thrombosis which is described in this manuscript a study on sars-cov and mers-cov has found that these two coronaviruses appear to have evolved mechanisms to attenuate or delay ifn production resulting in enhanced inflammatory host responses and severe lung injury 12 13 2022 this aberrant host immune response with the production of powerful inflammatory cytokines known as cytokine storm found in sars-cov- and mers-cov-infected patients would correlate with disease severity and poor prognosis 13 16 2023 severe covid-19 patients exhibit profound inflammatory response 24 25 transcriptomic rna-seq analysis of covid-19 patients has revealed that several immune pathways and pro-inflammatory cytokines cxcl ccl2 cxcl2 ccl8 il33 and ccl3l1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf and tnfsf10 cxcl10 il10 timp1 c5 il18 areg and nrg1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc were induced by sars-cov-2 infection suggesting a sustained inflammation and cytokine storm 26 importantly sars-cov-2 infectioninduced excessive cytokine release correlates with lung tissue injury and covid-19 pathogenesis 26 this estimated 20 of patients developing more severe disease with sars-cov-2 infection are most likely due to genetics epigenetics and or other factors with dampened innate immune response to fight the virus coupled with enhanced viral load leading to cytokine storm severe inflammatoryoxidative stress response and severe lung injury secondary to ards while there is clear understanding that the respiratory system is dramatically impacted in covid-19 patients evidence suggests that other organ systems are also affected emerging data show that sars-cov-2 may lead to damage to other organs including the heart and brain nearly 20 of hospitalized patients with covid-19 have indication of cardiac damage 17 furthermore neurologic symptoms have been reported in patients and infection of sars-cov-2 has been found in the brainstem of both humans and experimental animals 18 19 currently there is no vaccine andor specific therapeutic drugs targeting the sars-cov-2 hence it remains a major challenge to decide what potential therapeutic regimens to prevent and treat the severely sick covid-19 patients effective vaccines are essential to combat against the extremely contagious sars-cov-2 at present a lot of research efforts have been invested to develop vaccines around the world until we have specific vaccines or therapeutic drugs targeting sars-cov-2 repurposed drugs that have been approved by the fda in the usa for other indications have been used to treat covid-19 patients this review will summarize the most current pharmacotherapeutics prescribed in the treatment of severe cases of covid-19 patients these include antiviral therapy antibiotics systemic corticosteroids and anti-inflammatory drugs including anti-arthritis drugs neuraminidase inhibitors rna synthesis inhibitors convalescent plasma and traditional herbal medicines remdesivir is a potential drug for treatment of covid-19 it is a phosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine c-nucleoside and a broad-spectrum antiviral agent synthesized and developed by gilead sciences in 2017 as a treatment for ebola virus infection 28 remdesivir is metabolized into its active form gs-441524 that obscures viral rna polymerase and evades proofreading by viral exonuclease causing a decrease in viral rna production the antiviral mechanism of remdesivir is a delayed chain cessation of nascent viral rna animal experiments indicate that remdesivir can effectively reduce the viral load in lung tissue of mice infected with mers-cov improve lung function and alleviate pathological damage to lung tissue 29 wang et al found that remdesivir potently blocks sars-cov-2 infection at low range of micromolar concentrations and has a high selectivity index half-maximal effective concentration ec50 077 m half-cytotoxic concentration cc50  100 m si  12987 30 holshue et al reported that iv administration of remdesivir yielded promising results in the treatment of a patient with covid-19 recovering from pneumonia in the usa 31 in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drug in patients with covid-19 a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind multicenter phase iii clinical trial was launched on february 5 2020 in china patients in the experimental group received an initial dose of 200 mg of remdesivir and a subsequent dose of 100 mg for 9 consecutive days via intravenous infusion in addition to routine treatment patients in the control group received same dose of placebo treatment the trial is expected to conclude by the end of april 2020 the number of cases planned to be enrolled is 308 and 452 respectively 32 33 current recommendation for remdesivir includes a 10-day regimen of remdesivir treatment 200 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 100 mg once-daily maintenance doses for 9 days in both studies this regimen of remdesivir therapy is similar to that of former randomized clinical trial against the ebola virus 32 33 in a summary of subjects receiving remdesivir via compassionate use in the usa nearly 70 of patients had improvement in terms of oxygen requirements and many patients that were mechanically ventilated were extubated this report did not include a control group therefore extrapolating these results is difficult it is too early to conclude the direct antiviral effect of remdesivir on the enhanced clearing of viral loads in the respiratory tract but it indeed suggests a promising therapeutic effect of remdesivir 34 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are drugs with a long history of clinical use with similar chemical structures often used in the treatment of lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis and malaria 35 compared with chloroquine hydroxychloroquine has a hydroxyl group which makes it less toxic while maintaining similar activity one mechanism of action of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is targeting lysosome which may be useful to control graft-versus-host disease in humans 36 with the accumulation of chloroquine in lysosomes the ph of lysosomes is significantly changed and the activity of proteases in lysosomes is directly affected thus affecting the degradation of proteins and glycosaminoglycan 36 37 chloroquine can inhibit the entry of sars-cov-2 and prevent virus-cell fusion by interfering with glycosylation of ace2 receptor and its binding with spike protein suggesting that chloroquine treatment might be more effective in the early stage of infection before covid-19 reduces ace2 expression and activity 30 38 39 hydroxychloroquine possesses anti-inflammatory effect on th17-related cytokines il-6 il-17 and il-22 in healthy individuals and systemic lupus erythematosus sle and rheumatoid arthritis ra patients 40 there is some evidence that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can reduce cytokine storm according to one analysis the main cause of death of covid-19 patients is related to the triggering of the cytokine storm which contributed to acute respiratory distress 41 it has been reported that hydroxychloroquine is effective in inhibiting sars-cov-2 infection in vitro 1 39 42 zinc inhibits sars-cov and retrovirus rna polymerase activity in vitro and zinc ionophores block the replication of these viruses in cell culture 43 there is also evidence that zinc enhances chloroquine intracellular uptake 44 as such combining zinc with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is intriguing and is currently under investigation overall more clinical trials are underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic and treatment for covid-19 the us fda has issued emergency authorization for the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of covid-19 a recent study by tang et al reported that hydroxychloroquine did not lead to higher negative conversion rates but had reduced clinical symptoms through the anti-inflammatory properties and recovery of lymphopenia 45 it has also been reported that high doses of chloroquine 600 mg twice daily for 10 days or total dose of 12 g may be associated with significant cardiac risks and should not be recommended for treating covid-19 46 there is still a lack of evidence regarding the safety and effectiveness of these agents in treating covid-19 in this regard clinicians and patients should be made aware of the risk versus benefit profile of these medications 47 lopinavir is a protease inhibitor with high specificity for hiv-1 protease lopinavir is marketed and administered exclusively in combination with ritonavir this combination was first marketed by abbott under the brand name kaletra in 2000 48 due to lopinavirs poor oral bioavailability and extensive biotransformation it is co-formulated with ritonavir to enhance its exposure ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of the enzymes that are responsible for lopinavir metabolism and its co-administration boosts lopinavir exposure and improves antiviral activity 48 lopinavir is a peptidomimetic molecule containing a hydroxyethylene scaffold that mimics the peptide linkage typically targeted by the hiv-1 protease enzyme but which by itself cannot be cleaved thus preventing the activity of the hiv-1 protease 49 lopinavir-ritonavir was investigated in an open-label individually randomized controlled trial where patients with covid-19 received either lopinavir-ritonavir 400 mg100 mg orally twice daily plus standard of care or standard of care alone no benefit was observed with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond standard care diarrhea nausea and asthenia were the most frequently reported adverse effects in patients receiving lopinavir-ritonavir-based regimen 50 interestingly in a report from korea lopinavir-ritonavir administration significantly decreased coronavirus titers with no or little coronavirus titers were observed in the follow-up study however the analysis included a single patient in the initial phase of outbreak in korea 51 umifenovir branded as arbidol a derivative of indole carboxylic acids was first developed in 1988 in russia and has since been approved in russia and china for treating prophylaxis and infections associated with influenza a and b and other arbovirus 52 later on umifenovir demonstrated in vitro antiviral efficacy in widely spreading virus strains such as the ebola virus human herpesvirus 8 hhv-8 hepatitis c virus hcv and tacaribe arenavirus 53 its major mechanism of action is to block the virus-cell membrane fusion as well as virus-endosome fusion through incorporation into cell membranes and interference with the hydrogen bonding network of phospholipids 54 in influenza virus it has been shown to directly interact with virus particles to stabilize hemagglutinin ha reducing the likelihood of reaching the low ph threshold required for conformational transition into functional fusogenic ha 55 blaising et al reported the in vitro activity of umifenovir against sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 56 57 a retrospective cohort study has reported that compared with lopinavir-ritonavir lpv-rtv only group combination of umifenovir and lpv-rtv has shown increased negative conversion rate of sars-cov-2 and improved chest ct scan results 58 however another prospective study chictr200030254 has shown that compared with favipiravir umifenovir has inferior outcome in clinical recovery rate and relief of fever and cough 59 there are two randomized and open-label trials ongoing in china investigating the efficacy and safety of umifenovir against covid-19 the effect of umifenovir plus standard treatment versus lpv-rtv plus standard treatment will be evaluated in nct04252885 and the effect of umifenovir plus standard treatment versus standard treatment will be tested in nct04260594 favipiravir branded as avigan has been developed by fujifilm toyama chemical in 2014 in japan for the treatment of avian influenza or novel influenza resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors it is a guanine analogue with pyrazinecarboxamide structure and its antiviral activity is decreased at the presence of purine nucleosides due to the competition 60 the prodrug favipiravir first enters the infected cells through endocytosis and is then transformed into active favipiravir ribofuranosyl phosphates through phosphoribosylation and phosphorylation 60 61 the antiviral activity is exhibited through selectively targeting conservative catalytic domain of rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp interrupting the nucleotide incorporation process during viral rna replication 60 the dysregulation in viral rna replication results in increased number and frequency of transition mutations including replacement of guanine g by adenine a and cytosine c by thymine t or c by uracil u which induces destructive mutagenesis in rna viruses 60 favipiravir has been used in the treatment of infectious diseases caused by rna viruses such as influenza ebola and norovirus 62 recent in vitro and human studies have repurposed favipiravir as an experimental agent against enveloped positive-sense single-strand rna virus sars-cov-2 an in vitro research has investigated seven potential anti-sars-cov-2 medicines including ribavirin penciclovir favipiravir nafamostat nitazoxanide remdesivir and chloroquine showing that remdesivir and chloroquine have favorable selectivity index 30 in addition the study showed favipiravir has exerted efficacy in vero e6 cells infected with sars-cov-2 with half-maximal effective concentration ec50 of 6188  m and half-cytotoxic concentration cc50 at over 400 m implying the high concentration is needed for safe and effective treatment 30 clinical trials testing favipiravir against covid-19 have been carried out vigorously in various countries including china and japan a randomized control trial chictr200030254 has shown that covid-19 patients treated with favipiravir have superior recovery rate 7143 than that treated with umifenovir 5586 and the duration of fever and cough relief time are significantly shorter in favipiravir group than in umifenovir group 59 up to mid-april 2020 there are eight undergoing clinical trials in china and two in japan examining the anti-sars-cov-2 potential of favipiravir these trials include non-randomized and randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of favipiravir alone chictr2000030113 jprn-jrcts031190226 jprn-jrcts041190120 or in conjunction with interferon- chictr2000029600 baloxavir marboxil chictr2000029544 chictr2000029548 tocilizumab chictr2000030894 nct04310228 or chloroquine phosphate chictr2000030987 nct04319900 oseltamivirbranded as tamiflu is a drug approved for treatment of influenza a and b oseltamivir targets the neuraminidase distributed on the surface of the influenza virus to inhibit the spread of the influenza virus in the human body 63 64 a study in wuhan reported that no positive outcomes were observed after receiving antiviral treatment with oseltamivir 65 several clinical trials are still evaluating the effectiveness of oseltamivir in treating sars-cov-2 infection oseltamivir is also used in clinical trials in several combinations such as with chloroquine and favipiravir 66 azithromycin is an antibiotic that can be used to fight many different types of infections caused by susceptible bacteria such as respiratory infections skin infections and sexually transmitted diseases 68 moreover it has been proven to be active in vitro against zika and ebola viruses and to prevent severe respiratory tract infections when treated to patients suffering viral infection 6971 for the mechanism of action azithromycin prevents bacteria from growing by interfering with their protein synthesis it binds to the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome thus inhibiting translation of mrna 72 previously azithromycin has been used as adjunctive therapy to provide antibacterial coverage and potential immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects in the treatment of some viral respiratory tract infections eg influenza 73 74 currently many trials are testing the effect of azithromycin conjunction with hydroxychloroquine on the course of disease in people with sars-cov-2 for example pfizer has announced positive data for the use of its azithromycin zithromax drug along with hydroxychloroquine in a covid-19 clinical trial that was performed in france in brief the clinical trial was conducted to assess hydroxychloroquine in 20 patients 6 of which were co-administered with azithromycin compared with 16 controls and 14 hydroxychloroquine alone group the 6 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine  azithromycin presented with highest virologic cure rate following 6-day treatment 73 three other clinical studies used azithromycin 500 mg on day 1 then 250 mg daily on days 25 co-treated with 10-day regimen of hydroxychloroquine 600 mg daily in an open-label non-randomized study in france 6 pts 73 open-label uncontrolled study in france 11 pts 75 and uncontrolled observational study in france 80 pts 76 specifically gautret et al reported a 100 viral clearance in nasopharyngeal swabs in their 6 patients after co-treated of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin 73 but the findings reported by molina et al stand in contrast with those reported by gautret molina et al repeated the experiments thought the rapid and full viral clearance was quite unexpected and found 8 of 11 patients had significant comorbidities 75 based on those results data presented to date are insufficient to evaluate possible clinical benefits of azithromycin in patients with covid-19 76 furthermore one must consider the additive cardiac toxicity of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin both agents are known to prolong the qt interval and may potentiate the risk for cardiac events in a population known to have cardiac-related comorbidities vitamin c is an essential nutrient and plays significant roles within the human body it can neutralize free radicals and assist to prevent or reverse cellular damage as a potent antioxidant agent it is also involved in some biological processes many of which are associated with immune health 77 moreover vitamin c appears to be effective as an antiviral agent especially against influenza viruses 78 many studies showed that vitamin c positively affects the development and maturation of t lymphocytes and nk natural killer cells involved in the immune response to viral agents it also contributes to the inhibition of reactive oxygen species ros production and to the remodulation of the cytokine network typical of systemic inflammatory syndrome 79 given this background a phase ii clinical trial nct04264533 is initiated in china to evaluate high-dose iv vitamin c in icu patients with severe covid-19-associated pneumonia 80 some hospitals have reported giving infected patients 1500 mg of vitamin c as supportive treatment high-dose iv vitamin c has been given in the treatment of 50 moderate to severe covid-19 patients in china 81 the doses varied between 2 and 10 g per day given over a period of 8-10-h iv infusion the oxygenation index was improved in real time and all the patients eventually recovered and were discharged 81 moreover high-dose 15 mgkg body weight vitamin c has been used for several decades clinically and an nih panel also documented clearly that this dose regimen is safe and has no major side effects 81 82 as a potent anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic drug low doses of methylprednisolone depo-medrol or solu-medrol have the potential to prevent an extended cytokine response and may accelerate resolution of pulmonary and systemic inflammation in pneumonia 83 84 recently many medical researchers believe that corticosteroids especially methylprednisolone may improve dysregulated immune response caused by sepsis possible complication of infection with covid-19 and increase blood pressure when it is low 85 specifically in a retrospective cohort study 201 patients with confirmed covid-19 who developed ards were treated with methylprednisolone 12 mgkg daily iv for 57 days and the results showed that treatment with methylprednisolone may be beneficial for patients who develop ards in the reduction of the risk of death briefly of those patients with ards who received methylprednisolone treatment 23 of 50 46 patients died while those who did not receive methylprednisolone 21 of 34 618 died 86 in another study 46 patients with severe covid-19 that progressed to acute respiratory failure use of methylprednisolone was associated with improvement in clinical symptoms ie fever hypoxia and a shortened disease course in patients who received the drug compared with those who did not 87 moreover according to expert consensus statement from chinese thoracic society dosage regimen of methylprednisolone should be low to moderate ie  05 to 1 mgkg daily or equivalent 88 and the most common regimens of methylprednisolone applied in china were typically 4080 mg iv daily for a course of 36 days 89 the appropriate dosage low dose versus high dose place in therapy early versus late and role for corticosteroids cytokine storm or comorbidity management require additional clarity there is concern that the use of corticosteroids may have deleterious effects ie inhibition of immune response and pathogen clearance in patients with covid-19 83 one study reported no effect on mortality and decreased viral clearance with the use of corticosteroids 24 furthermore the infectious diseases society of american recommends against the routine use of corticosteroids in covid-19 however they do recommend the use of corticosteroids in the setting of ards in the context of a clinical trial 90 similarly the surviving sepsis campaign recommends against corticosteroids in mechanically ventilated patients with acute lung injury in the absence of ards 91 however they provide a recommendation for the use of corticosteroids in patients with ards acknowledging the weak level of evidence dexamethasone has demonstrated utility on ards by decreasing ventilator days and mortality on severe ards in patients without covid-19 92 whether the use of corticosteroids provides similar benefit in patients with covid-19 and ards remains to be seen ultimately the clinical utilization of corticosteroids still needs to be established and should be considered on a case by case basis since patients with pre-existing pulmonary conditions are at higher risk of covid-19 and should be closely monitored and cared pulmonary vasodilator agents have been used in some patients for hypoxemia refractory to conventional treatments but no study has been performed specifically on covid-19 patients the surviving sepsis campaign suggested a trial of inhaled pulmonary vasodilator method as rescue therapy in mechanically ventilated adults with covid-19 severe ards and hypoxemia despite optimized ventilation and other rescue strategies inhaled nitric oxide ino and inhaled epoprostenol iepo a naturally occurring prostaglandin are two common pulmonary vasodilators that have been widely studied 9395 experience in patients with ards indicates that ino can substantially reduce mean pulmonary artery pressure and improve oxygenation in such patients furthermore in vitro evidence of direct antiviral activity against sars-cov was studied and the genetic similarity between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 suggests their potential effectiveness against sars-cov-2 96 for iepo dosages up to 50 ngkg per minute have been used 93 94 97 98 previous studies reported that to provide a clinically important increase in pao2 and reduction in pulmonary artery pressure the most effective and safe dosage appears to be 2030 ngkg per minute in adults and 30 ngkg per minute in pediatric patients 98 for ino therapy was given for  3 days 30 ppm on day 1 followed by 20 and 10 ppm on days 2 and 3 respectively then weaned on day 4 in a pilot study on sars-cov 99 additionally clinical trials evaluating ino for treatment or prevention of covid-19 are planned or underway nct04305457 nct04306393 nct04312243 100 101 and on march 20 2020 fda granted emergency expanded access allowing its ino delivery system inopulse to be immediately used for the treatment of covid-19 finally additional studies are needed to evaluate the potential role of iepo and ino in the treatment of covid-19 patients sirolimus also known as rapamycin is an immunosuppressant that is used to prevent organ transplant rejection and to treat lymphangioleiomyomatosis lam by inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin mtor kinase it was originally isolated from the bacterium streptomyces hygroscopicus found on easter island rapa nui 102 and is commercially available as rapamune pfizer mtor and more specifically a protein complex mtorc1 formed by mtor plays a key role in viral replication in an in vitro experiment sirolimus has been shown to affect pi3kaktmtor pathway which inhibited mers-cov activity 103 a new randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial scope by university of cincinnati is planned to be conducted between april and september 2020 to test the effect of sirolimus on progression of patients hospitalized with covid-19 to advanced respiratory support 104 studies of patients hospitalized with influenza can further shed light on the antiviral effect of sirolimus in a randomized clinical trial conducted on 38 patients with confirmed h1n1 pneumonia and on mechanical ventilator support a group treated with corticosteroids and 2 mgday of sirolimus for 14 days n  19 showed significantly better clinical outcomes compared with the group treated with corticosteroids only including shorter median duration of ventilator used 105 delayed oseltamivir plus sirolimus treatment in ph1n1-infected mouse model further suggested a significant association between the sirolimus treatment and improved outcomes 106 additionally a new trial by the chinese university of hong kong is planned to begin in august 2020 to investigate the effect of sirolimus and oseltamivir on normalization of respiratory status and changes in biomarkers viral rna concentration 10 cytokineschemokines and pro-inflammatory mediators and several other clinical endpoints in influenza patients 107 at least one in silico study identified sirolimus as one of the 16 potential candidates for treating covid-19 patients based on data from other human coronavirus infections using network-based drug repurposing model 108 tocilizumab branded as actemra is a humanized mab developed by roche and chugai pharmaceutical for treating ra and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients at the time of publishing this article clinicaltrialsgov listed 20 planned studies that included tocilizumab treatment arm all of them at the recruiting stage or earlier a study published in april 2020 reported that 21 severe or critical covid-19 patients in china were treated with the compound with 20 of them recovered at the time of publication and 1 on the way to recovery but still in icu encouraged by these results a larger multicenter clinical trial was launched chictr2000029765 and had about 500 patients treated with tocilizumab already enrolled 109 110 sarilumab branded as kefraza a humanized mab was developed by regeneron pharmaceuticals and sanofi for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ra a phase 23 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was planned by regeneron pharmaceuticals and sanofi and in partnership with northwell healths feinstein institutes for medical research for march 2020 targeting to enroll 400 covid-19 patients measuring percent change in c-protein phase 2 only and time to improvement on a 7-point scale based on death and type of hospitalization in patients with serum il-6 level above a threshold as primary endpoints as of the time of this publication the results of this study have not been made public 111 anakinra branded as kineret by swedish orphan biovitrum is a modified human il-1 receptor antagonist il-1ra approved in 2001 in the usa and in 2002 in europe for use in ra patients il-1 family of receptors triggers innate immune response and was associated with damaging inflammation 112 out of 5 approved clinical trials involving anakinra treatment 2 also have tocilizumab as a comparison one multicenter open-label non-randomized trial in greece with estimated enrollment of 20 patients 113 and another multicenter randomized open-label trial in belgium with estimated 342 patients has been enrolled to date 114 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor is regarded as an important target in the pathogenesis of covid-19 studies reveal that frequently observed comorbidities including hypertension and diabetes in patients infected with sars-cov-2 are under medication with angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker arb 115118 that result in overexpression of ace2 it is speculated that sars-cov and sars-cov-2 bind to human cells via interaction with ace2 receptors 118 119 the opposing physiological actions of ace and ace2 in the renin-angiotensin system are reviewed to determine the therapeutic efficacy of ace2 inhibitors or arbs 120 121 in hypertensive patients chronic treatment with angiotensin ii type 1 receptor at1r antagonists like losartan lisinopril or olmesartan facilitates cardiac and renal ace2 overexpression according to some in vivo studies 120 122 in contrast sar viral rna following entry into respiratory epithelial cells downregulates the activity of ace2 thereby increasing the levels of angiotensin 2 this may potentially cause severe lung damage 121 123 continued treatment with these drugs may be essential for the survival to attenuate the cardiac stress of advancing covid-19 infection and limit the vasoconstriction and profibrotic effects of angiotensin 2 in alveolar capillaries some of the anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug nsaid are activators of ace2 receptors same as ace inhibitors or arbs their usage can lead to increased risk of contracting covid-19 118 since fatal lung failure induced by sars-cov infections may be controlled by blocking renin-angiotensin pathway 123 ibuprofen may not be harmful however there is no strong evidence suggesting a link between intake of an nsaid and worsening symptoms due to infection caused by sars-cov-2 the fda considers ibuprofen and the likes as a potentially promising therapeutic agent against covid-19 124 studies have demonstrated that thiazolidinedione and its derivatives which are type 2 diabetes mellitus drugs show efficacious effect against pulmonary disease induced by respiratory syncytial virus rsv or h1n1 influenza infection 125 126 but their role as a therapeutic drug against coronavirus is not yet explored interestingly it is known that thiazolidinediones may have the potential to upregulate ace2 receptor which is identified as a binding target for sars-cov-2 in host cells 118 however lack of clinical evidence makes it uncertain to determine its therapeutic efficacy against coronavirus infections amici et al have demonstrated that indomethacin a well-known nsaid and a potential cyclooxygenase cox inhibitor exhibits antiviral activity against sars-cov and canine coronavirus ccov in vitro studies suggest that indomethacin exhibits dose-dependent response in canine a72 cell monolayers infected with ccov with an ic50 of 5 um after 24 h of exposure also remarkable inhibition against sars-cov-infected vero cells by more than 99 at concentrations that were non-toxic for uninfected cells is also observed in addition indomethacin significantly blocks viral rna synthesis in dogs infected with ccov following oral administration of the drug 1 mgkg 127 this suggests probable efficacy of indomethacin against sars-cov-2 127 colchicine is an anti-inflammatory drug commonly used for gout management and a variety of other conditions sharing similar pathophysiology its mechanisms of action are related to interfering with migration of neutrophils to sites of inflammation and blocking the inflammasome complex in both neutrophils and monocytes thus reducing il-1beta activation 128 colchicine also has inhibitory effects on macrophages via the inhibition of the nacht-lrrpyd-containing protein 3 nalp3 inflammasome and pore formation activated by purinergic receptors p2x7 and p2x2 there may also be beneficial effects on endothelial function due to colchicines anti-fibrotic activities some patients with covid-19 present with myopathies and colchicine has been shown to reduce inflammation in the cardiac myocytes 129 there are several ongoing studies investigating colchicine for cytokine storm nct04326790 nct04322682 nct04322565 niclosamide an anthelmintic drug has been shown to be an effective sars-cov virus replication inhibitor at dose concentration of 156 um or higher in vero e6 cells without interfering with binding of corona virus onto the cells 130 another study reveals the efficacy of niclosamide in inhibiting mers-cov replication in verob4 cells via reduction of skp2 regulated becn1 ubiquitination and enhancement of autophagic flux and its ic50 value is determined to be 03 um 131 thus the possibility of niclosamide to inhibit sars-cov-2 cannot be neglected ivermectin a potent anthelmintic drug was first discovered to inhibit interaction between integrase in molecule of human immunodeficiency virus hiv-1 and its nuclear transport receptor importin  132 further studies exhibit its potential to prevent viral replication of a broad spectrum of viruses including dengue virus flavivirus and influenza 133135 very recently ivermectin has shown inhibition against sars-cov-2 up to 5000-fold at 48 h in vitro inhibition of imp1-mediated nuclear import of viral proteins is suggested as the probable cause of its antiviral activity 136 it will be interesting to know its inhibition effect against sars-cov-2 in vivo both nitazoxanide and its metabolite and tizoxanide have shown inhibitory effects against mers-cov in llc-mk2 cells besides inhibition of other corona virus strains including murine corona virus mouse hepatitis virus strain a59 mhv-a59 bovine corona virus strain l9 bcov-l9 and human enteric corona virus 4408 hecov-4408 by nitazoxanide is reported via suppression of viral n protein 137 nitazoxanide is found to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs and il-6 in vivo however the relevance of this information is currently unknown 138 this treatment option refers to transfusion of plasma loaded with antibodies from individuals after resolution from a specific pathogen this technique has been used for decades 139 transfusion can offer a short-term immediate immunity for individuals convalescent plasma can be used prophylactically and for already infected patients to attenuate clinical severity 140 141 mechanism of action is through binding of the transfused antibodies to the pathogen resulting in cellular cytotoxicity phagocytosis or direct neutralization of the pathogen 142 143 previously convalescent plasma was used for two coronaviruses sars-cov and mers 144 one large study in hong kong involving 80 patients with sars-cov supported early administration of antibodies for optimal clinical effect compared to later administration 145 limited data from taiwan and south korea showed clinical benefits in severe cases of sars-cov and mers 146 147 reported dosage varied widely in terms of the amount of plasma transfused and antibody titer 148 limited data on covid-19 patients from china illustrated clinical benefits 149 150 pilot study reported clinical improvement in terms of fever cough tightness of breath and chest pain while no serious side effects were reported 150 there has been considerable attention placed on the role of hypercoagulable state leading to micro- and macro-vascular thrombosis in covid-19 disseminated intravascular coagulation and elevated d-dimer level were identified as predictors of worse outcomes in a cohort study of patients with covid-19 151 patients receiving anticoagulants had a decreased mortality 152 heparin has anti-inflammatory properties and may also inhibit viral attachment via conformational changes to the sars-cov-2 surface receptor spike s1 153 low molecular weight heparin in patients hospitalized with covid-19 was associated with lower serum il-6 concentrations suggesting that there may be an added mechanism besides preventiontreatment of thrombosis 154 based on available evidence it is reasonable to administer venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with either a low molecular weight or unfractionated heparin in hospitalized patients in patients with rapidly progressing respiratory deterioration or where clinical judgment suggests thrombosis treatment doses of anticoagulants may be considered the covid-19 pandemic represents the greatest global public health crisis in the past 100 years hopefully vaccines and or specific therapeutic drugs targeting sars-cov-2 will be made available in the next few months or years with the speed and volume of basic and clinical covid-19sars-cov-2 research to develop potential drugs and therapies for this disease our hope will be on the horizon  hyperglycemia hydroxychloroquine and the covid19 pandemic adam brufsky   we are all struggling to understand the human catastrophe of the coronavirus disease2019 covid19 epidemic as of april 12 2020 there were 557043 cases of documented covid19 infection in the united states and 21952 deaths
1
 our economy except for limited sectors has come to a complete halt as we practice physical distancing to try to mitigate the effects of the pandemic in the 10 weeks since covid19 began to accelerate there has been a flurry of information from corners expected and unexpected to help us with this understanding rapid publication of peerreviewed data has defined the possible risk factors for covid19 its clinical course and its possible epidemiology in this unusual time of a public health emergency numerous nonpeerreviewed manuscripts have been uploaded to preprint servers and their unreviewed data and conclusions must be evaluated in this spirit nevertheless data both published and in preprint form point to a tantalizing hypothesis that covid19 infection and its severity can be explained by the concentration of glycosylated severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 sarscov2 viral particles in the lung epithelium the concentration of glycosylated angiotensinconverting enzyme receptor 2 ace2 in the lung epithelium and the degree and control of the pulmonary immune response to the sarscov2 spike protein at approximately day 8 to 10 after symptom onset which may be related to both ace2 appears to be the primary receptor for entry of sarscov2 into various epithelial tissues an envelope anchored spike protein allows entry of coronaviruses into host cells by binding to a host receptor and fusing viral and host membranes
2
 analysis of sarscov a betacoronavirus most similar to sarscov2 and responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars
3
 defined a receptorbinding domain rbd of the sarscov spike protein that specifically recognized ace2
4

 susceptibility to sars appears to be primarily dependent on the affinity of the spike rbd to bind host ace2 in target tissues in the initial viral attachment step and differences in the affinity of the rbd for ace2 may determine the zoonotic host and epidemiology of spread
5
 protein crystal structure analysis of the sarscov rbd complexed with ace2 demonstrated that this differential binding affinity resides in a critical receptorbinding motif of the spike receptor protein and in particular the composition of amino acids 442 472 479 480 and 487 determine affinity for human ace2 as opposed to other hosts
5

 predicted protein structural analysis of these critical five residues in the sarscov2 analogous to sarscov suggested an increased binding affinity to human ace2 by sarscov2
6
 a synthetic sarscov2 rbd was found in vitro to bind and enter cells transfected only with a human ace2 receptor and no other known coronavirus targets such as dpp4 the target of merscov
7
 therefore it is rational to assume that like sarscov sarscov2 uses the ace2 receptor on target tissues as its primary mechanism of entry recent work with cryo electron microscopy of ace2 bound to a spike protein fragment of sarscov2
8
 suggests that the viral spike protein is a trimer with one of the trimer rbd sites exposed to bind ace2 additional structurefunction studies
9
 also appear to indicate that the viral spike s protein of sarscov2 is highly glycosylated the s protein is cleaved by proteases into two subunits s1 and s2 and the s1 subunit is further divided into sa and sb domains with the sb domain predicted to bind to human ace2 the s2 subunit is responsible for fusion of the virusace2 complex with the cell membrane and is highly glycosylated at evolutionarily conserved sites
9

 it is tempting to speculate that alterations in glycosylation of both the spike protein as well as ace2 can modulate viral binding it is also tempting to speculate that alterations in the highly glycosylated and evolutionarily conserved viral fusion subunit could modulate s proteinace2 complex fusion with the cell membrane and potentially attenuate human to human transmission the importance of ace2 binding by sarscov2 in covid19 is underscored by the observation that anosmia and dysgeusia have recently been observed in patients with covid19
10
 and that ace2 expression has recently been found to be high in the oropharynx and tongue
11

 binding of ace2 by sarscov2 in covid19 also suggests that prolonged uncontrolled hyperglycemia and not just a history of diabetes mellitus may be important in the pathogenesis of the disease a known history of diabetes dm and ambient hyperglycemia were found to be independent risk factors for morbidity and mortality in sars
12
 in a followup analysis of 135 patients high fasting plasma glucose fpg was an independent predictor of sars mortality
13
 diabetes was found in 74 of a cohort of hospitalized covid19 patients and appeared to be a risk factor for severity of disease
14
 a history of diabetes was associated with 225 of covid19 intensive care unit icu admissions vs 59 of nonicu admissions in one case series
15
 and another recent icu case series reported 14 of 24 58 with a history of diabetes
16
 mortality of covid19 in patients with diabetes was found to be 76 vs 09 in patients with no comorbidities
17

 a possible explanation for a link between hyperglycemia and ace2 levels in the severity of covid19 disease could be explained by several clinical observations in sars and preclinical observations in the nod diabetic mouse as noted above potential changes in glycosylation of the ace2 as well as glycosylation of the viral spike protein both possibly induced by uncontrolled hyperglycemia may alter both the binding of the viral spike protein to ace2 and the degree of the immune response to the virus in a subset of 39 patients who had no prior diabetes received no steroid treatment during hospitalization and who survived sars fpg levels during hospitalization were found to decrease before discharge
13
 twenty of these 39 51 patients had diabetes during hospitalization
13
 and at 3 years of followup only 2 of 39 5 did autopsy examination of an unrelated individual revealed high levels of ace2 expression in the alveolar tissue of the lung the islet cells of the pancreas the heart and the kidney this suggested a mechanism of transient hyperglycemia induced by a transient inflammation of the islet cells of the pancreas by sarscov through binding of sarscov to the ace2 present on islet cells resulting in a transient insulin dependent diabetes mellitus which resolved with resolution of disease
13

 in a study of nod diabetic mice ace2 protein levels in the lung were putatively elevated when compared to control mice and returned to the control level when insulin was administered
18
 by reducing levels of glycosylated ace2 target in the target lung tissue by glycemic control this could possibly reduce the number of glycosylated viral binding sites in the lung and hence possibly ameliorate some of the inflammation and symptoms of covid19 disease this also suggests a possible paracrine loop hypothesis for covid19 infection where the virus infects the pancreas and lung leading to hyperglycemia and upregulation of glycosylated ace2 in the lung and further virus binding and inflammation poor glycemic control could therefore make the disease more severe in a case series of 138 covid19 patients glucocorticoid therapy was used in 449 of nonicu patients and 722 of icu patients
15
 and presumably this glucocorticoid use made hyperglycemia and possibly clinical symptoms more severe a recent review of glucocorticoids in viral diseases recommended against use in covid19 pneumonia and suggested that it could cause harm
19

 it is interesting to note that as this article was going to press that another group has expressed a similar hypothesis
20

 potentially high and aberrantly glycosylated ace2 in the lung nasal airways tongue and oropharynx in uncontrolled hyperglycemia could also serve as increased sarscov2 viral binding sites thus leading to a higher propensity to covid19 infection and a higher disease severity interestingly high ace2 has a protective effect in various organs
21
 ace2 gene expression is increased by estrogen in a mouse model 
22
 a potential protective factor for sarscov2 infection and pathogenicity as men are more likely than women to both acquire covid19 and have more severe disease recent survey studies found that ace2 gene expression was higher in tissues of women and in younger adults an inverse correlation to disease severity
23
 a possible explanation for this discrepancy is that gene expression experiments cannot measure posttranslational modifications such as protein glycosylation in the nod diabetic mouse model ace2 activity in the lung did not rise and then fall with insulin administration but the amount of ace2 protein apparently did
18
 this is consistent with a rise in glycosylated ace2 as opposed to total ace2 since antibody binding to proteins as measured by western blot analysis could be affected by glycosylation
24
 therefore it is likely that it is the amount of glycosylated ace2 receptor and not simply the amount of ace2 alone that is responsible for virus binding and fusion if true this argues for better glycemic control in patients with prediabetes and diabetes as a potential mechanism to slow covid19 spread and reduce the severity of symptoms additionally since 38 of the american population without a history of diabetes or prediabetes has a hemoglobin a1c over 61 in random sampling
25
 use of high a1c as a risk stratification for covid19 could have merit clinical information about the timing of the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards in sars and covid19 is also informative in a series of 75 patients with sars
26
 median time to oxygen desaturation occurred around day 4 after the onset of symptoms median time to peak viral load occurred around day 10 and median time to peak ards requiring intubation occurred around day 10 to 12 in a series of 138 covid19 patients
15
 median time to dyspnea from the onset of symptoms was 5 days to hospital admission was 7 days and to ards 8 days in a series of 24 covid19 patients admitted to icus in the seattle area the median time to hospital admission was 7 days from the onset of symptoms another case series from wuhan suggests a median time from symptom onset to development of computed tomography ct scan changes consistent with covid19 pneumonia to be a median of 5 days
14
 it appears that both sars and covid19 have a similar clinical course of infection symptom onset dyspnea and oxygen desaturation at approximately day 5 after symptoms in a fraction of symptomatic patients followed by a worsening of disease to ards requiring intubation at day 7 to 10 after symptoms in a smaller fraction of dyspneic patients this appears to be coincident with a peak in viral load as measured in nasopharyngeal swabs at day 10 after symptom onset in sars
26
 the timing of the ards in sars also corresponded to the timing of immunoglobulin g igg seroconversion
26
 additionally the neutralizing antibody nab response to the sarscov spike protein in patients who died of sars occurred earlier in the course of the disease 147 days after symptom onset vs those who survived 20 days and the nab antibody titer was higher in those who died of sars than in those survived
27
 notably viral load in covid19 in severe cases appears to remain high 10 days after symptom onset
28
 and it is tempting to hypothesize that a similar mechanism applies to sarscov2 the study of sarslike coronaviruses in animal models has been of necessity difficult in large part due to concerns in preventing a pandemic similar to the one we are currently experiencing sars experiments require a biosafety level 3 laboratory and experiments where recombinant coronavirus constructs were produced by insertion of various novel spike protein rbd coding sequences into benign or nontransmissible coronaviruses were specifically banned by the national institutes of health in 2014
29

 however experimental information exists on sars infection and immune response from a chinese macaque animal model
30
 in this model vaccination with a modified vaccina virus containing the fulllength sarscov spike protein followed by infection with sarscov induced varying degrees of diffuse alveolar damage in the majority of the experimental animals 7 days after infection adoptive transfer of serum from macaques vaccinated with the sarscov spike protein but not infected with sarscov was performed and this serum induced diffuse alveolar damage at rates greater than control serum in sarscovinfected macaques indicating that the spike protein neutralizing antibodies were amplifying virus damage by sarscov in the lung even at low doses of serum high doses of serum still caused alveolar damage even if they reduced sarscov viral titers and the damage appeared to be restricted to acutely infected animals the action of the serum in inducing this damage also appeared to be due to driving of pulmonary macrophages excessively to a proinflammatory m1 polarized state possibly through involvement of the glycosylated fc gamma receptor serum from deceased sars patients in this study also induced this proinflammatory m1 polarization as well the acute onset of lung inflammation in sars resulting in ards appears to be tightly associated with monocytemacrophage polarization and function
31
 during acute infection macrophages display a classically activated inflammatory m1 phenotype and express cytokines such as interleukin6 il6 high il6 levels were associated with increased mortality in a series of 191 hospitalized patients with covid19
16

 it is tempting to consider that the same mechanism acts in covid19 as in sars where an overactive macrophage m1 inflammatory response as neutralizing antibodies to the sarscov2 spike protein form at day 7 to 10 results in ards in susceptible patients it is also allows consideration of agents which may interfere with this overly brisk macrophage inflammatory response and perhaps influence the course of the disease in particular those that blunt but do not completely abrogate m2 to m1 balance in macrophage polarization as well as viral load which in sars appears to be temporally related to the onset of ards it is of interest that in a mouse model of asthma macrophage m2 polarization is increased by estrogen
32
 additionally estrogen also accelerates acquisition of an m2 phenotype in a monocyte cell culture model
33
 differences in m1 to m2 polarization may perhaps explain the partial protective effect of female sex in the pathogenesis of covid19 it is a tribute to the ingenuity and effort of the medical and scientific community that we currently have multiple agents in clinical trials to help treat covid19 all of which have a rational basis however for an agent to have an effect in blunting the medical complications of a widespread pandemic where hundreds of thousands of infected patients are at risk of fatal progression of disease this agent needs to be cheap relatively nontoxic and rapidly scalable only one of the agents being considered at this point meets these criteria hydroxychloroquine has been used of the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune conditions for nearly 70 years it has also been used as malaria prophylaxis and treatment for nearly 50 years it is extremely safe and has been used widely in underdeveloped countries for these conditions in children and in pregnant women with little to no monitoring while there are potential concerns for rare drug interactions with other agents that prolong the qt interval and there are concerns with retinopathy with long term use neither of these uncommon complications should be clinically significant if appropriate caution an electrocardiogram ekg before therapy is employed
34

 there is a possible rational basis for the development of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of covid19 in clinical trials of treatment and prophylaxis hydroxychloroquine inhibits sarscov2 in vitro at concentrations achievable in human lung tissue
35
 chloroquine a related compound inhibits sarscov replication and spread in cell culture possibly through reducing glycosylation of the ace2 receptor
36
 interestingly computer simulations suggest that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are predicted to bind to the active site of the enzyme udpnacetylglucosamine 2epimerase which catalyzes the rate determining step in the sialic acid biosynthesis pathway
37
 and thus there is a rational basis to assume hydroxychloroquine can interfere in terminal glycosylation of proteins in the golgi apparatus in a small unrandomized clinical cohort of 80 patients the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has been shown to rapidly reduce viral load in covid19 patients and ameliorate clinical symptoms in the majority of patients
38
 in another small randomized unpublished study of 62 covid19 patients undertaken after the observation that none of a cohort 80 lupus patients in wuhan on chronic hydroxychloroquine therapy developed covid19 infection 62 patients with mild covid19 symptoms and signs of covid19 pneumonia on ct scan were randomized to 200mg of hydroxychloroquine orally twice daily for 5 days and usual care or usual care alone
39
 in the hydroxychloroquine arm of this study 806 of subjects had improvement of covid19 pneumonia findings on ct scan vs 508 of controls after 5 days of therapy p0476 and 0 of patients on hydroxychloroquine progressed to severe disease vs 129 of control patients pnot done hydroxychloroquine also can act as an oral hypoglycemic agent as patients with diabetes taking hydroxychloroquine for rheumatologic diseases had a significant reduction in hemoglobin a1c when compared to methotrexate
40
 and thus can serve to reduce hyperglycemia a possible covid19 risk factor for disease severity while studies are mixed on this topic and the balance of m1 to m2 macrophage polarization may differ depending on the local microenvironment hydroxychloroquine has been shown in at least one study to block the polarization of macrophages to an m1 inflammatory subtype
41
 and it is predicted to interfere with glycosylation of a number of proteins involved in the humoral immune response possibly including the macrophage fcr gamma igg receptor and other immunomodulatory proteins potentially through inhibition of udpnacetylglucosamine 2epimerase in combination with potential other immunomodulatory effects this could possibly blunt the progression of covid19 pneumonia all to way up to ards where a potential overconversion to an inflammatory m1 macrophage subtype occurs in response to a postulated brisk humoral immune response to the sarscov2 spike protein around day 8 to 10 after symptom onset while we await larger randomized studies and more analysis of patient subtypes to determine who if anyone will benefit from hydroxychloroquine in the context of this theoretical framework for covid19 infection the results to date are supportive although much caution should be used in interpretation of these early small clinical trials regardless of the results of larger clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine in covid19 it is hoped that the above analysis can provide a testable theoretical framework to allow for advances in our understanding and control of this deadly viral epidemic the authors declare that there are no conflict of interests  use of hydroxychloroquine and interferon alpha-2b for the prophylaxis of covid-19 alexander yang charlotte yang bing yang   sars-cov-2 is an enveloped positive stranded rna coronavirus and is genetically related to sars-cov which was responsible for the sars outbreak in 2002-3 the receptor-binding domain of the s1 subunit has high affinity for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace-2 receptor 2 ace2 protein is primarily expressed in the epithelia of human lung and small intestine but is also expressed in heart kidneys and brain 3 sars-cov2 enters the host cell through the endocytosis 2 both sars-cov and sars-cov2 have been implicated to hijack the endocytic pathway to gain entry into host cells 4 after receptor binding and endocytosis of the virus in the acidic environment of the endocytic vesicle proteolytic cleavage of s allows the virus to fuse with the membrane of the endosome dumping viral nucleocapsid into the cytosol of the cell 4 5 taken together targeting the endocytic-lysosomal pathway could be beneficial in the prevention of sars-cov2 from entry into the host cell chloroquine is a well-known drug that has been used for the prevention or treatment of malaria and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus in addition the drug has been known to have anti-viral properties against viruses such as hiv 7 and sars-cov 8 the mechanism of chloroquine is well-known it inhibits the acidification of endosome thus inhibiting the entry of the virus into the cytosol it is also reported that chloroquine can inhibit the glycosylation of s1 protein preventing the entry into the host cell 8 interferon alpha-2b ifn -2b is an antiviral cytokine produced from leukocytes and other cells that are infected by a virus and is currently used to treat viral hepatitis c and hepatitis b while the antiviral mechanisms of ifn -2b are incompletely known ifn  inhibits viral replication through prevention of protein translation 9 since chloroquine and ifn  have two different mechanisms of action we predict that the two therapies would have additive effects in the prophylaxis of covid-19 in vitro chloroquine is reported to have antiviral activity against many types of rna viruses as reviewed by devaux 6 chloroquine has been studied in vitro using cell lines and found to be effective in preventing the entry of the virus into the cells 11 the prophylactic properties of ifn -2b have been tested against a variety of viruses including coronavirus 1 in human in the study involving cold caused by coronavirus volunteers used nasal spray of ifn -2b or placebo before inoculation of coronavirus 229e nasal spray of ifn  reduced cold symptoms significantly compared to placebo although the rate of viral infection was the same 1 given the effectiveness of prophylactic chloroquine in vitro and demonstrated ability of ifn -2b to reduce symptoms of coronavirus in human we are proposing to use chloroquine together with ifn -2b as a prophylactic measure in human most likely first line hospital workers and high-risk patients in the hospital and nursing home the efficacy of this method can be tested in a randomized controlled study clinically in the high risk group of patients individuals with the prophylaxis can be compared with the individuals without prophylaxis ideally there would be three experimental groups placebo hydroxychloroquine alone and hydroxychloroquine with ifn -2b rate of infection and severity of symptoms can be compared between all three groups due to the low side effect profile of chloroquine and ifn -2b the benefit to risk ratio of using chloroquine and ifn -2b to prevent the spread of sars-cov2 and covid-19 could be enormous chloroquine has a long half-life of 150-290 hours 13 for this reason in the prevention of malaria the patient is asked to take the drug once a week for the period of traveling to malaria-infected region chloroquine has a large volume of distribution and can penetrate almost all tissues including the liver spleen brain kidney lungs and spleen 10 due to the long half-life and large volume of distribution of chloroquine chloroquine can potentially prevent sars-cov2 from entry into host cell in all different organs
 perhaps the most appealing aspect of using chloroquine as a prophylactic treatment is the low side effect profile there have been few reports of severe side effect for the long-term use of chloroquine but there are some reports on cardiomyopathy as a severe adverse effect caused by chloroquine 16 bernstein analyzed all published cases and food and drug administration reports of retinopathy induced by hydroxychloroquine he concluded that there is no evidence of permanent visual-field scotomas occurring when the daily dose did not exceed 65 mgkg body weight for maintenance therapy 17 the dosage we are proposing is 125 to 25 of the dosage used in the long term treatment thus the rate of side effects should be significantly lower especially in short period of use intranasal ifn  given as prophylaxis intranasally also had a mild side effect profile side effects mainly were nose bleeds 1 we propose to test 50-100 mg of chloroquine daily for the prophylaxis of covid-19 at this lower concentration the side effect of chloroquine will be minimized so that the general public can use for a period of time until covid-19 is under control the concentration in plasma would be expected to be 016-08 m well below the threshold for side effects at 125 m whole blood concentrations of chloroquine are 5-10 times higher than plasma 10 and tissue concentrations are 200-700 times higher than plasma 19 thus at a dose of 50-100 mg daily the concentrations of chloroquine in tissue should be high enough to have prophylactic effect according to the concentrations of chloroquine used in vitro without minimal risk of adverse events 8 several forms of chloroquine have been approved for use in the clinic hydroxychloroquine is an analog of chloroquine with less drug-drug interactions and has been found to be more potent 20 thus hydroxychloroquine may be the most appropriate form of chloroquine to give for prophylaxis in the study involving prophylaxis of cold caused by coronavirus in healthy individuals dose of 05 x 106 iu twice a day of intranasal ifn -2b decreased symptoms of cold caused by coronavirus 1 since we hypothesize that the prophylactic effects of ifn -2b and chloroquine would be additive we recommend using a low intranasal dose of 05 x 106 iu twice a day to minimize adverse effects of ifn -2b treatment note after the submission of the manuscript dr jinping xu and dr youcheng liu of wayne state university school of medicine decided to collaborate with the authors to initiate a clinical trial to test the hypothesis the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest associated with the manuscript this work was supported by the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney disease niddk grants f30-dk116529 ay by and cy conceived of the presented idea all authors contributed to the writing and editing of the manuscript 
12 14 15 18  hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin for covid-19  warranted or dangerous corneliu popescu p philip fischer r   in light of the covid-19 pandemic the world is changing rapidly in unprecedented ways travel has been largely suspended global health concerns are locally relevant everywhere on the planet and the scientific community responsible for the care of travelers and infected individuals is rising to the opportunity with research and clinical guidance of relevance to both individualized medicine and public health what treatment should be advised for covid-19 no specific antivirals are currently available for sars-cov-2 antibody-based treatments are being evaluated however hydroxychloroquine-related compounds were reported to be active in vitro against sars coronavirus from 2002 to 2003 1 and later against mers coronavirus 2 in this issue of travel medicine and infectious disease million and colleagues report on the seeming effectiveness and good tolerability of hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin in treating covid-19 3 separate from the treatment outcomes data reported by million the very existence of this paper provides encouragement in two ways first the paper demonstrates teamwork thirty-seven co-authors combined their efforts to document care and outcomes of 1061 patients a nigerian igbo proverb states that it takes a village to raise a child similarly a large team is required to mount such a huge clinical and research response to try to save patients from covid-19 in addition the tmaid publishing team worked rapidly this paper includes data from april 2020 was reviewed by six different peer-reviewers was extensively revised and was accepted and published in may 2020 the speed and effectiveness of a rigorous review and publication process attest to the value of teamwork second this paper exemplifies the value of the scientific process fully separate from any celebrity opinions or political viewpoints the authors proposed and studied a hypothesis in a rigorous observational study presented their data carefully responded effectively to the peer-review process and now make their data are available for public review and interpretation so how can we interpret the data of the study by million et al 3 with hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin treatment mortality was effectively limited to only 09 among sars-cov-2-infected adults even though this was a hospital-based study though not limited to hospitalized patients the mortality wasnt much higher than the 06 death rate of all those infected worldwide and it is much lower than the 263 inpatient case fatality rate in a large british study 4 the seeming safety and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin is in contradiction to data in a study published just a week earlier that showed dangerously increased death rates in hydroxychloroquine chloroquine and macrolide-treated patients 5 that multi-nation registry of 96032 hospitalized sars-cov-2 patients in 671 centers on six continents included 14888 who were treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without a macrolide 5 confounding factors were considered and patients receiving remdesivir were excluded from the study mortality rates were 93 in the control non-hydroxychloroquinechloroquine group 18 in those who received hydroxychloroquine 238 in those who received hydroxychloroquine and a macrolide 164 in those who received chloroquine and 222 in those who received chloroquine with a macrolide 5 specific features of millions study impact interpretation of the findings first study subjects were included based on positive viral testing regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms thus some of these patients would probably not have become seriously ill whether or not they ever were diagnosed or treated by contrast the british study with a 23 case fatality rate4 and the afore-mentionedmultinational registry study 5 only included those who were sick enough to be hospitalized second a total of 350 potential study subjects were excluded from millions study some because of cardiac findings on screening and some because of use of other medications that might add increased cardiac risk this was appropriate for the research methods and for patient safety but this might have removed patients from consideration who would have had unfavorable outcomes and thus increased the mortality rates toward levels comparable to other studies third there was no control group in millions study in france it is possible that other helpful yet undocumented features of care in france unrelated to medications contributed to the seemingly favorable outcomes widespread use of incompletely tested medications could potentially have dangerous side effects and millions group wisely did not include patients with identified risk for arrhythmia in their study they screened patients carefully and all had a preliminary ecg among included patients though they found no obvious sign of medication toxicity this too is an important finding in contrast the multi-national study from mehra et al reported that new ventricular arrhythmias were approximately four times as common in those treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine than in controls 5 in that study approximately 35 of control and treated patients had pre-existing arrhythmia on entry into the study 5 this discrepancy in screening may to some extent explain the different outcomes thus the larger multi-national observational study5 found that hydroxychloroquine was associated with increased risk of death and increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias but the question arises whether this increase in mortality and of new ventricular arrhythmias in that study is not caused by an inappropriate prescription of the medication without considering the known side effects of hydroxychloroquine hydroxycloroquine use in the usa was approved by fda in 1955 6 hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are both included in the world health organization who model list of essential medicines 7 the arrhythmogenic side effects of hydroxychloroquine are well known and millions team limited its use in accordance with this knowledge while some readers will be encouraged enough by the results of millions study to just do something in giving hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin combined treatment to covid-19 patients others will opt to await more proof of safety and efficacy from randomized blinded controlled clinical trials indeed such a trial was started the world health organization solidarity trial 8 is assessing the antiviral remdesivir the hiv drug combination lopinavirritonavir the multiple sclerosis treatment interferon beta-1a and the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine the study has already enrolled approximately 3500 patients in 17 countries and recruitment continues in over 400 hospitals in a total of 35 countries 8 however who has temporarily paused enrolment in the hydroxychloroquine arm of the study not because of dangerous preliminary findings but rather because of data from the new multi-national study 5 perhaps relevant data will still emerge from the already-completed parts of the now-paused hydroxychloroquine treatment arm in the solidarity trial with an observational study million and colleagues validate the legitimacy of considering hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin in treating hospitalized patients with covid-19 however data from other studies raise a cry for caution especially if considering giving this treatment to individuals who might have an underlying arrhythmia with time we should soon know whether hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin use for covid-19 is warranted or dangerous  sars-cov-2 infection in a patient on chronic hydroxychloroquine therapy implications for prophylaxis khalid dousa m sharad malavade s jennifer furin barbara gripshover marjorie hatszegi leila hojat elie saade robert salata a   a pandemic of a novel coronavirus called sars-cov-2 causing coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 emerged spread from china and to date is affecting more than 197 countries and territories around the world since december 2019 12 sars-cov-2 infection transmits from human to human through droplets and through contact with infected surfaces efforts to discover potential treatments for covid-19 are accelerating with a focus on repositioning previously tested in vitro compounds hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are antimalarial agents with both immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities that have been proposed as possible treatments for covid-19 disease 3 there has also been interest in their use as prophylaxis for people with high-risk exposure to covid-19 who have not yet become infected although there are currently no data to support the use of these medications as preventive therapy 4 a 39-year-old female with medical history of mitral valve repair cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 4045  and rheumatoid arthritis on oral hydroxychloroquine 200 mg per day developed new onset fever as well as mild sore throat and rhinorrhea following exposure to a coworker who tested positive for sars-cov-2 the day following onset of symptoms she received a rt-pcr test that resulted as positive she was sent home where she continued to have fever and developed symptoms of mild productive cough exertional shortness of breathing generalized body pain diffuse headache myalgia fatigue nausea and diarrhea one week after the onset of symptoms she was admitted to our hospital for further management upon presentation the patient was febrile normotensive and in no distress with a normal chest examination radiograph of the chest showed no infiltrates laboratory values were pertinent for white blood cells of 51 normal 3611  109 cellsl lymphocytopenia to 064 normal 090290  109 cellsl neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio 61 platelets of 164 normal 150400  109 cells per liter creatinine clearance 60 mlmin normal hepatic transaminases and bilirubin c-reactive protein of 106 normal 30 mgl and mildly elevated prothrombin time and international normalized ratio of 12 over the next two days of hospitalization her home hydroxychloroquine was continued at 200 mg daily and no other treatments intended to specifically target sars-cov-2 or the inflammatory cascade were added she developed no additional fevers and her symptoms resolved at that point it was determined that she had mild disease and was deemed appropriate for discharge to continue self-quarantine at home chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are agents which have generated significant interest for treatment in persons with covid-19 infection they appear to have an antiviral effect mediated through increasing the endosomal ph thereby impeding virus to cell fusion as well as interfering with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of sars-cov-2 56 both drugs are known for their long elimination half-life of at least one month and high accumulation rate in cells 7 rationale for the use of these antimalarial compounds emerged from experiments in vero e6 cells in a recent letter published by wang and colleagues the in vitro activity of chloroquine against sars-cov-2 showed an effective concentration ec50 at 48 h of 113 m indicating potency 8 similar studies of chloroquine were previously done on sars-cov and mers-cov showing an ec50 in a comparable range 9 a recently published comparison study of their in vitro activity demonstrated higher potency of hydroxychloroquine over chloroquine with ec50 values similar to prior data 10 the authors utilized physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation techniques and provided a rationale for the optimal dosing regimen for hydroxychloroquine 400 mg twice on day 1 followed by 200 mg twice daily based on their in silico experiment in terms of in vivo data at least 15 clinical trials have been conducted on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in china 11 the results of which have not yet been formally published however a preliminary report was released in a letter by gao and colleagues from one hundred patients which demonstrated that chloroquine is superior to standard of care treatment in preventing exacerbation of pneumonia improving lung imaging findings promoting a virus-negative conversion and shortening the disease course 11 there have been several proposed dosages for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as treatment options for covid-19 one study referring to korean guidelines recommended 500 mg of chloroquine twice daily or 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine daily 12 a panel in china recommended chloroquine at a dose of 500 mg twice a day for 10 days for patients with any severity of pneumonia 13 the dutch centers for disease control cdc suggested a treatment regimen in adults consisting of an initial 600 mg dose of chloroquine followed by 300 mg 1 h later on day 1 then 300 mg twice a day on days 25 days another guideline document by the italian society of infectious and tropical diseases lombardy section recommended the use of chloroquine 500 mg twice a day or hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily for 10 days a meta-analysis of 6 published articles and 23 ongoing trials primarily in china listed a variety of different regimens being studied 14 most recently an open-label non-randomized trial by gautret et al suggested hydroxychloroquine 200 mg three times daily for 10 days with the addition of azithromycin depending on severity of illness 15 these proposed dosages for covid- 19 are greater than the hydroxychloroquine dose suggested for rheumatoid arthritis which is 200400 mg daily as a single oral daily dose or in 2 divided doses 16 people exposed to sars-cov-2 have a high risk of developing covid-19 and health care workers are at particularly elevated risk being at the forefront of this public health crisis as such there is significant interest in finding effective prophylaxis for which hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been considered 17 in a preprint non-peer reviewed retrospective cohort veterans who received hydroxychloroquine as treatment for covid-19 either with or without azithromycin had no reduction in risk of mechanical ventilation 18 currently in the us a randomized clinical trial of post exposure prophylaxis for sars-cov-2 at the university of minnesota is actively recruiting nct04308668 another trial assessing chloroquine prevention of sars-cov-2 infection in the health care setting at the university of oxford is being planned nct04303507 our patient developed covid-19 infection despite long-term use of hydroxychloroquine her hydroxychloroquine dose was lower compared to any of the proposed dose regimens for covid-19 treatment or prophylaxis however the chronicity of her treatment 3 years would be expected to mitigate this difference considering the long elimination half-life of the drug 30 days in addition to its known intracellular accumulation we would expect the intracellular and extracellular levels of hydroxychloroquine in a patient such as ours taking the medication chronically to be relatively comparable to the minimum desired dose for treating covid-19 the fact that our patient developed the disease in this context raises questions about the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine both as a therapeutic as well as a prophylactic agent 1920 were hydroxychloroquine effective as prophylaxis one might expect only mild asymptomatic infection not requiring hospitalization a critical need exists for further investigation of hydroxychloroquine and other chloroquine derivatives not only as treatment for covid-19 disease but also as preventive therapy further the effects of potential confounding factors like age comorbidities underlying autoimmune disease and clinical stage of covid-19 disease are yet to be determined more data from larger randomized clinical trials is necessary in order to elucidate these questions we thank the reviewer of idcases for their careful review of the

syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is an enveloped non-segmented positive-sense rna virus belonging to the beta-coronaviridae family1 covid-19 has been found to be the cause of severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards with a significantly high mortality rate2 according to the world health organization there are 207855 confirmed cases and 8648 deaths from covid-19 as of march 19 2020 and rapidly increasing3 originating from bats like other virulent coronavirus cov strains such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov covid-19 has become the focus of the medical world and the pandemic of 202014 we present a case of elderly female presenting with fever cough and shortness of breath found to be positive for covid-19 and started on high-dose iv ascorbic acid anti-interleukin-6 hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir requiring high ventilator settings and eventually requiring vasopressors and continuous veno-venous hemodialysis cvvhd a 77-year-old middle-eastern female with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency department ed from a day care facility apartment where 2 people at the facility have tested positive for covid-19 but she did not have any direct contact with these individuals about 5 days before admission the patient developed a fever with a temperature of 102f at home and went to her primary medical doctor who sent her to the ed in the ed she was found to have bilateral opacities on chest x-ray and had continued intermittent fevers with generalized weakness cough lethargy and dyspnea and was sent for testing for covid-19 then transferred to our facility for further management in our facility her temperature was 1017f blood pressure 14876 mm hg heart rate of 99 beats per minute respiratory rate of 18 per minute and oxygen saturation of 93 on room air physical exam was significant for a dry cough and bilateral rales on auscultation of the lung fields bilaterally but was unremarkable otherwise a chest x-ray fig 1 was performed showing bilateral opacities throughout the lung fields with predominance of the lower lung lobes she was admitted for possible pneumonia with isolation precautions for suspected covid-19 and was started on oxygen via nasal cannula and on 1-gram ceftazidime intravenously every 8 hours and 500 mg azithromycin orally daily ct scan of the chest fig 2 was performed showing bilateral ground glass appearance throughout the lung with predominance in the peripheral lower lobes respiratory viral panel was sent including a repeat covid-19 test table 1 all results came back negative however the patients condition deteriorated 2 days after admission to our facility and she became hypoxic to 85 oxygen saturation while on nasal cannula and remained spiking fevers up to 1034f she was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit icu for further management and was switched to ceftriaxone 1 g intravenously daily and azithromycin 500 mg via orogastric tube daily and was started on hydroxychloroquine 400 mg loading dose followed by 200 mg twice daily for a 7-day course she required 100 fraction of inspired oxygen fio2 and a positive end-expiratory pressure peep of 12 to maintain an oxygen saturation of 90 12 hours later the covid-19 test from the initial facility returned positive results on day 3 of hospitalization she was started on 6 g of iv ascorbic acid twice daily and given one dose of 8 mg per kg 567 mg of tocilizumab an anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody due to a shortage of vitamin c in the hospital her dose was decreased to 1 g iv daily on the 6th day of hospitalization and she was given another dose of tocilizumab on day 7 her peep increased from 12 to 16 due to worsening oxygen saturation and increased requirement despite 100 fio2 due to severe ards the decision was made to prone the patient for 18 hours a day she completed her course of antibiotics and hydroxychloroquine but remained on vitamin c and zinc approval for remdesivir was obtained from gilead sciences inc and she was given a loading dose of 200 mg on day 10 and due to worsening oxygen saturation her peep was again increased to 18 on day 11 the patient was unable to tolerate being prone due to significant desaturation to 65 on pulse oximetry and remained supine she eventually required levophed for maintenance of hemodynamic stability and her creatinine increased from her baseline of 05-06 since admission until day 10 to 265 on day 12 for this reason remdesivir was discontinued and nephrology was consulted and recommended cvvhd on day 13 on day 14 her peep requirement again increased to 20 while on 100 fio2 to maintain an oxygen saturation 90 her condition remained critical while being aggressively managed in the icu and ultimately the patients family decision was to pursue comfort measures and the patient passed away covid-19 is the cause of severe viral pneumonia rapidly leading to ards in a case series of 135 patients wan et al reported 889 of patients presented with a fever and 765 had a cough5 fatigue and myalgias 325 headache 177 and dyspnea 133 were less commonly reported5 these symptoms were also found on presentation with our patient while the covid-19 tests were pending the ct scan of the chest provided valuable information as it met the trend of findings in infected patients wan et al obtained ct scans on all patients in their study and found bilateral involvement and multiple patchy or ground glass appearance to be the primary finding5 huang et al found similar findings where 98 of ct scans obtained had bilateral involvement and multilobular consolidations6 these findings on ct scans are not unusual for a viral pneumonia influenza a h1n1 was first found to cause a pandemic in 2009 a retrospective review of 92 patients by rtk et al found 696 of patients with h1n1 had bilateral patchy pneumonic infiltrates and 413 had bilateral ground glass opacities7 while the lack of rapid testing for covid-19 has caused a delay in diagnosis perhaps the use of ct scans could provide an increased suspicion of covid-19 infection leading to earlier treatment and management our patient presented in this case received treatment with vitamin c and zinc both of which are known to improve the human immune system and aid in shortening the duration of and improving outcomes in respiratory infections including pneumonia89 in addition to vitamin and mineral supplements hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have obtained a large amount of attention for the treatment of covid-19 hydroxychloroquine a well-known anti-malarial and auto-immune medication is relatively inexpensive and has been extensively studied in the treatment for covid-19 studies have suggested hydroxychloroquine can interfere with glycosylation of the coronavirus receptors and increase endosomal ph thus inhibiting viral fusion and decreasing viral load1011 gautret et al reported a synergistic effect using hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in viral elimination and decreasing viral load12 despite this evidence the use of hydroxychloroquine for viral infections has been questioned roques et al reported a study using chloroquine in chikungunya virus reporting cytokines were reduced causing the adaptive immune response to be delayed exacerbating fever and unchanged suppression of viral load13 while further studies are in need to provide concrete evidence on the use of hydroxychloroquine clinical trials from china have already shown promising results for covid-19 and several countries around the world have begun using these medications tocilizumab a recombinant humanized anti-interleukin-6 receptor monoclonal antibody has been extensively used in auto-immune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis14 with this monoclonal antibody interleukin-6 function is blocked and hence the differentiation of t helper cells and b cells into immunoglobulin-secreting cells are inhibited14 the cytokine storm observed in patients with covid-19 has been difficult to control and manage leading to increased mortality tocilizumab therefore helps decrease the immune response and the resulting damage caused by cytokines615 while still not approved in the united states tocilizumab has thus far shown promising results in clinical trials15 other treatments for covid-19 have also emerged and have thus far shown promising results in ongoing clinical trials of these remdesivir gs-5734 and favipiravir t-705 have become the center of attention remdesivir is an adenosine analog that incorporates into viral rna causing premature termination1014 it has been found effective at inhibiting viral replication in ebola sars-cov and mers-cov infections101617 favipiravir an rna-dependent rna polymerase inhibitor has already obtained approval for the treatment of covid-19 in china on february 15th 202018 studies have shown favipiravir inhibited rna polymerase activity and thus prevented replication of rna viruses like covid-19 with minimal side effects18 remdesivir gs-5734 gilead sciences inc is currently under several clinical trials and all of its side effects have not yet been defined in our patient within 2 days of starting remdesivir our patient had worsening renal function eventually requiring cvvhd and vasopressors thus preventing further treatment with the medication while our patient was critically ill in the icu it is not known if this medication was the cause for further decompensation due to kidney injury further studies and clinical trials are required to fully understand the role of remdesivir and other medications in covid-19 infected patients covid-19 is a serious infection that has led to thousands of cases of severe pneumonia ards and even deaths across the globe as of now there are no approved treatments for this viral pandemic while several medications have shown to be effective in clinical trials further studies are needed to establish dosing treatment course and side effects of these medications as the number of cases and deaths continue to increase in the world the race to develop faster testing modalities to rapidly diagnose and manage these patients earlier continues to be the focus of the global healthcare system conceptualization steven douedi jeffery miskoff writing  original draft steven douedi writing  review  editing steven douedi jeffery miskoff  new insights into the antiviral effects of chloroquine andrea savarino livia di trani isabella donatelli roberto cauda antonio cassone   in a paper published 2 years ago in this journal some of us described the potentially therapeutic benefits of the quinoline antimalarial chloroquine in viral diseases such as hiv-1aids and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars1 chloroquinehydroxychloroquine has since been adopted to treat hiv-1-infected patients in clinical trials and new insights into its antiviral activity have been obtained from in-vitro studies on the hivaids front chloroquine 250 mg twice daily has been administered to hiv-1-infected patients with baseline viral loads over 50 000 copies per ml in combination with lamivudine 150 mg twice daily and hydroxyurea 500 mg twice daily in an ongoing clinical trial in india2 ten out of 18 volunteers had an undetectable viral load at week 242 the median drop in viral load was more than 20 log2 more than the median 15 log drop seen with a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nrti and hydroxyurea alone3
 these results are different from those of another trial in singapore using didanosine 125250 mg twice daily hydroxyurea 500 mg twice daily and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily corresponding to 125 mg of chloroquine1 the median drop in viral load was 13 log similar to that induced by a nrti plus hydroxyurea follow-up of these patients at week 144 suggests that the value of hydroxychloroquine may lie in the maintenance of the effects of didanosinehydroxyurea4
 the discrepancy between the two studies besides differences in the design and patients enrolled probably reflects the different dosages of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine drops in viral load are reported to occur using daily doses of 800 mg of hydroxychloroquine1 corresponding to 500 mg of chloroquine as used in the indian study but not using 250 mg of chloroquine daily5 corresponding to 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine as adopted in the singapore study chloroquinehydroxychloroquine might thus be a valuable option to be tested in low-cost antiretroviral combinations but correct dosages should be used considering that the study participants should be regularly monitored to prevent retinopathy prospective randomised double-blind placebo studies are also needed to assess the contribution of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine as part of an antiretroviral regimen according to new in-vitro results the antiretroviral effects of chloroquine are attributable to the inhibition of viral particle glycosylation6 these effects appeared to be specific since the chloroquine concentrations effective in vitro neither affected any other step in hiv-1 replication nor were cytotoxic6
 our hypothesis that chloroquine might inhibit replication of the sars coronavirus1 has been confirmed in two independent in-vitro studies7 8 researchers at the belgian catholic university of leuven found that chloroquine inhibited sars coronavirus replication with a 50 effective concentration of 88 se 12 moll within the range of blood concentrations achievable during antimalarial treatment7 the dose inducing 50 cytostatic activity was much higher 2613 145 moll time-of-addition experiments indicated that chloroquine affected an early stage of sars coronavirus replication7 researchers at the centers for disease control and prevention atlanta ga usa reported potent anti-sars coronavirus effects of chloroquine in vitro attributable to a deficit in the glycosylation of the sars coronavirus receptor ace28 again the antiviral drug concentrations were not cytotoxic if animal models confirm these results chloroquine might represent a valuable therapeutic option if sars re-emerges the broad spectrum antiviral effects of chloroquine deserve particular attention in a time in which the world is threatened by the possibility of a new influenza pandemic and the availability of effective drugs would be fundamental during evaluation of an effective vaccine the effect of chloroquine against replication of orthomyxoviridae has long been known9 10 inhibitory effects of chloroquine on both type a and b influenza viruses have been described9 10 we are currently investigating the inhibitory effect of chloroquine on the h5n9achickenitaly909797 avian influenza virus recently isolated from poultry in italy11 depending on the viral challenging doses and the methods adopted to detect the antiviral effects the inhibitory concentrations fell within the 0510 moll rangeie clinically achievable in plasma during malaria treatment ldt as id rc and ac unpublished data if these effects are confirmed chloroquine would deserve to be tested against the h5n1 type a avian influenza virus currently a matter of serious concern for public health as discussed above glycosylation inhibition might represent a major mechanism for the antiviral effects of chloroquine suggesting that specific interactions of chloroquine with sugar-modifying enzymes or glycosyltransferases may occur within human cells figure
 chloroquine was recently shown to inhibit quinone reductase 213 a structural neighbour of udp-n-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerases14 which are involved in sialic acid biosynthesis if chloroquine should indeed inhibit the biosynthesis of sialic acid this effect could explain not only the effects of chloroquine on hiv and sars coronavirus sialic acid moieties are present in hiv-1 glycoproteins and sars coronavirus receptor ace2 but also the in-vitro effects on orthomyxoviruses which use sialic acid moieties as receptors15 these effects deserve further investigation in that they may lead to new strategies controlling the replication of several viruses  fact versus science fiction fighting coronavirus disease 2019 requires the wisdom to know the difference nicholas ingraham e christopher tignanelli j   since december 2019 countries have quickly shifted from spectators to victims of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 outbreak the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems and crippled economies around the world including the united states unlike china many countries had time to prepare for their epidemics and as of march 25 remain in the early stages time has allowed the scientific community to bear arms and mount expedited research efforts in unforeseen fashion the collaboration between academic institutions and government agencies is unprecedented and inspiring countless hours and sleepless nights from academics around the world have resulted in a united front to mitigate morbidity and mortality from covid-19 despite these concerted efforts another pandemic in its own right threatens to destroy the meticulously built scientific juggernaut surrounding covid-19 those are alternative facts this commentary uses a recent study of hydroxychloroquine to demonstrate the dire need for randomized clinical trials but more importantly to explore the potential consequences of misinformation how fear fuels its impact and offer guidance to maintain scientific integrity without relinquishing hope chloroquine and its less toxic metabolite hydroxychloroquine are chemotherapeutic agents used to treat malaria 1 chloroquinehydroxychloroquine also inhibits certain inflammatory pathways resulting in the treatment of multiple rheumatological disorders 1 the sars-cov outbreak in 2003 led to yet another therapeutic potential when chloroquine was found to inhibit sars-cov attachment by altering the binding protein and receptor required for entry 2 despite other in vitro studies identifying a potential role in killing infected cells 3 4 in vivo trials have yet to confirm these findings 5 in fact preclinical trials of chloroquine in other viruses dengue fever and chikungunya demonstrated enough promise to warrant further clinical trials however the preclinical effects did not translate to humans 6 7 as of march 25 there remains no randomized control trial in humans with evidence that chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is beneficial in sars-cov or sars-cov-2 to date the only randomized control trial with published data found no benefit viral clearance between the 15 patients treated with chloroquine compared with 15 patients treated with a placebo c jun unpublished observations 2020 although an abstract published online february 19 2020 touts efficacy with chloroquine in 100 patients there remains no publication of these data 8 however a recent nonrandomized observational study by gautret et al 9 found decreased viral load in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine compared with a control group chosen from another hospital these findings are noteworthy for many reasons specifically for reasons not commonly noted the lack of randomization and adjustment in the study by gautret et al 9 introduces selection and confounding bias respectively this alone should temper any interpretation but the more subtle discretion regarding the six excluded patients from the treatment hydroxychloroquine group warrants an equivalent amount of skepticism of these patients one died three clinically deteriorated requiring intensive care admission one withdrew secondary to a drug-related complication and another was lost to follow-up excluding these patients drastically biases the results toward a benefit in fact if included the number needed to harm with hydroxychloroquine is six hydroxychloroquine 192 vs control 0 harm which is arguably of greater clinical significance compared with decreasing unadjusted viral load furthermore the mechanistic primary outcome with an implausible sample size calculation a presumed 50 efficacy creates enough methodological concerns to prevent anything beyond the hypothesis-generating conclusions from this study the limitations stated above are not groundbreaking and were likely appreciated by the regular and seasoned academic readership unfortunately the readership of not only this article but all academic literature has broadened immensely over the past 3 months the world is understandably grasping for a discovery while the scientific community operates under a worldwide microscope in desperate need of a critical appraisal filter despite its methodological limitations and lack of clinical relevance the article by gautret et al 9 continues to trend on social media days after its publication this article and its repercussions reinforce the adage that a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes since its publication prescriptions for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have dramatically increased standard operating procedures have incorporated hydroxychloroquine as a standard of care lethal overdoses have occurred and there are rising concerns that shortages may affect availability for us food and drug administration-approved uses of these medications premature acceptance of efficacy is not new swine flu vaccination 10 or recombinant human activated protein c 11 but it is these prior experiences that influence current standards to require high quality and often multiple randomized control trials to change practice this high bar contributes to the estimated 17 years it can take for best practices to be translated into medical practice 12 this glacial yet safe and meticulous pace is unacceptable in our current crisis lowering the bar and maintaining scientific rigor is possible when the scientific community harmoniously pivots toward a single target remarkably we have succeeded in this movement by coming together as an international community unfortunately unless we maintain the narrative from our scientific surge the bar we have meticulously repositioned may fall quickly to the floor inaccurate facts stem from two levels the ability to identify and suppress both misinformation and disinformation is crucial to maintaining the scientific process misinformation is incorrect or misleading information 13 whereas its more devious counterpart disinformation is false information deliberately and often covertly spread to obscure the truth 14 the example above represents misinformation we can safely assume the differing interpretations occurred unintentionally and we hope to provide guidance for future situations while we await results from randomized clinical trials misinformation occurs to a greater degree during disasters 15 a natural human tendency during a crisis is to find resolution even when it does not exist 16 fear fuels these efforts to dissipate this uncertainty the limitations of the study by gautret et al 9 are not lost on seasoned academic researchers however despite warnings from healthcare leaders and public health agencies there continues to be a premature adoption of hydroxychloroquine as treatment based on limited preclinical data and misinformed interpretation of a nonrandomized study importantly compassionate and well-intentioned healthcare workers are not immune to these tendencies arguably healthcare workers are more vulnerable to misinformation in our current climate as the careful and curious lens previously used to critically appraise the literature is now blurred by their intrinsic passion to do something intentions aside misinformation is a current public health emergency if left unchecked preventable patient morbidity and mortality will occur while simultaneously dismantling the remarkable ongoing efforts to defeat covid-19 there may be a risk to the integrity of not only hydroxychloroquine trials but also other investigational drug trials currently ongoing widespread use and misconception of hydroxychloroquine being a cure may result in reduced enrollment in hydroxychloroquine trials or hesitation to enroll in other drug trials that are not hydroxychloroquine these potential ripple effects from misinformation pose the greatest threat to our ongoing fight against covid-19 merchant and asch 17 layout countermeasures to combat misinformation first it is essential to leverage our position in social media and advocate for transparency table 1 accomplishing this will undoubtedly require a unified effort by the medical community given the majority of social media influence resides outside of healthcare fortunately we can turn to science to provide some insight a recent article in scientific reports analyzed the social media mechanisms associated with social bursts during significant worldly events although the motivation to propagate liking or retweeting a topic is commonly influenced by the users fondness for the topic during significant events the influence is shifted and amplified based on their degree of trust in the source of information 18 we live in a world where an entertainer politician or idols endorsement is echoed to millions in contrast a world-renown scientist or medical provider reaches people on the magnitude of thousands this creates a vacuum of credible medical information as the world looks to the medical community they do so through underutilized mechanisms where our voice is barely a whisper we currently have an ethical responsibility as leaders in our field to be prominent speak out against misinformation and deliver the facts just as we are condensing the timeline for research we must streamline our professional opinions in realtime through social media engagement similarly it is imperative that journals expedite responses to misinformation solicit commentary for controversial topics and deliver a unified message in collaboration with the authors resultantly the scientific community controls the narrative while preserving its veracity this is crucial because if left unchecked the narrative appears increasingly malleable as the virus and fear spread the spotlight is currently on the academic community more than ever we owe it to the research coordinators investigational drug service pharmacists the couriers the project managers the statisticians the trainees performing chart reviews our mentors and our mentees to ensure their unrelenting and ongoing efforts are not in vain equally as important we owe it to our family friends and community to be the beacon of hope while preserving scientific integrity a ts eliot quote 19 was recently reframed to reflect our duty as a scientific community  covid-19 and therapeutic drugs

that chloroquine inhibited covid-19 in in-vitro and this medicine should be assessed in covid-19 patients 12  experts in china suggested that individuals found with mild moderate and severe cases of covid-19 pneumonia and without chloroquine contraindications should be treated with 500 mg chloroquine therapy twice daily for consecutive ten days 7 13  the china national center for biotechnology development recently reported that chloroquine is among the three available medicines with potential activity against the covid-19 initial information from the chinese authorities revealed that almost 100 infected individuals treated with chloroquine experienced a faster decline in fever improved lung computed tomography ct images and required a shorter recovery time compared to control groups with no potential side effects they also recommended the addition of chloroquine in the covid-19 treatment guidelines 13 14  as a result chloroquine is likely the first-line treatment in china and other countries to treat fatal covid-19 although the prolonged usage of chloroquine in malarial treatment demonstrates the safety of acute chloroquine administration in humans moreover we cant neglect the low risk of j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f 5 macular retinopathy which relies on the cumulative dose and the presence of cardiomyopathy as a serious side effect induced by chloroquine 15  currently chloroquine is the medicine of choice among available drugs that can knock the severity of covid-19 till now at least 10 clinical studies are being carried out to investigate chloroquine as an anti covid-19 treatment 7 8  however a survey of adverse effects in patients infected with covid-19 is still needed for a better therapeutic decision hydroxychloroquine a chloroquine analog has both antimalarial and anti-inflammatory activities it is used for the treatment of malaria arthritis rheumatoid porphyria cutanea tarda systemic lupus erythematosus dengue and has somewhat higher potency against the covid-19 16  the safety profile of hydroxychloroquine is better than that of chloroquine during long-term usage and allows a higher daily dose and has fewer concerns about drug-drug interactions 16 17  based on limited anecdotal and in-vitro data hydroxychloroquine is presently suggested for the therapy of covid-19 patients in many nations hydroxychloroquine has well-known safety history with the major concern being cardiotoxic prolonged qt syndrome with prolonged use in individuals with renal or hepatic malfunction and immune suppression however reportedly well tolerated in covid-19 patients 17  hydroxychloroquine has been given to hospital admitted covid-19 patients in several countries because of its wider availability and high in-vitro activity against covid-19 currently hydroxychloroquine is being studied in clinical trials as covid-19 therapy with mild moderate and severe cases 17  according to a recent trial hydroxychloroquine is useful in removing viral nasopharyngeal carriage of covid-19 in a few days less than a week 18  presently no reports from randomized clinical trials rcts are available to update clinical guidance on the usage dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for therapy or prophylaxis of covid-19 the normal dose and duration of hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 therapy is unknown however some us clinicians described anecdotal variations in hydroxychloroquine dosing such as 400 mg bid on day one then daily for 5 days 400 mg bid on day one then 200 mg bid for 4 days 600 mg bid on day one then 400 mg daily on days 2-5 17  on the other hand the china international exchange and promotive association for medical and health care cpam has issued novel guidelines for 2019 covid-19 and recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine orally 400 mg once daily when chloroquine is not available 7  the synergistic effect of the combination of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine was also demonstrated in a recent study 18  azithromycin is active in vitro against ebola 19 and zika 20 viruses and to control severe respiratory infections in patients with viral infection 21  a study revealed that hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin reduced covid-19 rna detection in upper respiratory tract specimens compared to a non-control group 21  azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine are linked with prolong qt and caution is required when using these medicines in individuals with chronic renal failure hepatic patients or those patients who are using medicines that can interact to produce arrhythmias 17  more studies on this combination are required as this combination can both act as an antiviral treatment against covid-19 and control bacterial super-infections 18  concerns were raised with respect to the veracity of the data and analyses conducted by the multinational observational real-world study in patients with covid-19 on the regimen containing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide although several multicentre randomised controlled trials are underway there is an urgent need to provide accurate clinical guidance regarding this regimen 22  lopinavir a type 1 aspartate protease inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus hiv was used in 2003 against sars-cov due to its in-vitro inhibitory activity 23  a combination of ritonavir with lopinavir increases its plasma half-life by inhibiting cytochrome p450 lopinavir has activity against the mers-cov both in vitro 24 and in an animal model 25  the case study indicates that the combination of lopinavir-ritonavir with ribavirin and interferon alfa caused virologic removal 26  chinese guidelines recommended the use of lopinavir-ritonavir tablets 400 mg100 mg orally twice daily in critically ill elderly covid-19 patients 7  however there are no considerable data on the efficacy of this approach in human beings lopinavir-ritonavir has not shown a guarantee for the therapy of covid-19 hospitalized patients with pneumonia in a recently organized randomized controlled open-label clinical trial in china 27  remdesivir is an intravenous investigational drug with strong antiviral activity it has activity against covid-19 and other related beta-coronaviruses this drug is not effective in ebola but in a laboratory study remdesivir can prevent human cells from being infected with covid-19 furthermore findings have identified that remdesivir is highly effective in controlling covid-19 infection in vitro 12  according to the cdc the investigational agent remdesivir is currently being used in covid-19 patients in the us 17  fda grant emergency approval to usage of remdesivir for covid-19 28  however a remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits in adult hospitalized covid-19 patients 29  further confirmatory large multinational studies are needed to evaluate it efficacy and safety in covid-19 patients 29 30  favipiravir fpv is an anti-viral agent that selectively and strongly inhibits rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp viruses favipiravir has anti-viral activity against the influenza virus and welldemonstrated actions against all three influenza a b and c 31  according to a recent experimental study in china fpv has shown substantially improved therapeutic effects on covid-19 in terms of infection progression and viral removal furthermore this research also indicates that the duration of treatment of fpv can be extended if required due to less adverse reactions 32  according to the guardian news report and official at the chinese ministry of science and technology reported that favipiravir has recorded promising results in clinical trials in shenzhen and wuhan involving 340 patients 33  turkey has also begun fpv for covid -19 patients and according to the turkish ministry of health fpv has resulted in improvement in intensive care patients decreasing their time in care from 11-12 days to 4 days 34  according to a randomized clinical trial of favipiravir vs arbidol for covid-19 patients fpv can be considered a preferable therapy due to its higher seven-day clinical recovery rate and a more reduction in the incidence of fever and cough except with some antiviral-associated adverse effects 35  favipiravir is also considered to be teratogenic thus if a pregnancy is confirmed or suspected favipiravir administration should be avoided in women 36  however any approval for the use of fpv will of course entail further clinical testing followed by the approval of widespread use by the relevant regulatory body for medical care in each country oseltamivir is an antiviral drug used to treat and prevent influenza in patients aged 1 year and older 37  oseltamivir has been recommended for people at high risk of infection before or after pandemic influenza exposure 38  oseltamivir is also used in clinical trials with various combinations of chloroquine and favipiravir 39  further clinical trials and broad randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effective role of oseltamivir in covid-19 patients ribavirin has strong antiviral activity and is used treatment of hepatitis c respiratory syncytial virus rsv infection and certain viral hemorrhagic fever 40  according to the chinese 7th edition guidelines 41 and a review of human case reports in china 42 recommended the combination of ribavirin with lopinavirritonavir and pegylated interferon and reported that it is effective in viral clearance in covid-19 patients sofosbuvir is also an approved fda drug it acts as a nucleotide polymerase inhibitor and used for the treatment of the hepatitis c virus hcv 43  this drug has previously been used for the treatment of the zika virus 44  it has been used in combination with interferon or ribavirin 45  sofosbuvir-based regimens used for treating chronic hcv infection are considered safe with minimal adverse effects on the respiratory system a recent research indicates sofosbuvirs efficacy as a potent drug against the newly developed covid-19 43  however in covid-19 greater multicenter studies are needed for further evaluation ivermectin is a broad-spectrum antiparasitic agent approved by the fda that has anti-viral activity against a wide variety of viruses 46  it has been demonstrated to limit infection by rna viruses and also effective against the dna pseudorabies virus prv according to a recent report ivermectin may be a useful antiviral to reduce covid-19 47  ivermectin has a safety profile established for human use and previous analysis shows that high-dose ivermectin has comparable safety to standard low-dose treatment although there is not enough evidence to conclude the safety profile in pregnancy 48  a critical next step in further assessment for the potential benefit of covid-19 patients will be the examination of a multiple additional dosing regimen that mimics the current approved human use of ivermectin however the known safety profile shows that ivermectin is worthy of further consideration as a possible covid-19 therapy 47  interferons ifns are essential components of the innate immune response and the first line of protection against virus infection these are proteins in nature and derive their name from the word interfere as they interfere with viruses and prevent them from multiplying 49  ifns used to treat hepatitis c virus hcv infection numerous malignancies multiple sclerosis hiv and aids 50  the antiviral drug interferon alfa-2b is produced in china and is confirmed to have been effective in the treatment of hiv human papillomavirus hepatitis b and c according to studies this medicine is useful in the treatment of viruses with characteristics identical to the novel coronavirus the united kingdom biotech company synairgen has been approved for a fast-track trial of ifn-alfa-2b in covid-19 patients it is hoped that the administration of ifn-alfa-2b will enhance the bodys ability to fight the virus the who has described it as the only drug in phase 2 trials that can be inhaled which means that patients can administer it themselves through a small nebulizer powered by a battery 51  however the effectiveness of interferon therapy in covid- 19 has not yet been scientifically proved receptor that is mainly used in the treatment of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis sjia polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis pjia and rheumatoid arthritis 52  recently the fda has approved a study to evaluate the use of tocilizumab in covid-19 patients 53  details on the prior use mechanism of action and adverse effects of some repurposed drugs that may treat covid-19 are discussed in table i  anticoagulants are the main treatment used to prevent and treat thrombosis unfractionated heparin ufh and low molecular weight heparin lmwh are the favored anticoagulants in acute thrombosis due to their rapid antithrombotic activity 54  severe covid-19 coagulopathy is usually problematic and is associated with high mortality 55  the risk of venous thromboembolism vte in severe covid-19 patients is also increased due to the evidence of viral infection respiratory dysfunction and long-term bed rest in severe covid-19 patients treatment with anticoagulants such as heparin can help in reducing the pulmonary coagulopathy and venous thromboembolism 55  it is documented that lmwh improves coagulation dysfunction in covid-19 patients and exerts anti-inflammatory effects by reducing interleukin 6 il-6 and increase the percentage of lymphocytes it would also seem that lmwh may be used as a possible therapeutic drug for covid-19 56  however further studies are required to confirm and validate its efficacy and safety profile 55  the ibuprofen a painkiller is a common alternative for people with headaches and fevers two of the novel coronavirus symptoms however amid the growing covid-19 pandemic situation french health minister olivier vran called on social media to warn patients not to take antiinflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen or cortisone because they may worsen the disease and should rely on paracetamol 57  additionally according to a recently published letter in a medical journal hypostasized that ibuprofen may increase the levels of an enzyme called angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 which ultimately increases the severity of covid-19 the ace2 enzyme is increased in people with diabetes and also in those who received some hypertension therapy 58  however there is presently no scientific proofs to establish a connection between ibuprofen and the worsening of covid-19 later on 19 march 2020 the who states that they do not suggest against the use of ibuprofen 59 more evidence is therefore needed to explore this issue paracetamol is also known as acetaminophen and is used in the treatment of fever and pain it is typically used for mild to moderate relief of pain few health care professionals suggest first-line use of paracetamol over ibuprofen 60  the who does not oppose the use of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids such as ibuprofen for symptoms 59 and the fda describes that there is presently no evidence that covid-19 symptoms worsen with nsaids 61 the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ace inhibitor and angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs are used mainly for the treatment of high blood pressure and heart failure some scientists are hoping that these drugs may be beneficial for patients with covid-19 the university of minnesota has performed two clinical trials using the inexpensive generic losartan drug the trials will assess and explain whether losartan can prevent multi-organ failure and control prolonged hospitalization in covid-19 patients with pneumonia 62  losartan works by blocking the receptor or gateway to the cells which are used by the chemical called angiotensin ii to penetrate the cells and raise blood pressure covid-19 binds to the receptor of angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 and it may be assumed that because losartan can block these receptors it can prevent the virus from infecting cells the recently published study raised complicating issues and mentioned the possibility that specific hypertension drugs ace inhibitors and arbs specifically losartan may cause the body to generate more ace2 and thus increase the ability of the virus to infiltrate cells 58  furthermore a recent analysis of 355 covid-19 patients in italy found that hypertension existed in three-quarters of the patients who died and suggested that this was one of the reasons for their increased sensitivity 63  although theoretical questions about ace inhibitors arbs and ibuprofen have been raised but there is no convincing evidence that either ace inhibitors arbs or ibuprofen facilitate or worsen covid-19 infection in any type of patient 64  corticosteroid medication used to suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation these are not recommended for covid-19 until the disease is complicated 65  ozone is considered a natural killer of viruses and has been widely used by people for disinfection sterilization deodorization detoxification and bleaching for more than 100 years ozone kills viruses by disseminating the protein coat into the nucleic acid core and causing viral rna damage at higher concentrations ozone destroys the capsid or outer protein layer and damages either the microorganisms dna or rna virusbacteria structure 66  ozone has three main attributes such as full coverage reach to every corner of the environment high detergency with no toxic residues convenience produced by simple equipment ozone should be adopted as a weapon in the global fight against covid-19 due to the above-mentioned features 67  plants are not only essential for food but also as medicinal products knowing the pathways of secondary metabolite synthesis are also essential for the production of plant drug products 71  until now it is still unclear which drug can successfully fight against the disease while studies are underway and different countries try different combinations to treat their patients it is too early to be sure about them as safe treatments and studies appear to indicate some troubling side effects there are currently no complete data available from large rcts to provide clinical advice on the use dosing or duration to validate the effective role safety profile and adverse effects of all of the above-mentioned drugs for prophylaxis or treatment of covid-19 there is a desperate need for new drugs to treat covid-19 and meanwhile scientists are working hard to develop effective treatments however a lot of work needs to be done to achieve a better treatment outcome and it will take some time to establish the complete safety and efficacy of the trial drugs therefore further clinical studies and large randomized control studies are needed for the better treatment option and safety of

hydroxychloroquine a familiar agent to combat the pandemic of covid-19 vasilios polymeropoulos m   the novel coronavirus covid-19 has taken the world by storm causing widespread quarantines and lockdowns of entire nations actions not seen in over a century since the 1918 spanish influenza the natural defense against an infectious pathogen is to avoid contracting the pathogen altogether through quarantine a practice employed since antiquity 1 as world leaders allude to the promise of vaccines in a brief time period and the development of novel agents for treatment perhaps we should examine whether already existing therapeutics are effective in treating people affected with covid-19 researchers in china the nation first affected by covid-19 expeditiously assessed the potential use of already existing compounds in treating covid-19 hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine non-hydroxylated compound have demonstrated effective control of infection with covid-19 in vitro 2 hydroxychloroquine demonstrated comparable efficacy to chloroquine when used as a treatment against sars-cov-2 infection in vitro and in vero cells and was superior to chloroquine when used as pre-treatment prophylaxis 3 impressive in vitro results conducted and published in rapid timeframes have sparked interest into the use of these compounds in the fight against covid-19 infection igniting a wave of international clinical trials and leading to the adoption of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine into national guidelines in several countries including china korea and poland for the treatment of covid-19 4 the potential use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as an antiviral is not a novel concept chloroquine has demonstrated efficacy against sars-cov in vitro against avian influenza a h5n1 in mice and against human coronavirus oc43 in newborn mice 57 demonstrated long before the emergence of the novel sars-cov-2 although hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have demonstrated therapeutic antiviral potential in these models the efficacy of these compounds as antivirals in large controlled clinical studies in humans has yet to be demonstrated clinical evidence is now mounting as evidenced in a recent clinical study in february 2020 where gao and colleagues published an interim report from clinical trials describing that chloroquine has demonstrated superior efficacy in the treatment of covid-19 infection as seen in multiple disease parameters in humans leading to a recommendation of its widespread use 8 this report noted significant improvements of chloroquine improving disease parameters including time to seronegative conversion and shortening of disease though the magnitude of these effects has yet to be published a clinical trial recently published from marseille found hydroxychloroquine to be superior to standard of care in eradication of the virus 9 this study had limitations including a small size a lack of reporting of clinical assessments and open-label enrollment 9 the results remain promising and are consistent with previous research these studies are complemented by recent additional reports of encouraging results with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in news outlets given that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are among the most widely prescribed medications in the world we can be generally confident about their safety of course with any therapeutic agent there are always risks of adverse effects and thus the risks and benefits of treatment as always need to be determined on an individual basis risks of treatment with hydroxychloroquine include retinal damage associated with long term use and qt prolongation hydroxychloroquine is contraindicated in people with a history of hypersensitivity to 4-aminoquinoline compounds and should be used with caution in people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency 10 recommended dosing regimens from recent literature national guidelines and individual hospital guidelines for covid-19 have been similar to those currently used for malaria 3 8 given that hydroxychloroquine has demonstrated superior efficacy in vitro for the prevention of infection it should be considered as a first-line agent against covid-19 infection over chloroquine hydroxychloroquine should be utilized given the low risks associated with treatment and be further explored as a therapeutic agent at a dose of 400 mg orally per day in addition to larger clinical studies to evaluate therapeutic efficacy in the setting of active infection of particular interest would be further studies examining the utility of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis against covid-19 at a weekly dose of 400 mg orally given the long half-life over 40 days its previous utility as a prophylactic agent against malaria infections and promising in vitro results 3 11 despite limited clinical data hydroxychloroquine taken at 400 mg orally per day during active infection may offer an avenue of infection control and treatment of affected individuals in a time of rapid need for therapeutic options perhaps the answer to this once in a lifetime pandemic can be found from a dependable

sars-cov-2 emerged in december 2019 causing the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic currently there are a lack of evidence-based therapies to prevent covid-19 following exposure or to prevent worsening of symptoms following confirmed infection we describe the design of a clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine for post-exposure prophylaxis and pre-emptive therapy for covid-19 we will conduct two nested multicenter international double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine for 1 post-exposure prophylaxis pep of asymptomatic household contacts or healthcare workers exposed to covid-19 within the past four days and 2 pre-emptive therapy pet for symptomatic outpatients with covid-19 with a total symptom duration of less than 4 days we will recruit 1500 patients for each the pep and pet trials participants will be randomized 11 to receive 5 days of hydroxychloroquine or placebo the primary pep trial outcome will be the incidence of symptomatic covid-19 disease the primary pet trial outcome will be an ordinal scale of disease severity not hospitalized hospitalized without intensive care hospitalization with intensive care or death participant screening informed consent and follow up will be exclusively internet-based with appropriate regulatory and research ethics board approvals in canada and the united states discussion these complementary randomized control trials are innovatively designed and adequately powered to rapidly answer urgent questions regarding the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine to reduce transmission and disease severity of covid-19 during a pandemic in-person participant follow-up will not be conducted in order to facilitate social distancing strategies and reduce risks of exposure to study personnel innovative trial approaches are needed to urgently assess therapeutic options to mitigate the global impact of this pandemic trials registration clinicaltrialsgov nct04308668  syndrome-related coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 1 the virus was first recognized in wuhan china in december 2019 and quickly spread globally leading to a pandemic 2 currently the standard of care in most jurisdictions for those with mild to moderate covid-19 includes selfobservation and self-quarantine for 7-14 days 3 4 while some small studies 5 6 7 8 with methodologic limitations have suggested certain therapies may have promise at the time of this publication no proven effective therapies exist most major national and international guidelines have yet to incorporate pharmacologic therapies for covid-19 due to a lack of high grade evidence 9 10 an effective post-exposure prophylaxis or pre-emptive therapeutic intervention would provide significant benefit to individuals as well as to public health given the high rate of sars-cov-2 transmission and overburdened healthcare systems the onset of symptoms from covid-19 generally develops an average of 4-5 days after exposure to sars-cov-2 11 the incubation period ranges between 1-14 days 12 the majority 80 of people with covid-19 exhibit mild symptoms and recover spontaneously 13 however 14 of patients develop hypoxemia requiring hospitalization admission to the intensive care unit icu andor invasive ventilation 14 of those who are hospitalized in north america approximately 30 of individuals will develop respiratory failure shock andor multiple organ system dysfunction requiring an admission to a critical care unit 15 sars-cov-2 has demonstrated rapid spread through the population with a basic reproductive value r 0  value of 2 to 57 16 17 the secondary attack rate among household contacts has been estimated at 10 95 ci 2 to 31 18 but estimates are largely based on monitoring of travelassociated covid-19 cases in the context of community transmission the secondary attack rate may be much higher 35 95 ci 27 to 44 19 in the absence of appropriate distancing strategies secondary attack rates may be

replication against coronaviruses 20 one agent chloroquine has been shown to be effective at reducing laboratory established infection and spread to adjacent cells from sars-cov 21 more recently the related drug hydroxychloroquine was found to prevent sars-cov-2 viral replication before and after infection of vero cell lines 22 the exact anti-viral mechanism of hydroxychloroquine against sars-cov-2 is incompletely understood but may relate to impaired angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ace2 receptor binding and resultant cell entry as well as the suppression of cytokine storm 23 recent

need for the rigorous evaluation of hydroxychloroquine as a therapeutic option against this innovative trial is adequately powered to rapidly answer urgent questions regarding the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and its ability to prevent or reduce the severity of covid-19 the novel web-based design of this trial in the setting of a highly contagious global pandemic has ensured that all interactions with participants including enrollment and informed consent are done remotely using courier services for medicine delivery and internet-based follow-up this will allow compliance with strict social distancing strategies and reduce risks of infectious spread to study personnel and others the design encourages large scale enrollment for rapid achievement of enrollment target and trial results importantly the design was finalized regulatory and reb approvals were obtained and large geographic jurisdictions brought online in an unprecedently short duration within a few weeks of a global pandemic with a goal to obtain the maximal information in the minimal amount of time recently several public figures have promoted the widespread use of hydroxychloroquine in the absence of

this will support a new therapeutic option to mitigate the global spread and impact of covid-19 if a null or negative effect is shown this will reduce the risk of harm to future patients reduce health care expenditures on ineffective medications and protect the drug supply for patients with previously established indications for hydroxychloroquine the results of this trial will be instrumental in

found that hydroxychloroquine application is significantly associated with a decreased mortality in critically ill patients with covid-19 and lower level of il-6 one of most inflammatory cytokines we also found that the length of hospital stay in the hydroxychloroquine-treated non-survivors is longer than in non-hydroxychloroquine-treated non-survivors suggesting that hydroxychloroquine could prolong the lifetime of critically ill patients even if their lives were eventually lost which further supports that hydroxychloroquine has therapeutic effects for critically ill patients of covid-19 importantly we found that the role that hydroxychloroquine application associated with a decreased plasma il-6 level is highly consistent with the duration of its administration and once the drug stops plasma il-6 level rises up to control level we have noted that hydroxychloroquine has in vitro antiviral effects on several viruses including sars and sars-cov-2 7-10  which may contribute directly to its therapeutic effect to covid-19 patients however the anti-sars-cov2 action of chloroquine does not seems to account for the significant efficiency to critically ill patients in our cohort covid-19 patients displayed obvious immunity disorders showing marked reduction in lymphocyte numbers in peripheral blood and lymphatic tissues but huge amount of lymphocyte infiltration in lungs as well as in other critical organs such as heart many patients showed symptoms of cytokine storm with markedly-elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokine il-6 suggesting overactivated immune responses 11  anti-il-6 antibody tocilizumab has been been shown to be an effective treatment option for covid-19 patients with a risk of cytokine storms 12 in this study we demonstrate that hydroxychloroquine can mimic the effect of anti-il-6 antibody by observing decreased levels of il-6 in the critically ill covid-19 patients after all rights reserved no reuse allowed without

of lysosomal-autophagy pathways 14 additionally a decreased plasma il-6 level after hydroxychloroquine use is highly consistent with its application period and after stopped its role disappear and il-6 level increases to the level of non-hydroxychloroquine patients this finding indicates that we need to adjust our treatment regimen that is to keep use hydroxychloroquine until patients are completely cured in summary this retrospective study demonstrates that hydroxychloroquine application is associated with a decreased risk of death in critically ill covid-19 patients without obvious toxicity and its mechanisms of action is probably mediated through its inhibition of inflammatory cytokine storm on top of its ability in inhibiting viral replication therefore hydroxychloroquine

tarek andrea savarino  chloroquinehydroxychloroquine has recently been the subject of intense debate in regard to its potential antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 the etiological agent of covid-19 some report possible curative effects others do not in order to shed some light on this rather controversial topic we used mathematical modelling to simulate possible scenarios of response to hydroxychloroquine in covid-19 patients our computer-aided simulations show that hydroxychloroquine may have an impact on the amplitude of the viral load peak but that viral clearance is not significantly accelerated if the drug is not administered early enough ie when viral loads range from 1 to 1000 copiesml although some authors had used the trough plasma concentrations or the theoretical drug distribution in the lung to model the effect of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine on covid-19 the theoretical drug response based on the trough whole blood concentrations of the drug agreed well with the results of the clinical trials so far reported moreover the effects of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine could be fully explained when taking into account also the capacity of this drug to raise cell-mediated responses against the productively sars-cov-2-infected cells on the whole the present study suggests that chloroquinehydroxychloroquine has a narrow therapeutic window which overlaps with the highest tolerated doses these considerations may have implications for development of anti-covid-19 combination therapies and prevention strategies  chloroquine and its hydroxy-analog hydroxychloroquine was first proposed in 2003 for treatment of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 1 and due to its promising in-vitro effects 2  was then repurposed as a drug for treatment of covid-19 as clinical trials in covid-19 have so far produced mixed results further study on the interaction of this drug with the virushost dynamics in vivo is necessary in order to provide insight into the optimal timing of administration and association with other interventions however after many decades of clinical use of hydroxychloroquine part of its pharmacokinetics is still unknown and a number of studies still rely on the drug plasma concentrations 3  which are not an optimal indicator of the biodistribution of this drug which is a weak base that becomes readily entrapped in intracellular acidic organelles due to the henderson-hasselbach law 1  a recent advancement likely to shed more light in the interplay of sars-cov-2 with antiviral drugs has been the availability of a mathematical model able to simulate the virushost interplay and matching clinical observations 4  similar models developed by some of the authors of that study had proven able to simulate the viral dynamics in hivaids providing important therapeutic hints 5 6  in the present paper we use this model to simulate possible scenarios of response to hydroxychloroquine in covid-19 patients in the present paper we used the system of differential equations built by gonalves et al 4  as follows these are ordinary differential equations describing the viral dynamics in a model of target cell population with an eclipse phase accounting for antiviral effectiveness of chloroquine against viral reproduction and target cell populations t represents the target cells assumed to be 410 8 7 based on an assumption of 30 ml nasopharyngeal volume 8 that maintain a cellular concentration of 133  10 7 cellsml 4 which become infected with a constant parameter  which changes according

were 135 d -1 to allow prediction of intervention timing effect on viral propagation where releasing virions is controlled by constant parameter p which changes according to a constant parameter 1-

the simulation of   156 with a starting viral load of 10 5 copiesml is not provided as considered to be unrealistic using the system of differential equations developed by gonalves et al 4  we showed that hydroxychloroquine may have an impact on the amplitude of the viral load peak the effect on viral clearance is only evident in our simulations of mild viral loads being less pronounced when viral loads are 10 5 viral rna copiesml ie a viral load commonly found in throat swabs during symptomatic disease 13  using the parameters adopted by the authors the model shows that there is an early peak in viral replication followed by a gradual and slow abatement of viral load accompanying consumption of target cells figure 1 and supplemental figures s1 and s2 first row in their treatment simulations gonalves et al 4 concluded that hydroxychloroquine had no sufficient effect on the viral load dynamics because the pharmacokinetic parameter that they used to conduct the simulations was the plasma drug concentration which as mentioned above is unlikely to reflect the biodistribution of this drug in light of the plasma concentrations the in-vivo drug efficacy that they calculated was 33 the second row of figure 1 and supplemental figures s1 and s2 shows our simulations under those conditions when we used the whole blood concentration including the drug compartment entrapped in lysosomes 14  we calculated a drug efficacy of 07 based on the concentration-response curves published by yao et al 15  in this case a more pronounced decrease in the viral peak was observable  figure 1 and supplemental figures s1 and s2 third row another aspect that needs attention is the double mechanism of the antiviral effects of hydroxychloroquine as derived from studies on a huge number of viruses lysosomal entrapment of hydroxychloroquine is highly likely to affect both viral entry simulated by gonalves et al 4  and post-entry stages in cellular organelles such as viral budding and viral particle glycosylation 1 2 not considered in the aforementioned study according to the data of wang et al 2  chloroquine displayed approximately half of its antiviral activity when it was added after virus adsorption onto cells confirming that part of its activity occurs at a post-entry level therefore as we also wanted to estimate the impact of hydroxychloroquine-induced impairment of viral production at times beyond the 48 h period considered to estimate hydroxychloroquine efficacy in vitro 15  we decreased the viral production rate by 35 ie half of the value calculated on the basis of the drug efficacy on the whole viral replicative cycle we obtained a further decrease of viral load at peak and steady-state figure 1 fourth row  the data that we used to estimate the response of sars-cov-2 to hydroxychloroquine were based on the trough blood concentrations provided by morita et al 14  which were based on a drug regimen of 400 mgday gautret et al 3 recently published the trough serum concentrations of hydroxychloroquine obtained from patients with covid-19 and treated with a higher dosage ie 600 mgday of hydroxychloroquine unfortunately no blood concentrations were reported by gautret et al but these could be proportionally derived from the ratios provided by morita et al 14  by maintaining a similar plasmablood concentration ratio this calculation led to a prediction of drug levels in whole blood of 616 m by plotting this value to the dose-response curves published by yao et al 15  we extrapolated an efficacy of 90 we adjusted the viral infection and production accordingly and obtained a further decrease in the viral load peak figure 1 and supplemental figures s1 and s2 fifth row this simulation may also account for hydroxychloroquine administered at 400 mgday in combination with another antiviral agent with moderate potency among the immune-modulating effects of hydroxychloroquine is its capacity to induce antigen cross-presentation and increase the immune cytotoxic response 16 17  enhanced cytotoxic responses result in increased death of the infected cells by increasing the death rate of productively infected cells an effect of cytotoxic immunity by only 3 fold data derived from accapezzato et al 16  we could observe a further decrease in the peak amplitude and a shorter time to viral load exhaustion figure 1 and supplemental figures s1 and s2 sixth row the simulations that we provide confirm current hypotheses that the virologic response to hydroxychloroquine in covid-19 patients has a pharmacokinetic basis and that the drug dosages with an acceptable toxicity profile have a narrow window of overlap with the antiviral effective concentrations these results are in line with previous analyses of hiv clinical trials showing that the dosages adopted safely in the clinic are in the lowest range of the therapeutic window with significant though yet partial effects observable only at the highest doses administered 18  these observations are in line with the clinical data reported so far a small trial in france suggested that hydroxychloroquine helps treat covid-19 3 and a small study from china 19 reported opposite results both studies have their own limitations and very limited statistical power due to the fact that they were prepared during an emergency the discrepancy of the results obtained may reside according to the results of the present study in dosage of hydroxychloroquine adopted with the french study reporting positive results using 600 mgday of hydroxychloroquine and the chinese study being unable to show any efficacy following adoption of a lower dosage 400 mgday furthermore the reported response to hydroxychloroquine in the french study is incomplete and the authors had to add another experimental drug repositioned as an antiviral azithromycin in order to increase efficacy these considerations are in line with the results obtained in randomized clinical trials using chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine at an equivalent dosage superior to that reported in the two aforementioned studies 20 21 22  as the safety margin of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine is narrow 23  administration of higher dosages is unfortunately hampered by toxicity as shown by borba et al 22  although recent data show that the toxicity observed by borba et al could in fact be ascribed by the concomitant administration of azithromycin 24  our results agree in part with the simulations conducted by arnold and buckner 25  showing that only the 600 mgday regimen might have a significant impact on viral replication according to all parameters that they adopted and those of garcia-cremades et al 26  showing that a dosage higher than or equal to 600 mgday is necessary to obtain a sustained remission the approach that we have followed is more conservative than that adopted by arnold and buckner 25  in that we used the whole blood concentrations as a measure of prediction of tissue accumulation rather than the predicted accumulation in the lung according to the model adopted by arnold and buckner 25  the drug lung concentrations are hundreds of times higher than those in plasma and are predicted to reach a concentration able to inhibit 100 percent of sars-cov-2 replication we decided not to follow this prediction because 1 tissue accumulation of hydroxychloroquine in lung is mainly driven by tissue macrophages which are not a main target for the virus 2 according to the data published by yao et al 15  100 per cent of inhibition of coronavirus replication is not reachable experimentally using hydroxychloroquine also smit et al reached similar conclusions based on pharmacokinetic considerations 23  based on our simulations we suggest that chloroquine may not be a silver bullet eradicating covid-19 infection but on the other side it might display some beneficial effects in vivo  our simulations go beyond the other models published indicating that earlier virologic negativization should not be expected when hydroxychloroquine is administered at dosages of 400 mgday but only at dosages of 600 mgday iewithin the narrow therapeutic window instead we believe that the theoretical capacity of hydroxychloroquine to decrease the viral load peak when viral replication is most active deserves attention and further investigation the results of our simulations are in line with those of a recent meta analysis of the so far available clinical data showing that hydroxychloroquine may decrease disease severity but not viral clearance when administered to symptomatic covid-19 patients 27  one limitation of the present study resides in the fact that we only modeled the viral dynamics but not the effects of the molecule on immune mediated mechanisms such as the cytokine storm 1  be that as it may an impact on the immune hyperactivation can in this case be inferred from the estimated potential of the drug to decrease the viral load peak the amplitude of which is associated with deleterious immune hyperactivation in coronavirus infections 1  this hypothesis is in line with the ability of sars-cov-2 to infect cd4 t-cells 28  the target cells of hiv which is characterized by immune hyperactivation as well 18  finally we show that the effect of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine on antigen cross-presentation should be considered cross-presentation is a phenomenon in which a dendritic cell presents the antigen to cd8 t-cells improving their priming activation of cd8 t-cells after priming through antigen recognition can induce the selective killing of the infected cells 16  taking into account this parameter it is possible to predict that hydroxychloroquine may accelerate viral clearance but only when administered early accordingly we did not model a scenario of increased cell-mediated responses when viral loads are higher because immune dysregulation is in this case likely to have taken place enhanced cell-mediated responses may not only induce selective killing of the infected cells but also enhance immunity for better long-term control of the infection hydroxychloroquine is currently being investigated also as a prophylactic agent 29  given the great interest that this strategy has so far evoked in the context of covid-19 30 31  future vaccines against this disease should be considered in co-administration with chloroquinehydroxychloroquine in case chloroquinehydroxychloroquine should prove ineffective in protecting from sars-cov-2 acquisition it is plausible that it may mitigate disease severity by attenuating viral replication  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity which was

shih d heather johnson m dennis maki g charles hennekens h   many issues concerning the prescription of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment and prevention of coronavirus 2019 covid-19 have been addressed in recent peer reviewed publications in high quality journals nonetheless the widespread prescriptions by healthcare providers are 9 times greater than in the last several years1
 perhaps this is due in part to the compassion of healthcare providers to do more good than harm in an ever increasingly alarming pandemic specifically as of may 14 2020 in the united states us there have been over 13 million reported cases and over 84 thousand deaths from covid-19 worldwide the corresponding figures are over 43 million cases and almost 300 thousand deaths thus the us accounts for over 30 of the cases and over 25 of the deaths while comprising only about 45 of the worlds population of further alarm to healthcare providers and patients is that at present even without widespread rapid testing the us has already reported about 4 times the number of cases of any other country in the world and even after adjusting for the population sizes over 46 times the number of deaths of south korea whose first case was reported on the same day as that of the us2
 it is also likely that widespread lay media reports as well as statements by the highest-ranking us government officials have also been a contributing factor on april 4 2020 the president of the united states publicly stated what do you have to lose take it i really think they should take it during the next 24 hours the prescriptions of these drugs by healthcare providers skyrocketed to 46 fold above usual patterns1
 the continued widespread prescriptions by healthcare providers of these drugs for covid-19 in turn are leading to nationwide shortages thus patients with systemic lupus erythematosus sle and rheumatoid arthritis for whom hydroxychloroquine has been an approved indication for decades are unable to refill their prescriptions3
 in this commentary we review the totality of available evidence and conclude that there is an urgent need for a moratorium on the prescription of these drugs in the treatment and prevention of covid-19 when the totality of evidence is incomplete it is appropriate for health care providers to remain uncertain4 nonetheless regulatory authorities are sometimes compelled to act on incomplete evidence on march 28 2020 the us food and drug administration fda issued an emergency use authorization eua for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of covid-19 by april 24 2020 the fda issued a drug safety communication warning about potentially fatal prolongations of the qtc interval detectable on 12 lead electrocardiograms and risks of other serious cardiac arrhythmias thus with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as sometimes is the case the accumulation of further reliable data later did not support the early regulatory action advances in medical knowledge proceed on several fronts optimally simultaneously4 in basic research hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are structurally related and have similar mechanisms to inhibit the virus that causes covid-195 despite their structural similarities in vitro hydroxychloroquine appears to be more effective in addition when used for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis hydroxychloroquine has fewer side effects less drug interactions and is less toxic in overdose at present the available evidence is restricted to 8 published studies 5 on hydroxychloroquine alone 2 on hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin and 1 on both in combination or alone with respect to hypothesis testing only large scale randomized trials can reliably detect the most plausible small to moderate benefits4 of 3 randomized trials all were of inadequate sample size 225 62 and 30 patients and all tested hydroxychloroquine alone versus standard of care in china one showed no significant difference in viral clearance at 28 days the second no difference in viral clearance at 7 days and the third improvements in fever cough and chest computed tomography findings6 7 8
 the chief concern about side effects is prolongation of the qtc interval on the 12 lead electrocardiogram it has long been known that qtc prolongations of 40 milliseconds msec or lesser increases in those with baseline values 500 msec are associated with fatal arrhythmias as regards prescription of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for covid-19 in a case series the qtc interval was increased  40 milliseconds msec in 18 and baseline qtc intervals were  500 msec in 11 and 20 respectively the us fda adverse event reporting system reported similar findings but both lack a comparison group and can formulate not test hypotheses in addition azithromycin has little evidence for benefit when added to hydroxychloroquine but also independently prolongs the qtc interval9
 in summary we recommend that healthcare provider restrict their prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to compassionate use for patients with covid-19 until the results of randomized trials that provide sufficient evidence as regards risks healthcare providers should be aware that the reassuring safety profile of hydroxychloroquine derives from decades of prescriptions for autoimmune diseases which are of greater prevalence in younger and middle age women whose risks of fatal outcomes due to prolongations of the qtc are reassuringly very low in contrast the risks for covid-10 are so much higher because mortality rates are the highest in older patients and those with comorbidities both of whom are predominantly men in conclusion healthcare providers should always prioritize compassion with evolving science and safety data in this context we recommend a moratorium on the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin to treat or prevent covid-19 with the exceptions of obtaining the necessary evidence in randomized trials as well as compassionate use if these drugs need to be prescribed for patients with covid-19 baseline evaluations and serial monitoring are an absolute necessity9 we urge our competent and compassionate healthcare providers to adhere to the first words of the hippocratic oath of primum non nocere

 in an observational comparative study of 181 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pneumonia who require oxygen and were admitted to four french tertiary care centres between 12 march 2020 and 31 march 2020 three patients ages and sexes not stated were described who developed a corrected qt interval prolongation a first degree atrioventricular block or a left bundle branch block during an off-label treatment with hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 pneumonia the patients who had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 pneumonia and required oxygen but not intensive care were initiated on an off-label therapy with oral hydroxychloroquine 600 mgday subsequently one patient developed a corrected qt interval prolongation of 500ms observed on an ecg the second patient developed a first degree atrioventricular block after 2 days of hydroxychloroquine treatment the third patient who had started receiving hydroxychloroquine 5 days after the admission was transferred to intensive care 2 days later and was then prescribed an off-label therapy with ritonavir and lopinavir for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 pneumonia this patient developed a left bundle branch block due to hydroxychloroquine on hospital day 8 not all durations of treatments to reactions onsets stated hydroxychloroquine was stopped in all the 3 patients due to their respective adr outcomes not stated  hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of covid-19 a multinational registry analysis mandeep mehra r sapan desai s frank ruschitzka amit patel n   the absence of an effective treatment against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection has led clinicians to redirect drugs that are known to be effective for other medical conditions to the treatment of covid-19 key among these repurposed therapeutic agents are the antimalarial drug chloroquine and its analogue hydroxychloroquine which is used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis1 2 these drugs have been shown in laboratory conditions to have antiviral properties as well as immunomodulatory effects3 4 however the use of this class of drugs for covid-19 is based on a small number of anecdotal experiences that have shown variable responses in uncontrolled observational analyses and small open-label randomised trials that have largely been inconclusive5 6 the combination of hydroxychloroquine with a second-generation macrolide such as azithromycin or clarithromycin has also been advocated despite limited evidence for its effectiveness7 previous studies have shown that treatment with chloroquine hydroxychloroquine or either drug combined with a macrolide can have the cardiovascular adverse effect of prolongation of the qt interval which could be a mechanism that predisposes to ventricular arrhythmias8 9
 
research in context
evidence before this study
we searched medline via pubmed for articles published up to april 21 2020 using the key words novel coronavirus 2019-ncov covid-19 sars-cov-2 therapy hydroxychloroquine chloroquine and macrolide moreover we screened preprint servers such as medrxiv for relevant articles and consulted the web pages of organisations such as the us national institutes of health and who hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine used with or without a macrolide are widely advocated for treatment of covid-19 based on in-vitro evidence of an antiviral effect against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 their use is based on small uncontrolled studies and in the absence of evidence from randomised controlled trials concerns have been raised that these drugs or their combination with macrolides could result in electrical instability and predispose patients to ventricular arrhythmias whether these drugs improve outcomes or are associated with harm in covid-19 remains unknown
added value of this study
in the absence of reported randomised trials there is an urgent need to evaluate real-world evidence related to outcomes with the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine used with or without macrolides in covid-19 using an international observational registry across six continents we assessed 96 032 patients with covid-19 of whom 14 888 were treated with hydroxychloroquine chloroquine or their combination with a macrolide after controlling for age sex race or ethnicity underlying comorbidities and disease severity at baseline the use of all four regimens was associated with an increased hazard for de-novo ventricular arrythmia and death in hospital this study provides real-world evidence on the use of these therapeutic regimens by including a large number of patients from across the world thus to our knowledge these findings provide the most comprehensive evidence of the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of covid-19
implications of all the available evidence
we found no evidence of benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine when used either alone or with a macrolide previous evidence was derived from either small anecdotal studies or inconclusive small randomised trials our study included a large number of patients across multiple geographic regions and provides the most robust real-world evidence to date on the usefulness of these treatment regimens although observational studies cannot fully account for unmeasured confounding factors our findings suggest not only an absence of therapeutic benefit but also potential harm with the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine drug regimens with or without a macrolide in hospitalised patients with covid-19
 although several multicentre randomised controlled trials are underway there is a pressing need to provide accurate clinical guidance because the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine along with macrolides is widespread often with little regard for potential risk some countries have stockpiled these drugs resulting in a shortage of these medications for those that need them for approved clinical indications10 the purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with a macrolide for treatment of covid-19 using a large multinational registry to assess their real-world application principally we sought to analyse the association between these treatment regimens and in-hospital death secondarily we aimed to evaluate the occurrence of de-novo clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias we did a multinational registry analysis of the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of covid-19 the registry comprised 671 hospitals located in six continents appendix p 3 the surgical outcomes collaborative surgisphere corporation chicago il usa consists of de-identified

generalisable to the larger population the collaborative is compliant with the us agency for healthcare research and quality guidelines for registries with the onset of the covid-19 crisis this registry was used to collect data from hospitals in the usa that are selected to match the epidemiological characteristics of the us population and internationally to achieve representation from diverse populations across six continents data have been collected from a variety of urban and rural hospitals academic or community hospitals and for-profit and non-profit hospitals the data collection and analyses are deemed exempt from ethics review we included all patients hospitalised between dec 20 2019 and april 14 2020 at hospitals participating in the registry and with pcr-confirmed covid-19 infection for whom a clinical outcome of either hospital discharge or death during hospitalisation was recorded a positive laboratory finding for sars-cov-2 was defined as a positive result on high-throughput sequencing or reverse transcription-quantitative pcr assay of nasal or pharyngeal swab specimens and this finding was used for classifying a patient as positive for covid-19 covid-19 was diagnosed at each site on the basis of who guidance11 patients who did not have a record of testing in the database or who had a negative test were not included in the study only one positive test was necessary for the patient to be included in the analysis patients who received either hydroxychloroquine or a chloroquine analogue-based treatment with or without a second-generation macrolide were included in the treatment group patients who received treatment with these regimens starting more than 48 h after covid-19 diagnosis were excluded we also excluded data from patients for whom treatment was initiated while they were on mechanical ventilation or if they were receiving therapy with the antiviral remdesivir these specific exclusion criteria were established to avoid enrolment of patients in whom the treatment might have started at non-uniform times during the course of their covid-19 illness and to exclude individuals for whom the drug regimen might have been used during a critical phase of illness which could skew the interpretation of the results thus we defined four distinct treatment groups in which all patients started therapy within 48 h of an established covid-19 diagnosis chloroquine alone chloroquine with a macrolide hydroxychloroquine alone or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide all other included patients served as the control population patient demographics including age body-mass index bmi sex race or ethnicity and continent of origin were obtained underlying comorbidities based on international classification

at baseline including cardiac medications angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors angiotensin receptor blockers and statins or use of antiviral therapy other than the drug regimens being evaluated the initiation of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine during hospital admission was recorded including the time of initiation the use of second-generation macrolides specifically azithromycin and clarithromycin was similarly recorded a quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment qsofa was calculated for the start of therapy including a scored calculation of the mental status respiratory rate and systolic blood pressure and oxygen saturation spo2 on room air was recorded as measures of disease severity the primary outcome of interest was the association between use of a treatment regimen containing chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without a second-generation macrolide when initiated early after covid-19 diagnosis with the endpoint of in-hospital mortality the secondary outcome of interest was the association between these treatment regimens and the occurrence of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias defined as the first occurrence of a non-sustained at least 6 sec or sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation during hospitalisation we also analysed the rates of progression to mechanical ventilation use and the total and intensive care unit lengths of stay in days for patients in each group for the primary analysis of in-hospital mortality we controlled for confounding factors including demographic variables comorbidities disease severity at presentation and other medication use cardiac medications and other antiviral therapies categorical variables are shown as frequencies and percentages and continuous variables as means with sds comparison of continuous data between groups was done using the unpaired t-test and categorical data were compared using fishers exact test a p value of less than 005 was considered significant multiple imputation for missing values was not possible because for disease and drug variables there were no codes to indicate that data were missing if the patients electronic health record did not include information on a clinical characteristic it was assumed that the characteristic was not present cox proportional hazards regression analysis was done to evaluate the

ventilation or death composite endpoint independence of survival times or time to first arrhythmia for the ventricular arrhythmia analysis was confirmed proportionality between the predictors and the hazard was validated through an evaluation of schoenfeld residuals which found p005 and thus confirmed proportionality to minimise the effect of confounding factors a propensity score matching analysis was done individually for each of the four treatment groups compared with a control group that received no form of that therapy for each treatment group a separate matched control was identified using exact and propensity-score matched criteria with a calliper of 0001 this method was used to provide a close approximation of demographics comorbidities disease severity and baseline medications between patients the propensity score was based on the following variables age bmi gender race or ethnicity comorbidities use of ace inhibitors use of statins use of angiotensin receptor blockers treatment with other antivirals qsofa score of less than 1 and spo2 of less than 94 on room air the patients were well matched with standardised mean difference estimates of less than 10 for all matched parameters additional analyses were done to examine the robustness of the estimates initially obtained individual analyses by continent of origin and sex-adjusted analyses using cox proportional hazards models were performed a tipping-point analysis an analysis that shows the effect size and prevalence of an unmeasured confounder that could shift the upper boundary of the ci towards null was also done all statistical analyses were done with r version 363 and spss version 26 the funder of the study had no role in study design data collection data analysis data

shown in the appendix pp 1518 the results indicated that the associations between the drug regimens and mortality need for mechanical ventilation length of stay and the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias were consistent with the primary analysis a tipping point analysis was done to assess the effects of an unmeasured confounder on the findings of significance with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine appendix pp 1920 for chloroquine hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine with a macrolide a hypothetical unobserved binary confounder with a prevalence of 50 in the exposed population would need to have an hr of 15 to tip this analysis to non-significance at the 5 level for a comparison with the observed confounders in this study if congestive heart failure which has an hr of 1756 were left out of the model it would need to have a prevalence of approximately 30 in the population to lead to confounding in the analysis similarly for hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide a hypothetical unobserved binary confounder with a prevalence of 37 in the exposed population would need to have an hr of 20 to tip this analysis to non-significance at the 5 level again congestive heart failure which has an hr of 1756 would need to have a prevalence of approximately 50 in the population to lead to confounding in the analysis had it not been adjusted for in the cox proportional hazards model in this large multinational real-world analysis we did not observe any benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine when used alone or in combination with a macrolide on in-hospital outcomes when initiated early after diagnosis of covid-19 each of the drug regimens of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with a macrolide was associated with an increased hazard for clinically significant occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias and increased risk of in-hospital death with covid-19 the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in covid-19 is based on widespread publicity of small uncontrolled studies which suggested that the combination of hydroxychloroquine with the macrolide azithromycin was successful in clearing viral replication7 on march 28 2020 the fda issued an emergency use authorisation for these drugs in patients if clinical trial access was unavailable12 other countries such as china have issued guidelines allowing for the use of chloroquine in covid-1913 several countries have been stockpiling the drugs and shortages of them for approved indications such as for autoimmune disease and rheumatoid arthritis have been encountered10 a retrospective observational review of 368 men with covid-19 treated at the us veterans affairs hospitals raised concerns that the use of hydroxychloroquine was associated with a greater hazard of death however the baseline characteristics among the groups analysed were dissimilar and the possibility of bias cannot be ruled out14 another observational study in 181 patients from france reported that the use of hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 600 mg per day was not associated with a measurable clinical benefit in patients with covid-19 pneumonia15 our large-scale international real-world analysis supports the absence of a clinical benefit of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine and points to potential harm in hospitalised patients with covid-19 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are associated with concerns of cardiovascular toxicity particularly because of their known relationship with electrical instability characterised by qt interval prolongation the time taken for ventricular depolarisation and repolarisation this mechanism relates to blockade of the herg potassium channel16 which lengthens ventricular repolarisation and the duration of ventricular action potentials under specific conditions early after-depolarisations can trigger ventricular arrhythmias9 such propensity for arrhythmia provocation is more often seen in individuals with structural cardiovascular disease and cardiac injury has been reported to occur with high frequency during covid-19 illness17 18 furthermore individuals with cardiovascular disease represent a vulnerable population that experience worse outcomes with covid-1919 20 pathological studies have pointed to derangements in the vascular endothelium and a diffuse endotheliitis noted across multiple organs in covid-1921 whether patients with underlying cardiovascular disease and those that experience de-novo cardiovascular injury have a greater predilection to ventricular arrhythmias with chloroquine or its analogues remains uncertain but plausible covid-19 is exemplified by initial viral replication followed by enhanced systemic inflammation22 the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in combination with a macrolide is designed to use their antimicrobial properties in a synergistic manner23 macrolides such as azithromycin and clarithromycin are antibiotics with immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects24 however these drugs prolong the qt interval and increase the risk of sudden cardiac death8 9 in a preliminary analysis borba and colleagues25 reported a double-blind randomised trial with 81 adult patients who were hospitalised with severe covid-19 at a tertiary care facility in brazil this study suggested that a higher dose of chloroquine represented a safety hazard especially when taken concurrently with azithromycin and oseltamivir in another cohort study of 90 patients with covid-19 pneumonia mercuro and colleagues26 found that the concomitant use of a macrolide was associated with a greater change in the corrected qt interval our study did not examine the qt interval but instead directly analysed the risk of clinically significant ventricular arrythmias we showed an independent association of the use of either hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias we also note that the hazard of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias increased when the drugs were used in combination with a macrolide in our analysis which was dominated by patients from north america we noted that higher bmi emerged as a risk marker for worse in-hospital survival obesity is a known risk factor for cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death27 28 the most commonly reported arrhythmias are atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia although age race and bmi were predictive of an increased risk for death with covid-19 in our analysis they were not found to be associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias on our multivariable regression analysis the only variables found to be independently predictive of ventricular arrhythmias were the four treatment regimens along with underlying cardiovascular disease and copd thus the presence of cardiovascular comorbidity in the study population could partially explain the observed risk of increased cardiovascular toxicity with the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine especially when used in combination with macrolides in this investigation consistent with our previous findings in a smaller cohort of 8910 patients20 we found that women and patients being treated with ace inhibitors but not angiotensin receptor blockers or statins had lower mortality with covid-19 these findings imply that drugs that stabilise cardiovascular function and improve endothelial cell dysfunction might improve prognosis independent of the use of cardiotoxic drug combinations21
 our study has several limitations the association of decreased survival with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine treatment regimens should be interpreted cautiously due to the observational study design we cannot exclude the possibility of unmeasured confounding factors although we have reassuringly noted consistency between the primary analysis and the propensity score matched analyses nevertheless a cause-and-effect relationship between drug therapy and survival should not be inferred these data do not apply to the use of any treatment regimen used in the ambulatory out-of-hospital setting randomised clinical trials will be required before any conclusion can be reached regarding benefit or harm of these agents in covid-19 patients we also note that although we evaluated the relationship of the drug treatment regimens with the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias we did not measure qt intervals nor did we stratify the arrhythmia pattern such as torsade de pointes we also did not establish if the association of increased risk of in-hospital death with use of the drug regimens is linked directly to their cardiovascular risk nor did we conduct a drug dose-response analysis of the observed risks even if these limitations suggest a conservative interpretation of the findings we believe that the absence of any observed benefit could still represent a reasonable explanation in summary this multinational observational real-world study of patients with covid-19 requiring hospitalisation found that the use of a regimen containing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide was associated with no evidence of benefit but instead was associated with an increase in the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and a greater hazard for in-hospital death with covid-19 these findings suggest that these drug regimens should not be used outside of clinical trials and urgent confirmation from randomised clinical trials is needed  natural history of covid-19 and current knowledge on treatment therapeutic options wagner dos santos gouvea   coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 was declared as pandemic by the world health organization on march 11th 2020 mainly due to the speed and scale of the transmission of the disease 1 before that it started as an epidemic in mainland china with the focus being firstly reported in the city of wuhan hubei province in february 26th 234 the etiologic agent of covid-19 was isolated and identified as a novel coronavirus initially designated as 2019-ncov 5 later the virus genome was sequenced 6 and because it was genetically related to the coronavirus outbreak responsible for the sars outbreak of 2003 the virus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 by the international committee for taxonomy of viruses 78 the origin and source of the sars-cov-2 remains unknown although the initial cases have been associated with the huanan south china seafood market where snakes birds and other animals such as bats were sold considering that many of the early patients worked in or visited the market in contrast to the exported cases it was suggested either a human to human transmission or a more widespread animal source 9 a suspected bat origin was suggested after 96 genome sequence identity was demonstrated between sars-cov-2 and another coronavirus named bat-cov-ratg13 isolated from bat species which colonized a province nearly 2000 km away from wuhan 610 pangolins were also suggested as natural host of coronaviruses 1112 however evidence of human to human transmission became strongly supported on january 22nd 2020 after a visit conducted by a who delegation to the city of wuhan 13 since the first outbreak recognized in february 2020 the disease spread rapidly around the world according to the european centre for disease prevention and control as of 17th of june 2020 8142129 cases of covid-19 and 443488 deaths have been reported worldwide since 31st december 2019 american continent was among the ones with highest number of cases 3987543 with united states and brazil the leading countries 2137731 and 923189 respectively several sars-cov-2 samples have been isolated from different people and genomic sequences have been available aiming to better understand the virus and to provide information for the development of diagnostic tools and a potential vaccine to date more than 42000 sars-cov-2 rna genomes have been uploaded in the global initiative on sharing all influenza data known as gisaid 14 sars-cov-2 belongs to the beta subgrouping of the coronaviridae family and are enveloped virus containing a positive-sense single- stranded rna with 29891 bases of size 1516 the genome encodes for 29 proteins involved in the infection replication and virion assembly process like other coronaviruses they are characterized by the presence of crown-like spikes on their surface 17 the spike s protein from sars-cov-2 contains a receptor binding domain rbd that binds the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 and thereby promotes membrane fusion and uptake of the virus into human cells by endocytosis 1819 the rbd present in the spike protein is the most variable region of the coronavirus genome 620 structural and biochemical studies have suggested that rbd from sars-cov-2 binds with high affinity to ace2 compared to other sars-cov viruses 212223 however the human ace2 protein variability may also be a factor for the high binding affinity 21 sars-cov-2 can be transmitted human to human by respiratory droplets close contact with diseased patients and possibly by fecal-oral and aerosol contact 242526 it was recently shown that airborne transmission is highly virulent and represents the dominant route to spread the disease 27 this finding was obtained based on the analysis of the trend and mitigation measures in three different cities considered epicenters of covid-19 wuhan china italy and new york city in the period from january 23 to may 9 2020 importantly this result reveals that among the adopted mitigation measures such as social distancing and wearing of masks the difference with and without mandated face covering represents the determinant in shaping the trends of the pandemic and spread of the disease majority of sars-cov-2 infected individuals 80 are asymptomatic or present mild symptoms most likely due to a good immune response able to control the advance of the disease 2829 there is evidence that these asymptomatic people can infect others with sars-cov-2 3031 in the other hand symptomatic individuals may evolve to more severe symptoms and eventual death the best way to prevent transmission and illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus therefore some recommendations include wash hands often avoid close contact cover mouth and nose with a mask cover coughs and sneezes and clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily 32 in this regard wearing of face masks in public corresponds to the most effective means to prevent interhuman transmission 27 fig 1
 upon cell contact the virus can enter the cells in two ways either via endosomes or plasma membrane fusion in both ways spike proteins s1 e s2 from sars-cov-2 mediate attachment to the cell membrane by binding to the ace2 as the entry receptor 33 on the other hand virions are taken up into endosomes spike proteins are activated by cathepsin l or alternatively by transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 in close proximity to ace2 receptor which initiates fusion of the viral membrane with the plasma membrane the latter mechanism is less likely to trigger an antiviral immune response and is more efficient for viral replication 34 once inside the cell viral rna is released and polyproteins are translated coronavirus genomic rna encodes nonstructural proteins ns that play a critical role in viral rna synthesis and structural proteins which are important for new virion assembly first ns proteins 1a and 1ab are translated and cleaved by the papain-like protease pipro and 3c-like protease 3clpro to form functional ns proteins such as helicase or rna-dependent rna polymerase complex rdrp structural proteins s1 s2 envelope e membrane m are translated by ribosomes bound to the endoplasmic reticulum er and presented on its surface as a preparation of virion assembly the nucleocapsids n remain in the cytoplasm and are assembled together with the genomic rna the virion precursor is then transported from the er through the golgi apparatus to the cell surface via vesicles finally virions are released from the infected cell through exocytosis and a new replication cycle begins 1535 fig 2
 symptoms and signs associated with viral pneumonia such as fever cough sore throat headache fatigue myalgia and dyspnea are frequently shown by patients during the onset of covid-19 363738394041 additionally loss of taste or smell and gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea vomiting or diarrhea has also been reported by infected patients 424344 nevertheless disease severity seems to be strongly associated with underlying host conditions including age sex and overall health the latter seems to play a critical role in susceptibility and contribute to the risk of infection when severe and non severe patients are compared conditions such as hypertension diabetes cardiovascular and kidney diseases increase the risk of infection two to three-fold 45 the macrocyclic lactone antibiotic azithromycin has been shown to have in vitro activity against zika and ebola viruses 100101 azithromycin has also shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity 102103 additionally it has shown to induce interferon type i ifn- ifn- and type iii ifn- in cells from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and decrease rhinovirus-16 viral load in bronchial epithelial cells 104 most of the cytokines induced by azithromycin is related to viral infection response and in turn induce resistance to viral replication in target cells 105106 the in vitro concentration ec50 50 effective concentration for azithromycin against sars-cov-2 was determined as 212 m following 72 hours incubation period post infection 107 several studies in covid-19 patients have been showing limitations considering that they focused mainly on viral load as end point and detailed clinical outcomes are generally lacking nevertheless collectively they present preliminary evidence that inclusion of azithromycin in various treatment regimens can influence the course of viral infection and potentially influence clinical outcomes 108109 yet there are still controversies regarding efficacy of azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine in covid-19 while a french study have shown 100  reduction of viral load in six patients treated with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine in contrast with 571 of patients treated with only hydroxychloroquine another study showed no efficacy at all in a case series with eleven patients treated with the same combination 109110 thus confirmation and validation are still needed before a conclusion on the efficacy of azithromycin can be reached the contradictory results reported so far is one of the reasons suggesting that additional randomized controlled trials is essential to confirm these preliminary data and help to understand the benefits and the role of azithromycin in treatment combinations used to treat covid-19 infection clinical trials are currently ongoing to fill up these gaps chloroquine is a drug that has been used worldwide as anti-malarial as well as for the treatment of immune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus 111112 the first indication of a potential effect of chloroquine on sars-cov-2 infection came from a report during china outbreak in this study results from more than 100 patients demonstrated that chloroquine inhibited the exacerbation of pneumonia improved lung imaging findings promoted a virus negative conversion and shortening of the disease course 113 before the covid-19 outbreak previous studies with chloroquine had shown its ability to inhibit in vitro the viral replication of another coronavirus sars-cov responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome 114115 hydroxychloroquine is a less toxic derivative of chloroquine that has shown lower half maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 compared to chloroquine in inhibiting sars-cov-2 in vitro 116 additional studies confirmed this finding 117118119120 a small study open-label non-randomized clinical trial with 36 confirmed covid-19 patients was conducted in france the end point was the presence or absence of virus after six days from the inclusion in the protocol the results showed a significant association between hydroxychloroquine treatment and viral load reductiondisappearance and this effect was reinforced by azithromycin 109 important to note that in this study clinical severity of the patients ranged from asymptomatic to pneumonia ie none of them was critically ill also the results of this study was questioned by the international society of antimicrobial chemotherapy isac which declared that due to the lack of clear explanation of the inclusion criteria and the triage of patients to ensure patient safety it did not meet the expected standard of that organization nonetheless an analysis of the data reported in gautret work using a pharmacokinetic model claim to confirm that co-treatment of covid-19 with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin increases the probability of negative-pcr in patients the analysis also showed that clinical status affects the treatment outcome since the analysis was based on limited published data the results need to be interpreted with caution 121 basically three mechanisms have been proposed for the antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquinechloroquine first the drugs interfere with the terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor ace2 thus preventing virus-receptor binding secondly the drugs increase the ph of acidic cellular organelles hampering endocytosis at intermediate stages with negative effects on virion transport and potentially altering post-translational modification of newly synthesized viral proteins and third the drugs may disturb the process of virion assembly and viral protein synthesis 119122 despite the lack of strong and reliable evidence of efficacy due to the pressure that covid-19 has imposed worldwide many health authorities have implemented official guidelines on the use hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for the treatment of patients with covid-19 123124125 regarding the side effects of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine both have been in clinical use for several years thus their safety profile is well established 126 gastrointestinal upset has been reported with hydroxychloroquine and retinal toxicity has been described with long term use of both drugs 127128129 retinal toxicity may also be related to over-dosage 130 additionally cardiomyopathy and heart arrhythmia have been reported 131132 to address the effect of chloroquine hydroxychloroquine in combination or not with azithromycin on the qt interval a measure of delayed ventricular repolarization a prospective observational study was performed in hospitalized patients with sars-cov-2 the primary outcome evaluated in this study was qt prolongation resulting in torsade de pointes tdp and cardiac death the results showed that for the two hundred one patients treated for covid-19 with chloroquinehydroxychloroquine baseline qt intervals did not differ between patients treated with chloroquinehydroxychloroquine and patients treated with these drugs and azithromycin however during treatment the maximum qt was significantly longer in the combination group compared to the monotherapy group and seven patients required discontinuation of the medications but no arrhythmogenic deaths were reported the authors concluded that although clinicians seldomly needed to discontinue therapy further studies are needed before final recommendations can be made 133 a multinational registry evaluation of the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without a macrolide for the treatment of covid-19 using data from 671 hospitals in six continents was recently published 134 in this study was included patients hospitalized between dec 20 2019 and april 14 2020 with a positive laboratory finding for sars-cov-2 patients were included in one of four treatments chloroquine alone chloroquine with a macrolide hydroxychloroquine alone or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide and patients who received none of these treatments formed the control group from a total of 96032 patients analyzed 14888 patients were in the treatment groups 1868 received chloroquine 3783 received chloroquine with a macrolide 3016 received hydroxychloroquine and 6221 received hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide and 81144 patients were in the control group the study concluded that after controlling for multiple confounding factors age sex race or ethnicity body-mass index underlying cardiovascular disease and its risk factors diabetes underlying lung disease smoking immunosuppressed condition and baseline disease severity it was not possible to confirm a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine when used alone or with a macrolide on in-hospital outcomes for covid-19 each of these drug regimens was associated with decreased in-hospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when used for treatment of covid-19 134 of note this study was performed with hospitalized patients most of them with associated comorbidities regrettably this study was recently withdrawn under suspect of flawed data and ethical concerns about the methodology used in the analysis before this announcement clinical trials designed to address the safety and efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin were suspended temporarily by the world health organization authorities based on the published results however they stepped back and authorized the continuation of the ongoing clinical trials therefore a great debate persists whether individuals with confirmed covid-19 with mild symptoms or asymptomatic could benefit from treatment with these drugs ivermectin is best known as an antiparasitic agent sold with the commercial name stromectol but it has also demonstrated antiviral activities toward human immunodeficiency virus hiv and dengue virus 135 ivermectin targets the host nuclear transport importin 1 heterodimer which the virus relies for the replication and assembly of new virions 136 this drug was shown to inhibit sars-cov-2 in vitro replication for up to 48 h at a concentration of 5 m the 50 inhibition concentration ic50 was determined as 2 m which was much higher than the maximum plasma concentration 137 a study was performed aiming to predict total bound and unbound and unbound plasma concentration-time profiles after the administration of fda approved dose 200 mgkg 60 mgkg and 120 mgkg the results of this study showed that plasma concentrations did not reach the ic50 even at doses higher than the approved furthermore the authors concluded that after oral administration with the approved dose it is unlikely that ivermectin reaches the ic50 in the lungs and therefore the likelihood of a successful clinical trial would be low despite these results combination therapy with other agents may be beneficial and it has been suggested 138 moreover studies with animal models have shown up to 3-fold higher levels in pulmonary tissue than in plasma one week after oral dosing demonstrating the need for further research to better evaluate the effectivity of ivermectin for the treatment of respiratory viruses such as sars-cov-2 139 lopinavir is an aspartate protease inhibitor that has demonstrated high specificity against human immunodeficiency virus hiv type 1 lopinavir was developed by the pharmaceutical company abbot and is sold by the brand name kaletra this drug is generally administered in combination with ritonavir due to its poor oral bioavailability rapid biotransformation and to increase its half-life through the inhibition of cytochrome p450 140 in the hiv-1 infection context the lopinavir hydroxy ethylene bond mimics the normal peptide cleaved by the virus hiv-1 protease 141 during the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic in 2003 lopinavir was tested in vitro and showed inhibitory activity against sars-cov 140142143 a multicenter retrospective study matched cohort study was performed by chan et al 144 to investigate possible benefits and adverse effects of the addition of lopinavirritonavir to a standard treatment protocol for the treatment of sars they showed that as an initial treatment the protocol used was associated with a significant reduction in the overall death rate and intubation rate when compared with a matched cohort who received standard treatment another study reported in 2004 suggested that the addition of lopinavirritonavir compared to a control group who received the antiviral ribavirin reduced the risk of adverse clinical outcomes and viral load among patients with sars 140 one study reported a case of a single patient in the initial phase of sars-cov-2 outbreak in korea who was identified as an index patient that caused secondary and tertiary transmission the administration of lopinavirritonavir to this patient significantly decreased the viral load and no or little coronavirus titers were observed during follow-up 145 nevertheless in another study reporting a randomized controlled open-label trial involving 199 hospitalized adult patients with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection the use of lopinavirritonavir showed no benefit beyond standard care this study had the time to clinical improvement as the primary end point 146 nitazoxanide belongs to the class of drugs known as thiazolides it has a broad spectrum antiparasitic and it has also shown to have broad spectrum antiviral activity nitazoxanide has been previously shown to exhibit in vitro activity against mers-cov and other coronaviruses 147 haffizulla et al showed that when nitazoxanide was given in a regimen of 600 mg twice daily for 5 days it reduced the duration of symptoms in patients with acute uncomplicated influenza with minor adverse effects 148 several recommendations have been made suggesting the potential use of nitazoxanide to treat sars-cov-2 infection but they have been often ignored 149 a recent review evaluated nine nitazoxanide research clinical trials to assess the safety cost and potential use of this drug for covid-19 150 the authors concluded that this drug demonstrate good safety profile at approved doses although further evidence is required regarding hepatorenal and cardiovascular effects as well as teratogenicity if efficacy of nitazoxanide is clinically proven against covid-19 it may represent an affordable and safe treatment to date the 15th of june 2020 twelve nitazoxanide clinical trials undergoing worldwide have been registered on the clinicaltrialgov website five of them recruiting volunteers table 2
 remdesivir is a phosphoramidate nucleoside analogue prodrug and a broad-spectrum antiviral agent commercialized by the pharmaceutical company gilead 151 it has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity in animal models against coronaviruses causing mers and sars which are structurally similar do sars-cov-2 152 remdesivir demonstrated to potent block sars-cov-2 infection at low concentrations with a half-maximal effective concentration ec50 of 077 m 120 a report on a single case patient described clinical improvement after use of remdesivir intravenously to treat the first united states case of covid-19 153 another study reported a compassionate use of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection who had an oxygen saturation of 94 or less or who were receiving oxygen support 154 the authors observed clinical improvement in 36 of 53 patients 68 treated with remdesivir consisting of a loading dose of 200 mg intravenously on day 1 plus 100 mg daily for the following 9 days however the authors suggested that efficacy will require ongoing randomized placebo controlled trials notwithstanding these results a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study with 237 patients enrolled showed that use of remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits patients receiving redemsivir had a numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement compared to placebo although theses results were not statistically significant 155 this study had to be terminated early due to the adverse events observed in the patients favipiravir commercially sold as avigan is a pyrazinecarboxamide derivative and guanine analogue that has shown to selectively inhibit the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp of rna viruses interfering with the assembly of viable virus 156157 this drug has shown activity against many rna viruses such as influenza a virus alphavirus filovirus arena and norovirus as well as ebola virus 158 a study designed to evaluate the potential antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 included favipiravir in a panel of drugs tested favipiravir showed efficacy in vitro in infected vero e6 cells demonstrating a half-maximal effective concentration ec50 of 6188 m and half cytotoxic concentration over 400 m 120 in contrast choy et al showed that concentrations lower than 100 m has no effect against sars-cov-2 in vitro 159 on the other hand it has been shown that covid-19 patients treated with favipiravir show superior recovery rate 7143 than patients treated with umifenovir 5586 160 an open label nonrandomized controlled study examined the effects of favipiravir and lopinavirritonavir in 80 patients with confirmed covid-19 the study comprised two arms with one containing 35 patients treated with favipiravir day 1 1600 mg twice daily days 214 600 mg twice daily plus 5 ku twice daily ifn- and the other containing 45 patients treated with lopinavirritonavir days 114 400 mg100 mg twice daily plus 5 ku twice daily ifn- as a control group favipiravir treatment was associated with faster viral clearance significantly higher improvement rate in chest imaging and fewer adverse effects compared to the lopinavirritonavir arm 161 non-randomized and randomized controlled clinical trials aiming to investigate efficacy and safety of favipiravir alone or in combination with tocilizumab or chloroquine phosphate are currently ongoing umifenovir is an indole carboxylic acid derivative used for treating prophylaxis and infections associated with h1n1a and b arbovirus 162 also known as arbidol umifenovir acts by blocking the virus-cell membrane fusion and virus-endosome fusion through incorporation into cell membranes and interference with the phospholipids network organization 163 this drug showed in vitro activity against sars-cov-1 virus and was speculated to have activity against sars-cov-2 164 combination of umifenovir and lopinavirritonavir showed increased negative conversion rate of sars-cov-2 and improved chest ct scans results in a retrospective cohort study 165 however it was shown that patients treated with umifenovir demonstrated inferior outcome in clinical recovery rate and less improvement in symptoms like fever and cough when compared to favipiravir 160 in contrast another study evaluated the antiviral effects and safety of lopinavirritonavir and arbidol in fifty patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 they were divided into two groups lopinavirritonavir group consisting of 34 cases and arbidol group consisting of 16 cases the first group received 400 mg100 mg of lopinavirritonavir twice a day for a week while the second group was given 02 g arbidol three times a day rt-pcr assay was used to detect sars-cov-2 virus during antiviral therapy patients in the arbidol group had a shorter duration of positive rna test compared to those in the lopinavirritonavir group suggesting that arbidol monotherapy may be superior to lopinavirritonavir in treating covid-19 166 clinical trials aiming to investigate efficacy and safety of umifenovir alone or in combination are currently ongoing methylprednisolone is one of the classical immunosuppressive drugs used to stop or delay the progress of pneumonia and have been proved to effective for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards patients with covid-19 pneumonia and severe cases develop rapidly to acute respiratory failure 39 therefore it is not a surprise that methylprednisolone became a drug of choice to use in severe cases in a retrospective cohort study with 201 patients with covid-19 who developed ard administration of 12 mgkgdaily iv for 57days apparently reduced the risk of death although 42 of patients who received this drug died compared to 618 who did not received the drug 167 early low-dose and short application of methylprednisolone was associated to improvement in clinical symptoms and a shortened disease course in another study with 46 patients with severe covid-19 168 a limited study with only 15 patients and no control group corroborated the benefits of low dose corticosteroids treatment in a subset of critically ill covid-19 pneumonia patients 169 another steroid that has been used in the treatment of acute respiratory syndromes before is the fluorinated steroid dexamethasone a synthetic member of the class of glucocorticoids at the closing of this review on june 17th the results of a randomized clinical trial established to examine the potential benefit of treatment with dexamethasone in covid-19 patients were announced by the university of oxford this study was part of the proposal called recovery randomized evaluation of covid-19 therapy and consisted of 2104 patients randomized to receive 6 mg once per day of dexamethasone either orally or by intravenous injection for ten days and 4321 patients randomized to receive standard care as mentioned before patients with severe covid-19 infection requires ventilation and oxygen support and unfortunately they are among the patients with high mortality rate dexamethasone reduced deaths by one-third among ventilated patients and by one fifth among those receiving oxygen this benefit was not observed in patients who did not require respiratory support the announced yet unpublished study is encouraging and give support to the hypothesis that corticosteroids can be useful in the treatment of severe covid-19 patients reducing mortality 170 some studies have been reporting that severe covid-19 patients present coagulopathy complications 39171172 disseminated intravascular coagulation is frequently observed in most of deaths caused by sars-cov-2 39 this observation led to the active application of anticoagulants such as heparin for patients with severe covid-19 in china notwithstanding the lack of efficacy validation 173 nevertheless tang et al 174 performed a retrospective study where they compared the 28-day mortality between a group of severe covid-19 patients who received heparin and a group who did not receive this anticoagulant no statistically difference in 28-day mortality was observed between groups 303 vs 297 p  0910 however in a group of patients presenting sepsis-induced coagulopathy with score greater than 4 those who received heparin showed a lower 28-day mortality than those who did not receive heparin 400 vs 642 p  0029 on the other hand negri et al 175 reported in a not yet peer-reviewed study a series of 27 consecutive covid-19 patients admitted at a hospital in so paulo-brazil and treated with heparin in therapeutic doses used in clinical severity the treatment with heparin improved the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen pao2fio2 and the mean time of discharge of 81 of theses patients were 114 days 175 cardiac arrhytmias are often the immediate cause of death in severe patients 176 therefore it has been suggested that the use of heparin in covid-19 severe patients would be useful not only due to its anticoagulant activity but also its antiarrhythmic property 177178179 beyond the virus itself another factor considered to be important as primary cause of mortality of patients infected with sars-cov-2 is the pro-inflammatory response which can promote a cytokine storm and secondary bacterial infection therefore drugs acting as anti-inflammatory are thought to help decrease the severity of covid-19 patients interleukins 1 il-1 and il-1 are cytokines associated with innate immunity and damaging inflammation 180 il-1 was shown to reach peak levels at the time of disease onset in a study of ards assessing serial bronchoalveolar lavage fluids for cytokine content 181 anakinra sold by the brand name kineret is a recombinant il-1 receptor antagonist used to treat autoinflammatory disorders 182 a retrospective cohort study conducted in italy with patients with covid-19 moderate-to-severe ards and hyperinflammation demonstrated that high-dose intravenous anakinra was safe and associated with clinical improvement in 72 of the patients 183 despite the recognized limitations of this study the results are promising and a randomized phase two clinical trial nct04324021 is ongoing meanwhile a cohort prospective study was performed in france with participants who were admitted to groupe hospitalier paris saint-joseph with severe covid-19-related bilateral pneumonia on chest x-ray or lung ct scan from march 24 to april 6 2020 the anakinra group consisted of 52 consecutive patients that received subcutaneous anakinra 100 mg twice a day for 72 h then 100 mg daily for 7 days as well as the standard treatments at the institution at the time the control group consisted of 44 patients that received standard treatments and supportive care intensive care unit icu admission or death occurred in 13 25 patients in the anakinra group compared to 32 73 patients in the control group 184 these results suggest the need of more clinical trials to confirm the efficacy of anakinra to treat patients with severe covid-19 infection baricitinib is a janus kinase jak inhibitor licensed primarily for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and with good efficacy and safety records 185 interestingly this anti-inflammatory drug has been considered an option for treatment of covid-19 and its antiviral effect is believed to be related to its affinity for ap2 associated protein aak1 reducing sars-cov-2 endocytosis 186 cantini et al 187 reported a pilot study to evaluate the safety and clinical impact in covid-19 baricitinib was given to 12 patients with moderate covid-19 at a dose of 4 mgdayorally no adverse events were recorded after two weeks and clinical and respiratory parameters significantly improved at two weeks with no patients required admission to icu 187 caveats in this study is that no proper control group was included interleukin 6 il-6 tumor necrosis factor tnf and interferon gama ifn- are other targetable cytokines that play important role in the pathogenesis of lung seen in covid-19 excessive il-6 signaling induces several biological pathways including janus kinase jnk which contribute to organ damage 188 tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal anti-il-6 antibody that binds both soluble and membrane bound il-6 receptor 189 a chinese study aiming to assess the efficacy of tocilizumab in 21 patients with covid-19 showed preliminary results demonstrating that this drug improved clinical outcome immediately in severe and critical patients and was an effective treatment to reduce mortality all 21 patients in the study were discharged on average 151d after giving tocilizumab 190 interferons ifns are the first line of immune defense against viral infections its antiviral activity occurs by blocking viral replication and eliminating the virus-infected cells 191 several cellular proteins located in different compartments contain pattern recognition receptors prrs such as toll like receptors tlrs rig-i like receptors rlrs and cyclic amp-gmp synthase cgasstimulator of ifn genes sting that act as sensors for specific viral components 192193194 upon virus infection transcription factors such as interferon regulatory factors irfs and nuclear factor-b nf-b are activated by signaling pathways triggered by ligand-prrs interaction these transcription factors act cooperatively to induce the synthesis of type i interferons such as ifn- which in turn can induce the expression of several genes involved in blocking viral infection via janus kinase jaksignal transducer of transcription stat signaling pathway 195 interferon-1b treatment have shown to improve outcome of mers-cov infection in a nonhuman primate model of common marmoset 196 ifn- and ifn- have been tested in vitro against sars-cov-2 and shown potent antiviral activity infected vero cells treated with ifn- or ifn- at a concentration of 50 international units iu per milliliter reduced viral titers by 34 log or over 4 log respectively demonstrating the potential therapeutic use of these biologicals in covid-1 infections 197 addition of ifn-1 in the treatment of covid-19 patients receiving the antivirals lopinavirritonavir was shown to be better than the treatment with the two antivirals alone as demonstrated by a open label randomized phase ii clinical trial where patients in the triple combination treatment group had a significantly shorter median time from start of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab 7 days compared to the lopinavirritonavir control group 12 days 198 as mentioned before angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 was identied as a functional receptor in sars-cov infection 199 structural and functional analysis of sars-cov-2 binding receptor showed that the spike glycoprotein of this virus also binds to ace2 receptor 200201202 it has been observed that patients with comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes are frequently under medication with angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers arb which could result in overexpression of ace2 and potentially increase availability of target molecules for sars-cov-2 entry 45203204205 ace inhibitors and arbs are used to treat patients with high blood pressure heart and kidney problems and other conditions it is believed that disbalance in ace2 as caused by ace inhibitors or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug nsaid such as ibuprofen an activator of ace2 receptors expression may predispose to severe disease 206 on the other hand there are some reports showing no association between these drugs and severe covid-19 207 however the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is very complex and it has been suggested that this complexity needs to be taken into consideration when treating covid-19 pneumonia patients with comorbidities due to the opposing physiological actions of ace and ace2 receptors 208 ace cleaves angiotensin i to generate angiotensin ii the peptide which binds to and activates angiotensin receptor 1 at1r to constrict blood vessels thereby elevating blood pressure in contrast ace2 inactivates angiotensin ii while generating angiotensin 17 a heptapeptide having a potent vasodilator function via activation of its mas receptor 209 in this context it has been proposed that at1r blockers such as losartan and olmesartan could reduce the aggressiveness and mortality from sarscov2 virus infections the rationale appointed for this proposal is that when sars-cov-2 binds to ace2 receptor it causes a downregulation of ace2 activity which in turn results in excessive production of angiotensin-ii by the related enzyme ace while less ace2 is capable of converting it to the vasodilator heptapeptide angiotensin 17 which contributes to lung injury due to increased pulmonary vascular permeability 210 furthermore observational studies on the use of ace inhibitors and arbs during the covid-19 pandemic and in other acute respiratory syndromes do not support the hypothesis that these drugs increase the risk of infection with sars-cov-2 or have a negative impact on the clinical outcomes of covid-19 patients some demonstrate the opposite of the initially raised concerns 211212 although in preclinical animal model treatment with losartan has been shown to upregulate ace2 mrna expression and activity human studies showed no significant difference in ace2 plasma levels in patients treated with arbs or ace inhibitors although local tissue ace2 levels have not been measured 213214215216 ace inhibitors and arbs could mitigate the deleterious effects at1r pathway activation which in turn decreases inflammation and lung injury 217 however the real impact of ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers on severe acute respiratory illness due to sars cov-2 is not well established and contradictory results have been published in the literature so far only controlled randomized trials will be able to definitively answer the question of whether ace inhibitors or arbs pose a harm to patients with covid-19 or if they could even be beneficial despite controversies it has been suggested the use of ace inhibitors and arbs should be continued in patients that are in stable condition who are at risk for infection are being evaluated for infection or have covid-19 218 convalescent plasma is a type of therapy where plasma is collected from individuals following resolution of infection and development of antibodies transfusion of convalescent plasma may prevent infection or decrease clinical severity in individuals with recent exposure to the virus 219 this type of therapy has been in use for over a century 220 human plasma from recovered covid-19 patients is being considered a safe and potentially effective alternative for treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis 221222 a study with 173 sars-cov-2 infected patients detected the presence of antibodies in serial plasma samples and demonstrated seroconversion rates for antibody ab igm and igg of 931 827 and 647 respectively the presence of antibodies was 40 among patients within 1-week since onset and rapidly increased to 1000 ab 943 igm and 798 igg since day-15 after onset demonstrating a strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of covid-19 patients 223 there are still few data on the use of convalescent plasma therapy in covid-19 however reports from china has shown preliminary clinical benefits regarding improvement of symptoms like fever cough chest pain and no serious side effect 224225 again the need of randomized clinical trials is urgent to determine the true clinical effect of this treatment or whether the patients might have recovered without this therapy according to the clinicaltrialsgov database there are currently 102 studies evaluating this therapy for covid-19 vitamin c ascorbic acid is an essential vitamin known for its antioxidant properties important to boost the immune system 226 some studies have shown that various high-dose intravenous vitamin c infusions eg 200 mgkg body weightday divided into 4 doses shortened the intensive care unit icu stay by 78 227 and was accompanied by a signicant reduction in the mortality rate in the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock 228 moreover vitamin c has also demonstrated antiviral activity which was recently reviewed 229 coronaviruses increase oxidative stress that promotes cellular malfunction and ultimately results in organ failure 230 it is believed that high intravenous dose of vitamin c could be particularly effective by inhibiting the production of cytokines storm due to covid-19 and many physicians in china have identied promising results using this approach against covid-19 231232 it was reported that high-dose intravenous vitamin c was successfully used in the treatment of 50 moderate to severe covid-19 patients in china the doses used varied between 10 g and 20 g per day given over a period of 810 h the oxygenation index was improving in real time and all the patients eventually cured and were discharged 231 recently a new clinical trial to test high-dose vitamin c in patients with covid-19 identifier nct04264533 has begun in wuhan china in this trial the investigators will treat 140 patients with a placebo control or intravenous vitamin c at a dose of 24 gday for 7 days they will assess requirements for mechanical ventilation and vasopressor drugs organ failure scores icu length of stay and 28-day mortality 232 it is known that vitamin d can stimulate innate immunity and modulate acquired immunity 233 however although there are several contradictory results reported in the literature regarding the effect of vitamin d on acute respiratory infections considering that pneumonia sepsis respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress are frequently found in sars-cov-2 infected patients it has been suggested that this vitamin could be beneficial in patients with covid-19 a meta-analysis study has shown evidence that vitamin d supplementation could protected against acute respiratory infections 234 this benefit was observed in individuals who received frequent eg daily doses of vitamin d but not in those who received bolus doses and this effect was more evident in individuals with vitamin d deficiency a study performed with 449 individuals recruited from a uk biobank with confirmed covid-19 aimed to establish whether 25-hydroxyvitamin d 25ohd concentration was associated with covid-19 risk 235 this study showed no potential link between vitamin d concentrations and covid-19 infection nor relation between this vitamin and the ethnic differences in covid-19 infection despite this result there are several clinical trials undergoing to better evaluate the role of vitamin d in covid-19 infection table2 it has been shown that zinc inhibits coronavirus and retrovirus rna polymerase activity and zinc ionophores exhibit the potential to block virus replication in vitro 236 moreover zinc has also shown to play a role as anti-inflammatory agent in pneumonia in animal models thus limiting tissue damage and systemic effects 237238 furthermore previous work performed before the covid-19 pandemic demonstrated that chloroquine is a zinc ionophore increasing zn2 flux into the cell 239 therefore zinc has been considered as supportive treatment in the therapy of covid-19 infection recently it was reported a series of four patient cases one 63 years old man and three women with 57 41 and 26 years old with clinical symptoms andor laboratory confirmed covid-19 that used high dose zinc salt oral lozenges to alleviate the symptoms of the disease the treatment resulted in significant improvement in objective and symptomatic disease measures such as fever and pao2 after one day of this high dose therapy 240 currently there is no standard dosage for zinc supplementation established in the treatment of covid-19 however several clinical trials are underway to evaluate the effects of supplementation with zinc alone or in combination with other supplements or drugs such as vitamin c chloroquine hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin on covid-19 table 2 hydroxychloroquineazithromycin combination therapy has shown promising results in covid-19 treatment although no clear mechanism of action has been established nevertheless it was shown by molecular dynamics that both drugs act in synergy to prevent contact between the virus and the plasma membrane cells 241 azithromycin display similarity with the sugar moiety of ganglioside gm1 a lipid that act as important host attachment cofactor this antibiotic interacts with the ganglioside-binding domain of sars-cov-2 spike protein and thereby prevents virus attachment to the host cell receptor on the other hand hydroxychloroquine saturates sites in the vicinity of the primary coronavirus receptor ace2 241 the results from an open label randomized phase ii clinical trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of triple combination of interferon beta-1b lopinavirritonavir and ribavirin for treating patients with covid-19 were recently published the study comprised 127 patients from which 86 were randomly assigned to the combination group 14-day combination of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h ribavirin 400 mg every 12 h and three doses of 8 million international units of interferon beta-1b on alternate days and 41patients were assigned to the control group 14 days of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h the primary endpoint was the time to providing a nasopharyngeal swab negative for sars-cov-2 rt-pcr the combination group had a significantly shorter median time from start of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab 7 days than the control group 12 days p  00010 the authors concluded that early triple antiviral therapy was safe and superior to lopinavirritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate covid-19 198 several treatment combinations protocols with the drugs mentioned earlier are being tested on ongoing clinical trials clinicaltrialsgov 2020 a summary of the status of these clinical trials accessed in june 13th on the clinicaltrialsgov databank is shown in table 2 a vaccine named chadox1 ncov-19 was the first vaccine to enter phase i clinical trial aiming to assess whether health people can be protected from covid-19 this investigational vaccine developed at the university of oxford jenner institute protected six rhesus macaques from pneumonia caused by sars-cov-2 242 it started to recruit volunteers in oxford on april 23rd 2020 around 1100 people is expected to take part in the trial with half receiving the vaccine and the other half control group the vaccine is based on an adenovirus vaccine vector and the sars-cov-2 spike protein and has been produced in oxford 243 another candidate vaccine for covid-19 named mrna-1273 was developed by the pharmaceutical company moderna and phase 1 data was announced on may 18th 2020 mrna-1273 is an mrna vaccine against sars-cov-2 encoding for a prefusion stabilized form of the spike s protein the vaccine has shown to generate an immune response similar to the response seen in people infected by the virus and recovered despite the limited data in phase i trial eight patients who received low and middle doses of 25 and 100 g of the vaccine respectively developed neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov-2 one of the people who received 100 g developed redness at the injection site which is considered criteria for grade 3 adverse event three volunteers subjected to the highest dose tested of 250 g presented these adverse events after receiving the second of two doses 244 zhu et al 237 reported on may 22nd the results of a clinical trial nct04313127 where they tested the safety tolerability and immunogenicity of a recombinant adenovirus type-5 vectored covid-19 vaccine healthy adults aged between 18 and 60 years were sequentially enrolled and allocated to one of three dose groups 5  10 1  10 and 15  10 viral particles to receive an intramuscular injection of vaccine 108 participants 51 male 49 female mean age 363 years were recruited and received the low dose n  36 middle dose n  36 or high dose n  36 of the vaccine elisa antibodies and neutralizing antibodies increased significantly at day 14 and peaked 28 days post-vaccination specific t-cell response peaked at day 14 post-vaccination the authors concluded that this vaccine was tolerable immunogenic and warrants further investigation 245 notwithstanding preliminary these results are encouraging and shed hope for an effective treatment in the near future besides these vaccines there are more than 140 clinical trials registered in the clinicaltrialsgov databank despite great efforts worldwide to try to find an effective drug against sars-cov-2 yet there is not a consensus about a definite therapy for covid-19 the use of repurposed medications has shown to be a good alternative with promising results while an effective vaccine is still not available in this review we incorporated only key drugs and treatments that have been tested and demonstrated potential for use against sars-cov-2 virus as of june 13th 2020 however the results obtained so far with the use of repurposed drugs must be faced with caution unfortunately the pressure imposed by the increasingly death toll and the great attention of the media and politics on the pandemic have stimulated the publication of some small or incomplete studies in humans with questionable empirical clinical data many of them without desirable scientific rigor this fact has been the subject of broad debate as a result misinformation and confusion have occurred hindering important actions to combat covid-19 advance and leading to a needless discredit in science in fact some published research papers from recognized medical journals have been withdrawn recently after several concerns raised with respect to the veracity of the data and analyses conducted by the authors revealing the use of dubious methods of analysis and ethical problems 246 this fact had a direct impact on ongoing clinical trials causing temporary suspension and compromising the long-awaited results on the other hand as stated by zhang et al 27 sound science should be effectively communicated to policy makers and should constitute the prime foundation in decision-making amid this pandemic furthermore only well designed and rigorous randomized controlled trial can provide reliable and generalized data for safety and effective use of drugs to treat infected patients 247 despite the great challenge posed by the covid-19 pandemic and the surfaced ethical issues the ongoing efforts to fight the virus and the excellence and hardworking of many research groups across the world offer hope that in a near future we can win this battle this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectors 7980 there is no conflict of interest  current targeted therapeutics against covid-19 based on first-line experience in china yue zhang qianhao xu zhuoyan sun lei zhou   in late december 2019 an outbreak of sars-like pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus occurred in the chinese city of wuhan which was officially named as covid-19 coronavirus diseases 2019 by the world health organization who later and the novel coronavirus was designated sars-cov-2 spreading nationwide and across the world on march 11th 2020 who assessed that covid-19 could be considered as a pandemic so far the quantity of covid-19 diagnosed worldwide is 132758 and the death toll is 5420 as of march 13th 2020 1 the majority of patients infected with sars-cov-2 showed nonspecific symptoms fever dry cough fatigue along with pneumonia demonstrated on chest ct scan imaging and have a mild condition with a case fatality rate cfr around 2 2 however among elderly patients and patients with chronic underlying diseases such as hypertension diabetes there is a higher rate of transmission to the intensive care unit icu and mortality 3 given sars-cov-2 is a novel strain causing a global pandemic effective targeted therapies are urgently needed however no proven effective antiviral or immunomodulatory therapies exist for the treatment of covid-19 4 most patients have received numerous potentially targeted therapies as described so far based on medication experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers which mostly belong to existing antiviral agents approved or in development for treating infections caused by human immunodeficiency virus hiv hepatitis b virus hbv hepatitis c virus hcv and influenza and a section of patients have participated in ongoing uncontrolled clinical trials in this review we summarize the current therapeutic medicines used in the real world according to possible mechanisms based on chinese clinical experience hoping to provide some implications for clinical medication remdesivir is a nucleoside analog effective against a variety of viruses including mers-cov and sars-cov in vitro and animal models 56 and phase iii clinical trial for inhibiting ebola virus are ongoing 7 research has revealed that in vitro remdesivir has the ability to inhibit sars-cov-2 recently 8 the first covid-19 case in the us has improved condition and declined the viral load after treated with remdesivir on illness day 7 suggesting that remdesivir has the potential to treat covid-19 recently the results of a trial of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with severe covid-19 under sympathetic medication were published the data have shown that 68 of severe patients have relieved symptoms after using remdesivir and the mortality of those patients is 13 which is noteworthy though these findings need to be confirmed in the ongoing randomized placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir therapy for covid-19 9 remdesivir is an investigational agent not commercially available safety and efficacy have not been established in covid-19 patients it is available as part of several ongoing clinical trials for adult and nonpregnant patients while individual compassionate use requests are limited to pregnant women or pediatric patients 18 years of age with confirmed covid-19 and severe disease although there are no clear contraindications in the population included in clinical trials nct04257656 nct04252664 nct04292899 people with a creatinine clearance below 30 ml per minute and serum levels of alanine aminotransferase alt and aspartate aminotransferase ast more than five times the upper limit of the normal range were excluded therefore patients with liver and kidney function impairment should be used with caution fig 1
 chloroquine is a drug widely used in the treatment of malaria and autoimmune diseases 10 reported to having broad-spectrum antiviral potential in2006 11 in a recent study 8 chloroquine was found to inhibit sars-cov-2 at low-micromolar ec50  113 m in vero e6 cells which can be clinically achievable based on experience with rheumatoid arthritis 12 in addition time-of-addition assay 8 demonstrated that chloroquine functioned at both entry and post-entry stages of the 2019-ncov infection in vero e6 cells the antiviral activity of chloroquine may be due to the following three ways fig 2
 1 reduce the ace2 receptor terminal glycosylation on the surface of cells thus interfere with the binding of sars-cov-2 to the ace2 receptor 13 2 increase the ph of endosomes and lysosomes to prevent the fusion process of the virus with host cells and subsequent virus replication 1415 3 impede pro-inflammatory signaling activation and production of cytokines eg il-1 il-6 and tnf by inhibiting lysosomal activity in antigen-presenting cells apcs interrupting binding between toll-like receptors tlr7 and tlr9 and their rnadna ligands and interfering with the interaction between cytosolic dna and the nucleic acid sensor cyclic gmp-amp synthase cgas the press released from the state council of china indicated that chloroquine phosphate had demonstrated marked efficacy in preventing the deterioration of covid-19 related pneumonia in multicenter clinical trials conducted in china on february 17 2020 16 the latest guideline 17 recommended for adults 18-65 years old 500 mg each time 2 timesday lasts 7days for patients who weigh more than 50 kg 500 mg each time 2 timesday lasts 2 days and 500 mg each time 1 timeday lasts 5 days for patients who weigh less than 50 kg banned for people with underlying heart disease due to its cardiotoxicity there are currently more than 20 clinical trials of chloroquine registered in the china clinical trial registry hydroxychloroquine is an analogue of chloroquine with similar therapeutic effects and significantly reduced toxic side effects 18 besides in vitro hydroxychloroquine exhibited better anti-sars-cov-2 activity than chloroquine 19 comprehensive treatment and management of coronavirus disease 2019 an expert consensus statement from shanghai 20 recommended hydroxychloroquine in an attempt of antiviral treatment however no dosage recommendations were made peking university third hospital established a physiology-based pharmacokinetic pbpk model based on the data of the hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in vitro to simulate the distribution concentration of the drug in the lung whole blood and plasma after different dosing regimens according to the results of the pbpk model it is recommended that the oral loading dose of hydroxychloroquine 400 mg bid on the first day and the maintenance dose of 200 mg bid continue to be treated for four days on the fifth day the lung titer can reach more than three times the oral chloroquine phosphate 500 mg twice daily 19 this dose was subsequently confirmed in the first randomized controlled clinical trial chictr2000029559 of hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 which enroll 62 patients with covid-19 31 received hcq 400 mgd 200 mg bid another 31 entered the control group have found that after 5 days the clinical recovery time of the hydroxychloroquine group was significantly shortened and the symptoms of fever and cough were relieved faster p  005 81 of patients in the hydroxychloroquine group had significantly improved pneumonia compared with 55 in the control group p  005 all patients who progressed to critical illness were in the control group this study affirmed the therapeutic effect of hydroxychloroquine 21 recently in a clinical trial 22 involving 36 patients with covid-19 shown the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has a full and rapid viral clearance the effects of which is better than hydroxychloroquine alone the mechanism by which azithromycin enhances the efficacy of covid-19 is unclear but azithromycin has previously been shown to prevent severe respiratory infections in patients infected with the virus 23 however jean et al 24 have not observed similar results in 11 covid-19 patients who have received the combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin given the trial is not an rct the number of cases is small and the control group is from other clinical centers an expanded clinical trial with good quality control is needed to confirm in addition the simultaneous use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin can lead to a prolonged qt interval and increase the risk of tip torsion arrhythmia so careful evaluation is required due to the cardiac and retinal toxicity acute lethal risk of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine when chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is used electrocardiogram monitoring should be performed and attention should be paid to changes in patients vision and neurological symptoms favipiravir t-705 belongs to nucleoside analogs like ribavirin approved for the treatment of novel or re-emerging pandemic influenza in china and japan effectively against multiple viruses like influenza ebola yellow fever chikungunya norovirus and enterovirus 25 favipiravir is teratogenic and is strictly prohibited during pregnancy and lactation 2627 wang et al reported its activity against 2019-ncov ec50  6188 m in vero e6 cells 8 and subsequently more than 10 clinical trials of favipiravir for the treatment of covid-19 has been registered the preliminary results from one of the clinical trials chictr2000029600 showed that group treated with favipiravir 35 cases has shorter median time to virus clearance 4 days vs 11 days high improvement rates of chest image 9143 vs 6222 than control group treated with lopinavir and ritonavir 45 cases with significant differences between the two groups and adverse reactions were lower than that in the control group the zhongnan hospital of wuhan university initiated a multicenter randomized open and positive parallel-controlled clinical study of favipiravir in the treatment of covid-19 chictr2000030254 with 240 patients enrolled and clinical treatment observations completed the results showed that the experimental group treated with favipilavir 120 cases is significantly better than the control group treated with arbidol 120 cases in the treatment of covid-19 in terms of secondary indicators the clinical recovery rate of day 7 was significantly better in the experimental group than in the control group which were 7143 and 5586 respectively in terms of secondary indicators the time from randomization to fever reduction 25 days vs 42 days cough relief 457 days vs 598 days and the rate of auxiliary oxygen therapy or noninvasive mechanical ventilation 816 vs 1712 during the trial in the experimental group was significantly better than the control group in view of the good safety of favipiravir and the drugs are available experts have been formally recommended to be included in the guideline as soon as possible 28 arbidol has been licensed in russia and china against upper respiratory tract infections caused by influenza a and b viruses it is contraindicated in patients allergic to this product antiviral mechanism of arbidol is by inhibiting hemagglutininase a protease on the surface of the influenza virus that binds to sialic acid receptors on human cells and then enters the cells through endocytosis to prevent the influenza virus from infecting human cells besides abidol can induce interferon production and exert a broad-spectrum antiviral effect 29 a recent study has revealed that arbidol can inhibit sars-cov-2 infection at a concentration of 10-30 m effectively in vitro 30 deng et al 31 found patients taking arbidol and lpvr n  16 had increased sars-cov-2 negative rate in 7-days and 14-days and improved chest ct scan compared to oral lpvr n  17 only however no effects of lpvr or arbidol was found to improve symptoms or shorten the clearance time of nucleic acid in respiratory specimens while there are more gastrointestinal adverse reactions comparing with the placebo control group in a clinical trial at shanghai public health clinical center 32 these contradictory results may be due to small sizes and inconsistent timing of medications missing the best therapeutic window in part of patients a clinical study of arbidol using for post-exposure prophylaxis of sars-cov-2 in a high-risk population including medical staff is in progress chictr2000029592 may providing us whether there are effects of arbidol on prevention and early treatment the latest guide recommends that the course of treatment for arbidol should not exceed 10 days 200 mgeach time 3 timesday lopinavir is approved by the food and drug administration fda to treat hiv infection as a protease inhibitor with ritonavir as a booster by inhibiting cytochrome p450 to increase blood concentrations 33 lopinavirritonavir lpvr is contraindicated for allergy to this product severe liver dysfunction and drugs that are highly dependent on cyp3a clearance and elevated plasma concentrations are associated with acute or life-threatening reactions a non-randomized clinical trial showed that sars patients treated with ribavirin combined with lpvr had a lower risk of ards and death than ribavirin monotherapy 34 a korean covid-19 patient has been found reduced viral loads and improved clinical symptoms when being treated with lopinavirritonavir 35 while it was not clear whether it was an effect of an antiviral drug or natural course or both lpvr has been recommended for the treatment of covid-19 in the latest guideline 400 mg100 mgeach time 2 timesday based on experience in sars-cov and mers-cov nausea vomiting fat metabolism disorders and elevated blood sugar are common adverse reactions to lpvr elderly patients with chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia need close monitoring of blood glucose and blood lipids however with the increase in the number of clinical applications most clinicians believe that it is not effective and gastrointestinal adverse reactions also occur frequently 36 nejm has published an article on march 18 2020 reporting a randomized controlled open-label clinical trial involving 199 patients with severe covid-19 in the china-japan friendship hospital chictr2000029308 which proves that lpvr has no significant effect on the treatment of covid-19 37 that might confirm antiviral drugs themselves are challenging to reverse the lung injury caused by a cytokine storm ribavirin a nucleoside analog may through multiple mechanisms of action including lethal mutagenesis specific or nonspecific chain termination and inhibition of nucleotide biosynthesis to eliminate rna viruses 38 it has been approved for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus rsv by fda 39 and contraindicated to autoimmune hepatitis hemoglobin disease impaired kidney function creatinine clearance below 50 ml per minute pregnant females or males with pregnant partners and allergies to it 40 due to its broad-spectrum antiviral effect it was widely used in the early stages of the sars epidemic however the role ribavirin play is controversial on the one hand severe side effects such as hypoxia anemia and decreased hemoglobin levels are related to the use of high-dose ribavirin 41 the other hand contradictory results from clinical observation experiments 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 in cell culture ribavirin has an inhibitory effect on sara-cov-2 but requires higher concentrations ribavirin is not recommended for antiviral treatment in diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus disease from military medical team supporting wuhantrial version 2 but has been included in the guidelines for the prevention diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus-induced pneumonia trial version 7 which recommend low-dose ribavirin 500 mg each time 2 to 3 timesday combined with lopinavirritonavir or interferon instead of monotherapy a trial comparing effectiveness and safety of ribavirin plus interferon-alpha lopinavirritonavir plus interferon-alpha and ribavirin plus lopinavirritonavir plus interferon-alpha in patients with mild to moderate novel coronavirus pneumonia is in progress chictr2000029387 the antiviral effect of ribavirin in the combination of multiple drugs is not clear and clinical trials need to be confirmed table 1
 the antiviral interferon system plays a critical role in the innate immune defense in human beings ifns are cytokines produced by cells when meeting viruses 49 at present ifns are approved for indications such as hepatitis b hepatitis c and various malignancies by the fda in patients infected with sars-cov and mers-cov the ifns production is suppressed 5051 which is confirmed to be responsible for activating pro-inflammatory monocyte macrophages and cytokines in the lungs of the sars mouse model 52 effect of ifn monotherapy or combined with ribavirin was observed in vitro and animal models if given early in the disease 53 54 55 56 however in clinical trials combination therapy with ifn did not show good curative effect and prognosis 4357 58 59 which might occur due to medication delay and multiple organ damage caused by subcutaneous medications 57 guidelines 17 for the prevention diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus-induced pneumonia trial version 7 recommend interferon inhalation as early as possible which ensuring higher levels of the drug in lung tissue and longer drug circulation time than subcutaneous injection it should be noted that nebulized interferon is contraindicated in patients with spontaneous pneumothorax and pulmonary bullae at present the corticosteroid use is controversial in covid-19 on the one hand corticosteroids suppress lung inflammation and cytokine storms which is essential for covid-19 patients especially severe and critical patients on the other hand increased secondary infection rate and delayed virus clearance can be found in sars and influenza pneumonia patients using corticosteroids 60 61 62 a small observational study of patients with covid-19 showed potential benefits from low-dose corticosteroid treatment in critically ill patients despite no significant improvement in overall survival 63 ni et al 64 retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 72 patients with covid-19 and found that there was no statistically significant difference in the time of viral nucleic acid negation and lung image recovery between the low-medium dose glucocorticoids methylprednisolone 075-15 mgkgd treatment group and the non-glucocorticoid control group glucocorticoid immunosuppressive therapy does not prolong virus clearance time in patients with covid-19 suggesting that hormone therapy may be helpful to severe patients a study reviewed the clinical data of 112 cases in wuhan red cross hospital with the treatment of low dose methylprednisolone when mild and common cases became severe and critical and found that the optimal window period for low dose methylprednisolone treatment of covid-19 is within 48 hours after switching from mild condition to severe or critical the early administration of low dose methylprednisolone within the window period for these patients could significantly reduce the critical illness rate and mortality rate 65 the expert consensus statement in china 66 recommends low-to-moderate corticosteroid 05-1 mgkg per day methylprednisolone or equivalent should be used carefully in critically ill patients with covid-19 and the duration should be short 7 days tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized antibody that specifically binds the interleukin-6 il-6 receptor to inhibit the activity of the il-6 licensed for adult rheumatoid arthritis and cytokine release syndrome 67 il-6 has long been considered as one of the key cytokines that induce cytokine storms among patients with covid-19 il-6 was significantly higher in severe and dead patients than in mild and discharged patients 368 for the reasons above the first affiliated hospital of university of science and technology of china initiated a multicenter randomized controlled trial for the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in the treatment of covid-19 chictr2000029765 in the first phase of the clinical study 14 patients with covid-19 pneumonia maximum age of 82 years 9 of whom were severe and 2 of who were critically ill had diffuse lesions in both lungs before treatment of which 11 had a persistent fever after treatment with the new treatment regimen of tocilizumab combined conventional therapy the temperature of 11 patients with fever fell to normal within 24 hours 4 patients had better absorption of ct lesions in the lungs xu et al 69 also found similar results in observational studies therefore for patients with severe conditions caused by a cytokine storm tocilizumab is a drug worthy of clinical research there have been five clinical trials in addition to that mentioned above on trastuzumab in progress for patients with extensive infiltrating lesions of the lungs and severe patients with elevated il-6 tocilizumab treatment can be tried the recommended dose is 400 mg and the cumulative dose is up to 2 times and medical staff should pay attention to allergic reactions and exclude active infections such as tuberculosis 17 in the absence of particularly effective medicines from western medicine chinese medicine has played a unique advantage in improving immunity and improving symptoms in china more than 90 of people use traditional chinese medicine for treatment 70 chinese medicine physicians summarized the law and experience of traditional chinese medicine in the treatment of viral infectious diseases deeply explored ancient classic recipes combined with clinical practice thus selecting a group of prescription drugs represented by the three drugs and three prescriptions with obvious curative effects jinhua qinggan granules lianhua qingwen capsules xuebijing injection qingfeipaidu decoction huashibaidufang and xuanfeibaidufang jinhua qinggan granule and lianhua qingwen capsule are used in no confirmed suspected cases the former is mainly used for patients with headache as the main symptom and mild fever symptoms while the latter is used for patients with severe fever and dry stool qingfei paidu decoction is a general prescription for mild severe and critical covid-19 patients 71 in the treatment of severe and critically ill patients xuebijing injection may be a very important therapeutic drug xuebijing injection has a curative effect on the inflammatory storm and coagulation dysfunction early clinical studies have proved that xuebijing has a certain effect in severe pneumonia 72 some observational studies 73 74 75 suggested that traditional chinese medicine can improve patients symptoms inflammation and promote the absorption of lung infections however there is a lack of reliable rct researches in covid-19 based on the currently reported retrospective studies on covid-19 6476 77 78 79 80 81 we found that most people received two or more antiviral therapy in combination because it depends on the patients liver and kidney function whether there is complications and adverse reactions there are various combinations the most common combinations are the following interferon ifn  lpvr ifn  arbidol oseltamivir  arbiodol ifn  lpvr  arbidol a multicenter prospective study of 237 patients showed the triple combination antiviral therapy of ifn lpvr and arbidol showed shorter viral shedding time and hospitalization time compared with the dual combination antiviral therapy of ifn and arbidol and the earlier the time to initiate triple antiviral treatment the shorter the time of virus shedding 82 in addition some studies have suggested that troponin is elevated in some severe and critically ill patients 4 90 the most likely cause is myocardial damage caused by inflammatory storms cardioprotective drugs such as coenzyme q10 trimetazidine hydrochloride and creatine phosphate and vitamin c could be used in severe and critical patients to improve cardiac energy metabolism 58 in elderly patients the hematopoietic function of liver kidney heart and bone marrow declines with age and there are more underlying complications and drug treatments it is necessary to pay attention to the interaction between antiviral drugs and treatment drugs for basic diseases and close monitoring and individualized treatment is required in conclusion there are no antiviral drugs proven to be effective currently antiviral drugs should be used carefully to reduce viral replication in the early stages of disease based on the dynamic results of clinical trials while it is not recommended to use antiviral drugs for the prevention of covid-19 since the antiviral effects of lpvr and arbidol are not apparent and gastrointestinal adverse reactions frequently occur the therapeutic effect of the above two drugs on covid-19 still needs further evaluation based on the current clinical trial results and clinical medication experience we recommend favipiravir and interferon for patients with mild to moderate conditions given the good results of the clinical trial of remdesivir are focused on severe patients currently we recommend it for severe patients chloroquine is another antiviral drug that has the potential to have an effect on severe patients due to its immunosuppressive effect in addition to the antiviral effect in critically ill patients low-to-moderate corticosteroid and tocilizumab should be used to combat cytokine storms and reduce mortality with caution the authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this work  psychiatric aspects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine treatment in the wake of covid-19 psychopharmacological interactions and neuropsychiatric sequelae brandon hamm s lisa rosenthal j   chloroquine was developed subsequent to the bark extract quinine for the treatment and prophylaxis of malaria1 due to potential toxicity and drug resistance chloroquine and quinine are no longer in frequent use2 both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are currently under investigation as possible treatments for patients infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which causes the disease covid-19 several mechanisms have been suggested to explain how chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may be therapeutic for covid-1934 including inhibition viral binding to host cell ace2 receptor is the mechanism for viral entry into host cells inhibition of viral replication enzymes via raising host cell organelle ph and de-escalation monocyte cytokine production decreasing immune-mediated host tissue damage these mechanisms could serve to inhibit virus entry into neurons and glia slow replication of the virus in the brain and other tissues and de-escalate the neuroinflammatory response and delirium risk chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been shown to inhibit sars-cov-2 in vitro5

6 a chinese commentary reported early favorable results in placebo-controlled trials of chloroquine treatment of covid-197 and based on this early data the department of science and technology of guangdong province and health commission of guangdong province have published chloroquine dosing recommendations for covid-198 others have published recommendations to consider hydroxychloroquine instead of chloroquine for covid-19 treatment citing a superior side effect profile9 higher mortality was shown in with covid-19 treatment with higher dose chloroquine 600 mg twice daily relative to a lower dose 450 mg twice daily in a phase ii double-blinded randomized clinical trial10 one large registry found increased mortality with chloroquine treatment as well as increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia11 likely due to the appeal of hydroxychloroquines superior side effect profile relative to chloroquine more research is currently published on hydroxychloroquine treatment of covid-19 one placebo-controlled randomized trial of 62 patients showed faster covid-19 recovery time with hydroxychloroquine than placebo12 and a large retrospective study suggested hydroxychloroquine benefits and minimal adverse effects13 in contrast many observational studies have not detected a mortality benefit with hydroxychloroquine treatment of covid-1914-17 and some studies even suggest net adverse outcomes with hydroxychloroquine treatment for covid-19 cardiac gastrointestinal11

 in summary chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are not clearly evidenced to be beneficial in treatment of covid-19 at this time but are under further investigation and are being used more hydroxychloroquine in the us in the setting of highly limited treatment options psychiatrists and other physicians may encounter patients on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 treatment and this review aims to summarize the current psychiatric research on these medications to enable physicians to clarify what drug-drug interactions and possible neuropsychiatric side effects may need to be considered in clinical care chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been in clinical use for over 50 years19 and both historic and current data relevant to psychiatry is presented first pertinent pharmacokinetic considerations and drug-drug interactions are discussed second potential for qt prolongation is reviewed we then provide an overview of central nervous system side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine followed by a comprehensive description of the current literature on neuropsychiatric side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine finally more common alternate etiologies for psychiatric presentations in hospitalized patients with covid-19 are briefly discussed references for this review were identified through searches performed in pubmed for articles published from january 1950 to march 2020 combining the terms chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with terms psychiatry neurology neuropsychiatry depression anxiety psychosis delirium encephalopathy memory suicide cyp450 and qtc articles resulting from these searches and relevant references cited in those articles were reviewed articles were included with novel or recent content both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have a large volume of distribution with variable but prolonged elimination half-lives ranging from 40-60 days19 chloroquine is known to be a mild 2d6 inhibitor20 and a substrate for cyp2c8 and cyp3a4 with minor cyp2d6 metabolism21 hydroxychloroquine is also a mild inhibitor of cyp2d6 and is metabolized by similar cyp450s to chloroquine cyp2d6 2c8 3a4 and 3a522 potential cyp450 interactions among psychiatric medications and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are listed in table 1
and table 2
 in addition both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are partially renally excreted and require dose adjustment in renal insufficiency to reduce risk of toxicity24 both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine demonstrate dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation25

26 one study showed possible synergism for cardiovascular thromboprophylaxis with five or more years of concomitant administration of aspirin and hydroxychloroquine25 but we were unable to find any studies evaluating the thrombotic impact of co-administering chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine concomitantly with psychiatric medications known to inhibit platelet aggregation such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors27
 both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been suspected to prolong the qt interval however the clinical significance of this is unclear while some studies demonstrate qt prolongation others do not28 a 2018 systematic review of published prospective trials with chloroquine did not demonstrate increased risk of sudden deaths attributed to cardiac arrhythmias29 nevertheless several case reports describe episodes of torsades de pointes tdp for patients on chloroquine30 and hydroxychloroquine31

32 in the setting of increased cardiac vulnerability and frequent exposure to qtc-prolonging agents ex azithromycin during hospitalization for covid-19 the fda released a drug safety communication warning that addition of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine may increase risk of negative cardiac outcomes33 it is reasonable for psychiatrists to anticipate that the risk of tdp may be increased in combination with medications known to prolong the qt interval such as antipsychotics tricyclic amines or hydroxyzine see funk 2020 for a more comprehensive review of qt interval prolongation with psychiatric medications34 increased risk of tdp in overdose on chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine by suicidal patients is certainly another relevant consideration for psychiatrists the most common central nervous cns system side effects of chloroquine are headache 64 dizziness 53 and insomnia 4535 dose-dependent retinopathy can occur with chloroquine less-frequent with hydroxychloroquine and this requires monitoring with careful attention to the need for dose adjustment19 in general the side effects with hydroxychloroquine are similar to those with chloroquine but are less common19 infrequent case reports have also reported dystonia and generalized tonic-clonic seizures after chloroquine administration35 36 37 38
 early symptoms of cns toxicity include nausea and vomiting dizziness and headache followed by delirium and seizures36 chloroquine has a narrow therapeutic window with rapid onset of toxicity symptoms36 and a 10-35 risk of mortality in overdose39

40 another factor for psychiatrists to consider in patients with risk of overdose cns toxicity and neuropsychiatric effects may occur at therapeutic doses36

37

41 hydroxychloroquine overdose has less data but can also be fatal42
 several mechanisms of chloroquine have been proposed as contributors to chloroquine neuropsychiatric side effects inhibition of neuronal calcium currents43 dopamine excess37

44 prostaglandin e antagonism45 spermidine excess46 acetylcholine dysfunction47 further cns levels of chloroquine are elevated 10-30 times over serum levels48 possibly influenced by interference with p-glycoprotein function in the blood-brain barrier49 hydroxychloroquine is proposed to have many similar properties to chloroquine and often hydroxychloroquine mechanisms of action are assumed based on chloroquine studies19

50
 neuropsychiatric events such as depression mania psychosis and catatonia present in less than 1-2 of patients on chloroquine35

51

52 these events also seem to present less with hydroxychloroquine exposure than chloroquine exposure research regarding these phenomena is largely composed of case series and case reports and is described in the sections that follow although overall incidence is unknown cases of psychosis following chloroquine have been described since 195853 a retrospective study by biswas and colleagues describes 51 cases diagnosed as psychosis following chloroquine over the course of 10 years extracted from the records of 22 psychiatric units in areas of india were malaria is hyperendemic41 the inclusion criteria in this study were reasonable and included diagnostic criteria for substance-induced mood disorder hallucinations or delusions in the absence of delirium a minimum of 1 week of psychiatric symptoms psychosis onset within 6 weeks of chloroquine initiation at least one 150 mg tablet exposure and resolution within 8 weeks of discontinuing chloroquine levels were not drawn so it is unclear what proportion of cases featured toxic levels this study demonstrated that these psychosis presentations most commonly featured combined psychotic and affective symptoms 762 of cases the most prevalent affective presentation was irritability with a mixed mood episode consistent with case series prior to this study37

38 psychotic episodes were demonstrated to be prolonged mean duration to resolution was 2962 days after discontinuation of chloroquine41 psychosis following chloroquine is often described to feature derealization or depersonalization37

41

48 and biswass study found this was most present following significant stressors41 the most common positive symptoms in the study were visual hallucinations and most cases did not feature negative symptoms41 additionally psychosis is typically not related to pre-morbid psychiatric history and patients are reported to have preserved insight during psychosis following chloroquine37

41

48 a dose-response relationship between chloroquine dose and risk of psychotic symptoms has not been demonstrated41 chloroquines prolonged half-life and high cns penetration are mechanisms proposed to explain the prolonged psychotic symptoms course after chloroquine discontinuation37

41
 no studies were found regarding the incidence of hydroxychloroquine-induced psychotic symptoms six case reports describe psychosis suspected to be associated with hydroxychloroquine in diverse circumstances and were temporally related by hydroxychloroquine prescription preceding the onset of psychosis and resolving with hydroxychloroquine discontinuation hydroxychloroquine was prescribed for lupus presentations in three of these cases 54 in one report the patient was suspected to have cns toxicity due to a pharmacy error resulting in ten-day exposure to an excessive hydroxychloroquine dose40 another case featured a patient with borderline personality disorder who developed auditory and kinesthetic hallucinations as well as suicidal ideation during two hydroxychloroquine exposures five years apart55 it is not clearly documented in all cases how lupus cerebritis was ruled out as a psychosis etiology but one author utilized the naranjo probability scale to evidence a hydroxychloroquine induced psychosis etiology56 the other three cases describe diverse psychotic presentations in the setting of hydroxychloroquine treatment for rheumatoid arthritis57 q fever50 and erosive plantar lichen planus58 the patient with rheumatoid arthritis developed disorganized psychosis with neurovegetative features57 another patient being treated for q fever demonstrated an array of hallucinations auditory and visual as well as formication without disorientation or fluctuation of alertness50 the final case was notable for concomitant methylprednisolone exposure as well as an atypical psychotic presentation early nightmares followed by depersonalization and cenesthetic hallucinations false perception of viscera movement58
 mood episodes without psychotic symptoms associated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine exposure may occur in a 1962 case series by drew 43 of 21 patients treated with chloroquine for rheumatoid arthritis developed mild to severe depression one severe enough to warrant electroconvulsive therapy59 the presence of rheumatic diseases could be a confounder for depression etiology in this small case series larger sample malaria chemoprophylaxis studies do not demonstrate association of chloroquine exposure with such high incidence of depressive symptoms although it is feasible that the higher doses of chloroquine used in treatment of rheumatological conditions could present an increased risk of incident depression than the lower doses used in malaria chemoprophylaxis in a 1993 study evaluating a database of 40726 persons on antimalarial chemoprophylaxis with chloroquine 300 mg weekly depression was documented in 14 of persons35 of note the chloroquine dosing in this study is less than the dosing being used for covid-19 treatment in a 2009 four arm randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of mood profiles during malaria chemoprophylaxis the study arm with 154 patients treated with chloroquine did not demonstrate increased depression symptoms compared to controls60 of note the chloroquine dose in this study 100 mg per day is less than that used for covid-19 further the studys placebo group only took placebo for the first 1 week of a more than 6-week trial transitioned to drug exposure after 1 week decreasing the validity of the placebo comparison finally a 2013 nested case-control analysis of over 7 years of data from the united kingdom general practice research database demonstrated that the 34 cases of incident depression while on chloroquine chemoprophylaxis did not reflect a significant difference in depression risk compared to controls53 a problematic feature of this study was that an incident case of depression would be linked to chloroquine if exposure was within 540 days prior to general practitioner diagnosis of depression which seems like and inappropriately long duration at ascribe association despite the apparent low frequency of chloroquine-associated depression in malaria chemoprophylaxis studies several case reports describe patients who developed severe depressive episodes often with suicidal ideation and psychotic features within days of chloroquine exposure38

61

62 a common feature of these cases was resolution of the depressive symptoms within several days of discontinuing chloroquine completed suicide via overdose on chloroquine has been previously reported and fatal overdoses are possible at just a few times the therapeutic dose often at 2 to 4 gram overdose62 this should evoke caution in prescription of chloroquine for patients experiencing active suicidal ideations several case reports describe manic episodes during chloroquine exposure37

64 although no systematic studies are published in these reports onset of manic presentations was approximately one week after initiation of chloroquine exposure with resolution 1-2 weeks after discontinuation of chloroquine classic manic symptoms were present in described cases with notable grandiosity and frequent religiously-themed delusions patients were treated with haloperidol and chlorpromazine as well as electroconvulsive therapy in one patient who developed catatonia mood episodes associated with hydroxychloroquine have received less research attention in a 2013 naturalistic study of patients receiving treatment for rheumatoid arthritis n 115 the 31 subjects on hydroxychloroquine did not demonstrate an elevated risk for depression compared with other treatment groups65 however the patients on hydroxychloroquine scored significantly higher on severity of suicidal ideation in the beck scale for suicidal ideation mean  1694  1109 than patients on methotrexate or leflunomide severity of suicidal ideation for patients taking hydroxychloroquine was still much lower than with exposure to the biologic therapies ex rituximab mean  2573  382 given that this was a naturalistic study clinical features that prompted decision for the one treatment over another could represent confounders in group comparison and this was not clearly controlled for in the study it is unclear whether this data can be meaningfully generalized to the context of persons taking hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 prophylaxis or treatment a 2018 review by mascolo and colleagues evaluated the reports of hydroxychloroquine psychiatric side effects entered into the eudravigilance pharmacovigilance database of the european medicine agency from 2001 to 201766 70 cases of depression were reported as well as 53 cases of completed suicide causation of these outcomes by hydroxychloroquine is certainly not clear from this pharmacovigilance data however the data do raise questions that warrant more formal study anxiety has not received much attention as a psychiatric side effect of chloroquine although several case reports have described panic episodes attributed to chloroquine exposure37

38 in these cases anxiety symptoms resolved within a few days of chloroquine discontinuation in the 1966 case series by drew some patients described increased claustrophobia and nightmares during chloroquine exposure46
 in the european medicine agency pharmacovigilance database from 2001 to 2017 32 cases of anxiety disorders were reported in the setting of hydroxychloroquine exposure as well as 59 cases of insomnia66 further in the previously referenced 2013 study by pinho de oliveira ribeiro patients on hydroxychloroquine treatment for rheumatoid arthritis were found to screen positive on the anxiety subscale of the hospital anxiety and depression scale hads-a mean  11 sd  26865 the anxiety scores in this group were significantly higher than scores of patients on methotrexate or leflunomide similar to the affective data from this rheumatoid arthritis treatment study this data may not generalize well to the context of persons taking hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 prophylaxis or treatment some attention has been directed to consideration of hydroxychloroquine as an intervention for neurodegenerative disorders based on its impact on lysosomal ph and immune system activation a 2019 retrospective study in a large sample of patients with connective tissue disorders did not demonstrate a significant change in risk of developing alzheimers dementia for patients exposed to chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine67 further in a 2018 double-blinded randomized controlled trial of 168 subjects with early alzheimers disease the group with 18 months of treatment with hydroxychloroquine did not demonstrate significant difference compared to the placebo regarding dementia progression cognitive performance or behavior changes68
 although no thorough studies on neuropsychiatric symptoms of covid-19 have been published at the time this article was written psychiatric presentations are expected to be common in hospitalized patients with covid-19 due to etiologies other than chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine-induced neuropsychiatric side effects delirium has anecdotally been frequent in patients requiring intensive care critically ill patients frequently become delirious and may present with confusion aggression mood changes hallucinations delusional thinking or other neuropsychiatric symptoms69 additionally survival of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards complicated by delirium has been associated with increased incidence of post-traumatic stress symptoms70 in the study by mao et al71 nervous-system related clinical findings were present in 364 of 214 hospitalized covid-19 cases with the most common findings being stroke ataxia seizure and depressed level of consciousness prevalence of neurological symptoms was increased to 455 in severe covid-19 cases additionally a study of 58 patients with covid-19 and ards showed that 69 of patients had agitation and 65 were confused when neuromuscular blockade was discontinued72 within the discharged subgroup in this study 33 demonstrated executive dysfunction in addition to the physiological impact of covid-19 and treatment exposures ie sedatives prolonged mechanical ventilation several authors had noted that isolation introduces barriers to nonpharmacological measures to decrease the risk of delirium73 although a detailed consideration the pathophysiology and treatment of delirium in covid-19 is beyond the scope of this article but comprehensive articles have been published elsewhere73 74 75 additionally case reports have been published regarding covid-19 infection complicated by steroid-responsive encephalitis76 psychosis in non-delirious patients77 and acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy78
 increased depression anxiety memory deficits insomnia and post-traumatic stress disorder ptsd symptoms were demonstrated in survivors of sars-cov-1 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections and these may be symptoms present in covid-19 survivors as well79 further in a survey one year after h1n1 influenza-associated ards survivors reported high anxiety depression and post-traumatic stress disorder ptsd80 patients hospitalized for pandemic-related infections who do not experience delirium may also experience adjustment disorder with depressive andor anxious symptoms as well as ptsd81 survivors of hospitalization for pandemic-related infections may also express pessimistic views anger due to perception of rejection by society and survivor grief82 although no covid-19 pandemic suicidology studies have been published at the time of this writing some authors predict increased suicidality based on previously demonstrated correlations with increased unemployment83 and based on increased suicide rates during the 2003 sars-cov-1 epidemic84 given the high expected incidence of psychiatric presentations during covid-19 hospitalization the infrequent neuropsychiatric side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may be very difficult to clinically isolate in this population though may be more clear to isolate in the setting of prophylactic use anticipation of potential neuropsychiatric sequela from chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine treatment of covid-19 requires extrapolation of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine research in treatment of rheumatological disease and chemoprophylaxis for malaria neuropsychiatric side effects are uncommon in patients on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine although they are better described with chloroquine exposure than hydroxychloroquine exposure psychiatric symptom presentation during hospitalization for covid-19 infection is much more likely to be due to delirium and adjustment disorder than neuropsychiatric side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine the most studied neuropsychiatric phenomenon with these medications is psychosis following chloroquine which may be prolonged in its resolution conversely psychosis induced by hydroxychloroquine has been described only in a few case reports and should be expected to be quite rare weak evidence suggests potential for increased anxiety symptoms or suicidal ideation with hydroxychloroquine exposure although this evidence is based on a very limited research with unclear generalization given that pandemic stressors and neuropsychiatric sequelae of covid-19 could possibly synergize with this possible increased suicide risk attributable to hydroxychloroquine best practice may include screening for suicidal ideation and performance of a suicide risk assessment for patients on hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 prophylaxis or treatment appropriate clinical practice can be better clarified by future research studying the association of hydroxychloroquine with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts particularly in the setting of covid-19 prophylaxis or treatment further psychiatric considerations include chloroquine and hydroxychloroquines mild cyp2d6 inhibition the potential for psychiatric medications to impact chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine levels and toxicity and the potential increased risk of tdp when chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is combined with psychiatric medications that prolong the qt interval the neuropsychiatric effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine when used for treatment of covid-19 have not been previously studied future research regarding the incidence and phenomenon of neuropsychiatric side effects in this clinical context may be helpful to guide future risk stratification

exchange and promotive association for medical and health care cpam recommend using anti-sars properties of lopinavir and ritonavir capsule for older age covid-19 patients with the underlying condition and serious symptoms these capsules should be used for emergency cases chu et al 2004 huang et al 2020 y h jin et al 2020 we used covid-19 instead of sars-cov-2 in the following text human have long been infected by coronavirus as it is one of those responsible for the common cold it is a contagious viral infection that can be spread through inhalation or ingestion of viral droplets as a result coughing and sneezing and touching infected surface are primary sources of infection the coronavirus genome is comprised of 30000 nucleotides it encodes four structural proteins nucleocapsid n protein membrane m protein spike s protein and envelop e protein and several non-structural proteins nsp figure 1 the capsid is the protein shell inside the capsid there is nuclear capsid or n-protein which is bound to the virus single positive strand rna that allows the virus to hijack human cells and turn them into virus factories the n protein coats the viral rna genome which plays a vital role in its replication and transcription the n-terminal of the n protein which is binding to genomic and sub-genomic rnas in mhv and ibv virions and process the viral replication and transcription this is one of the important open research problems the developing of an effective drug targeting to prevent the contacts between n-terminal of n-protein and single positive rna strand which can stop viral replication and transcription sarma et al 2020 reported that two important class of compounds theophylline and pyrimidone drugs as possible inhibitors of rna binding to the n terminal domain of n protein of coronavirus thus opening new avenues for in vitro validations the m-protein is most abundant in the viral surface and it is believed to be the central organizer for the coronavirus assembly the s-protein is integrated over the surface of the virus it mediates attachment of the virus to the host cell surface receptors and fusion between the viral and host cell membranes to facilitate viral entry into the host cell kirchdoerfer et al 2016 the e-protein is a small membrane protein composed 76 to 109 amino-acid and minor component of the virus particle it plays an important role in virus assembly membrane permeability of the host cell and virus-host cell interaction gupta et al 2020 a lipid envelop encapsulates the genetic material hemagglutinin-esterase dimer he have been located on the surface of the viral the he protein may be involved in virus entry is not required for replication but appears to be important for infection of the natural host-cell lissenberg et al 2005 state-of-the-art cryo-em experiments have revealed the full structure of the spike s protein in the close pdb id 6vxx walls et al 2020 and open prefusion states pdb id 6vyb wrapp et al 2020 such glycoprotein is made of three identical chains with 1273 amino acid each and it is composed by two well-defined protein domain regions s1 and s2 subunits which are associated to cell recognition and the fusion of viral and cellular membranes respectively the latter process occurs through different protein conformational changes that remain still uncharacterized the mechanism of viral entry and replication and rna packing in the human cell is mapped in figure 2 the coronavirus spike s protein attaches to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors that is found on the surface of many human cells including those in the lungs allowing virus entry the coronavirus s protein is subjected to proteolytic cleavages by host proteases ie trypsin and furin in two sites located at the boundary between the s1 and s2 subunits s1s2 site in a later stage happens the cleavage of the s2 domain s2 site in order to release the fusion peptide this event will trigger the activation of the membrane fusion mechanism searching for antibodies can find support on molecular targeting which can utilize the structural information aa sequence of the binding region which is found in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in this way this protocol could device a treatment to block the viral entry typically human cell ingests the virus in a process called endocytosis once entered the cytoplasm it has been suggested most likely that covid-19 employs a unique three-step method for membrane fusion involving receptor-binding and induced conformational changes in spike s glycoprotein followed by cathepsin l proteolysis through intracellular proteases and further activation of membrane fusion mechanism within endosomes simmons et al 2005 then the endosome opens to release virus to the cytoplasm and uncoating of viral nucleocapsid n is started via proteasomes which typically can hydrolyse endogenous proteins but they are also capable of degrading exogenous proteins such as the sars nucleocapsid protein q wang et al 2010 a different two-step mechanism has been suggested li 2016 and in this case the virion binds to a receptor on the target host cell surface through its s1 subunit and the spike is cleaved by host proteases hasan et al 2020 and then it is expected the fusion at low ph between viral and host target membranes via s2 subunit finally the viral genetic material a single stranded rna is fully released into the cytoplasm there takes place the replication and transcription processes which are mediated by the so-called replicationtranscription complex rtc such complex is encoded in the viral genome and it is made of non-structural proteins nsp the rtc is believed to induced double-membrane structures in the cytoplasm of the infected cell van hemert et al 2008 following the positive rna genome is translated to generate replicase proteins from open reading frame 1ab orf 1ab see figure 1 these proteins use the genome as a template to generated full-length negative sense rnas which subsequently serve as templates in generating addition full-length genomes structural viral proteins m s and e are synthesized in the cytoplasm and then inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum er figure 2 and transfer to endoplasmic reticulum-golgi intermediate compartment ergic masters 2006 song et al 2004 also in the cytoplasm nucleocapsids are formed from the encapsidation of replicated genomes by n protein and as a result they coalesce within the ergic membrane in order to self-assembly into new virions finally novel virions are exported from infected cells by transport to the cell membrane in smooth-walled vesicles and then secreted via a process called exocytosis so that can infect other cells in the meantime the stress of viral production on the endoplasmic reticulum eventually leads to cell death however the mechanism of action for novel covid-19 is still unknown masters 2006 the covid-19 replicase gene encoded two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab with molecular weight 450 and 750 kd respectively these polyproteins are required for viral replication and transcription wu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020  in the proteolytic process the functional polypeptides of spike membrane envelop nucleoprotein replicase and polymerase are released from polyproteins this process was carried out by a chymotrypsin-fold proteinase namely main protease mpro anand et al 2003the mpro is a vital role in polyprotein processing and virus maturation hence it is considered to be an attractive target for antiviral drug design as an approach toward covid-19 treatment anand et al 2003 pillaiyar et al 2016 yang et al 2003 the chinese scientists have first published the genome and with overseas collaboration have obtained the crystal structure of three-dimensional novel covid-19 main protease mpro and deposited in the protein data bank z jin et al 2020 the crystal structure of covid-19 mpro has 306 amino acids with the three regions in the first region represented in blue contains 8-101 residues second region in green are 102-184 residues and third region in orange are 201-303 residues the first and third regions have an antiparallel -sheet structure third region has five alpha helices arranged into a cluster the third region is connected to second region through a long loop region contains 185-200 residues mass spectroscopy determined the weight of covid-19 mpro is 337970 da theoretical studies confirmed the weight is 337968 da z jin et al 2020 furthermore in the literature several crystal structure of covid-19 mpro see figure 3 in complex with different inhibitor are deposited in the protein data bank httpspdbjorgfeaturedcovid-19 by using x-ray diffraction technique at resolution between 131  and 3084  covid-19 featured content 2020 on the other hand the hiv-1 protease inhibitors tipranavir saquinavir ritonavir nelfinavir lopinavir indinavir darunavir atazanavir and amprenavir are widely reported to be able to deactivate mpro yang et al 2003 the covid-19 e-protein is a short and integral membrane protein that contains 76-109 amino acids size ranging between 84 and 12 kda consist of 35 -helices and 40 loops the protein has short hydrophilic amino terminus consisting of 712 amino acids followed by a large hydrophobic transmembrane domain of 25 amino acids long hydrophilic c-terminal domain shown in box the hydrophobic region can generate oligomerization and form an ion-conductive pore in membranes it plays a significant role in the assembly of the viral genome this protein is involved in several aspects of the virus life cycle such as assembly budding envelope formation and pathogenesis schoeman  fielding 2019 e proteins ion channel activity is found in the transmembrane region of the protein verdi-bguena et al 2012 wilson et al 2004 the membrane potential has been regulated by e-protein controlling the ion flow between the intracellular and extracellular environment the ion conductivity triggered by e-protein via the manipulation of covid-19 genome seems to be a novel route involved in virus pathogenesis although the e-protein has been interacted with other coronavirus proteins as well as host cell proteins e-proteins ion channel activity and the alteration of coronavirus cell ion balance by e-protein is a necessary process for virus production but the effect of e-protein ion channel activity in virus pathogenesis remains elusive  few efforts have been found that mutation of the e-protein in the extracellular membrane could disrupt the ion-conductivity and the normal viral assembly torres et al 2007 verdi-bguena et al 2012 hence control the e protein dynamics is a promising target for preventing pathogenesis associated with the covid-19 pervushin et al 2009 for example nieto-torres et al 2014 have demonstrated that mice infected with covid-19 viruses exhibited e-protein ion channel activity with wild-type e-protein sequence that restored ion transport resulting in the mice death with the loss of weight in contrast mice infected with mutant e-protein showed lack of ion channel activity and has result they recovered from the disease and most survived this evidence confirmed that ion channel activity correlated well with the virus growth the strong e-protein ion channel activity is generated a higher chance for the mortality of mice is observed hence inhibitor target to e-protein process can help to prevent virus production in this respect wilson et al showed that hexamethylene amiloride inhibitor has shown to block the e-protein ion channel conductance in cell membrane and inhibits replication of the parent coronavirus in cultured cells wilson et al 2006 recently gupta et al 2020 have identified the medicinal properties of belachinal macaflavanone e and vibsanol b inhibitors which are successfully passed the admet test and lipinskis rule 5 s these compounds are reduced the random motion of the human covid-19 e protein in terms of inhibiting the function of the human covid-19 e protein so far our understanding about the mechanism of the e-protein ion channel activity in the viral assembly is an ongoing debate this is one of the most important research topics to investigated which deals with e-protein ion channel activity in viral production to reduce the mortality rate of diseased human by deletion of e-protein by inhibitor yang et al z jin et al 2020 f wang et al 2017 yang et al 2005 have designed michael acceptor n3 inhibitors are found to have an optimal pharmaceutical activity against viral protease through mechanism-based irreversible inhibition they also evaluated a series of wide-spectrum inhibitors targeting the mpro proteases of multiple coronaviruses including sars and mers ren et al 2013 f wang et al 2017 xue et al 2008 yang et al 2005 and also exhibited an antiviral activity for infectious bronchitis virus in an animal modelxue et al 2008 it fights to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus which causes high mortality in pigs as well as covid-19 f wang et al 2017 recently jin et al 2020 have constructed a homology model for covid-19 mpro and they used molecular docking to monitor whether the n3 binds with it the docking showed that n3 binds with the covid-19 mpro as shown in right side figure 4 subsequently the crystal structure of covid-19 mpro in complex with n3 inhibitor have been determined at 23  resolution and deposited in the protein data bank pdb id 6lu7 where the n3 inhibitor binds with the residues of 164-168 in the long strand 155-168 residues and with residues 189-191 of the loop connecting between second and third region further it can form several hydrogen bonds with the main chain of the residues in the substrate-binding pocket the contact between n3 and covid-19 mpro is locked the inhibitor inside the substrate binding pocket several x-ray studies covid-19 featured content 2020 demonstrated that small antiviral compound including lopinar zhao et al 2008 is locked in the same position of n3 in the substrate-binding pocket as shown in left side of figure 4 figure s1 and table s1 the second region of the covid-19 mpro is the favorable position for the inhibitors binding yang et al 2003 zhao et al 2008 in the literature the number of small bioactive compounds reported has reached 135 million bostrm et al 2018 in this regard researchers should device strategies to identify an anti-covid-19 mpro properties candidate based on structure-based virtual screening computational approach nowadays the drug repurposing has been used to identify potential drugs against coronavirus enormous efforts have been paid for the ability to reuse fda approvedpreclinical trial drugs for the disease in the literature we find several promised drugs candidate targeted to multiple virus protein graham et al 2013 khan et al 2020 yang et al 2003 the who has provided the permission to doctors and scientist carry out the trial test with the combination of different fda-approved drugs for covid-19 treatment in the view of urgency and current need to reduce the cost time and risks of the drug development process scientists are involved in reusing already approved drug candidates to test in covid-19 patients in a short time the response of the scientific community is such that involve enormous efforts to develop a novel therapy and treatment for example chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine old drugs have been used to treat malarial rheumatoid arthritis lupus and sun allergies for more than sixty years the activity of hydroxychloroquine on viruses is probably same as that of chloroquine since the mechanism of the action of these two molecules is identical chloroquine as an antimalarial and autoimmune disease drugs has shown a synergistically enhancing effect as antiviral drugs in vivo studies savarino et al 2006 yan et al 2013 it interferes with terminal glycosylation of cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 this may negatively influence-receptor binding and abrogate the infection with further ramifications by the elevation of vesicular ph resulting the spread of sarscov in cell culture has been prevented vincent et al 2005 the hydroxychloroquine has shown a potent efficacy in treating patients with covid-19 pneumonia more than hundred patients showed the superiority of chloroquine compared with treatment of standard care in terms of reduction of exacerbation of pneumonia viral load and symptoms chinese clinical trial registry nd gao et al 2020 colson group have suggested that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as available weapons to fight covid-19 colson et al 2020 in 2014-2017 ivermectin antiviral drug used for phase 3 treatment of dengue infection daily oral dose significantly reduced in serum level of viral ns1 protein caly et al 2020 have demonstrated ivermectin-treatment can reduce 5000-fold viral rna load compared to the control sample in cell cultural at 48 h but no further reduction observed at 72 h mulangu et al 2019 have conducted a trial of four investigational therapies for ebola virus diseased patients a total of 681 patients were registered between november 18 2018 and august 9 2019 the patients were assigned 1111 ratio to receive zmapp a triple monoclonal antibody agent remdesivir a nucleotide analogue rna polymerase inhibitor mab114 a single human monoclonal antibody derived from an ebola survivor and regn-eb3 a coformulated mixture of three human igg1 monoclonal antibodies both mab114 and regn-eb3 groups were superior than zmap and remdesivir group in reducing mortality for ebola patients primary groups have faster rate of viral clearance than later groups remdesivir has been promised antiviral drug against rna viruses including sarsmers in cultured cell mice and nonhuman primate model sheahan et al 2017 it is under the clinical development for ebola virus treatment and typically it is distributed in the entire human body including lung after oral administration sheahan et al 2017 tested a remdesivir inhibitor that has shown activity against ebola virus as a potential agent to be used to combat coronaviruses unfortunately it could not be help to ebola patients during the 2019 outbreak in the democratic republic of the congo a coronavirus research at the university of iowa suggested that remdesivir antiviral acting much more potential if patient takes it early patients with mild symptoms kai kupferschmidt  cohen 2020 importantly m wang et al 2020 study reported that remdesivir and chloroquine are highly effective in the control of covid-19 infection in vitro experiments the first covid-19 patient 35-year-old in washington admitted to a hospital on 15 january 2020 in the united states because of dry cough two-day history of nausea and vomiting holshue et al 2020 he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain the important signs fever cough rhinorrhea fatigue nausea vomit diarrhea and abdominal discomport were in normal condition he had high fever 394 c with cough at the eleventh day of hospitalized on the evening of same day clinical began treatment with intravenous remdesivir next day his clinical condition had improved as january 30 he was still hospitalized but his symptoms had resolved exception of cough which has decreased in severity cao et al 2020 have conducted trial test using lopinavir-ritonavir antiviral drugs for covid-19 patients a total of 199 patients were enrolled for the test 99 patients were assigned to the lopinavir-ritonavir group remaining 100 patients to be treated in the standard care group resulting the mortality rate was similar in both lopinavir-ritonavir group and standard care group they found that lopinavir-ritonavir treatment failed to significantly accelerate clinical improvement reduce mortality diminish throat viral rna detectability in patients with serious covid-19 in case of the severe covid-19 adult patients no benefit was observed with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment in comparison to the standard care group such study has found that lopinavir-ritonavir does not seem to be effective for covid-19 patients and these combinations has produced more side effects cao et al 2020 in summary the antiviral drugs alone and in combination have been tested in human body all showed some evidence of effectiveness against sars and mers they seem not to be effective for covid-19 baden  rubin 2020 azithromycin has been displayed an antiviral property against zika and ebola virus in vitro bosseboeuf et al 2018 madrid et al 2015 retallack et al 2016 it can prevent severe respiratory tract infection in the case of viral infected patients bacharier et al 2015 gautret group have treated successfully chronic disease patients with long-term hydroxychloroquine medicines with 600 mg per day for 12 to 18 months as 17 march 2020 a paper reported gautret et al 2020 they are monitored the viral load in the covid-19 patients with and without receiving drugs for the six days they have examined a total of 36 patients 20 hydroxychloroquine-treated patients and 16 control patients among hydroxychloroquine-treated patients six patients received azithromycin with 500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg per day for the next four days at day 6 100 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination have cured comparing with 571 in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine only and 125 in the control group finally they found that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination have cured the covid-19 patients but the drawback of this study is used a very small size of survey z jin et al 2020 have screened a library of 10000 compounds which are consisting of approval drugs clinical trial drugs and natural products they were used combined structural-based abinitio drug design and high-throughput screening to identified two drugs of these compound are ebselen and thiadiazolidinone-8 tdzd-8 quantitative real-time rt-pcr demonstrated that in comparison to treatment in the absence of inhibitor treatment of ebselen reduced the amount of covid-19 by 203-fold and tdzd-8 and n3 n3 inhibitor designed by z jin et al 2020 that can inhibit multiple coronavirus mpro s including those from covid-19 and mers-cov showed 109-fold and 84-fold reduction in covid-19 growth respectively these data suggested that ebselen as a potential antiviral inhibitor for covid-19 treatment doctors team reported a large doses of the flu drug oseltamivir combined with hiv drugs lopinavir and ritonavir could improve the conditions of several covid-19 patients at the rajavithi hospital in bangkok httpswwwthe-scientistcomnews-opinionflu-and-anti-hiv-drugs-show-efficacy-against-coronavirus-67052 based on the report gromica et al muralidharan et al 2020 have utilized computational docking approach to analysed the effect of synergism of these drugs against the covid-19 main protease they found that the combination of three drugs lopinavir oseltamivir and ritonavir showed a better binding energy than that of individual drug and they reported the protein in complexed with three drugs are stable during the simulations the cpam china international exchange and promotive association for medical and health care recommends to take lopinavir 400 mg ritonavir 100 mg two tablets by mouth twice in daily or chloroquine 500 mg tablet by mouth twice in daily for older patients or patients with under underlying conditions and serious symptoms in case chloroquine is unavailable consider to use of hydroxychloroquine 400 mg by mouth once daily it cannot be recommended to take ribavirin and interferon drug because of the high risk for side effects but these drugs may be considered if treatment with lopinavir ritonavir chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are ineffective chu et al 2004 gao et al 2020 huang et al 2020 y h jin et al 2020 to this end some drugs have become promises other are being ruled out including lopinavir and ritonavir mix of two drugs used to treat hiv disease so far trial test results are confirmed as fda-approved therapeutics or drugs have not helped to treat cure or prevent covid-19 other most important research on plasma therapy is ongoing several convalescent patients are donating plasma against covid-19 based on the positive results of another coronavirus koenig 2015 mair-jenkins et al 2015 surprisingly it has preliminarily obtained favourable results in severe covid-19 patients on the other hand the recombinant human monoclonal antibody is a straightforward path to neutralize viral load of covid-19 cr3022 is a coronavirus-specific human monoclonal antibody that can bind to the receptor-binding domain of covid-19 this has the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics of covid-19 disease tian et al 2020 other monoclonal m396 cr3014 antibodies neutralizing covid-19 that may be an alternative for the treatment of more severe cases zhang  liu 2020 effective antiviral-covid-19 candidates are essential for reducing disease severity viral load and transmission thus helping to prevent the coronavirus outbreaks there are several drugs against sars-cov mers-cov tested in animals and infected viral cell in lab and proteins vaccines graham et al 2013 these investigations are in progress but it requires months to years to develop the vaccines for covid-19 so far the infected virus patients population is growing rapidly the organized effort of the computational community is becoming very essential to infer about the structural characteristics of the virion with and without the

protein the protein-ligand contacts of the stable ligand-receptor complex cqd15-6lu7 was studied by using the protein-ligand contact histograms figure 9 dariya  nagaraju 2020 protein-ligand interactions or contacts are categorized into four types hydrogen honds hydrophobic ionic and water bridge hydrogen bonds play a significant role in ligand binding consideration of hydrogen-bonding properties for drug design is important because of their strong influence on drug specificity metabolization and adsorption hydrogen bonds between a protein and a ligand can be further broken down into four sub-types backbone acceptor backbone donor side-chain acceptor and side-chain donor the geometric criteria for protein-ligand hydrogen bond is of 25  between the donor and acceptor atoms dha a donor angle of 120 between the donor-hydrogen-acceptor atoms dha and an acceptor angle of 90 between the hydrogen-acceptor-bondedatom hax the histogram shows the active site amino acids mainly gln-107 gln-110 thr-111 asn-151 asp-153 tyr-154 asp-295 interacting through hydrogen bonding figure 9 hydrophobic contacts fall into three subtypes like -cation - and other non-specific interactions these types of interactions involve a hydrophobic amino acid and an aromatic or aliphatic group on the ligand some hydrophobic amino acids like val-104 ile-106 tyr-154 ile-249 pro-252 phe-294 and val-297 showing hydrophobic interactions with the ligand figure 9 ionicinteractions or polar interactions are between two oppositely charged atoms that are within 37  of each other and do not involve a hydrogen bond all ionic interactions are broken down into two subtypes those mediated by a protein backbone or side chains asp-153 and asp-245 are showing minimal ionic interaction with the ligand figure 9 water bridges are hydrogen-bonded protein-ligand interactions mediated by a water molecule the hydrogen-bond geometry is slightly relaxed from the standard hydrogen bond definition the current geometric criteria for a protein-water or water-ligand hydrogen bonds are a distance of 28  between the donor and acceptor atoms dha a donor angle of 110 between the donor-hydrogen-acceptor atoms dha and an acceptor angle of 90 between the hydrogen-acceptor-bondedatom hax almost all the major interacting amino acids are showing water bridges figure 9 in this protein-ligand contact histograms some amino acids were showing highly effective interactions like asp-153 and phe-294 having 62 and 83 time interactions in 6lu7-cqd15 complex of 100 ns simulation a timeline representation of the interactions and contacts hydrogen bonds hydrophobic ionic and water bridges summarized in the ligand-receptor interaction histogram study analysed in the following two panels in figure 10a b the top panel shows the total number of specific contacts the protein makes with the ligand in each and every trajectory frame the number of contact varies zero to nine over the course of the trajectory figure 10a the contribution of amino acids in each trajectory frame of 100 ns md simulation was studied from ligand-protein interaction bottom panel figure 10b the bottom panel shows which amino acid residues interact with the ligand in each trajectory frame some residues make more than one specific contact with the ligand in a particular trajectory frame which is represented by a darker shade of orange according to the scale to the bellow the plot the 6lu7-cqd15 receptor-ligand complex shows two deep bands phe-294 and asp-153 row which explains that the above amino acid have more interactions with the ligands in almost all possible orientations geometry which is exactly similar as histogram results a series of computational approaches used to identify more effective drug candidate against sars-cov-2 the pharmacophore modelling molecular docking mmgbsa study and adme property analysis combinedly concluded with 3 ligands cqd15 cqd14 and cqd16 which have good docking score ligand-receptor interactions pharmacophore-based structural features and drug likeness property in comparison to chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine the ligand-receptor md simulation study validates the molecular docking study by exploring the protein stability rmsd various ligand property and protein-ligand contacts further in vitro analysis followed by its in vivo testing may help in proving cqd15 ligand as a better inhibitor of sars-cov-2 the whole study concludes that derivatives of chloroquine may play a prominent role for the treatment of covid-19  clearance of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine by the seraph  100 microbind  affinity blood filter -approved for the treatment of covid-19 patients title elimination of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine by the seraph  100 malin-theres seffer jens martens-lobenhoffer julius schmidt j gabriele eden stefanie bode-bger m jan kielstein t   in july 1934 johann hans andersag synthesized chloroquine by replacing the acridine ring of atabrine with a quinoline ring 1  he then developed the drug into a salt of the base using 24-dihydroxy-benzoic acid naming it resochin as it was the resorcinate of a 4-aminochinolin after an initial clinical test in 4 psychiatric patients by bayer in 1935 it was found to be too toxic for practical use in humans 1  it took ten years before chloroquine was back into the clinical arena in the context of a malaria trial sponsored by the us government today it is on the world health organizations list of essential medicines ie it is considered to belong to the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health care system chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are used to prevent and treat malaria rheumatoid arthritis lupus erythematosus and morbus boeck both 4-aminoquinolines have recently gained a lot of attention dozens of clinical trials of chloroquine hydroxychloroquine or both sometimes in combination with other drugs like remdesivir are currently under way the animated controversy about its potential benefits and risks in treating covid-19 patients is aggravated by methodological flaws 2 in high impact publications 3  the underlying rational for their use is the fact that they were found to block covid-19 infection at low-micromolar concentration 4  especially hydroxychloroquine is assumed to attenuate the progression of covid-19 through inhibiting the cytokine storm by reducing cd154 expression in t cells 5  in april 2020 the united states food and drug administration granted coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 emergency use authorizations for medical devices including extracorporeal blood purification devices for none of those devices it is known whether or not they decrease the concentration of both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine one of the devices is the seraph  100 microbind  affinity blood filter produced by exthera medical martinez ca usa first licensed in the european economic area in 2019 6  the aim of this study was to investigate the in-vitro adsorption of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine from human plasma in a life size approach using equipment that is also used at the bedside blood plasma was obtained from five voluntary donors during regular therapeutic plasma exchange tpe treatments due to various indications patients received neither chloroquine nor hydroxychloroquine written informed consent was given by every patient the removed plasma of a single tpe treatment was stored at 4c and used within 24 hours 50 mg of chloroquine-phosphate and 50 mg hydroxychloroquine-sulfate diluted in 10 ml of normal saline each was injected into about 1000 ml blood plasma that was placed into an empty bag with luer-lock connectors this bag served as the patient dummy with nominal concentrations of about 140 gml chloroquine and 175 gml hydroxychloroquine each the fluid was mixed well for 3 min for anticoagulation 2500 iu unfractionated heparin was added we primed a standard hemoperfusion blood tubing system fresenius medical care germany as well as the seraph  100 microbind  affinity blood filter exthera medical ca usa with a total filling volume of about 2200 ml with plasma and connected the dummy patients plasma bag with luer-lock tubing with the hemoperfusion circuit the multifiltrate fresenius medical care gmbh germany was used to pump the plasma through the adsorber as described previously 7  in brief using a standard tubing set of the multifiltrate a roller pump propelled the plasma from one port of the plasmabag through the seraph back into the second port of the plasma bag at a rate of a 250 mlmin the plasma bag was continuously shaken during the procedure to ensure mixture of the plasma the experiment was repeated five times with different plasma bags from different donors visual controls were performed on the plasma bag as well as all the drawn samples to detect possible drug precipitations this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved a plasma sample of the whole plasma c 0  was obtained after mixing the chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with the plasma after start of the hemoperfusion pre c pre  seraph  plasma levels were obtained at 5 c 5  10 c 10

clearance one aliquot of the whole plasma sample was stored at room temperature without passing through the seraph  to determine drug stability plasma levels from this control samples were determined at the same intervals described above written informed consent was obtained from the voluntary plasma donors the study was performed in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and german federal guidelines plasma concentrations of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were measured by a validated hplc method applying uv-detection plasma samples 100 l were prepared for analysis by addition of 100 l 01 trifluoroacetic acid and 20 l of 25 m perchloric acid for plasma protein precipitation after 5 min centrifugation at 10000  g 20 l of the clear supernatant was injected into the hplc system chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were separated by gradient elution on an agilent zorbax sb-c18 5 m 21150 mm column the gradient started with 95 01 trifluoroacetic acid and 5 methanol evolved in 8

analytes were detected at a wavelength of 343 nm under these conditions chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were specifically separated from each other and from endogenous plasma constituents precisions and accuracies of the method were 116 and 664 for chloroquine and 125 and 539 for hydroxychloroquine respectively the seraph  plasma clearance cl of both drugs was assessed at 5 and 120 minutes into the procedure was calculated based on the plasma flow q e  and extraction ratio using the equation cl drug  q e  c pre -c post   c pre  calculations were performed using graphpad prism 8 san diego ca usa this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved all five in vitro runs using the hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine spiked plasma could be carried out as planned for 120 min we found no significant drug plasma clearance during the 120 min procedure median iqr plasma clearance of the seraph for hydroxychloroquine was 179 021 -368 mlmin figure  for chloroquine the median plasma clearance of the seraph was 171 051 -438 mlmin figure  a slight decrease in plasma levels of both drugs after connecting our dummy patient plasma bag with about 2200 ml spiked plasma from the start of the procedure to the first drug level into the procedure at 5 minutes this decrease was  10 for both investigated substances and due to the fact that the dummy patient was connected to the plasma filled tubing system including the seraph  about 200 ml that contained neither hydroxychloroquine nor chloroquine in other words the first drop in plasma concentration was dilution no additional decrease in drug plasma levels was observed during the experiment for either of the drugs on visual control neither the plasma bag nor the drawn samples showed signs of drug precipitations

charcoal hemoperfusion removal could be shown in vitro 10  the lack of drug removal of the seraph  can be explained by the distinct structure ie ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene beads with endpoint-attached heparin to which bacteria viruses fungi and toxins have been shown to bind interestingly there are no data available on other medical devices that received emergency use clearance by the fda for the treatment of covid-19 thus it is there unknown whether chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have to be adapted in their dose due to removal we wish to point out an important limitation of this in vitro study the investigated drugs medium was human plasma rather than whole blood therefore interactions between cellular blood components the seraph  chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could not be investigated by this study however hydroxychloroquine is not significantly bound to red blood cells but only to white blood cells that just make up 1  of the blood volume 11  time course

nathalie wurtz jean-marc rolain philippe colson bernard la scola didier raoult   since the end of 2019 the world has encountered pandemic conditions attributable to a novel coronavirus sars-cov 2 1 2 3 this is the 7th coronavirus identified to infect the human population 145 and the first one that had pandemic potential in non-immune populations in the 21st century 6 finding therapeutics is thus crucial and it is proposed to do so by repurposing existing drugs 7 8 9 this strategy presents the advantages that safety profiles of such drugs are known and that they could be easily produced at relatively low cost thus being quicker to deploy than new drugs or a vaccine chloroquine a decades-old antimalarial agent an analog of quinine was known to inhibit the acidification of intracellular compartments 10 and has shown in vitro and in vivo mice models activity against different subtypes of coronaviruses sars-cov-1 mers-cov hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 11 12 13 14 15 16 in 2004 it was tested in vitro against sars-cov 17 and caused a 99 reduction of viral replication after 3 days at 16 m moreover tests in vitro have shown inhibition of viral replication on sars-cov 2 detected by pcr and by cck-8 assay 18 hydroxychloroquine hydroxychloroquine sulfate 7-chloro-4-4-n-ethyl-n-b-hydroxyethylamino-1-methylbutylaminoquinoline sulfate has shown activity against sars-cov2 in vitro and exhibited a less toxic profile 19 this drug is well known and currently used mostly to treat autoimmune diseases and also by our team to treat q fever disease 2021 and whipples disease 2223 in those clinical contexts concentrations obtained in serum are close to 041 gml at the dose of 600 mg per day over several months 24 clinical tests of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat covid-19 are underway in china 25 with such trials using hydroxychloroquine in progress in the us clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04307693 and in europe with the discovery trial in this drug repurposing effort antibacterial components have also been tested teicoplanin a glycopeptide was demonstrated in vitro to inhibit cellular penetration of ebola virus 26 and sars-cov 2 2627 azithromycin azithromycin dihydrate a macrolide n-methyl-11-aza-10-deoxo-10-dihydroerythromycin a has shown antiviral activity against zika 28 29 30 azithromycin is a well-known and safe drug widely prescribed in the us for example with 12 million treatment courses in children under 19 years of age alone 31 a recent study has identified these two compounds azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine among 97 total potentially active agents as possible treatments for this disease 32 in a preliminary clinical study hydroxychloroquine and with even greater potency the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were found effective in reducing the sars-cov-2 viral load in covid-19 patients 33 since the beginning of the epidemic in the marseille region we isolated numerous strains and we tested one of them the sars-cov-2 ihumi-3 using different concentrations of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in combination with vero e6 cells the procedure of viral isolation of our sars-cov 2 strain ihumi-3 was detailed elsewhere 33 the viral production was done in 75 cm2 cell culture flask containing vero e6 cells american type culture collection atcc crl-1586 in minimum essential media gibco thermofischer mem with 4 of fetal bovine serum and 1 glutamine cytopathic effect was monitored daily under an inverted microscope fig 1
 after nearly complete cell lysis approximately 96 h viral supernatant was used for inoculation on 96-well plate we determined the tcid50 of the strain at 5105 infectious particles per ml briefly we prepared 96-well plates with 5105 cellsml of vero e6 200 l per well using mem with 4 of fetal bovine serum and 1 l-glutamine plates were incubated overnight at 37 c in a co2 atmosphere drug concentrations tested expressed in micromoles per liter m were 1 2 or 5 m for hydroxychloroquine associated with 5 or 10 m for azithromycin each test was done at least in triplicate and repeated two times except conditions with 5 m for hydroxychloroquine associated with 5 or 10 m for azithromycin that were repeated a third time four hours before infection cell culture supernatant was removed and replaced by drugs diluted in the culture medium at t  0 virus suspension in culture medium was added to all wells except in negative controls where 50 l of the medium was added multiplicity of infection moi was of 025 then rt-pcr was done 30 min post-infection in one plate and again at 60 h post-infection on a second plate for this 100 l from each well was collected and added to 100 l of the ready-use vxl buffer from qiacube kit qiagen germany the extraction was done using the manual high pure rna isolation kit roche life science following the recommended procedures the rt-pcr was done using the roche realtime pcr ready rna virus master kit the primers were designed against the e gene using the protocol of amrane et al 34 in the roche lightcycler 480 instrument ii relative viral quantification was done compare to the positive control viruses without drugs by the 2delta delta ct method 35 we performed a statistical analysis using graphpad prism v900 graphpad software la jolla california usa distribution of the data not followed a normal law so non parametric kruskal-wallis test was used to compare each combinations against positive controls using ct between h0 and h60 then dunns test was used to correct the multiple comparison all test was used at p  005 parameter and were bilateral two-sides and significant p-value was indicated on fig 2
 all others conditions was not significant no cytotoxicity was associated with drugs in combination in all 13 control wells without viruses we detected rna viral production from 25 to 16 cycle-thresholds ct inversely correlated with rna copy numbers for the positive control that was associated with cell lyses in all cases cell lyses at 60 h was correlated with viral production as compared to control fig 1 combination of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine led to significant inhibition of viral replication for wells containing hydroxychloroquine at 5 m in combination with azithromycin at 10 and 5 m p-values at 00003 for a10h5 and at 00004 for a5h5 fig 2a with relative viral inhibition of 975 and 991 respectively fig 2b others conditions were not significant in agreement with the relative viral rna load reduction a cytopathic effect could be observed in 531 wells at 60 h post infection as compared to 1313 in positive controls in the work we identified a strong synergistic effect of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin hydroxychloroquine has been demonstrated in vitro to inhibit replication of sars-covs 1 and 2 1719 concentrations of drugs for our study were based on the known cytotoxicity of the drugs 50 of cytotoxicity cc 50 and their effect on microorganisms 50 inhibitory concentration ic50 with zika virus azithromycin showed activity with an ic 50 range from 21 to 51 m depending on moi 28 without notable effect on ec 50 at high concentration 29 the observation of efficacy of azithromycin on rna viruses is probably shared by some other macrolides clarithromycin or the non antibiotic macrolide em900 were observed as effective on rhinovirus in vitro 36 37 in vivo sulfate of hydroxychloroquine could be imply in the modulation of the immune response by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and by modification of the lysosome acidification procedure 38 those aspects may play a keystone role in severe cases of sars-coronaviruses indeed in mouse models from sars-cov pneumonia and lung affections was associated with cytokines storm 39 in parallel azithromycin was known as inhibit the viral replication of zika virus in vitro 29 and in enlarge viral infection context azithromycin was associated to up-regulate interferons i and iii 30 concerning the respiratory syncytial virus it was also shown that macrolides reduce the acidity of the lysosome and by the down-regulation of the icam-1 protein 36 so in the sars-cov 2 context azithromycin could potentialize the effect of hydroxychloroquine by similar mechanism on vero e6 it was shown that for hydroxychloroquine cc 50 is close to 250 m 24950 m which is significantly above the concentrations we tested herein 19 against sars-cov 2 the ic 50 of hydroxychloroquine was determined to be 451 406 1731 and 1296 m with various moi of 001 002 02 and 08 respectively one of the main criticisms of previously published data was that drug concentrations for viral inhibition used in vitro are difficult to translate clinically due to side effects that would occur at those concentrations the synergy between hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin that we observed herein is at concentrations achieved in vivo and detected in serum 35 and pulmonary tissues 3637 respectively our data are thus in agreement with the clinical efficacy of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin observed by gautret et al 33 they support the clinical use of this drug combination especially at the early stage of the covid-19 infection

the need for an evidence base fabio taccone s julie gorham jean-louis vincent   with the rapid spread of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 critical care physicians are seeing increasing numbers of patients with acute respiratory failure secondary to coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and reporting mortality rates of 4065 for those requiring mechanical ventilation1strikingly higher than the mortality rates reported for the more typical acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with other diseases2 the focus of therapeutic intervention has therefore been not only to reverse hypoxaemia and provide adequate organ support but also to decrease viral load and thus limit disease severity in addition to several antiviral agents antimalarial drugs have been proposed as treatments that could reduce transmission of the virus in-vitro studies have shown that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can both inhibit sars-cov-2 transmission3 4 5 through alkalinisation of the intracellular phagolysosome which prevents virion fusion and uncoating and therefore viral spread early results from clinical studies conducted in china suggest that chloroquine use might have been associated with reduced fever increased resolution of lung lesions on ct and delayed disease progression6 7 results of two french studies suggested that hydroxychloroquine could reduce the viral load in patients with covid-19in particular if combined with azithromycin8 9 table
 on the basis of these preliminary findings chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been prescribed to patients to reduce the length of hospital stay and improve the evolution of covid-19-related pneumonia nevertheless the recently published surviving sepsis campaign guidelines on the management of critically ill patients with covid-19 concluded that there was insufficient evidence to offer any recommendation on the routine use of these drugs in patients admitted to the intensive care unit icu10 how can we explain these discrepancies and how should antimalarial drugs be used in the clinical management of patients in the icu with severe covid-19 first hydroxychloroquine is not expensive is readily available and seems to be safe however clinical observations of the effects of this drug in patients with covid-19 have not included critically ill patients who are receiving several other medications and have organ failure such as hepatic or renal dysfunction which might influence drug metabolism and potentially increase the risk of adverse events second clinical data on hydroxychloroquine are far from convincing the first study reported by philippe gautret and colleagues8 which indicated that hydroxychloroquine might be effective had several limitations a small cohort of patients with only 20 participants who received hydroxychloroquine six of whom received azithromycin and 16 controls included in the final analysis a very short observation period 6 days absence of randomisation raising concerns about selection bias and imbalance of baseline characteristics in the intervention and control groups and no report of effects on clinical evolution 6 17 patients were asymptomatic and only 8 22 had pneumonia the second french study although larger had no control arm9 moreover the inclusion and exclusion criteria were poorly described most patients 69 of 75 92 had a low national early warning score and the overall clinical outcome was similar to that reported for untreated patients with covid-1911 the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was associated with reduced viral load 83 and 93 tested negative on days 7 and 8 respectively but no other clinically relevant outcomes were reported in a trial in 30 patients with covid-19 jun chen and colleagues found no significant difference in nasopharyngeal viral carriage on day 7 when hydroxychloroquine was compared with local standard of care however concomitant antivirals were given which might have served as confounders when interpreting the results of this study12 in a second chinese trial in 62 patients zhaowei chen and colleagues showed that hydroxychloroquine treatment was associated with a shorter time to clinical recovery temperature and cough than placebo13 the participants had mild disease sao2spo2 93 or pao2fio2 300 and it is not possible to extrapolate these results to critically ill patients a study of 11 patients with covid-19 reported persistence of sars-cov-2 in the nasopharyngeal swab in 8 of 10 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine14
 third whether viral load is important in critically ill covid-19 patients or whether progressive lung involvement is related to an overwhelming inflammatory response unrelated to the virus remains to be clarified an observational study found that high viral load was associated with disease severity13 however the influence of antiviral strategies in such advanced forms of the disease remains unproven fourth the search for effective new drugs requires appropriate and valid trialsie prospective randomised placebo-controlled clinical studies although many drugs have in-vitro activity against the virus the proposal that such drugs might provide more benefit than harm is inappropriate in the face of no clinical evidence supporting efficacy and safety in patients with covid-19 international multicentre studies such as the discovery study nct04315948 and the solidarity study eudract number 2020-000982-18 will randomise patients with covid-19 to receive different antiviral drugs including hydroxychloroquine in an adaptive study design these initiatives will provide important data to guide the management of patients with covid-19 and help to improve understanding of the effects of antiviral therapies in critically ill patients whether antimalarial drugs could be effective in changing the disease course in patients with severe covid-19in particular in cases requiring icu admissionremains unknown moreover for patients receiving antimalarial drugs who then require icu admission it is not known whether the drug should be continued or considered clinically ineffective and stopped assessing viral load either on a nasopharyngeal swab or in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid might be of use in understanding whether targeting viral replication rather than other injurious lung pathways is a reasonable therapeutic strategy future studies should aim to clarify the precise role if any of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in critically ill patients with covid-19  pharmacists readiness to deal with the coronavirus pandemic assessing awareness and perception of roles iman basheti a razan nassar muna barakat rajaa alqudah rana abufarha tareq mukattash l bandana saini   according to the centres for disease control and prevention cdc usa epidemic refers to a rapid increase in cases of a disease over what is the normally expected occurrence in a particular community or geographic area with significant population proportions affected in that area1 epidemic escalate to a pandemic when the disease spreads over wider geographical zones across countries and continents and affects a higher number of people all over the world1 in recent months the world health organization who and cdc declared the coronavirus infectious disease coronavirus disease 2019 termed covid-192

 pharmacists are a part of the health care system and their role is critical in completing the management cycle of coronavirus outbreak10 on the march 19 2020 the international pharmaceutical federation fip released a guideline to clarify the required coronavirus information for pharmacists and the pharmacy workforce11 in addition this guideline stipulated the responsibilityrole of both community and hospital pharmacists in the control of this outbreak11
 pharmacists need to be engaged in the coordinated efforts during pandemics and be readily adaptive to changes required in pharmacy practice as fip advocated community pharmacies in outbreak-affected and unaffected countries are often the first point of contact with the health system for those with health-related concerns or simply in need of information and reliable advice11 hence it is important to explore how pharmacists around the world are managing their customary and newly emerging roles during the covid-19 outbreak from macau china home of the outbreak it was documented from the perspective of the authors that pharmacists had roles in ensuring the stable supply of key medicines providing information about the coronavirus infection performing early detection of cases and appropriate referral and implementing government arrangement such as the guaranteed mask supply scheme10 another study from china acknowledged that community pharmacy management teams shall support different services by providing adequate supply of covid-19 related medications and preventative products in addition to providing sufficient staff trainings12 from colombia community pharmacists were proposed to contribute to the early detection and appropriate referral of possible cases of the virus then to be reported through designated telephone lines in addition to providing patient education13 from the united arab emirates uae it was stated that pharmacists can also play a role in promoting an empathy culture to help in preventing the stigmatization of infected individuals based on ethnicity population or nationality and by broadcasting facts in their communities via various media14 it is expected that pharmacists around the world are finding their ways to contribute to the collaborative forces in combating the spread of the virus but for pharmacists to assume a role in humanitarian and health emergency settings the application of real-world data10 in addition to the provision of tailored training programs taking into consideration all aspects including the psychological impact of such roles are vital15

16 published research so far provide reference for pharmacists on providing patient care services to improve patients outcomes and make a contribution to the control of the pandemic no previous study has looked into pharmacists own perspective of their role in the management of the coronavirus pandemic their awareness of important facts needed to be able to deliver their roles successfully and the source of such facts the aim of this study was to investigate pharmacists and pharmacy students preparedness to take part in the management of epidemics and pandemics specifically we investigate participants awareness of important facts regarding the current coronavirus pandemic and the source of their information as well as their perspective of pharmaceutical professional roles during this emergent situation the study objectives were addressed in a descriptive cross-sectional online survey this study was conducted in jordan during the coronavirus outbreak from 15 to 30 march 2020 eligible participants were licensed pharmacists practicing in community and hospital pharmacies in jordan academics and pharmacy students ethics approval for the study was obtained from the faculty of pharmacy applied science private university participation in the study did not pose any risk to participants and was voluntary potential participants who completed the survey were considered to have given informed consent for participation in the study following an extensive review of the literature9

18 the leading research team developed the first draft of the questionnaire the questionnaire was administered in english since english is the official language of education for pharmacists in jordan several sources were used to generate a pool of questions considered to be relevant to the study objectives the questions were tabled and reviewed by the research team in order to combine concepts and to remove duplicates if any to ensure face validity the first draft of the questionnaire was evaluated by six independent academics who have previous experience in pharmacy practice and education they informed the research team if any of the items in the questionnaire were not clear or difficult to comprehend comments and feedback provided were considered by the research team and then incorporated where appropriate to develop the final version of the questionnaire finally the research team revised the items as necessary to make them concise and to fit for online administration the final version of the questionnaire was organized into three main sections addressing different topics of interest the first section included items to collect demographics data the second section included items aimed at assessing potential participants current epidemicspandemics and covid-19 awareness here potential participating pharmacists were asked about how much they know about the coronavirus including a symptoms b modes of transmission c how to prevent the transmission and the spread of the virus and d awareness about where to access the latest coronavirus updates regarding treatment for each of these sections there were several detailed items eg participants when asked for example were probed about the modes of coronavirus transmission such as if the virus can be transmitted from the respiratory droplets from person to person among close contacts and after touching surfaces that were contaminated by the virus19 other questions investigated participants awareness regarding the highest risk patients in addition to the symptoms that are associated with coronavirus such as fever dry cough shortness of breath muscle aches and gastrointestinal symptoms19 the latest coronavirus updates on treatment were questioned for example if hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin have been used as a preventive therapy against coronavirus infection or if oseltamivir is being used in the management of the coronavirus infection19 20 21 22 23 another question assessed the awareness concerning the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen when there is an infection24

25 other questions in the treatment section were about whether the use of some drugs glucocorticoids and autoimmune disease medications increase the susceptibility to contract coronavirus infection26

27 participants awareness of how to prevent the transmission and the spread of the virus was assessed in depth as well such as if washing hands with soap and water for 20 s would be enough to clean the hands also the least distance that should be kept while counseling patients 2 m6 feet19

28

29 two questions were about exercise the first one asked if exercise causes antibodies and white blood cells to circulate more rapidly in the body therefore detecting and combating infections at an early stage and the second question asked if the brief rise in body temperature during and after exercise prevents bacterial growth thus increases the bodys ability to fight the infection17

30 the rest of the questions were about the immune system and ways to boost it to combat the viral infection17

32 for example participants were asked if protein-calorie malnutrition increases the opportunistic infection33

34 and the role of garlic mushrooms vitamin c and d was also questioned not smoking and the importance of decreasing stress to boost immunity was also questioned35 36 37 and finally the effect of sunlight in activating the t-helper cells in order to boost the immunity was questioned38 participants were asked to provide their email to receive the answers for the awareness questions once the study was completed if they wished to receive this information potential participants were also given the choice to view the correct answers via a facebook page designed for this study all items in this section required a truefalsenot sure response the third section concentrated on the potential participants perspective of the role of the pharmacist during epidemics and pandemics and the new coronavirus pandemic it included 8 closed-ended questions the participants responses to this sections used a likert scale answer ie strongly agree agree neutral disagree or strongly disagree study participants were recruited through social media facebook and whatsapp those willing to consider participation could open a link to initially view ethics committee approved information about the study and then proceeding to the survey at the end of the data collection phase 7 days the correct answers for the awareness part in the survey were made available to the participants as informed in the information section to improve their awareness about coronavirus prevention symptoms and proposed treatment based on the number of licensed pharmacists in amman 15045 sample size calculation using a margin of error of 5 confidence level of 95 and response distribution of 50 a minimum sample size of 375 pharmacies is needed for pharmacy students a sample size calculation was performed using the following formula n  p  100 - p  z2d2 where p is the anticipated prevalence prevalence of awareness here d is the desired precision z is the appropriate value from the normal distribution for the desired confidence using 95 confidence level 5 precision level and 50 anticipated prevalence of inappropriate awareness this conservative prevalence value results in the highest possible sample size that can be used in this study as no previous studies in this area were found to indicate other prevalence of inappropriate awareness a sample size of 385 was considered representative of this sampling frame data were analyzed using statistical package for social science spss version 22 spss inc chicago il usa the descriptive analysis was undertaken using mean and standard deviations for continuous variables and percentage for qualitative variables checking for data normality was carried out using the shapiro-wilk test with p-value 005 indicating a normally distributed continuous variable group differences between students and pharmacists were explored using chi-squared analysis screening of the factors affecting participants awareness score about coronavirus pandemic was carried out using linear regression for multiple linear regression analysis using entry method the variable entry criterion was set to 025 ie any variables found to be significant on the single predictor level p  025 were entered into the multiple linear regression analysis to explore the variables that were significantly and independently associated with participants awareness score variables were selected after checking their independence where tolerance values  01 and variance inflation factor vif values were 10 were selected to indicate the absence of multicollinearity between the independent variables in regression analysis the homoscedasticity assumption for multiple linear regression was checked using breusch-pagan test with a p  005 indicating the absence of heteroscedasticity the sample size required for the study was reached n  726 with a mean age of 269 years table 1
 a majority of participants were females 719 and not marriedsingle 726 participants came from private 541 and public universities 459 with the majority having a bachelors in pharmacy degree 402 pharmacy students made up 353 of the sample while the rest ranged between pharmacy owners pharmacy employees hospital pharmacists pharmacy trainees academics and others most of the participants lived in amman the capital of jordan if not a student most of the participants had graduated recently from the university 15 years ago 281 and hence 15 years was the years of experience reported by the majority of participants 788 many participants did not attend any educational workshop last year 266 while few attended 5 or more workshops 44 and 88 respectively while only 543 of the participants believed that they got enough education previously about epidemicspandemics most of them 946 reported that they currently followed the latest coronavirus updates on treatments quite closely fig 1
 with regards to the sources of information about coronavirus treatment study participants reported that they obtain their information mostly from the general media followed by the who reports published research papers and facebook fig 2
 when assessing awareness about coronavirus pandemic responses demonstrated that more than half of the participants knew the appropriate answers to the items except for two items the first item you need to keep a distance of at least 3 m 10 feet when counseling patients during a pandemic where the more appropriate answer in the jordanian context would be 2 m 6 feet as sufficient the second item was the highest population risk category for people contracting coronavirus are elderly 65 immune-compromised people or children under the age of 9 children under the age of 9 are not amongst the highest risk people in contracting the coronavirus table 2
 yet 811 of participants chose this statement as true for the rest of the awareness items more pharmacist 813 than student participants 699 knew that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen may theoretically increase the risk of complications when used during viral infections p  0001 and that muscle aches and gi symptoms nauseavomitingdiarrhea could be associated with coronavirus infections p  0001 the case was the same for the items stating that steroids may increase the susceptibility to coronavirus infection in some cases hydroxychloroquine has not been trialed as a preventative therapy against coronavirus infection azithromycin has been trialed along with hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of the coronavirus infection and that oseltamivir can be used in the management of coronavirus infection p  0001 for all hence overall the awareness score out of 20 the higher the score the higher the awareness of pharmacists was significantly higher p  0001 than that of students fig 3
 multiple linear regression analysis of factors affecting awarenesss cores among study participants highlighted that older age study group being a pharmacist versus a student graduating from a public university versus a private university attending educational workshops on a yearly basis significantly affected the awareness level of participants table 3
 more than 70 strongly agreedagreed expressed as believed after here that they have a major role in the management of pandemicsepidemics through their pharmacies and that it is their role to ensure the availability of key medications fig 4
 more than 90 believed that it was their role to counsel people about coronavirus infection and how to reduce the transmission and the spread of disease and that they should ensure their personal safety by avoiding close contact with all patients more than 80 said that if they suspected someone may have coronavirus they knew how to seek immediate medical attention and that pharmacies should be allowed to send medications to their patients home during the coronavirus pandemic when needed only 22 reported that they would provide hydroxychloroquine to patients who need it even if they dont have a prescription about 50 believed that they should be allowed to sell medications for coronavirus management via the drive-through service available in some chain pharmacies although 872 of the participants provided their email addresses the majority of participants 657 chose to view the correct answers for the 20 awareness questions once the study was completed via the study facebook page and the rest 343 chose to receive the answers via an email sent to their email address from the research team pharmacists play an important role as active members of the healthcare team39 internationally pharmacists are integrated into pandemic planning and response40 not only do they have an effective role in clinical settings41 but in community settings they can play an important role in the community by making pharmaceutical products available and by enhancing health awareness among the public14

42 along those lines participants in the present study believed that they could play an effective role during the covid-19 pandemic this was through infection control by counseling individuals regarding hygiene practices needed to reduce infection spread more than 80 of participants knew how to act in seeking immediate medical attention if they suspected someone may have the coronavirus infection this study supports the notion that pharmacists are willing to and do play an important role in infection control and public safety43 and in assuring public health and wellbeing the majority of participants indicated that they will be able to act if they suspected that a patient has covid-19 one of the important aspects of pharmacy practice in the context of pharmaceutical care is being able to triage patients to appropriate health care44 furthermore the majority of participants were willing to deliver medicines to patients homes this is not required by the jordanian drug and pharmacy laws and in fact pharmacists are not allowed to adopt a courier home delivery service45 hence during the covid-19 pandemic only registered pharmacists were allowed to deliver medications this would be an effective service especially for elderly patients were the risk of infection and its complication are increased although of course the delivery personnel should probably be pharmacy stafftrainee pharmacists to free-up pharmacy capacity in a pandemic situation19
 some participants indicated that they were willing to dispense hydroxychloroquine directly to patients this is quite surprising as hydroxychloroquine has been regulated by the jordan food and drug administration and is not allowed to be sold in the community pharmacy without a valid prescription furthermore the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine has not been thoroughly established for covid-19 and the medication has a risk benefit profile that requires clinical supervision when used participants willingness to dispense without prescription may be influenced by the media which has been proposing hydroxychloroquine as the treatment of covid-19 about 95 of participants in this study reported that they currently follow the latest coronavirus updates on treatments obtaining their information mostly 60 of them from the media highlighting more reliable sources such as the fip released guideline in march of this year could benefit in providing accurate information to pharmacists globally by clarifying required coronavirus information for pharmacists and the pharmacy workforce and presenting evidence-based information11
 many pharmacists were not sure about the role of hydroxychloroquine 12 and 29 of them thought it has been used as a preventative therapy against the coronavirus infection it may be posed that jordanian pharmacists need to be made aware about current preliminary recommendations for the symptomatic management of mild covid-19 cases iefluids antipyretics and rest specialist hospital unit physicians of course have trialed and may be using treatments such as chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as well as of course ventilatory support for patients with severe respiratory distress symptoms46 most participants 72 knew that azithromycin has been trialed along with hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of the coronavirus infection while only 28 knew that antivirals such as oseltamivir have been used in the management in critical cases of the infection and 46 were not sure46
 ibuprofen the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicine or nsaid is sold under a number of brand names including advil and nurofen in addition to treating pain its often used to manage fever associated with various viral or bacterial infections at the time of designing this study it was said that nsaids such as ibuprofen can increase the risk of complications when used during viral infections including the coronavirus infection however the who declared on march 18 2020 under a post titled anti-inflammatory drug has been subject of conflicting reports that theres no evidence to suggest that using ibuprofen to manage symptoms of covid-19 will worsen the condition earlier reports said a spokesperson had cautioned against using ibuprofen to manage symptoms of the illness caused by the coronavirus until who experts could investigate this case provides a good example on the confusing information provided to healthcare professionals including pharmacists via the media regarding covid-19 pandemic47
 the use of corticosteroids by covid-19 patients has also been a confusing issue to many pharmacists corticosteroids were widely used during previous outbreaks of similar types of infection such as the middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov48 however although there appeared to be some evidence that corticosteroids may be beneficial if used in the early acute phase of infections conflicting evidence from the who surrounding corticosteroid use in certain viral infections means this evidence is not conclusive49 current reports indicate no unique reason exists to expect that patients with covid-19 infection will benefit from corticosteroids and they might be more likely to be harmed with such treatment50 hence considering the current availability of literature caution should be exercised until further evidence emerges surrounding the use of corticosteroids in covid-19 patients51
 pharmacists and pharmacy students showed acceptable awareness about the covid-19 pandemic as more than half of them knew the correct answers to the awareness related items except for the items probing the appropriate distance they need to maintain between them and the patients the majority 67 believed that at least 3 m 10 feet were the needed distance when counseling patients during a pandemic while the appropriate answer as per jordanian guidelines is 2 m 6 feet and 7 were not sure it was important to raise awareness about this fact as participants received the correct answers upon completion of the study because anecdotal comments from pharmacists indicated that some did not allow customers to come anywhere near them which negatively affected the counseling process the majority 76 of them were not aware of the highest risk population group in terms of contracting the coronavirus infection and they believed that children under the age of 9 were at highest risk along with and to the same extent as the elderly 65 and immune-compromised patients while 5 were not sure it was interesting to note that generally significantly more pharmacists answered the awareness items on the survey correctly than pharmacy student this may indicate the experience boosts clinical awareness and reasoning skills of pharmacists study results indicated that not only being a practicing pharmacist versus a pharmacy student was associated with better awareness but that older age being a public university alumnus versus a private university alumnus attending more educational workshops on a yearly basis were also significantly associated with a better level of awareness none of these are of course surprising except of course the difference in graduating from a different type of educational institution public vs private it is noteworthy to recognize that this finding could be due to the fact that about half of the graduates from the private educational institutions in jordan are international students who travel back to their countries once they graduate international students who remain in jordan are not able to practice as pharmacists representing a front-line professional component of essential health care and being the most accessible healthcare providers pharmacists role has been expanding along with the advancement of different configurations of pharmacy services provided to customers the drive-through pharmacy service is one example of the numerous newly emerging community pharmacy services in jordan this model initiated in the nineties in the united states of america usa with pharmacy chains being initial adopters though now it is a well espoused model acrossthe usa52 in jordan drive-through pharmacy services have recently been introduced representing a new trend in community pharmacy services with positive customer awareness and perceptions towards the service53 although of course the model limits the sit-down counseling deemed as a higher order role of pharmacists in jordan this service appeared well received particularly in a certain subset of customers but concerns regarding proper counseling represented the main disadvantage of the service43about 50 of the participants in this study believed that they should be allowed to sell medications for coronavirus management via the drive-through service available in some chain pharmacies in jordan although benefits may be found in this approach of dispensing in the covid-19 era suboptimal counseling raises a concern this discussion falls unto policymakers to make a clear announcement about whether to allow encourage or prohibit pharmacists from dispensing coronavirus patients medications via the drive-through service in public health emergencies clinical pharmacists enact their professional expertise by analyzing the current situation rationally and working in a professionally cohesive and efficient manner to provide innovative pharmacy services around medication safety and rational use of medicines43 we acknowledge that the scope of community pharmacy practice varies considerably across countries hence it is important to examine ways in which the profession can assist with the public health response to covid-19 this can be donenot only by maintaining the continuity of healthcare services but by achieving optimal use of possible services54
 a limitation of this study is that it was conducted via an online questionnaire but due to the pandemic that the world is going through and the public quarantine currently imposed in jordan other research methods were possible there are of course issues of representativeness in the profile about participants a majority of the participants were from amman the capital where the availability of cpd workshops can be higher than in other areas of the country we did not ask the pharmacy students about their study year which could have played a role in the results obtained fourth and fifth year students for example are expected to have a wider awareness in the clinical field as compared to students in the earlier years of their study the survey itself is also of course not validated although items were put together in real-time based on the literature and reviewed by a team of clinical pharmacy experts more than half of the pharmacists and pharmacy students believed that they got enough education previously about epidemicspandemics and the majority follow on the latest coronavirus updates on treatments mostly from the media followed by the who reports the majority believed they have a major role in the management of epidemicspandemics through their pharmacies certain gaps in the awareness about covid-19 were identified highlighting areas of improvement and generally pharmacists showed significantly higher awareness score than students which is in a way a satisfactory and expected finding higher age of participants graduating from a public university versus a private university and attending educational workshops on a yearly basis also significantly affected the awareness level this study was funded by the deanship of academic research at applied science private university amman jordan all authors were involved in all parts of study and manuscript preparation including literature search study design analysis of data manuscript preparation and review of manuscript none  cardiovascular complications of covid-19 pharmacotherapy perspective azita talasaz hajhossein hessam kakavand benjamin van tassell maryam aghakouchakzadeh parham sadeghipour steven dunn babak geraiely   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which can lead to coronavirus disease of 2019 covid-19 is spreading rapidly the world over at the time of writing this article july 5 2020 it has infected over 11 million people and caused more than 500000 deaths globally httpswwwwhointdocsdefault-sourcecoronavirusesituation-reports20200705-covid-19-sitrep-167pdfsfvrsn17e7e3df4 the disease was declared pandemic by the world health organization who on march 11 2020 1 sars-cov-2 is a single-strand rna virus from the coronaviridae family it can affect various organs including but not limited to the respiratory system the kidneys the gastrointestinal system and the cardiovascular system 2 data published from wuhan china indicate that patients with underlying cardiovascular disease cvd are at increased risk of mortality and morbidity from covid-19 3 this infectious disease can affect the cardiovascular system both directly and indirectly 4 the increased susceptibly of patients with cvd in the covid-19 outbreak notwithstanding the fact that this population is already under treatment with various classes of medication places them at higher risk of adverse drug events and possible drugdrug interactions although our current understanding of covid-19 pathology would suggest an increased number of cardiovascular complications during the pandemic the total number of cardiovascular-related admissions has paradoxically declined by 43 in the united states 5 however this may be largely attributable to the fear of contracting covid-19 at medical centers and thus not indicative of a true reduction in cardiovascular diseases it is prudent therefore to pay sufficient heed to the cardiovascular problems of our patients even more than before as it is still the number one killer globally even in the covid-19 era an approved therapy for patients with covid-19 has yet to emerge however there are some medications used in the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection globally they include hydroxychloroquinechloroquine which has immunomodulatory effects and can inhibit viral fusion lopinavirritonavir which is an antiretroviral agent and can block virus replication dexamethasone as an anti-inflammatory agent remdesivir which is an inhibitor of rna synthesis and lastly passive immunotherapeutic agents such as tocilizumab sarilumab canakinumab and anakinra 6 although not yet approved by any regulatory agencies remdesivir has shown evidence of shortened time to recovery among patients with covid-19 7 according to the recent recovery trial dexamethasone showed beneficial effects in patients after 7 days of treatment initiation at a dose of 6 mgday for up to 10 days as it reduced 28-day mortality in patients under mechanical ventilation by one third and by one fifth in patients only on supplemental oxygen 8 finally convalescent plasma showed positive effects by improving the rate of nasopharyngeal viral rna clearance at 72 h in patients with severe but not life-threatening covid-19 however it did not increase the overall rate of clinical improvement in patients with life-threatening covid-19 infection 9 this article seeks to review the most up-to-the-minute evidence with a view to explaining possible pharmacotherapies for the cardiovascular complications of covid-19 including acute coronary syndrome acs heart failure myocarditis arrhythmias and coagulopathy as well as possible interactions between these medications and those currently administered or under evaluation in the treatment of covid-19 similar to other coronaviruses sars-cov-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 for cell entry 10 ace2 is a membrane protein highly expressed in the lung enterocytes and the heart and is responsible for converting angiotensin ii to angiotensin-17 which is a vasodilator peptide with a potential role in lung protection 11 based on animal studies sars-cov-2 can downregulate ace2 expression facilitate neutrophil infiltration and subsequently accelerate lung and myocardial damage 12 such damage is speculated to be more profound in patients with cardiovascular disorders because they may be more likely to have upregulated ace2 expression due to the pharmacological inhibitors of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas and underlying conditions 13 14 sars-cov-2 infections can also directly lead to viral myocarditis and elevated levels of myocardial injury markers troponin and creatine kinase 15 in severe cases sars-cov-2 disease progresses from ace2-dependent alveolar damage and hypoxia to systemic inflammatory response syndrome acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and an exaggerated cytokine release the result may be myocardial supply-and-demand imbalance plaque rupture and thrombosis because of procoagulant states fig 1 these hypotheses may explain not only why patients with cvd are prone to higher rates of sars-cov-2 infections and mortality but also how patients with chronic stable states and even otherwise healthy individuals might sustain acute cardiovascular problems during the covid-19 pandemic an effective antiplatelet regimen is a matter of utmost importance in acs management the optimal antiplatelet regimen hinges on the treatment strategy and the covid-19 status the current guidelines stipulate that if fibrinolytic agents are to be used in patients not receiving active therapy for covid-19 the p2y12 inhibitor of choice is clopidogrel 21 although ticagrelor can also be considered according to the treat trial 22 in patients undergoing primary percutaneous interventions prasugrel and ticagrelor are recommended whatever the case may be decision-making with regard to patients with covid-19 should be in light of drugdrug and drugdisease interactions aspirin at the low dose administered in acs has minimal anti-inflammatory effects so concerns regarding the potentially detrimental effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the clinical course of covid-19 are not applicable to aspirin 19 the loading and maintenance doses of aspirin for patients with covid-19 should be the same as those administered to the normal population if the patient has coagulopathy clopidogrel is the p2y12 inhibitor of choice because it poses the lowest bleeding risk 21 another concern over the prescription of antiplatelets is the interaction between p2y12 inhibitors and protease inhibitors lopinavirritonavir is a potential antiviral agent for covid-19 it can through the strong inhibition of the cyp3a4 pathway increase the risk of bleeding with ticagrelor consequently ticagrelor is contraindicated in patients receiving lopinavirritonavir lopinavirritonavir could also diminish the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel which is why the platelet function test is suggested to adjust the clopidogrel dose accordingly in individuals without coagulopathy and bleeding risk prasugrel may be a good option while lopinavirritonavir is administered table 1 23 with respect to glycoprotein iibiiia inhibitors given the high bleeding risk and propensity for acute kidney injury in patients with covid-19 their use should ideally be avoided tirofiban and eptifibatide may be considered if needed but abciximab is not recommended due to the high risk of thrombocytopenia 21 in a large cohort study on patients with covid-19 haung et al 16 recorded 5 thrombocytopenia platelet count 100000l in the entire population with a higher prevalence among patients in the icu 8 as low molecular weight heparin lmwh may have advantages over unfractionated heparin ufh in patients with coagulopathy 24 it may be regarded as the agent of choice still if the patient is considered at high bleeding risk or has severe kidney injury ufh may be preferable because protamine is available for its reversal if bleeding occurs in patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy lmwh can be used as the agent of choice if the cardiologist defers angiography 21 nonetheless in centers where angiography is routinely done within 24 h of fibrinolytic therapy ufh still constitutes the best option table 1 if complete revascularization is achieved per the typical management of these patients in the absence of risk factors for vein thrombosis anticoagulants can be discontinued 21 it should be noted that there are no interactions between parenteral antithrombotic agents and the currently available covid-19 medications 23 reperfusion therapy with thrombolytics is an attractive option in stable patients without contraindications tenecteplase the most fibrin-specific agent is a prudent choice in patients with covid-19 on the strength of its high success rate low bleeding risk and single-dose administration strategy 21 tenecteplase is also associated with the least fibrin depletion of all fibrinolytics statins have beneficial vascular and myocardial effects that are attributed to their anti-inflammatory effects which may explain why the continued use of this class of medication in patients with a cardiovascular or cardiometabolic indication may have positive effects in the presence of acute viral respiratory infections 25 irrespective of covid-19 a high-intensity statin atorvastatin or rosuvastatin should be administered to every patient with acs 26 cohort studies in china have demonstrated prevalent elevated levels of hepatic transaminase and creatine kinase in those afflicted with covid-19 1618 it is advisable therefore to monitor the liver function and creatine kinase levels at baseline and periodically thereafter in the case of severe rhabdomyolysis or increased liver enzymes it is recommended that statins be temporarily withheld 19 another concern is the potential drug interaction between atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and lopinavirritonavir the respective daily dose of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin should not exceed 20 mg and 10 mg while in concomitant use with lopinavirritonavir table 1 27 interleukin-6 il-6 receptor antibodies such as tocilizumab may also lower statin concentrations by reversing cytochrome p450 cyp45 suppression however the clinical significance of this effect may be minimized by the short-term use of anti-il-6 receptor treatments 25 according to the guidelines on acs beta-1 selective beta-blockers may be preferred over nonselective agents 21 among beta-1 selective beta-blockers whereas metoprolol is metabolized by cyp2d6 and bisoprolol is partially metabolized by cyp3a4 and cyp2d6 atenolol is not metabolized by cyp450 table 1 28 bradycardia with hydroxychloroquine has also been reported which may be potentiated with beta-blockers as with patients receiving any beta-blocker diligent monitoring of the heart rate and blood pressure is warranted patients with hemodynamic instability should not receive beta-blockers unless there are clear improvements in their blood pressure and heart rate there is conflicting evidence on the pros and cons of the use of aceis and arbs in patients with covid-19 fang et al 29 demonstrated that ace2 was upregulated in their patients chronically receiving raas blockers which might place such patients at increased risk of infection with sars-cov-2 conversely some animal models have indicated the potentially protective effect of losartan administration in the lungs 30 at present there are three major studies on aceis and arbs in patients with covid-19 and they have all reported no harm in the use of raas blockers in patients with covid-19 3133 given the conflicting reports on this issue almost all international societies 34 35 have recommended against the discontinuation of aceis and arbs due to covid-19 hence in patients with acs an acei or arb should be started in the first 24 h after admission as is the case in the normal population 21 the important issue here is the potential drug interaction between lopinavirritonavir and arbs when administered concomitantly with ritonavir losartan and irbesartan may have less ability to transform into their respective active moiety and as such lose their efficiency 28 on the other hand the concentration of valsartan may increase through the inhibition of organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1b1 oatp1b and the hepatic efflux transporter multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 mrp20 28 ultimately in patients with covid-19 receiving aceis and arbs the close monitoring of blood pressure serum creatinine and potassium is recommended 25 with the exclusion of patients with hemodynamic instability and lung edema patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction should receive a beta-blocker similar to patients with acs beta-1 selective beta-blockers ie metoprolol succinate and bisoprolol may be preferred in patients with respiratory infections among the beta-blockers used for heart failure carvedilol is metabolized by glucuronidation ugt1a1 and cyp450 primarily 2d6 and 2c9 metoprolol is chiefly metabolized by cyp2d6 and bisoprolol is partially metabolized by cyp3a4 and cyp2d6 table 1 28 ritonavir can consequently affect the metabolism of all of these agents which is why the watchful monitoring of the heart rate and blood pressure of patients receiving lopinavirritonavir is highly recommended similar to the acs scenario regardless of covid-19 infection patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction should receive an acei or arb under close surveillance 19 the concentration of sacubitril rises in tandem with the administration of ritonavir hence the importance of the thorough monitoring of blood pressure serum creatinine and potassium in patients on sacubitrilvalsartan table 1 there is no specific interaction between loop diuretics and anti-covid medications so these drugs can be safely initiated or continued in patients with covid-19 given the high rate of acute kidney injury among this group of patients diuretic therapy should be closely monitored in terms of vital signs serum electrolytes and creatinine mineralocorticoid antagonists if administered under close surveillance can also be continued in patients with covid-19 concerning patients receiving protease inhibitors the area under the curve auc of eplerenone can increase fourfold which may favor the use of spironolactone in patients on lopinavirritonavir table 1 no specific interaction is known between thiazides and lopinavirritonavir with indapamide being an exception the concentration of indapamide may increase while administered with lopinavirritonavir necessitating extreme caution it is also essential to take heed of the risk of qt prolongation associated with chloroquinehydroxychloroquine as patients with electrolyte disturbances are at greater risk those receiving diuretics should be monitored for potassium and magnesium levels 25 all patients who are on digoxin and hospitalized for covid-19 should be monitored meticulously because of the possibility of instability during acute infection this may necessitate the measurement of serum concentration in patients with covid-19 who continue to receive digoxin furthermore ritonavir can increase the auc of digoxin by 29 and its half-life by 43 hydroxychloroquine can also increase the concentration of digoxin through an unknown mechanism 25 the narrow therapeutic index drugdrug interactions and potential for the unpredictable serum concentrations of digoxin may require physicians to reconsider the continued use of digoxin for patients with covid-19 table 1 protease inhibitors can reduce the formation of nitric oxide from isosorbide dinitrate and as such compromise its efficacy protease inhibitors also significantly interact with hydralazine dose adjustments based on the patients response should be considered 28 ivabradine is an if channel blocker used for symptomatic management in patients with ejection fractions of 35 or lower sinus rhythms and minimum resting heart rates of 70 beats per minute despite a maximum tolerable dose of beta-blockers it appears that ivabradine can be continued safely in hemodynamically stable patients with covid-19 the coadministration of potent cyp450 inhibitors can increase the auc of ivabradine 6-fold so ivabradine should be discontinued in patients receiving lopinavirritonavir for covid-19 25 viral infections are the most common etiology of myocarditis and are self-limiting without sequelae in most cases 38 the pathophysiology of covid-19 is the same as that of myocarditis in that it is detected several days after fever initiation 39 the underlying mechanism of myocardial injury in patients with covid-19 is related to the upregulation of ace2 in the cardiovascular system 19 39 while a rise in cardiac markers may not be related solely to myocarditis elevated levels of troponin and brain natriuretic peptide are correlated with worse outcomes 13 15 it appears that similar to other instances of viral myocarditis covid-19related myocarditis can exist without clinical symptoms nevertheless fulminant viral myocarditis with cardiac enlargement and acute heart failure has also been reported 40 there is also a case report from italy that showed endomyocardial localization of the virus in a patient with fulminant myocarditis and cardiogenic shock 41 based on the data extracted from cases with myocarditis as a consequence of other viral infections the treatment of covid-19related myocarditis is mostly supportive 38 antiviral therapy and immunomodulators can also be of help the treatment of new-onset heart failure with a balanced use of vasopressors inotropes diuretics vasodilators and fluid therapy may be lifesaving based on the latest guideline on the management of critically ill adults with covid-19 norepinephrine is the vasopressor of choice and vasopressin can be added if the target mean arterial pressure is not achieved with norepinephrine the use of dopamine is discouraged because of the increased risk of arrhythmias and mortality in patients with covid-19 who suffer cardiogenic shock dobutamine is the inotrope of choice and milrinone can be added in refractory cases 42 in critically ill patients with covid-19 the routine use of corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulins is not recommended in the absence of ards 42 43 corticosteroids may be beneficial to patients with lymphocytic myocarditis 44 this is also true for patients with covid-19 as systemic corticosteroids are suggested in mechanically ventilated patients with ards 42 the most significant information on the use of immunomodulators among patients with covid-19 and myocarditis comes from a case report of coronavirus fulminant acute myocarditis which was treated with methylprednisolone to suppress inflammation 200 mgday for 4 days and immunoglobulin to regulate the immune status 20 gday for 4 days 40 in another case report a young male patient with covid-19related myocarditis recovered without any specific treatment and with just supportive heart-failurerelated medications 45 in the setting of heart failure secondary to ischemia corticosteroids should be avoided as they may increase the potential for the mechanical complications of infarction sars-cov2 can place the patient in the danger of pericardial inflammation due to cytotoxic effects or immune-mediated pathways as reported by dabbagh et al 46 furthermore colchicine as a known beneficial agent in the treatment of pericarditis showed an improvement in the time to clinical deterioration in covid-19 patients in the grecco-19 trail 47 cardiac arrhythmias such as tachyarrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias are other cardiovascular complications that occur frequently in patients with covid-19 48 49 in a study in china the prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias was higher in icu patients than in non-icu patients 444 vs 69 18 cardiac arrhythmias may be attributed to direct myocardial injury or secondary to systemic alterations due to acute viremia eg metabolic derangement hypoxia neurohormonal changes and inflammatory stress patients with covid-19 who are in a hyperinflammatory state have hypercytokinemia and arrhythmogenic potential cytokine storm and increasing levels of il-1 il-2 il-1 il-6 monocyte chemoattractant protein and tumor necrosis factor-alpha tnf- are associated with fatal arrhythmias 50 these cytokines particularly il-6 prolong qtc via their direct effect on the ion channels of cardiomyocytes and their indirect effect on the bioavailability of qtc-prolonging medications by inhibiting cyp3a4 and hyper-activating the cardiac sympathetic system 51 several covid-19 pharmacotherapies including chloroquinehydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin and lopinavirritonavir can prolong the qtc interval and increase the risk of drug-induced torsade de pointes di-tdp and drug-induced sudden cardiac death di-scd the risk of di-scd can be augmented if these drugs are used in combination with each other ie chloroquinehydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin with or without lopinavirritonavir 52 53 the largest multinational registry analysis in this regard to date reported that the use of hydroxychloroquinechloroquine alone or with a macrolide was associated with an increased risk of de novo ventricular arrhythmias and mortality in patients with covid-19 54 be that as it may the manuscript was subsequently retracted casting doubt on the reliability of the data for decision-making another important adverse effect is the risk of atrioventricular block associated with lopinavirritonavir and chloroquinehydroxychloroquine other altered cardiac functions secondary to the use of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine include bundle branch block ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation 48 several risk factors have been identified that can increase the risk of di-tdp and di-scd these risk factors include advanced age female sex structural heart disease congenital long-qt syndromes electrolyte disturbances eg hypokalemia hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia concomitant use of loop diuretics hepaticrenal failure baseline qtc prolongation concomitant qtc-prolonging medications fever sepsis and inflammatory state 53 5558 irrespective of the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin the concerns regarding di-tdp and di-scd underscore the need for meticulous surveillance and optimization of these risk factors 53 57 to that end several risk scores such as the tisdale score and the pro-qt score are utilized for the prediction of drug-associated qtc prolongation 55 56 the significance of the detection of these risk factors before treatment initiation necessitates baseline and periodic 12-lead ecgs also of considerable importance is the baseline and periodic monitoring of the hepaticrenal function serum potassium and serum magnesium all other unnecessary qtc-prolonging medications should be discontinued or switched to alternatives with less qtc liability 52 53 57 a recent study posited that a baseline qtc of greater than 500 ms or  530550 ms if qrs  120 ms or a minimum tisdale risk score of 11 with failure to monitor serial ecgs for inpatients should be regarded as a contraindication to the use of hydroxychloroquine moreover a baseline qtc of greater than 480 ms or  510530 ms if qrs  120 ms or a minimum tisdale risk score of 11 for outpatients is an absolute or relative contraindication for the combined use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin if the decision has been made to treat a patient with a minimum baseline qtc of 500 ms with these qtc-prolonging medications it may be reasonable to start with hydroxychloroquine monotherapy 53 57 the discontinuation of azithromycin andor reduction of the dose of hydroxychloroquine should be considered for patients with an increase in qtc of greater than 30 to 60 ms after treatment initiation ecg monitoring should be conducted 2 to 4 h after the first dose and 48 and 96 h thereafter for patients with a baseline qtc of greater than 500 ms for patients with a baseline qtc of less than 500 ms there is no need to acquire ecg after the first dose daily ecgs should be considered for all inpatients receiving qtc-prolonging agents 53 57 59 60 however the measurement of qtc alone cannot prevent chloroquine- and hydroxychloroquine-induced arrhythmias since these agents may affect conduction velocity and calcium hemostasis these changes cannot be assessed by qtc assessment 61 another alteration in the ecg of patients with covid-19 is brugada-like ecg morphology 62 it is necessary to differentiate between brugada syndrome and brugada-like ecg morphology since fever in patients with brugada syndrome is associated with life-threatening arrhythmic events these patients should take precautionary measures eg social distancing and use aggressive antipyretic therapy to alleviate their fever ecg monitoring should be considered for those who do not respond to antipyretics with body temperatures exceeding 385 c 19 60 drug interactions between antiarrhythmic medications and antiviral agents eg hydroxychloroquine and lopinavirritonavir are another cause for concern antiarrhythmic agents can increase the risk of qt prolongation and tdp with the concomitant use of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine hence the importance of ecg monitoring before the initiation and maintenance of serum magnesium above 2 mgdl and serum potassium above 45 mgdl 19 48 52 53 another source of concern is the interaction between antiarrhythmics and protease inhibitors protease inhibitors can augment the effects of amiodarone lidocaine and quinidine in patients for whom the administration of the mentioned antiarrhythmics is necessary caution should be exercised through ecg monitoring and dose reduction additionally if these antiarrhythmics are in concomitant use with amiodarone blood pressure and liverthyroid function should be monitored periodically and alternative agents should be considered the coadministration of protease inhibitors and class 1c antiarrhythmics flecainide and propafenone is not recommended 52 coagulopathy has been reported as a predictor of poor prognosis in patients with covid-19 3 primary reports on covid-19 comparing patients who did not survive and those who survived showed that the former group had significantly higher levels of d-dimer and other fibrin degradation products as well as longer prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times aptt 63 nonetheless based on recent publications coagulopathy in patients with covid-19 manifests as elevated fibrinogen and d-dimer levels with minimal alterations in the prothrombin time aptt and platelet count in the early stages of the disease 64 tang et al showed that disseminated intravascular coagulation dic occurred in 714 of the non-survivors versus 06 of the survivors during hospitalization in their study 63 in contrast in a report by klok et al none of the patients in the intensive care unit icu whose cases were complicated by thrombotic events developed dic 65 interestingly zhang et al described three patients with covid-19 who had overt coagulopathy with positive antiphospholipid antibody tests 66 bowles et al in their case series of 34 patients with covid-19 and a prolonged aptt found positive lupus anticoagulant assays in 31 91 patients 67 thus it is still unclear whether the observed coagulopathy is only a marker of the severity of the disease as observed in septic shock or whether the virus has a direct impact on the coagulation cascade 63 68 several investigations have tried to implicate coagulopathy indices in the survival prediction of patients with covid-19 and posited the d-dimer level the prothrombin time 3 63 and thrombocytopenia 69 as potential prognostic factors the suggested potential d-dimer cutoff points for predicting the severity of the disease are 05 3 24 16 and 3 mgl 63 there is consensus regarding the role of d-dimer in patients with covid-19 yet a single study reported that d-dimer was not a determinant in the clinical risk model for predicting the occurrence of critical illness 70 the salient point is that d-dimer is generally accepted as an important factor in patients with covid-19 23 conversely bleeding complications appear to be rare in this group of patients 71 the coagulopathy described in covid-19 in conjunction with a severe inflammatory response and hypoxia may increase the risk of thrombotic events in patients with this infection 23 a few reports have elaborated on the prevalence of different thrombotic complications in patients with covid-19 in a study conducted in three hospitals in the netherlands klok et al observed a 31 incidence rate of thrombotic complications the majority of which were vte 27 of the patients compared with arterial thrombotic events 37 of the patients 65 similarly a high incidence of pulmonary emboli was observed by poissy et al who reported a rate of 206 of vte in infected patients in addition the rate was twice that during the same time interval in the previous year 72 it should be noted that the diagnosis of vte might be very challenging in patients hospitalized for covid-19 apart from the fact that d-dimer is deemed inapplicable the transfer of critically ill patients to imaging wards and then positioning them properly is by no means straightforward as a result the diagnostic process of considerable numbers of patients remains incomplete although not definitive diagnostic measures such as right ventricular enlargementdysfunction on echocardiography or deep vte in the lower limbs on ultrasound might be helpful toward the diagnosis of vte controversy persists concerning the treatment of patients without a definite diagnosis with various experts having suggested intermediate- to full-dose anticoagulation 23 in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism at low bleeding risk full-dose anticoagulation might be acceptable 73 whereas in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism at high bleeding risk intermediate-dose anticoagulation could be considered 64 73 a half-therapeutic-dose regimen has been adopted as intermediate-dose anticoagulation in many centers 64 several trials are ongoing on the true value of each of these proposed regimens 74 the symptom overlap between pulmonary emboli and acute respiratory disease in covid-19 75 and the aforementioned challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary emboli in the pandemic call for an appropriate prophylaxis strategy tang et al investigated the validity of the sepsis-induced coagulopathy score and the d-dimer level in the risk stratification of patients with covid-19 with regard to vte prophylaxis 24 in their retrospective analysis on 449 patients hospitalized for severe covid-19 there was no 28-day mortality benefit among heparin lmwh or ufh users however in patients with a minimum sepsis-induced coagulopathy score of 4 or a d-dimer level greater than 30 gml heparin prophylaxis significantly improved the 28-day mortality hence tang and colleagues recommended prophylaxis implementation based on risk stratification 24 other risk stratification tools eg caprini and improve have also been suggested by some experts 23 the international society on thrombosis and haemostasis isth has offered a liberal recommendation suggesting the administration of lmwh in all patients hospitalized for covid-19 including those who are not critically ill who do not have contraindications platelet count 25  109l or active bleeding 71 while there is currently a dearth of data suggesting this routine vte prophylaxis a case series by klok et al confirmed the high incidence of vte 27 in patients hospitalized for covid-19 which may be regarded as justification for the liberal approach some investigators have suggested a higher-than-routine ie escalated dose of vte prophylaxis in patients in the icu and especially patients with ards 64 successful experiences have been previously published 76 regarding the mentioned approach in patients with h1n1 complicated by ards accordingly a meta-analysis of 9 trials showed that a minimum of 5000 ud of lmwh succeeded in significantly decreasing the 28-day mortality among patients with ards rr 063 95 ci 041 to 096 77 an elevated level of d-dimer has been proposed as a marker for the benefit of an escalating regimen 64 additionally mechanical prophylaxis has been suggested for patients with contraindications for pharmacological prophylaxis 23 notably the importance of vte prophylaxis has been recognized since the early days of the current pandemic wang et al in their short report on 1026 patients hospitalized for covid-19 showed that more than 40 of their patients obtained a minimum padua prediction score of 4 ie high risk for vte and only 7 received appropriate treatment 78 for patients on chronic treatment with anticoagulants a switch to parenteral agents is recommended upon admission 23 from the drug-interaction point of view it is worth mentioning that warfarin can be used with covid-19 medications with careful monitoring of the international normalized ratio inr according to the european society of cardiology esc 2020 guideline rivaroxaban and apixaban have fewer interactions with chloroquinehydroxychloroquine than with dabigatran and edoxaban 19 still with lopinavirritonavir the use of rivaroxaban is contraindicated due to the increased risk of bleeding furthermore edoxaban is not recommended because of the lack of evidence the dose of apixaban should be halved and dabigatran can be administered at a full dose with a 2-h gap of lopinavirritonavir 19 25 79 it is vital to remember that cardiovascular complications remain the leading cause of death in the pandemic era indeed cardiovascular complications are a common finding in covid-19 and patients with underlying cvd are more susceptible to the infection pharmacotherapy an integral component of patient care should be adjusted in patients with active coronavirus infection based on their comorbidities which may affect the drug choice and dosage drug interactions between cardiovascular medications and such antiviral agents as hydroxychloroquine and lopinavirritonavir constitute another issue deserving of special note we herein sought to suggest appropriate therapies for the common cardiovascular problems of covid-19 namely acs heart failure myocarditis arrhythmias and vte based on the current literature there is clearly a paucity of information on each of these complications at present and further studies are needed to elucidate the best pharmacotherapy regimen in patients suffering from covid-19  post-exposure prophylaxis or pre-emptive therapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus

hours later by 600 mg orally once three tabletsdays 2 to 5 hydroxychloroquine 600 mg orally once daily three tablets per day placebo tablets will be administered using the same dosing schedule and number of tablets as the interventional arm the rationale for the study dose is adapted from a modified malaria dosing schedule for hydroxychloroquine35 considerations were made for maximal viral inhibition while balancing potential toxicity and drug supply with anticipated shortages a loading dose was used similar to malaria treatment strategy to achieve antiviral activity as quickly as possible monte carlo simulations were conducted with the proposed dose achieving steady-state serum concentrations above the ec5022 where 50 of viral inhibition would occur the most common anticipated side effect from hydroxychloroquine is gastrointestinal upset27 participants will be instructed to spread out doses throughout the day eg two tablets with breakfast one tablet with lunch to increase tolerability if required participants may voluntarily stop taking the study medicine at any time adherence will be determined by self-report chronic medications will be taken as usual but these must

paper documents will be retained or stored enrolment progress reports will be generated for each trial at 25 50 and 75 of enrolment to highlight the number of participants enrolled on study completed or lost to follow-up the cumulative incidence of covid-19 both arms pooled and cumulative hospitalizations both arms pooled will be reported according to existing research the attack rate of transmission to household contacts is approximately 1018 we used fishers exact test and a two-sided   005 and test power of   090 to detect a 50 relative risk reduction in disease incidence using 11 randomization we calculated a required sample size of n  621 per arm accounting for a predicted 20 dropout rate with an internet self-study design the sample size was inflated to n  746 per arm therefore we aimed to recruit a total of 1500 patients for the pep trial for symptomatic patients the proportion of patients who progress to require hospitalization is approximately 1014 for this trial we assumed that without treatment 90 of the control arm would not be hospitalized 8 would be hospitalized without an icu stay or death and 2 would be hospitalized with an icu stay or death with 11 randomization and 1464 total participants the pet trial has 90 power to detect a log odds ratio of 070 a number of sample size approximations were made accounting for differences in baseline rates and relative effect sizes these can be found in appendices 1 and 2 primary and secondary outcomes will be analyzed separately in pep and pet trials by intention-to-treat primary outcome for pep the incidence of covid-19 by day 14 will be assessed in the intervention vs control arm by the fishers exact test primary outcome for pet the ordinal scale for disease severity outpatient hospitalized without icu hospitalized with icu death at day 14 will be assessed in the intervention vs control arms by proportional odds model secondary outcomes pep and pet are analyzed separately in the pep group for the subset of patients who develop symptoms of covid-19 after taking at least one dose of the study medicine we will analyze the change in symptom severity in the intervention vs control group we will use the same approach as for the primary outcome in the pet group participants who are randomized in the pep group but develop symptoms before taking one dose of the study medicine will

event of early termination for efficacy the trial will immediately convert to an open-label observational cohort study at the second dsmb review a sample size re-estimation will occur based on the disease transmission rate in the control group the a priori assumption of 10 transmission risk in close contacts is based on limited data in other jurisdictions a new sample size estimation will take into account the updated transmission rate in this trial and be powered to detect a 50 relative reduction in the primary outcome starting with the second dsmb review the dsmb will be given the conditional power under both the trial design parameters and under the current data if the conditional power is less than 20 trial discontinuation may be considered short-term use of hydroxychloroquine is well-tolerated with a safe track record of use for approved indications since 1955 the most commonly reported side effects include gastrointestinal upset nausea vomiting diarrhea headache skin rash or itching27 gastrointestinal side effects are minimized when taken with meals and when dosages are separated throughout the day participants will be instructed to use these optional strategies to increase tolerance while a recent study showed a risk of harm with very high doses of chloroquine24 hydroxychloroquine is much less toxic26 doses used in this trial 38 g total are similar to those doses used to treat malaria 2 g total and are significantly less than doses used to treat coxiella burnetii infection or other autoimmune conditions 400-600 mg daily indefinitely all showing a long history of safety27 a recent trial in covid-19 using significantly higher doses 12 g daily for three days then 800 mg daily for two to three weeks showed no significant differences in serious adverse advents though gastrointestinal side effects were higher at this dose28 the safety of taking hydroxychloroquine will be enhanced by excluding those with pre-existing retinopathy

covid-19 pandemic39 several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown data that may support its possible efficacy but clinical data are limited to small clinical trials and uncontrolled case series and cohorts20 there is an urgent need for the rigorous evaluation of hydroxychloroquine as a therapeutic option against covid-1940 this innovative trial is adequately powered to rapidly answer urgent questions regarding the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and its ability to prevent or reduce the severity of covid-19 the novel web-based design of this trial in the setting of a highly contagious global pandemic has ensured that all interactions with participants including enrolment and informed consent are done remotely using courier services to deliver medicine and using internet-based follow-up this will allow compliance with strict social distancing strategies and reduce risks of infectious spread to study personnel and others the design encourages large scale enrolment to ensure the target number of participants are enrolled and trial results are obtained as quickly as possible importantly the design was finalized regulatory and reb approvals were obtained and large geographic jurisdictions brought online in an unprecedently short duration within a few weeks of a global pandemic with a goal to obtain the maximal information in the minimal amount of time recently several public figures have promoted the widespread use of hydroxychloroquine in the absence of robust scientific data3941 this trial will help address if large scale dissemination of hydroxychloroquine is appropriate in certain populations importantly if this study shows a positive effect this will support a new therapeutic option to mitigate the global spread and impact of covid-19 if a null or negative effect is shown this will reduce the risk of harm to future patients reduce healthcare expenditures due to ineffective medications and protect the drug supply for patients with previously established indications for hydroxychloroquine the results of this trial will be instrumental in determining if hydroxychloroquine may play an important role in mitigating the global impact of covid-19  seven recommendations to rescue the patients and reduce the mortality from covid-19 infection an immunological point of view andreas kronbichler maria effenberger michael eisenhut keum lee hwa jae shin il   coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a severe public health emergency worldwide caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 1 the number of confirmed cases and the mortality rate are increasing worldwide and the world health organization who acknowledged covid-19 as a pandemic on march 11 2020 2 currently there have been many efforts to diagnose a number of patients with symptoms or close contacts to prevent the spread in the community this may prevent some spreading of the virus but not perfectly moreover many confirmed cases are occurring through diagnosis but there is no definite guideline for the initial therapeutic approach for them and therefore many patients have been dying if the covid-19 symptoms are severe the patients are hospitalized and the treatment is done though they have not been established yet currently however no treatment is provided for those who are isolated at home or shelter among them there will be also some cases in whom severe lung injury or cytokine storm has progressed 3 leading to sudden death case fatality rates in some countries especially italy and spain are high and effective therapeutic measures are urgently needed 4 in this review we discuss some important points dedicated to the management of patients with covid-19 which should help reducing morbidity and mortality patients with covid-19 have higher leukocyte numbers c-reactive protein crp erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr d-dimer and an imbalance of proand anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines with increased levels of interleukin il-1 il-1ra il-7 il-8 il-9 il-10 basic fibroblast growth factor fgf2 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor g-csf granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor gm-csf interferon ifn- ifn- induced protein ip-10 monocyte chemoattractant protein mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory protein mip1- mip1- platelet derived growth factor pdgf-b tumor necrosis factor tnf- and vascular endothelial growth factor vegf-a 5 higher expression levels of il-2 il-7 il-10 g-csf ip-10 mcp-1 mip1- and tnf- were found in individuals admitted to the intensive care unit icu 5 these cytokines may indicate patients at risk to develop acute lung injury followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and eventually death this circumstance is called cytokine release syndrome crs or cytokine storm 6 the main pathogenesis of covid-19 may be similar to that of other viruses such as influenza or others however there have been few efforts to make a potential hypothesis why covid-19 could cause a higher incidence of acute lung injury ards cytokine storm and death than other viruses we are going to make a simple hypothetical model for the inflammatory processes and cytokine storm for covid-19 to understand the pathophysiology of covid-19 and its associated lung injury ards and cytokine stormfirst covid-19 sars-cov-2 is first attached to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors in the nasopharynx and respiratory epithelium 7second host immune responses are initiated after entry of covid-19 into the cells and the pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by covid-19 are formed by various kinds of immune cells such as t cells b-cells and macrophages and others 89third the degree of increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines determines the degree of covid-19-induced lung injury the more increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines the higher the injury to lung tissue and the more severe the ards which could be related to higher mortalityfourth the degree of increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines in covid-19 is higher as induced by other viruses especially this effect is more pronounced in older age and comorbid conditionsfifth the reason why this effect is less pronounced in younger age groups may be obscure but it could be due to the immaturity of immune system and the predominance of th2 immunity than th1 in these groupssixth the reason why this effect is more pronounced in older age groups and those with comorbid conditions may be obscure but it could be due to pre-existing subclinical or subtle inflammations represented by increased high-sensitive crp hscrp in these groupsseventh the exaggerated increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines in covid-19 could be due to hyperactivation of various kinds of immune cells in response to n-protein of covid-19 which is called cytokine stormeighth this increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by covid-19 cytokine storm can cause acute lung injury ards and eventually multiorgan failureninth cytokine storm may start from the early course of disease to later stage according to the degree of activation of host immune response and it may be rapidly progressive at any timetenth there may be clinico-pathologic non-correlations between them 3 the patient may be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms despite severely progressed conditions which will delay the appropriate treatment at an early stage
 the pathogenesis of covid-19 is summarized in fig 1
 regarding our immunity there are 3 states 1 immunosuppressive state 2 normal immune state this is also classified as lower normal normal and upper normal and 3 hyperimmune state if there are 100 normal persons they are distributed from 0 to 100 on a scale according to the degree of anti-viral immunity which will be mostly represented by th1 response if the person is immunocompromised heshe will have minus points on the scale the lower the minus number is located the more severe the immunosuppressive condition will be if the number is higher than 100 the person will get hyperactivated host immune response and will have lung injury ards and multiorgan failure if the person is infected with other usual respiratory viruses such as rhinovirus or influenza heshe will have fever and sore throat caused by host immune response however the degree of increase in inflammatory reaction will be 35 so if the person who has the number of immunity scale of 90 and infected by other viruses the number on a scale will increase to 9395 however the degree of increase in inflammatory reaction in patients with the current covid-19 will be 1015 therefore if the person who has the number of immunity scale 90 is infected by covid-19 the number on a scale will increase to 100105 which means that there will be a high probability that this patient will progress to cytokine storm due to hyperactivated immune response which might lead to death because younger age groups immune system may be immature and they may have the predominance of th2 immunity than th1 10 they might have the number of immunity scale 030 therefore even though they are infected by covid-19 and the number is increased by 10-15 by covid-19 their number will be located between 10 and 45 therefore there is a lower possibility that they will be progress to severe cytokine storm which may explain less mortality in this group however the person in an older age group will have multiple co-morbidities by aging process such as atherosclerosis hypertension diabetes mellitus metabolic syndrome and chronic kidney disease and they might have pre-existing subclinical or subtle inflammations represented by increased hscrp in these groups 11 therefore they might have a number of immunity scale 8595 therefore if they are infected by covid-19 and the number of 1015 is increased by covid-19 their number will be located between 95 and 110 therefore there is high possibility that they will progress to severe cytokine storm which may explain high mortality in this group surely there will be additional factors that influence the susceptibility and severity of covid-19 such as genetic variant of different polymorphisms or environmental factors as smoking in addition to this basic 1015 increase in the degree of inflammatory reaction if the patient progressed to cytokine storm the number will rapidly increase to 200300 we are going to discuss the use of steroids later but the basic increase of 1015 in various pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by covid-19 might be suppressed by short-course low dose steroids in an early stage of disease but steroids may not be effective in a later stage of disease such as ards and multiorgan failure to suppress cytokine storm because 200300 cannot be suppressed even though high dose of steroids are used recently hydroxychloroquine has been shown to be effective in covid-19 12 and this drug may reduce the increase in the degree of inflammatory reaction however we do not know which agent may be better in decreasing inflammatory reactions and how much the number might be decreased by steroids or hydroxychloroquine in addition to these the rate of bacterial complications will increase in accordance with the progression with time after covid-19 we think if bacterial complication is combined with cytokine storm there will be more severe inflammatory reactions although this theory may not be perfect this may be helpful to understand the pathogenesis and potential harms of covid-19 and guide how patients should be treated evidence based medicine ebm is the conscientious explicit judicious and reasonable use of modern best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients 13 ebm integrates clinical experience and patient values with the best available research information 13 many clinicians are applying the treatment to the current coronavirus covid-19 based on the previous experiences for mers or sars however this is not exactly evidence-based since covid-19 is different to be evidence-based a large-scale randomized placebo-controlled trial for covid-19 should urgently be conducted however it is too difficult to find an appropriate drug for covid-19 in a pandemic state because it will take a long time although this effort should also be done concurrently in addition even if the results of small rcts are meaningful those are often reversed when a larger rct is performed 14 moreover although the results of meta-analysis may be considered to be the best evidence this should be interpreted with caution because the meta-analysis results can be significant even though all the results of individual rcts have no statistical significance 15 furthermore it has been claimed that most published research findings are false and not useful 1617 though this should also be interpreted with caution and numerously published meta-analyses are also misleading 18 in addition guidelines suggested by experts can also have a mistake 19 in this context we should find what is the best strategies to protect the humans form the harms of covid-19 even though we apply several therapeutic strategies investigated in sars or mers it should be interpreted with caution if we cannot apply ebm immediately in this covid-19 pandemic we should also make every effort to find wise ways to solve the problems in this situation an experience-based approach may be also important in this pandemic era and many publications should urgently be published even though they are case reports or case series covid-19 is causing a severe public health emergency all over the word and the mortality is rapidly increasing all over the world we would like to remind of the basic principle for the treatment of patients but we often forget this do no harm 20 we should think of what harms means and what do no harms would look like in this pandemic we have thought and summarized the potential harms and the things we are doing now regarding covid-19 and it is summarized as below and table 1
1continuing smoking is a significant harm to respiratory epitheliums if so why dont we recommend cessation of smoking at this time not doing so is causing a significant harm to the patients2cytokine storm is considered to be a significant harm and an important cause of death if so why dont we make every effort to prevent this process at an early course of disease not doing so is causing a significant harm to the patients3currently some asymptomatic patients or those with mild symptoms have severe radiologic findings and bacterial complications which can lead to sudden death but no radiologic examinations and treatment are done for these patients until severe symptoms develop this may be considered to be a significant harm if so why dont we make every effort to detect these patients and treat them at an early course of disease not doing so is causing a significant harm to the patients4currently covid-19 infected patients are divided into two groups one is the person who is isolated at home but no medications are provided and the other is the person who developed severe symptoms with time and admitted to the hospital currently many patients with covid-19 are recommended to be at home until severe symptoms develop due to infectivity to others we think there will be a patient group with moderate symptoms in whom if early treatment is done with steroids and antibiotics they will not progress to severe conditions to let them at home will be a significant harm if so why dont we provide medications such as steroids or antibiotics at the time of covid-19 test and monitor the patient even by phone considering it is practically difficult for the patient to visit the clinic again if so policy should be changed in this pandemic era as medications should be given to the patients more liberally than in usual situations not doing so is causing a significant harm to the patients and hesitating for the use of steroids and antibiotics may be a harm to the patients with covid-195doing something is better than nothing currently there are no established guidelines for covid-19 and we rely on the previous treatments for sars mers or influenza or on expert opinions recently some investigators are discussing the beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 but this is just based on in vitro studies and not much experience but why dont we have more interests on the use of elderberry supplements which was shown to be effective in cold and influenza by randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study and meta-analysis 21 22 23 if some treatments such as elderberry supplements or betadine mouth or nasal spray are not causing significant harms we think doing something is better than nothing6misinterpretation of the various studies including systematic review without considering the biases will lead to a false guidance for the treatment of covid-19 which will be a significant harm 24 the role of experts who are doing evidence-based medicine or meta-research is very important to reduce the harm to the patients in this pandemic era see table 2

 in addition to these there may be more current harms in this pandemic era and this should also be urgently discussed first smoking cessation should be encouraged this has always been recommended for general population but it has also been very difficult for the people to do so because covid-19 can predominantly damage the respiratory epitheliums and lungs this should at least be recommended recently it was also hypothesized that those individuals who have been exposed to nicotine prior to their exposure to the virus are primed to be at higher risk because nicotine can directly impact the putative receptor for the virus ace2 and lead to deleterious signaling in lung epithelial cells 25 in addition several cytokines including il-2 il-6 and tnf- which is induced by smoking might trigger cytokine storm in covid-19 we still do not know whether a short duration of smoking cessation could reduce the susceptibility or severity of covid-19 or not but if it is beneficial doing something smoking cessation is better than nothing second povidoneiodine polyvinylpyrrolidoneiodine pvp-i betadine mouth or nasal spray can be applied to kill the covid-19 viruses and it will reduce the number of covid-19 viruses which enter into the cells covid-19 is initiated by the attachment of the virus to the pharynx or respiratory epithelium and this causes sore throat currently however we do not know about whether the number of virus attached to the pharynx or respiratory epithelium will influence on the severity of covid-19 easily speaking when you inhaled 10 viruses and when you inhaled 1000 viruses will infection risk or the disease severity be same or different currently this cannot be proved easily however considering the effectiveness of a mask that prevents respiratory infections less exposure is likely to prevent infection by an indirect evidence one previous meta-analysis showed that physical measures are highly effective in preventing the spread of sars wearing masks odds ratio 032 95 ci 025 to 040 number needed to treat nnt  6 454 to 803 vs wearing n95 masks 009 003 to 030 nnt  3 237 to 406 26 we can make a potential hypothesis if 10 viruses were inhaled and attached to the throat this may be cleared by host immunity however if 1000 viruses were inhaled and attached to the throat it should go through a fight between the virus and host immunity if viruses are cleared by host immunity the person can be free from virus but if the viruses win they may replicate exponentially within a relatively short time and will cause viremia in the blood in this situation we still do not know whether the degree of viremia viral load might be correlated to the degree of host hyperimmune response or whether reduction of viruses in the throat for example using betadine mouth spray or gargles could decrease the degree of viremia in blood currently inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 and blocking angiotensin receptor 2 ar2 is considered to be the key target for sars-cov-2 vaccination and covid-19 therapy 27 due to this finding some authors recommend the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors acei or angiotensin receptor 2 blockers arbs 28 currently these findings and suggestions cant be transferred into clinical practice easily acei and arbs are widely used in clinical daily practice no clinical studies have been made in the set of covid-19 outbreak so far even basic science due to the pathophysiological mechanisms eg effectiveness of blocking ar2 are limited 27 due to a substantiated benefit-risk evaluation a therapy with arbs or acei cannot be recommended in addition we do not know about how many ace2 receptors could be downregulated or blocked by antibodies or vaccines and how many entries of viruses could be inhibited by these if they are developed however if blocking entry of virus is a potential therapeutic target we think that direct killing of the virus in the throat by betadine mouth or nasal spray might be more efficacious than the receptor downregulation several studies showed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov could be inactivated by pvp-i in vitro 2930 one phase 1 study shows application of pvp-i nasal spray to the nasal mucosa did not result in any demonstrable limitation of the nasal function nor in detectable damage to the multilayer ciliated epithelium of the nose 31 because anyone can buy betadine mouth or nasal spray or gargles without a prescription as over-the-counter medicines if it does not cause any significant harm there is no reason not to use it and it can be applied if a person feels sore throat at an early course of the disease although side effects of pvp-i use are rare the adverse effect of iodine and other precautions should also be recognized pvp-i can cause allergic reactions and should not be used in patients suffering from thyroid diseases 32 even there exist no studies for pvp-i and sars-cov-2 either due to the benefit-risk evaluation pvp-i can be used in patients infected with sars-cov-2 with no or mild symptoms without allergies to pvp-i or thyroid diseases or if a person is visiting more crowded places such as airport it can also be applied easily third the use of elderberry supplements should be considered at an early course of the disease although it has not been tested in coronavirus elderberry supplements which was shown to be effective in cold and influenza by randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study and meta-analysis 21 22 23 currently there was one cleveland clinic news reported by emily bamforth on the use of elderberry supplements 33 although there have been several reports on the beneficial effect of elderberry supplements on several viral infections 21 22 23 there have been few hypotheses on the potential immunologic mechanisms on the beneficial effect of elderberry supplements focusing on covid-19 it is well known that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is a receptor for sars-cov 34 a recent study showed that sars-cov-2 covid-19 spike s glycoproteins also uses ace2 to enter cells and that the receptor-binding domains of sars-cov-2 s and sars-cov s bind with similar affinities to human ace2 correlating with the efficient spread of sars-cov-2 among humans 35 although less discussed than ace2 it was shown that cd209l l-sign encoded by clec4m is also a receptor for sars-cov 36 in this study cd209l was expressed in human lung in type ii alveolar cells and endothelial cells both potential targets for sars-cov and the large s glycoprotein of sars-cov might use both ace2 and cd209l in virus infection and pathogenesis 36 in addition chan et al demonstrated that individuals homozygous for clec4m tandem repeats are less susceptible to sars infection and l-sign is expressed in both non-sars and sars-cov-infected lung 37 they also showed that compared with cells heterozygous for l-sign cells homozygous for l-sign show higher binding capacity for sars-cov higher proteasome-dependent viral degradation and a lower capacity for trans infection suggesting that homozygosity for l-sign plays a protective role during sars infection 37 in summary the first encounter of the virus with the host might be through binding to attachment receptors such as these receptors which might play an important role of infection for a large number of enveloped viruses by capturing concentrating and transmitting infectious virions 38 once a virus reaches its target cell a cascade of events generally starting with the interaction of viral envelope glycoproteins with specific entry receptors and co-receptors is necessary in order to trigger the virus-cell membrane fusion 38 although not much studied in coronavirus capture and transmission of hiv-1 by the c-type lectin l-sign was inhibited by carbohydrate-binding agents cbas 39 in this study both mannose- and n-acetylglucosamine glcnac-specific cbas dose-dependently prevented virus capture by l-sign-expressing 293 t-rexl-sign cells 39 because coronavirus also uses l-sign as a receptor for entry one study suggested that influenza virus and coronavirus infections might also qualify to be treated by cbas 40 keyaerts et al evaluated the effect of 33 plant lectins with different specificities to coronavirus 41 they showed that the plant lectins possessed marked antiviral properties against both coronaviruses with ec50 values in the lower microgramml range middle nanomolar range being non-toxic cc50 at 50100 microgml and the strongest anti-coronavirus activity was found predominantly among the mannose-binding lectins in addition a number of galactose- n-acetylgalactosamine- glucose- and n-acetylglucosamine-specific plant agglutinines exhibited anti-coronaviral activity 41 they also found that there was a significant correlation with an r-value of 070 between the ec50 values of the 10 mannose-specific plant lectins effective against the two coronaviruses but little correlation was seen between the activity of other types of lectins 41 therefore they reported that two targets of possible antiviral intervention were identified in the replication cycle of sars-cov the first target is located early in the replication cycle most probably viral attachment and the second target is located at the end of the infectious virus cycle 41 de clercq summarized various compounds which have been reported to exhibit in vitro activity against sars-cov though they have an ill-defined mode of action but selectivity indexes up to 100 valinomycin glycopeptide antibiotics plant lectins hesperetin glycyrrhizin aurintricarboxylic acid chloroquine niclosamide nelfinavir and calpain inhibitors among them plant lectins and chloroquine which is being discussed for the potential treatment of covid-19 are included 42 this hypothesis has further been tested later in mers-cov epidemic because coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with the spike proteins present on their surface responsible for virus entry into the target cell 43 because mers-cov also cause a high mortality rate of about 35 no vaccine is available and therapeutic options for mers-cov infections are limited to palliative and supportive care a search for specific antiviral treatments was urgently needed 43 millet et al thought that lectins are attractive anti-coronavirus candidates because of the highly glycosylated nature of the spike protein and tested the antiviral effect of griffithsin grft a lectin isolated from the red marine alga griffithsia sp against mers-cov infection 43 they demonstrated that griffithsin is a potent inhibitor of mers-cov infection without significant cytotoxicity 43 griffithsin inhibited entry into host cells of particles pseudotyped with the mers-cov spike protein suggesting that griffithsin inhibits spike protein function during entry at the binding step 43 the compounds found in elderberries are phenolic acids flavonoids vitamins lectins and aroma compounds etc 44 a very similar lectin called sambucus nigra fruit specific agglutinin i sna-if was identified as a minor protein in ripe elderberry fruits 45 although elderberry supplements have not been tested in the current covid-19 pandemic lectin components might inhibit spike protein function during entry at the binding step as mentioned above or have unknown other effects currently because anyone can buy elderberry supplements without a prescription as over-the-counter medicines if it does not cause any significant harm there is no reason not to use it and it can be applied at an early course of the disease although there have been some reports on the increase in some cytokines by elderberry supplements 46 elderberry supplements also have various kinds of other effects surely however we should also weigh the benefit and risk for the use of elderberry supplements like other otcs we know that even otcs eg tylenol have many adverse effects on the drug information in addition we should also look at the evidence-based systematic review of elderberry and elderflower sambucus nigra by the natural standard research collaboration 47 which could be applied to the current covid-19 pandemic in this point we should be able to guide the use of these elderberry supplements to the general population or patients with covid-19 as this elderberry supplements can be used in those with covid-19 at an early course of disease if you understand the previous efficacy of these and potential adverse effects fourth the use of oral steroids should be actively considered at an early course of the disease if the cause of death of covid-19 is ards and organ failure due to cytokine storm by hyperactivated host immune response why we are not considering to suppress or prevent this process at an early course of the disease we think the increase in various pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by covid-19 may be suppressed by short-course low dose steroids in an early stage of disease but it may not be effective in a later stage of disease such as ards and multiorgan failure this situation can be assimilated by forest fire if a first small fire by cigarette butts can be detected by hiker early early covid-19 it can be extinguished by small amounts of water low dose steroids easily but if wild forest fires spread persistent high fever dyspnea in the mountain without early suppression it cannot be suppressed despite every effort by numerous fire trucks long-term use of very high dose of steroids and all mountains will be burned destructed lung requiring ecmo there was one recent systematic review reporting that the use of steroids may be harmful to patients with covid-19 48 however this result should be interpreted with caution because the quality of the included studies is extremely low and they have many biases many studies are missing and the included studies are not on the use of steroids vs no use this result should not be generalized to the patients with early course of the disease and mild symptoms one study investigated the structural arrangement of n protein explaining the first steps of its interaction with nucleic acid at the initial stages of virus structure assembly 49 the nucleocapsid n protein of covid-19 has nearly 90 amino acid sequence identity with sars-cov and the n protein antibodies of sars-cov may cross react with covid-19 but may not provide cross-immunity in a similar fashion to sars-cov the n protein of covid-19 may play an important role in suppressing the rna interference rnai to overcome the host defense 50 in rat models the n-protein of sars-cov had pathogenicity and could induce obvious pulmonary inflammatory reaction and acute lung injury which were related to the increase and imbalance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines 51 in this study glucocorticoids could effectively alleviate the pulmonary inflammatory reaction induced by n-protein of sars-cov supporting the beneficial role of steroids on the inflammatory reactions caused by n-protein of the current covid-19 51 according to the chinese governments daily report 132213 of patients with covid-19 developed severe or fatal illness and therefore the chinas national health commission released the fifth trial version of diagnosis and treatment scheme for pneumonitis with covid-19 and provided a systematic treatment strategy for severe cases and systematic corticosteroids treatment methylprednisolone 12 mg per kg body weight for 35 days was recommended to be an adjuvant therapy 52 zou et al recently showed that systematic corticosteroids therapy in the first 35 days in severe patients could enhance oxygen saturation sao2 and arterial oxygen tension pao2inspiratory oxygen fraction fio2 but corticosteroids did not exert any intervention on survival of ncp patients complicated with both ards and shock or multiple organ injury 53 nevertheless they concluded that corticosteroids in the phase of ards would effectively inhibit furious inflammatory storm and gain valuable time for controlling infection and preventing secondary multiorgan damage and shock which implies that corticosteroids have synergistic biological effects when combined with other intensivists treatment against severe or fatal ncp patients 53 however as we mentioned above we think the increase in various pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by covid-19 may be suppressed by short-course low dose steroids in an early stage of disease but it may not be effective in a later stage of disease such as ards and multiorgan failure because a later stage may be a big fire which cannot be suppressed easily one another thing is a short course of low dose oral steroids is easily prescribed in the treatment of urticaria but why are we afraid of prescribing the use of oral steroids in the acute covid-19 setting even though many patients progress to severe disease in whom there will be some patients with mild symptoms with severe radiologic findings if we can lower the percentage of progressing to cytokine storm by early use of steroids even though it is found to be statistically nonsignificant such as p-value of 006009 several patients will be rescued therefore we should interpret the results based on the p-value cautiously and conversely misinterpretation or misunderstanding of p-value will cause a significant harm to the patients with covid-19 recently some groups showed the beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine 12 until these reports there was evidence of hydroxychloroquine on coronavirus just from in vitro study 5455 therefore the doctor who first used this drug in a patient with covid-19 might have done this treatment by non-evidence-based medicine we should try the oral steroids in patients with covid-19 at an early course of disease fifth the use of oral antibiotics should be actively considered if the patient feels not good because secondary bacterial infection might aggravate acute immunological lung injury induced by several cytokines eg il-2 il-6 and tnf- in covid-19 there are no controlled clinical trials evaluating the use of empiric antimicrobials in covid-19 patients or other coronavirus driven diseases therefore recommendations can only be based on other viral diseases like influenza 56 furthermore another guideline on treating covid-19 patients was released both guidelines suggest that blind or inappropriate use of antibacterial drugs especially the combination of broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs should be avoided in patients with mild or no symptoms 57 however we are against these guidelines because the current covid-19 situation is definitely different to other usual viral infections because some patients with mild symptoms can have severe radiologic features and sudden death furthermore bacterial superinfection is hard to detect and cannot be easily diagnosed symptoms of covid-19 and bacterial superinfection may overlap data on the prevalence of bacterial superinfection in patients with covid-19 are very limited 58 influenza pneumonia is often associated with staphylococcus aureus co-infection and can be especially virulent 56 initiating empiric antibacterial therapy in adults with community-acquired pneumonia who test positive for influenza was recommended by recent clinical practice guidelines 56 therefore we suggest that according to the clinical manifestations of patients if the accompanying bacterial infection cannot be ruled out patients can take antibacterial drugs against community-acquired pneumonia such as amoxicillin azithromycin or fluoroquinolones 57 empirical antibacterial treatment in severe patients should cover all possible pathogens deescalating therapy until the pathogenic bacteria are clarified 59 in addition the current special situation should also be considered currently if the patient is diagnosed as having covid-19 heshe will be isolated at home and is recommended that if severe symptoms are developed come to the hospital and no medications are provided however we think this is a very dangerous situation because some persons might have no or only mild symptoms despite severe progression of lung injury and when these patients become to feel dyspnea and come to the hospital the time might be late for the recovery they will receive not only intravenous antibiotics but also various kinds of multiple drugs we speculate that many patients who became to get severe symptoms might have bacterial complications it has been reported that bacterial coinfection is associated with approximately 40 of viral respiratory tract infections requiring hospitalization 60 the incidence of bacterial complications of covid-19 is unknown yet but considering that more patients with covid-19 get severe symptoms than observed in other respiratory viral diseases we speculate that more bacterial complications might be combined not only in severe conditions but also in mild conditions if the patient is having usual other respiratory viral infections heshe will visit the clinic and will be prescribed antibiotics however in the current situation the patient with covid-19 cannot visit an usual clinic and should wait until he will recover or get dyspnea if virus damages the throat or lungs other bacteria oral cavity can cause secondary infection and this cannot be exactly evaluated and diagnosed because the laboratory examinations for bacteria such as culture or procalcitonin may not be exact due to false negative and all the bacteria cannot be examined in this situation based on the medical principle do no harm waiting until the patient deteriorate is a severe harm therefore to prevent the deterioration of the patient with covid-19 oral antibiotics and oral steroids should be given to the patient at the time of covid-19 and it should be recommended if the patient has high fever and feels bad take the antibiotics and steroids empirically and it can be acceptable in the pandemic era as many patients are dying due to complications of covid-19 if the doctor can monitor and guide the patients with phone calls it will be better if there are enough medical personnels so in the current situation liberal and early use of oral antibiotics and steroids may be do no harm which may be a different situation than during the usual common cold situation in our experiences if the patient feels bad earlier antibiotics and steroids are used the patients condition will recover sixth hydroxychloroquine can be used as a secondary drug in patients with worsening symptoms in covid-19 chloroquine and its metabolite hydroxychloroquine are antimalarial agents that have demonstrated antiviral effects on sars-cov and sars-cov-2 in vitro 5455 chloroquine had inhibitory effects for multiple rna viruses in vitro chloroquine showed no antiviral or clinical beneficial effects in treatment of dengue and chikungunya virus infections and as influenza prophylaxis 61 a news briefing suggested that its use in more than 100 patients showed that it was superior to the control in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia improving lung imaging findings promoting a virus negative conversion and shortening the disease course but the data have not been published yet 62 a recent consensus document recommended chloroquine phosphate 500 mg twice daily for minimum of 5 days 63 another study found hydroxychloroquine more potent than chloroquine in vitro based on these data hydroxychloroquine for 4 days 400 mg twice daily after a loading dose of 400 mg was recommended 54 a recent systematic review found no published studies in covid-19 patients 64 furthermore adding azithromycin to hydroxychloroquine 600 mg daily treatment seemed to have a beneficial outcome in a small french cohort 12 however we should also be cautious in interpreting the results of hydroxychloroquine because the current situation is just based on the in vitro studies and small number of case series also the adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine should also be considered in this situation we think hydroxychloroquine should not be used as a routine treatment of covid-19 but if the condition of the patients worsens despite the use of steroids and antibiotics hydroxychloroquine can be used as a secondary drug seventh policy for the drug use should be changed to reduce the mortality of patients in usual situation the patient can visit the clinic frequently according to the condition therefore steroids and antibiotics can be given timely based on the judgement of doctors however this pattern of examination diagnosis and treatment cannot be done in this covid-19 era doctors prescriptions are surely important to diagnose and treat patients however as we mentioned above patients are just waiting for recovery or deterioration until severe symptoms and no treatment is done in the meanwhile if the patient is infected occur with covid-19 and gets fever and visit the different clinics the treatment will not be standardized among doctors if a doctor concerns for the fever and the nature of rapid deterioration in covid-19 he may use steroids and antibiotics early while other doctors may not if so we can make some guidelines for the practical use of antibiotics steroids and hydroxychloroquine for the patients to use these drugs these should also include the benefit and adverse effect for each drug the policy we are proposing is to give these drugs to the patients freely although the range of drug should also be more discussed in korea the diagnosis of covid-19 is being done by drive through our suggestion is to make another drive through place to give these drugs to the patients to avoid the dissemination of infection because if the infected patient go to the hospital for the treatment heshe can infect all other patients also it will be good if the drugs are given to the patient who is visiting the screening clinic for example at the time of drive through diagnosis and explain in detail the benefit and adverse effect for each drug and then the doctor can check the result for covid-19 and guides the patient for taking the drugs by phone calls also the patient can take these drugs at hisher judgement this concept is based on that 1 any treatment for covid-19 has not been established 2 even though the patient visits the doctor the treatment patterns will be all different among doctors 3 steroids have frequently been used in other mild diseases such as urticaria 4 because we do not exactly know the presence or absence of secondary infection when the patient get fever oral antibiotics for 34 days can be acceptable treatment in routine clinical practice further 5 hydroxychloroquine can also be given to the patients and it can be recommended that if the patients symptoms worsen despite the use of steroids and antibiotics heshe can take hydroxychloroquine after recognizing all the adverse effect of the drug but if the symptoms worsen the patient surely visit the hospital as well covid-19 is causing a severe public health emergency and the mortality is rapidly increasing all over the word in this era we suggested 7 recommendations to rescue the patients and to reduce the morbidity and mortality due to covid-19 based an immunological point of view table 2 ours may be personal opinions but we believe these may be beneficial to control these complications exerted by covid-19 in addition there will be more other or conflicting evidences and publications regarding our opinions however we would like to remind of the basic principle for the treatment of patients again but we often forget this do no harm we all should think deeply on what is harm and what is no harm in addition we would like to say again doing something is better than nothing in the acceptable level of clinical practice we hope that our opinions can be transferred to not only who and cdc but also clinicians researchers and many institutions and covid-19 could be finished as rapidly as possible all authors made substantial

treatment and prevention interventions chris triggle r devendra bansal elmoubasher farag abu hong ding ali sultan a helene rosenberg f   the coronavirus cov now named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is responsible for the disease coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and was first detected in early december 2019 in wuhan city hubei province china the disease was initially described as a pneumonia of unknown etiology with high fever that was not responding to drug treatment the early cases were linked to the huanan seafood market and by the end of december 25 similar cases had been reported unfortunately unlike earlier cases of avian flu the outbreak did not peter out and it was on 31 december 2019 that the world health organization who was informed and cases were finally reported and entered into the chinese national health database sars-cov-2 is a zoonotic virus related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov that was responsible for a 2002 outbreak and is also related to middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov responsible for middle east respiratory syndrome 1 covid-19 subsequently has with the exception of antarctica spread globally and the number of cases is growing daily 24 although as a result of the 2002 sars-cov epidemic china had created a rapid-response infectious disease reporting system there was an unfortunate delay in recognizing the early cases in december 2019 as a new sars-like outbreak and there was a rapid spread of covid-19 in hubei and beyond 5 the incubation period for covid-19 ranges from 2 to 14 days 6 7 up to 44 of covid-19 cases spread from person to person before symptoms appear thus emphasizing the difficulty in containing the spread and the importance of testing for the virus as well as the importance of control measures to reduce the spread of the virus such as hand washing social distancing and the use of face masks 8 furthermore some people are initially asymptomatic and may remain asymptomatic and serve to spread infection throughout the community although the report from china stated that the majority of those tested and initially found asymptomatic went on to develop covid-19 9 the clinical manifestations represent a wide spectrum of disease ranging from mild to severe respiratory syndrome influenza-like illness with mainly lower respiratory tract symptoms complicated by pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards high fever and headache 10 in many cases loss of taste and smell and severe gastrointestinal symptoms are reported as are cardiac problems with the latter being perhaps secondary to a cytokine storm such as is seen in the more severely affected patients 1012 based on the data from china approximately 80 of people infected with covid-19 present with mild to moderate disease that may include pneumonia about 14 have severe disease with blood oxygen saturation 93 and 6 are critical with respiratory failure septic shock andor serious multiple-organ dysfunction or failure 9 elderly persons and those with multiple comorbidities such as cancer cardiovascular disease diabetes and immunosuppressive diseases are at a higher risk of acquiring the infection and developing complications and are more likely to succumb to the infection 13 14 the case fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 5 but with country-to-country variability and likely inaccurate data reported in many countries the true number of infected persons is unknown due to inadequate testing 2 3 6 from a public health perspective it is important that health care workers and the public are aware of the resilience of the virus as reported in the new england journal of medicine when in the aerosol form as it leaves a human host the sars-cov-2 virus has a half-life of 11 to 12 h a range very similar to that seen with sars-cov-1 15 however the half-life of sars-cov-2 on metal and plastic is much longer with a half-life of 58 h for stainless steel and less for copper and cardboard but a half-life of 68 h on plastic thus appropriate care needs to be taken in the handling and cleaning with disinfectant of potentially virus-contaminated packages and containers 15 in addition because of the potential presence of asymptomatic carriers of sars-cov-2 in the community the experiences from the covid-19 pandemic point very clearly to the need to impose social distancing and for the wearing of face masks and the cancellation of public events including sports and religious gatherings thus limiting and slowing the spread of a pandemic in this article we discuss the current status treatment and prevention of covid-19 and the lessons that have so far been learnt and that should therefore help the world to prepare for any future pandemics during the first 4 months of 2020 there was a very rapid rise in the number of cases of covid-19 and a rapid global spread from the first case officially confirmed in wuhan on 31 december 2019 to cases being reported in several other countries in asia europe and north america and in australia and new zealand before the end of january 2020 covid-19 was first reported in the middle east in february 2020 and in south america africa and south pacific countries in march by 5 may 2020 more than 37 million cases of covid-19 more than 250000 deaths and more than 12 million recoveries had been reported 24 in the absence of a vaccine or drugs with known effectiveness against the sars-cov-2 coronavirus there was a highly variable response to the threat of covid-19 china south korea taiwan and vietnam all offer success stories in the control of the spread of this disease the main lesson from their experiences is that aggressive and early action is critically important china rolled out the most ambitious agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history and although experiencing 82000 cases and 4600 deaths to date seems to have controlled the spread of covid-19 although china is now pursuing an equally vigorous regimen to prevent a second wave of infections as a result of citizens returning from overseas the strategy that underpinned this containment effort was initially a national approach that promoted universal temperature monitoring masking and hand washing 9 on 23 january 2020 the chinese government announced a lockdown in the city of wuhan population 11 million 9 16 at that point the total number of known cases in china was about 1000 soon the lockdown was expanded to about 15 other cities covering the whole hubei province with a population of about 57 million the who described the actions taken by china as unprecedented in public health history taiwan based on the countrys experience with the earlier sars-cov outbreak established the taiwanese national health command center in 2004 and was well prepared to contain the spread of covid-19 immediately after the who was informed of the covid-19 outbreak on 31 december 2019 taiwan officials began checking all incoming airline passengers from wuhan with proactive testing and as appropriate quarantine 17 as of 5 may 2020 taiwan with a population of approximately 25 million has reported 450 cases and only 6 deaths 2 3 similarly south korea took aggressive action manifested in the early testing of hundreds of thousands of its people and tracking and isolation of infected individuals even using smartphone and gps technology 18 similar approaches have been considered in the past such as in the united kingdom with fluphone but to date there has been reluctance or disinterest with respect to accepting what might be considered a breach of privacy 18 south korea also introduced drive-through testing for covid-19 and achieved rates of testing of approximately 10000day representing an approach that is envied and is beginning to be copied by the rest of the world as a result in south korea the first wave of covid-19 infection is now receding and the situation seems to be under control based on the experiences in china and south korea it can be argued that government action that may initially be seen as excessive unjustified and possibly overly invasive of individual rights is essential thus such stringent controls have benefits in controlling the spread of a pandemic and reducing mortality vietnam is an example of a country with limited resources that was proactive in responding to covid-19 and as in the case of taiwan its ministry of health hospitals and clinics were well prepared before the country recorded its first case on january 23 2020 authorities in vietnam checked passengers at airports restricted movement where necessary followed up possible contacts closed schools and as of 5 may 2020 had administered 200000 tests for the virus and recorded only 271 cases 2 3 among non-asian countries new zealand stands out with a low number of cases that as of 5 may 2020 stood at 1500 cases 308 per million capita with only 20 deaths 2 3 new zealand was also proactive in checking incoming airline passengers requiring returning citizens to self-quarantine tracing contacts and then finally locking down the country interestingly the majority of the covid-19 cases occurred in clusters of 200 individuals suggesting that contact tracing may not have been completely effective in many other countries covid-19 spread very quickly with devastating effects iran has been one of the hardest hit by covid-19 infections and the failure to restrict travel at an early stage in the outbreak and lack of availability of hospital supplies due to the us-initiated sanctions may have been contributing factors 24 in march a number of countries in europefirst italy next spain and then the united kingdomsoon rivaled and surpassed china as the epicenters for covid-19 only to be overtaken by the united states as cases skyrocketed there at the end of march 2020 in italy the first case was identified in the lombardy region of northern italy in early february 2020 and the infected individual had been a recent visitor to china however the second case was not confirmed until 20 february 2020 and that person had no prior contact with the first case and had not recently visited china many more cases were quickly confirmed indicating that covid-19 was already widely spread in the community the availability of testing and the difficulties in containing the spread of the virus undoubtedly contributed to the rapid increase in confirmed cases and deaths although we do not have a clear answer as to why there was such a high case mortality rate in italy 13 as of 5 may 2020 2 3 age may be one factor as the citizens of italy represent the second oldest population in the world after japan with approximately 60 of the population over 40 higher mortality in care homes may also be a factor and this problem has been reported in several countries regardless in a comparison of the age profiles of covid-19 cases and deaths in italy versus china distinct differences have been noted and although mortality increases with age the case mortality rates are lower in the chinese population 19 in china the mean age of those who have died was reported to be 795 years with most suffering from at least one comorbidity and with approximately 75 of those with covid-19 disease being over 50 years old whereas only 14 people under 50 died from the disease 16 a lesson can also be learnt from a community v in northern italy where aggressive contact tracing was used to seek out and identify asymptomatic infected individuals and where all 3300 members of the community were tested resulting in much better control of further infections 20 germany despite having identified a high number of confirmed cases of covid-19 of 5 may 2020 managed to keep its case-fatality rate very much lower than that seen in either italy or spain 37 versus 10 to 13 2 3 19 the answer would seem to have been a proactive testing program utilizing a large network of independent laboratories that started testing as early as january 2020 other factors including the number of available hospital beds and a lower population age than in italy may also have contributed 21 in the united kingdom the government initially hoped that the development of herd immunity would reduce the impact of covid-19 the british government also depended upon public cooperation to restrict travel and it was not until 23 march 2020 and too late that the prime minister announced that people would be allowed out of their homes only for nonessential reasons and that the police had the power to impose fines on offenders similarly in the united states despite the first case being recorded in washington state on 21 january 2020 there was an initial dismissal at the federal level of the severity and risks of covid-19 and there were initial problems with the accuracy of cdcs covid-19 test kit as a consequence the infection rapidly spread at least in part due to us citizens returning primarily from europe who were already infected 22 a number of other factors might also contribute to the differences in infection and fatality statistics thus based on genomic analysis of 103 genomes rom genbank two distinct strains of sars-cov-2 have been reported with the l type more prevalent in the early stages of the breakout in wuhan and also more aggressive than the evolutionary older s type 23 however no supportive evidence has been produced indicating that such strain differences explain the differing country-to-country mortality rates it has also been argued that seasonal flu is more prevalent during the winter months and wanes when warmer weather arrives there is no evidence that weather would dramatically affect the spread of covid-19 and for example countries such as singapore have not been spared covid-19 with the number of cases per million similar to the rate in sweden 2 3 another factor may relate to differences in vaccination requirements from country to country of particular interest is whether the mycobacterium bovis bcg bacille calmette gurin vaccine for tuberculosis provides protection against covid-19 thus countries without a national requirement policy or that have dropped the requirement such as france italy spain the netherlands and the united states have had comparatively high infection and case fatality rates for covid-19 whereas countries such as china and japan that have a policy requiring vaccination of newborns report much lower levels 24 whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship between different strains of sars-cov-2 weather or bcg vaccination and infection and susceptibility to covid-19 requires careful retrospective epidemiological evidence that will require further analysis finally differences in the reporting of covid-19 deaths may distort statistics as has been evident with the apparent omission of those dying in care homes as well as deaths due to other morbidities that may have been attributed to covid-19 after the 2002 sars-cov epidemic the world was sensitized to the necessity of a fast response to contain future zoonotic infections in recognition of the threat china established a nationwide web-based automated system for reporting and responding to such infections 5 unfortunately covid-19 still managed to catch the world flat-footed and the lack of preparedness in many countries rapidly became apparent we can however better prepare for the next potentially equally lethal outbreak recommendations include the followingestablishing a rapid reporting system such that any unusual infectious outbreak eg pneumonia of unknown origin is immediately reported to the national health organization for appropriate investigation action and notification of the who should be a high priorityimmediately isolating the infected persons and identifying and quarantining individuals who have been in contact with infected persons is crucialwhen as in the case of covid-19 in wuhan spread of a virus has occurred within a local community it is essential to initiate a rigorous attempt to identify all persons who might have been in contact with the infected individuals for appropriate testing and potential quarantine an immediate lockdown of a town or area should also be considered the rigorous pursuit of contacts is extremely important as we have learnt with covid-19 many infected individuals may not show symptoms of the disease and could become super spreadersif the spread of the infection is no longer localized steps should be taken to impose social distancing limit travel limit public gatherings including sporting and religious events quarantine and impose other actions to better contain the spread of the pathogen the lessons that we have learnt from covid-19 are that these actions require 100 cooperation from the public and strong endorsement and if necessary enforcement by governments and that these clearly have not been evident in all countriesas was the case for covid-19 the early genomic identification of the causative pathogen is important and can facilitate determining and developing the optimal treatment optionsvaccine development could be enhanced by pursuing progress and clinical trials made with earlier vaccines developed for instance for sars-cov on the basis that such a vaccines may also benefit patients infected by a related pathogen coronavirus or help facilitate the development of new vaccinesenhancing of drug development programs should be undertaken and would serve to identify and establish preclinical testing of candidate molecules effective against coronaviruses and other potential zoonotic virusesestablishing a global network with a mandate to ensure that there is sufficient personal protective equipment and hospital equipment available to all affected countries to deal with a pandemic should also be performed to constrain the global spread of a pandemic
 as discussed asian countries such as china including hong kong south korea and taiwan have generally fared better than most european countries and the united states with respect to containing the spread of covid-19 and this can be attributed in part to the proactive measures taken to control and proactively test for covid-19 however another significant difference between western and asian countries is the wearing of face masks a practice that in some countries for example china south korea and japan was already very common and almost ubiquitous even in the absence of a known infection in contrast in the west it has been assumed that an individual wearing a face mask is infected with that individual possibly subjected to harassment furthermore in the west the argument has been made that there is an absence of evidence that wearing a non-n-95 surgical mask would provide protection against covid-19 and that encouraging asymptomatic noninfected people to wear face masks would further strain the personal protective equipment supply train and reduce availability to health care personnel however as stressed above it should be a priority for governments to ensure that adequate stocks of personal protective equipment are maintained and thus that such shortages should not occur interestingly as correctly stated by feng et al 25 with reference to the benefits of wearing a face mask however there is an essential distinction between absence of evidence and evidence of absence indeed proof has been provided that wearing a surgical mask can reduce droplet transmission from infected people 26 of course surgical masks are routinely worn by hospital personnel when treating patients so an assumption can be made that they likely do reduce infections transmitted from patients to health care personnel and vice versa interestingly many countries have reversed their recommendations on the wearing of face masks and now require their use undoubtedly this is an appropriate decision as it should reduce infection transmission of sars-cov-2 from that group of silent asymptomatic carriers to the noninfected public on 10 january 2020 the sars-cov-2 genome sequenced by chinese researchers was made available in genbank by yong-zhen zhang of the shanghai public health clinical center  school of public health fudan university 27 sars-cov-2 is an rna molecule with 29891 bases encoding 9860 amino acids and containing 15 genes one of which is the s gene which codes for the spike glycoprotein located on the surface of the viral envelope responsible for binding to the hosts cell via a receptor that for humans is angiotensin ang converting enzyme 2 ace2 27 28 of significance is that there is only 40 homology between sars-cov-2 and other sars viruses for the external binding domain of the virus spike protein 17 this may be of importance with respect to assuming that drugs that proved at least potentially successful when used to treat sars or mers patients might not be as effective or might be entirely ineffective against sars-cov-2 29 currently no specific therapeutic agents and preventive vaccines are available and approved for the covid-19 furthermore it is anticipated that despite unprecedented research activity a vaccine will not be available before 2021 30 however a number of drugs that have been approved for other diseases some of which have been tried in patients with sars-cov and mers-cov are being evaluated for the treatment of covid-19 the drugs include remdesivir baricitinib chloroquine hydroxychloroquine the interleukin-6 il-6 receptor monoclonal antibody tocilizumab and the anti-influenza drugs favipiravir and umifenovir 31 32 the advantage of investigating these drugs is that there is already an extensive knowledge base with respect to their use and safety in humans however as is also the case for vaccines it is essential that despite the urgency the introduction of new therapies should not be rushed at the expense of safety 33 first among the drugs being considered for use in treatment of covid-19 is chloroquine which was first synthesized by bayer pharmaceuticals germany in 1934 and has the advantage of being generic and inexpensive and shows good bioavailability when given orally chloroquine was first used in the 1940s to treat malaria and has also being successfully used against autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus where the drugs immunosuppressive effects against proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf- and il-6 are beneficial examples of the toxicity of chloroquine are well known with central nervous system cns side effects and macular retinopathy being the most serious however if chloroquine were to be used acutely for covid-19 treatment the risk of these side effects should be considerably less hydroxychloroquine is also effective against malaria lupus and rheumatoid arthritis and its use for these diseases is not associated with significant cardiovascular side effects hydroxychloroquine also has the advantage that doses higher than those appropriate for chloroquine could be used for antiviral purposes nonetheless concerns over cardiac toxicity should not be ignored particularly if its use for covid-19 is promoted before appropriate testing and if it is used in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine do have direct inhibitory effects on cardiac sodium and potassium channels albeit at high doses the potential of cardiac toxicity is critical because evidence has emerged that sars-cov-2 may itself directly negatively affect cardiac function perhaps as a result of a downregulation of ace2 andor secondary to a cytokine storm 12 hydroxychloroquine has very good bioavailability with a very long half-life of 22 to 30 days and is metabolized via cytochrome p450s cyp450 azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that has been used in combination with hydroxychloroquine in several clinical trials azithromycin has cyp450-inhibitory effects and therefore may reduce the metabolism of hydroxychloroquine and also can precipitate cardiac arrhythmias via its ability to prolong the qt interval thus a combination of the two drugs may result in an accumulation of hydroxychloroquine to toxic levels and trigger a fatal arrhythmia in addition there are serious concerns that because hydroxychloroquine is also used for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis diverting its use to covid-19 may seriously affect the availability of the drug to patients being treated for these autoimmune diseases the mechanisms for the antiviral actions of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are not fully understood however it is known from in vitro studies that as basic lysosomotropic drugs with a pka of 95 they become trapped in the acidic endosomes alkalinizing the organelle and thereby interfere with the ph-dependent entry of viruses including coronaviruses through the endolysosomal pathway 34 chloroquine may also interfere with glycosylation of the cell membrane receptor for the coronavirus ace2 thus preventing the binding and cellular entry of the virus as was shown in vitro for sars-cov 35 36 a number of clinical trials are under way and the early preliminary data from china demonstrated benefits in more than 100 patients with pneumonia where treatment with chloroquine resulted in elimination of the virus and improved recovery time compared to standard-of-care treatment soc 37 chloroquine is included in the 6th version of the guidelines for the prevention diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus-induced pneumonia issued by the national health commission nhc of the peoples republic of china in another clinical trial french researcher didier raoult in marseille reported that a 6-day treatment with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin with the antibiotic azithromycin included to reduce complications from secondary bacterial infections performed initially with 25 patients and later with 80 patients with covid-19 improved recovery and reduced viral load 38 however these were small nonrandomized unblinded trials and confirmative results are required from larger appropriately randomized controlled studies one such randomized trial discovery has been launched in europe and will compare the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine plus standard of care versus standard of care alone and in other arms of the study the effectiveness of remdesivir lopinavir plus ritonavir and lopinavir plus ritonavir plus interferon beta 39 interestingly the results from a multicenter open-label randomized trial of 150 patients in china treated with hydroxychloroquine versus soc for 28 days did not demonstrate relief of symptoms and the hydroxychloroquine group reported significantly higher levels of side effects 30 versus 88 40 treatment with hydroxychloroquine did however lower c-reactive protein crp levels thus supporting an anti-inflammatory action of the drug collectively and based on the current evidence the available positive data are insufficient to demonstrate that treatment with hydroxychloroquine would benefit covid-19 patients despite the current lack of conclusive positive medical evidence covid-19 patients are being treated with hydroxychloroquine in the united states under the provisions of the emergency use authorization second baricitinib is a small-molecule janus kinase jak inhibitor that is currently approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis viruses as mentioned above in the discussion of the putative antiviral effects of chloroquine infect cells via cell surface receptor-mediated endocytosis and for sars-cov-2 the receptor is ace2 endocytosis is regulated by kinases including ap2-associated protein kinase 1 aak1 and baricitinib inhibits aak1 41 arguably baricitinib should disrupt ace2-mediated sars-cov-2 endocytosis entry into cells within the same therapeutic plasma concentration range when used for rheumatoid arthritis and therefore baricitinib is postulated to be another candidate for clinical trials to treat covid-19 41 42 third remdesivir was developed to treat infections due to the ebola virus but its use was not pursued remdesivir is a prodrug that is administered via intravenous iv infusion and the active metabolite is an adenosine nucleoside analog that inhibits the action of viral rna polymerase thereby preventing viral replication remdesivir has been shown to be effective both in vitro and in a mouse model of sars-cov and appears to possess fairly broad anticoronavirus activity 43 several clinical trials are under way in asia china and the united states to study the efficacy and safety of remdesivir including an nih-sponsored randomized controlled trial at the university of nebraska medical center in omaha one small nonrandomized but multicenter trial of 61 patients with remdesivir reported clinical improvement in 36 of the 53 patients for whom data could be analyzed however there was no control group and a high number of side effects with serious side effects were reported in 12 patients 44 fourth ritonavir and lopinavir are two protease inhibitors that have been widely used in haart highly active antiretroviral therapy regimens as ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor treatment of hiv ritonavir is not only a protease inhibitor but also an inhibitor of cytochrome p4503a4 and thereby reduces the metabolism and enhances and prolongs the action of the second protease inhibitor in this case lopinavir protease inhibitors prevent viral replication by virtue of blocking the proteolytic cleavage of precursor proteins that are required by the virus 45 the ritonavirlopinavir combination has previously been shown to be effective in vitro and in an animal model of middle east respiratory syndrome mers and a clinical trial is under way to assess its effectiveness against mers 46 47 furthermore as reported in a case study in south korea a patient treated with ritonavir plus lopinavir displayed reduced viral loads and improved clinical symptoms however it was recognized that her recovery may simply reflect the natural course of the disease and regression to the norm 48 a randomized controlled open-label study of 199 covid-19 patients at chinas jin yin-tan hospital in wuhan led to the conclusion that the combination of ritonavir plus lopinavir did not provide sufficient benefits over standard care including reduction of viral rna load during the 28 days of the study 49 further studies are needed however therapies directed at viral replication may prove to be more effective in the early stages of covid-19 before significant pneumonia symptoms have developed fifth the anti-influenza drug favipiravir is an orally effective prodrug developed in japan and approved in 2014 for the treatment of influenza it differs from the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir in that it inhibits the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase in mid-march 2020 china announced that favipiravir had shown good clinical efficacy against covid-19 50 however it remains to be clarified at what stage of infection with covid-19 favipiravir is most effective another influenza drug that is being repurposed in russia and china is umifenovir often referred to by its brand name arbidol which is believed to prevent virus entry into the cell by inhibiting membrane fusion scientific support for the antiviral efficacy of umifenovir is sparse however and it has not been approved by the fda for the treatment of influenza another drug of interest is the antiparasitic drug ivermectin where in vitro data suggest potential benefits however based on the pharmacokinetic evidence the dose required to demonstrate in vivo efficacy for covid-19 treatment in humans would most likely prove too toxic to use 51 camostat is a promising drug that is approved in japan for pancreatitis and reflux esophagitis and targets the serine-threonine protease tmprss2 tmprss2 is the protease utilized by sars-cov-2 to prime the spike protein and facilitate binding to ace2 and entry into the cell camostat has been reported to have inhibited sars-cov-2 entry into human epithelial cells in an in vitro assay and clinical trials are being initiated 52 other approaches being pursued include the use of the cytokine interferon  which can be applied by inhalation directly to the lungs where it can activate the immune response the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra and health research authority hra 53 have approved a fast-tracked phase-2 trial with interferon  in the united kingdom it is one of the drugs whose use either alone or in combinations such as lopinavirritonavir is being studied for treating coronavirus diseases 54 serum therapy is also a consideration whereby the antibodies in the plasma of recovered covid-19 patients human convalescent-phase serum are used to combat infection in severely infected patients and such therapy has been used previously for instance during the 20092010 h1n1 influenza virus pandemic 55 56 in the most severely ill covid-19 patients a cytokine storm is a major contributor to the high mortality rate tocilizumab the humanized monoclonal antibody against the soluble and membrane-bound forms of the interleukin-6 il-6 receptor is being used with some success but as with the other drugs discussed here larger trials are required with appropriate controls before science-based recommendations on use can be made 57 inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas are used extensively in the treatment of cardiovascular disease and are beneficial to many patients with comorbidities of hypertension and diabetes and help protect renal function ace2 is ubiquitously expressed with the highest levels detected in the lungs cardiovascular system kidneys and the gastrointestinal system ace2 not only serves as a key receptor for the cellular entry of sars-cov-2 but also is an aminopeptidase that cleaves angiotensin i ang i and angiotensin ii ang ii into the ang1 to ang9 ang19 and ang17 peptides critically ang17 signaling via the mas receptor has cardiovascular protective activity reducing levels of ang ii thus loss of ace2 would be expected to increase the risk to the patient particularly in those with comorbidities the epidemiological evidence for covid-19 indicates that the elderly with comorbidities have a higher mortality rate and many are likely already being treated with drugs that target raas for underlying cardiovascular diseases controversy has however arisen with regard to whether patients being treated specifically with angiotensin converting enzyme 1 inhibitors aceis or ang ii receptor 1 blocker inhibitors arbs are protected or are at higher risk from covid-19 ace2 is downregulated in sars-co-v and the loss of ace2 may be a factor contributing to pulmonary dysfunction treatment with aceis and arbs arguably though without reproducible evidence should increase ace2 levels as a result of redirecting ang 1 and ang ii to ang 19 and ang17 respectively and should thus prove protective against covid-19 conversely by increasing ace2 activity treatment with aceis or arbs might enhance sars-cov-2 entry and exacerbate covid-19 and lung pathology the use of recombinant ace2 protein has been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach to treat covid-19 with the ace2 protein acting as a decoy receptor for sars-cov-2 58 the arguments both for and against the use of aceis and arbs in the presence of covid2 have been reviewed leading to the conclusion that based on the available evidence and given the risk reduction benefits of continued treatment with aceis and arbs there is no reason to switch treatment and that most patients should remain on their current therapy 59 60 further information will undoubtedly become available the contribution of traditional chinese medicine tcm to the therapeutic management of sars was evaluated as a result of its extensive use for sars-cov and although there was evidence of reduced morbidity and mortality possibly linked to anti-inflammatory effects the design of the studies and the fact that treatment with tcm was often combined with western medicines make it difficult to arrive at definitive conclusions with respect to the individual effectiveness of the tcms 61 for sars-cov-2 it has been estimated that 85 of covid-19 patients in china were treated with tcms 62 what is the prospect for new drugs specific for sars-cov-2 as previously noted there is only 40 homology between the sars-cov-2 spike protein and that of other sars viruses 29 thus efforts should be directed at identifying lead molecules that specifically target the sars-cov-2 and the viruss proteases mpro is one such target and since it has no known human homologues it should prove specific for the viruss replication machinery 63 most patients with covid-19 present with fever and many with headache the drug of choice if needed for its antipyretic and analgesic actions is paracetamol acetaminophen paracetamol is not a true nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug nsaid and lacks the anti-inflammatory antiplatelet anticoagulant effects of nsaids and is also gastrointestinal sparing gastro-sparing and therefore avoids some of the potential problems that might be present in patients with comorbidities and who may also present with severe gastrointestinal symptoms of covid-19 disease concerns have been presented by french officials with respect to the use of nsaids in patients with severe lung infections such as those seen with covid-19 as their anti-inflammatory actions may suppress the patients immune response there is as has been stated by the european medicines agency currently no scientific evidence to support this argument 64 it should be noted that the use of both cox-2 selective drugs such as coxibs celecoxib and nonaspirin nsaids has been associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk thus the use of these drugs in patients with cardiovascular disease and covid-19 should be evaluated on the basis of risk versus benefit 65 currently no vaccine is available to prevent infection with sars-cov-2 however there are several lines of evidence suggesting that development of a vaccine against sars-cov-2 is achievable including the followinga group of researchers from australia examined the immune response of a 47-year-old female who was experiencing mild-to-moderate symptoms of covid-19 66 they showed that recruitment of immune cell populations activated cd4 and cd8 t cells together with igm and igg sars-cov-2-binding antibodies in the patients blood before the resolution of symptoms these data indicate that robust multifactorial immune responses can be elicited in response to sars-cov-2 infection 66a study involving four rhesus macaques found that contracting sars-cov-2 protected against future reinfections 67 when the researchers reinfected two of the four monkeys with the virus 28 days after the initial infection a total of 96 nasopharyngeal and anal swabs tested negative after the reexposure of the monkeys to sars-cov-2 data obtained following the euthanasia and necropsy of one of the two monkeys confirmed these results 67 these data suggest that the immune response developed by the 2 animals had protected them from future exposure to sars-cov-2hoffmann and colleagues 52 studied whether antibodies made by people who had had a previous diagnosis of sars would prevent sars-cov-2 virus entry into cells they found that antibodies against the sars-cov s protein reduced the efficiency of infection into cells of a laboratory model virus with the sars-cov-2 spike s protein they also observed similar results with antibodies against s proteins made in rabbits 68 these results indicate that neutralizing antibody responses raised against the virus s protein could offer some protection against sars-cov-2 infection which may have implications for prevention of covd19 infectionanother study showed that antibody serum from four different mice could reduce by 90 infection with a laboratory model virus containing the sars-cov-2 s 69as argued by casadevall and pirofski 55 passive immunization with convalescent sera containing antibodies from patients who have recovered from covid-19 could prevent covid-19 infection evidence supporting the benefits of using convalescent plasma for covid-19 has been provided by china and includes radiological resolution reduction in viral loads and improved survival 69
 several efforts are under way to devise new vaccines and phase 1 clinical trials are ongoing in the united kingdom the united states germany france and china the first one is taking place at the kaiser permanente washington health research institute in seattle wa 70 in that trial 45 healthy volunteers are to receive a vaccine that contains a segment of genetic code copied from sars-cov-2 as the vaccine does not contain the actual sars-cov-2 the participants will not develop covid-19 at this stage the main purpose of this trial is to confirm the safety of such vaccine and it might take 12 to 18 months before the vaccine can be deployed as a preventive vaccine against covid-19 71 moderna inc cambridge ma usa is developing the mrna-based vaccine mrna-1273 which codes for the appropriate coronavirus proteins when this vaccine is injected into the body immune cells in the lymph nodes process the mrna and start immediately making the protein which is then recognized and marked for destruction 71 another mrna-based vaccine is being developed by the curevac biotech company in tbingen germany with plans to enter a human clinical trial in june 2020 72 in the united kingdom sarah gilbert and her colleagues at oxford university have begun a human and animal trial of chadox1 vaccine and expect it to be available by the end of the 2020 73 in china a recombinant vaccine has been developed by cansino biologics in collaboration with the academy of military medical sciences a clinical trial has begun among volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age 74 what is still unclear is the true mortality rate of covid-19 what is clear is that the elderly with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease diabetes cancer and immunosuppression-related diseases are at greater risk however an unknown fact is what percentage of people with mild symptoms that perhaps were attributed to flu were misdiagnosed and therefore were omitted from being tested possibly the mortality will prove not to be high as has been reflected in some reports and hopefully will prove to be closer to 1 this should become clearer in the coming months it is also apparent that the overall global response to covid-19 has been inadequate with considerable differences in how rapidly and appropriately different nations have responded these deficiencies emphasize the need for greater collaboration as well as the benefits of testing for the disease in a timely manner of contact tracing of suspected carriers and of containing the spread by limiting the movement of people within and between regions valuable lessons have been learnt but at considerable cost it is appropriate to quote bill gates from his 2015 ted talk that was also published in the new england journal of medicine 75 perhaps the only good news from the tragic ebola epidemic in guinea sierra leone and liberia is that it may serve as a wake-up call we must prepare for future epidemics of diseases that may spread hopefully in 2020 the lessons learnt from covid-19 will stimulate a collaborative global effort and a greater focus on how to better control future pandemics and the development of new drugs and vaccines to target potential zoonotic diseases  a randomized trial of hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis for covid-19 david boulware r matthew pullen f ananta bangdiwala s katelyn pastick a sarah lofgren m

prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine after exposure to covid-1912 we randomly assigned participants in a 11 ratio to receive either hydroxychloroquine or placebo participants had known exposure by participant report to a person with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 whether as a household contact a health care worker or a person with other occupational exposures trial enrollment began on march 17 2020 with an eligibility threshold to enroll within 3 days after exposure the objective was to intervene before the median incubation period of 5 to 6 days because of limited access to prompt testing health care workers could initially be enrolled on the basis of presumptive high-risk exposure to patients with pending tests however on march 23 eligibility was changed to exposure to a person with a positive polymerase-chain-reaction pcr assay for sars-cov-2 with the eligibility window extended to within 4 days after exposure this trial was approved by the institutional review board at the university of minnesota and conducted under a food and drug administration investigational new drug application in canada the trial was approved by health canada ethics approvals were obtained from the research institute of the mcgill university health centre the university of manitoba and the university of alberta we included participants who had household or occupational exposure to a person with confirmed covid-19 at a distance of less than 6 ft for more than 10 minutes while wearing neither a face mask nor an eye shield high-risk exposure or while wearing a face mask but no eye shield moderate-risk exposure participants were excluded if they were younger than 18 years of age were hospitalized or met other exclusion criteria see the supplementary appendix available with the full text of this article at nejmorg persons with symptoms of covid-19 or with pcr-proven sars-cov-2 infection were excluded from this prevention trial but were separately enrolled in a companion clinical trial to treat early infection recruitment was performed primarily with the use of social media outreach as well as traditional media platforms participants were enrolled nationwide in the united states and in the canadian provinces of quebec manitoba and alberta participants enrolled themselves through a secure internet-based survey using the research electronic data capture redcap system13 after participants read the consent form their comprehension of its contents was assessed participants provided a digitally captured signature to indicate informed consent we sent follow-up e-mail surveys on days 1 5 10 and 14 a survey at 4 to 6 weeks asked about any follow-up testing illness or hospitalizations participants who did not respond to follow-up surveys received text messages e-mails telephone calls or a combination of these to ascertain their outcomes when these methods were unsuccessful the emergency contact provided by the enrollee was contacted to determine the participants illness and vital status when all communication methods were exhausted internet searches for obituaries were performed to ascertain vital status randomization occurred at research pharmacies in minneapolis and montreal the trial statisticians generated a permuted-block randomization sequence using variably sized blocks of 2 4 or 8 with stratification according to country a research pharmacist sequentially assigned participants the assignments were concealed from investigators and participants only pharmacies had access to the randomization sequence hydroxychloroquine sulfate or placebo was dispensed and shipped overnight to participants by commercial courier the dosing regimen for hydroxychloroquine was 800 mg 4 tablets once then 600 mg 3 tablets 6 to 8 hours later then 600 mg 3 tablets daily for 4 more days for a total course of 5 days 19 tablets total if participants had gastrointestinal upset they were advised to divide the daily dose into two or three doses we chose this hydroxychloroquine dosing regimen on the basis of pharmacokinetic simulations to achieve plasma concentrations above the sars-cov-2 in vitro half maximal effective concentration for 14 days14 placebo folate tablets which were similar in appearance to the hydroxychloroquine tablets were prescribed as an identical regimen for the control group rising pharmaceuticals provided a donation of hydroxychloroquine and some hydroxychloroquine was purchased the primary outcome was prespecified as symptomatic illness confirmed by a positive molecular assay or if testing was unavailable covid-19related symptoms we assumed that health care workers would have access to covid-19 testing if symptomatic however access to testing was limited throughout the trial period covid-19related symptoms were based on us council for state and territorial epidemiologists criteria for confirmed cases positivity for sars-cov-2 on pcr assay probable cases the presence of cough shortness of breath or difficulty breathing or the presence of two or more symptoms of fever chills rigors myalgia headache sore throat and new olfactory and taste disorders and possible cases the presence of one or more compatible symptoms which could include diarrhea15 all the participants had epidemiologic linkage15 per trial eligibility criteria four infectious disease physicians who were unaware of the trial-group assignments reviewed symptomatic participants to generate a consensus with respect to whether their condition met the case definition15 secondary outcomes included the incidence of hospitalization for covid-19 or death the incidence of pcr-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection the incidence of covid-19 symptoms the incidence of discontinuation of the trial intervention owing to any cause and the severity of symptoms if any at days 5 and 14 according to a visual analogue scale scores ranged from 0 no symptoms to 10 severe symptoms data on adverse events were also collected with directed questioning for common side effects along with open-ended free text outcome data were measured within 14 days after trial enrollment outcome data including pcr testing results possible covid-19related symptoms adherence to the trial intervention side effects and hospitalizations were all collected through participant report details of trial conduct are provided in the protocol and statistical analysis plan available at nejmorg we anticipated that illness compatible with covid-19 would develop in 10 of close contacts exposed to covid-199 using fishers exact method with a 50 relative effect size to reduce new symptomatic infections a two-sided alpha of 005 and 90 power we estimated that 621 persons would need to be enrolled in each group with a pragmatic internet-based self-referral recruitment strategy we planned for a 20 incidence of attrition by increasing the sample size to 750 participants per group we specified a priori that participants who were already symptomatic on day 1 before receiving hydroxychloroquine or placebo would be excluded from the prophylaxis trial and would instead be separately enrolled in the companion symptomatic treatment trial because the estimates for both incident symptomatic covid-19 after an exposure and loss to follow-up were relatively unknown in early march 20209 the protocol prespecified a sample-size reestimation at the second interim analysis this reestimation which used the incidence of new infections in the placebo group and the observed percentage of participants lost to follow-up was aimed at maintaining the ability to detect an effect size of a 50 relative reduction in new symptomatic infections an independent data and safety monitoring board externally reviewed the data after 25 and 50 of the participants had completed 14 days of follow-up stopping guidelines were provided to the data and safety monitoring board with the use of a landemets spending function analogue of the obrienfleming boundaries for the primary outcome a conditional power analysis was performed at the second and third interim analysis with the option of early stopping for futility at the second interim analysis on april 22 2020 the sample size was reduced to 956 participants who could be evaluated with 90 power on the basis of the higher-than-expected event rate of infections in the control group at the third interim analysis on may 6 the trial was halted on the basis of a conditional power of less than 1 since it was deemed futile to continue we assessed the incidence of covid-19 disease by day 14 with fishers exact test secondary outcomes with respect to percentage of patients were also compared with fishers exact test among participants in whom incident illness compatible with covid-19 developed we summarized the symptom severity score at day 14 with the median and interquartile range and assessed the distributions with a kruskalwallis test we conducted all analyses with sas software version 94 sas institute according to the intention-to-treat principle with two-sided type i error with an alpha of 005 for participants with missing outcome data we conducted a

respirators of those 365 received hydroxychloroquine and 354 received placebo approximately 60 of the participants reported not wearing any element of personal protective equipment during their covid-19 exposure overall new covid-19 either pcr-confirmed or symptomatically compatible developed in 107 of 821 participants 130 during the 14 days of follow-up table 2 the incidence of new illness

participants 46 in the hydroxychloroquine group and 42 in the placebo group did not complete the day 14 survey among these participants vital status was unknown for 36 in the hydroxychloroquine group and 33 in the control group in sensitivity analyses exclusion of these persons from the denominator or inclusion of them as having had an event did not affect the trial conclusions table s1 of 113 persons in whom symptomatic illness developed 16 had pcr-confirmed disease 74 had illness that was compatible with probable covid-19 per the us case definition 13 had possible covid-19 with compatible symptoms and epidemiologic linkage and 10 were adjudicated as not having covid-19 on the basis of the symptom complex table s2 four additional participants had positive pcr tests and were asymptomatic during the 14-day trial period symptoms eventually developed in 3 of these participants the median number of symptoms was 4 interquartile range 2 to 5 among participants with covid-19 the most frequent symptoms were cough 449 of the 107 participants with covid-19 fever 346 shortness of breath 187 fatigue 495 sore throat 402 myalgia 374 and anosmia 234 among participants who were symptomatic at day 14 the median symptom-severity score on a scale from 0 to 10 with higher scores indicating greater severity was 28 interquartile range 16 to 50 in those receiving hydroxychloroquine and 27

participants in the hydroxychloroquine group 312 of 414 and 826 of those in the placebo group 336 of 407 having taken all 19 prescribed tablets over a period of 5 days p001 the most common reason that participants stopped taking the assigned hydroxychloroquine or placebo was side effects 17 participants in the hydroxychloroquine group and 8 in the placebo group side effects were more frequent with hydroxychloroquine than with placebo table 3 among the participants who took any hydroxychloroquine 401 140 of 349 reported a side effect by day 5 as compared with 168 59 of 351 receiving placebo p0001 nausea loose stools and abdominal discomfort were the most common side effects there were no serious intervention-related adverse reactions or cardiac arrhythmias on day 14 we assessed how well the masking of the trial interventions was maintained of the 344 participants in the hydroxychloroquine group who completed the day 14 survey question 160 465 correctly identified that they received hydroxychloroquine 151 439 were unsure and 33 10 believed that they received placebo of the 353 participants in the control group who completed the day 14 survey question 126 357 correctly identified that they received placebo 168 476 were unsure and 59 167 believed that they received hydroxychloroquine participants who reported any side effect regardless of trial group at day 5 were 37 times as likely to believe that they received hydroxychloroquine as participants who did not report side effects 122 of 179 participants 682 reporting side effects and 94 of 504 participants 187 not reporting side effects p0001 in the absence of side effects blinding was well maintained in this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial we investigated the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine as covid-19 postexposure prophylaxis in this trial high doses of hydroxychloroquine did not prevent illness compatible with covid-19 when initiated within 4 days after a high-risk or moderate-risk exposure we used a pragmatic approach to recruitment and follow-up of participants through internet-based self-referral and online follow-up surveys and we couriered the trial interventions directly to participants homes this approach allowed for recruitment across north america minimized the risk of sars-cov-2 infection to researchers lowered the burden of research participation and provided a timely answer to this question of whether postexposure prophylaxis was effective moreover this approach allowed broad geographic participation regardless of anyones physical distance from academic centers increasing the generalizability of the findings one result of our approach was that enrolled participants were generally younger and healthier than those at risk for severe covid-19 although the risk of severe covid-19 is related to age and coexisting conditions16 the risk of acquiring symptomatic infection is generally still present among adults regardless of age although pcr or serologic testing for asymptomatic infection would have added to the scientific strength of this trial this was not possible and we cannot assess an effect on mild or asymptomatic infections although a marginal possible benefit from prophylaxis in a more at-risk group cannot be ruled out the potential risks that are associated with hydroxychloroquine may also be increased in more at-risk populations and this may essentially negate any benefits that were not shown in this large trial involving younger healthier participants we acknowledge that this trial has limitations because of the lack of availability of diagnostic testing in the united states the vast majority of the participants including health care workers were unable to access testing thus an a priori symptomatic case definition was used  the us clinical case definition of probable covid-1915 this trial represents real-world implementation after exposure in the context of a randomized trial design any nonsars-cov-2 viral infection eg influenza adenovirus or rhinovirus should be equally distributed in the trial groups owing to the internet-based approach used to rapidly recruit participants in the context of a pandemic data were obtained by means of participant report the types and frequency of symptoms that were observed are similar to those in previous studies involving us health care providers17 the us case definition is how probable covid-19 cases are nationally reportable1518 however the predictive power of this case definition is unknown particularly in the younger populations that we studied given the small number of pcr tests it remains theoretically possible that hydroxychloroquine therapy limits proven infection reproduction of our results in other ongoing trials would confirm our findings this randomized trial did not demonstrate a significant benefit of hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis for covid-19 whether preexposure prophylaxis would be effective in high-risk populations is a separate question with trials ongoing in order to end the pandemic a reduction in community transmission is needed  non-optimal effectiveness of convalescent plasma transfusion and hydroxychloroquine in treating covid-19 a case report tian-min xu bin lin cong chen long-gen liu yuan xue   coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a pandemic that is rapidly spreading worldwide it has been reported that 1020 of severe patients with mild atypical symptoms initially can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome the main cause of respiratory failure 1 few studies have reported the effectiveness of convalescent plasma cp transfusion in treating critically ill patients with covid-19 24 the clinical symptoms were significantly improved within 3 days and the viral load was undetectable within 7 days after cp transfusion 3 these results are encouraging and worthy of further investigation nevertheless zeng et al 5 reported that sars-cov-2 became undetectable after cp transfusion but it could not reduce mortality in critically ill covid-19 patients moreover hydroxychloroquine was found to be active against sars-cov-2 in vitro and is a treatment option in clinical practice yao et al 6 reported that hydroxychloroquine was more potent than chloroquine to inhibit sars-cov-2 in vitro herein we administered cp transfusion and hydroxychloroquine to a patient with severe covid-19 and analyzed their clinical symptoms oxygenation index oi and dynamics of viral load a 65-year-old chinese man who was diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 was admitted to our isolation ward on 25 march 2020 a week before his admission he flew in from brazil airport and was subsequently

c-reactive protein crp 488 mgl and low white blood cell count 196  109l indicative of severe covid-19 oxygen and atomized inhalation of recombinant human interferon-2b was given at admission cp from two convalescent patients was intravenously given and hydroxychloroquine shanghai zhongxi pharmaceuticals shanghai china was orally administrated for a week 02 g three times a day as shown in fig 1 on day 4 after cp transfusion the lactic acid and crp levels remained high 21 mmoll and 7323 mgl respectively the arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation sao2 decreased to 86 while the oi decreased to 76 mmhg and mechanical ventilation was administered his temperature returned to normal and the oi ascended above 300 on day 11 after which the ventilator was withdrawn on day 11 after cp transfusion the rna test remained positive in throat swab and ct revealed severe pulmonary lesions fig 2
 in addition no apparent side-effects were found during cp transfusion and hydroxychloroquine treatments currently the pathogenesis of covid-19 remains unclear and no specific treatment is available cytokine storm and excessive inflammation coexist and may lead to multiple organ failure both antiviral therapy and treatment of the systematic response are important for patients with rapid deterioration of covid-19 in a study with small sample size the median time from onset of illness to cp transfusion was 165 days and the disappearance of viremia was observed in 7 days after cp transfusion 3 the results suggested that cp therapy could potentially improve the clinical outcomes by neutralizing viremia in severe covid-19 3 in another study cp transfusion was given at a median of 215 days after first detection of sars-cov-2 the viral load became negative 3 days after cp transfusion though 5 of 6 patients died eventually 5 unexpectedly the viral load remained detectable on day 11 after combination therapy with cp and hydroxychloroquine considering the time from onset of illness to cp transfusion in previous studied 3 5 it is difficult to prove whether the viremia is cured by the cp and antiviral agent or is a natural course of covid-19 indeed there is a limitation that antibodies against sars-cov-2 in cp from the two convalescent patients and the present patient are not detected based on our clinical experience sufficient evidence supporting the use of cp and hydroxychloroquine in treating covid-19 is lacking our findings suggested that the effectiveness of combination therapy with cp and hydroxychloroquine may be non-optimal and specific therapy needs to be explored  comment treatment strategies to fight the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 a challenge for a

new lung disease covid-194 is closely related to sars-cov and together with mers-cov are three new human coronaviruses that emerged in the last 20 years 5 the three viruses are associated with

ongoing pandemic httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirus sars-cov-2 is an enveloped positive sense single stranded non-segmented rna virus of the betacoronavirus family 7 remdesivir targets virus replication through inhibition of the viral rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp required for the copying and synthesis of novel viral genomes and viral mrnas for the expression of viral proteins remdesivir incorporation in the nascent viral rna by the rdrp results in premature chain termination and because of the high conservation of the core rdrp enzyme among coronaviruses it has a broad-spectrum antiviral efficacy against multiple genetically distinct coronaviruses including the sars-cov and mers-cov in vitro and in vivo 8 furthermore it has shown prophylactic action against infection of corona viruses in animal models 8 notably remdesivir potently blocked sars-cov-2 infection at low-micromolar concentration and showed high selectivity index in vero e6 cells a monkey epithelial cell line ec50  077 m cc50 100 m si 12987 9 it should be noted that remdesivir resistance is already documented for sars-cov and other coronaviruses that lead to reduced viral inhibition 10 the outcomes in a cohort of patients hospitalized for severe covid-19 who were treated with remdesivir on a compassionate-use basis were recently reported by grein et al 11 fifty-three patients received 10-day course of remdesivir consisting of a loading dose of 200 mg intravenously on day 1 plus 100 mg daily for the following 9 days improvement in oxygen-support status was observed in 68 of patients and overall mortality was 13 over a median follow-up of 18 days although no data on viral dynamics were documented throughout the study clinical improvement was less frequent among patients receiving invasive ventilation than among those receiving noninvasive ventilation and among patients aged 70 years or older as compared with patients younger than 50 years chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine a less toxic derivative represent potential broad-spectrum example of inhibiting viral cell entry chloroquine is a weak base that becomes entrapped in membrane-enclosed low ph organelles such as endosomes and lysosomes and inhibits their acidification low ph in the endosomes regulates the action of proteases that lead to conformational changes of the virus envelope proteins allowing for the fusion of cellular and viral membranes and the escape of the viral genome into the cytosol attachment and entry of sars-cov-2 on host cells requires interaction of the spike protein subdomain 1 s with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 and its proteolytic cleavage by tmprss2 and to a lesser degree by the acid activated cathepsin bl 12 although the exact mechanism of sars-cov-2 entry is not completely understood and a new study has suggested that ph-dependent fusion of viral and cellular membranes is dispensable for viral genome entry into host cells chloroquine similarly to remdesivir inhibited sars-cov-2 infection at low-micromolar concentration and showed high selectivity index in vero e6 cells ec50  113 m cc50 100 m si 8850 9 chloroquine is also used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as sle and ra 13 although the precise mechanism of action is not documented inhibition of endosome acidification also interferes with innate immune response signaling from endosomal tlrs such as tlr 3 7 8 and 9 that mainly detect nucleic acid pamps and damps and in this way reduce inflammatory responses therefore chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may also protect the host from overt inflammatory responses driven by the activation of immune cells such as macrophages by the increased load of viral rna or cellular nucleic acids released from infected cells results from clinical trials using chloroquine have provided promising results despite the limitations of these studies and suggest that chloroquine may represent a line of defense in the protection of medical stuff and patients with increased risk for severe covid-19 symptoms chen et al 14 evaluated the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine hcq in the treatment of 62 patients with mild covid-19 from february 4 to 28 2020 at renmin hospital of wuhan university patients were randomized either in a control group receiving standard treatment or in the hcq group in which the patients received standard treatment plus hcq 200 mgbid between days 1 and 5 the study focused on time to clinical recovery ttcr clinical characteristics of patients and pulmonary recovery as it was depicted on chest ct results one day before day 0 and one day after day 6 a beneficial effect of hcq in the treatment of covid-19 was pointed out despite the small number of the cases more specifically body temperature recovery time and cough remission time were significantly reduced in the hcq treatment group moreover the study of the chest ct scans revealed larger proportion of patients with improved pneumonia in the hcq group 806 compared with the control group 548 gautret et al 15 from france conducted a single arm protocol from early march to march 16 patients received 600 mg of hydroxychloroquine daily azithromycin was added to the treatment regimen as the clinical presentation required and the control group was represented by untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol patientsviral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was evaluated on daily basis virus clearance at day-6 post-inclusion was the primary endpoint while virus clearance during the study period clinical parameters and occurrence of side-effects were considered secondary outcomes regarding the effect of hydroxychloroquine on viral load the study showed that a greater proportion of patients from the treated group had negative pcr results at days 3-6 post-inclusion compared with the control group interestingly at day 6 post-inclusion the percentage of negative pcr patients in the treated group was 70 while it was 125 in the control group p0001 the addition of azithromycin in the therapeutic regimen enhanced the beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine more intensely patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were all 100 clear of virus at day 6 post-inclusion comparing with 571 in the group that was treated with hydroxychloroquine only and 125 in the control group p0001 the last two arms of solidarity and discovery trials include kaletra which is a combination of two antiviral drugs - lopinavir and ritonavir - normally used to treat hiv lopinavir acts against the viral 3cl protease responsible for the cleavage of the viral structural proteins from a polypeptide chain in order to produce new virions lopinavir has modest antiviral activity against mers and is significantly less potent than remdesivir 16 however in combination with ritonavir and the antiviral immunomodulator interferon  it is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of mers 17 the efficacy and safety of oral lopinavir-ritonavir for sars-cov-2 infection was tested through a randomized controlled trial in china but found no benefit beyond standard care 18 kaletra with or without interferon 1 will be tested in the solidarity and discovery trials favipiravir brand name avigan is a type of rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp inhibitor which acts through blocking the replication of rna viruses and is a potential antiviral agent against sars-cov-219 a prospective multicenter open-label randomized superiority trial examined the efficacy of favipiravir n120 versus arbidol n120 for treating covid-1920 there was no difference in the 7-day clinical recovery rate primary endpoint for favipiravir versus arbidol in the overall population 6121 versus 5167 p014 however this difference existed for a subgroup of non-critical patients without hypertension or diabetes favipiravir 7143 versus arbidol 5586 p002 20 three registered clinical trials are planned regarding the use of favipiravir against covid-19 21-23 several promising theurapeutic options are emerging such as a protease inhibitor specific for tmprss2 cell protease required for virus entry 12 the broad spectrum orally bioavailable -d-n4-hydroxycytidine nhc eidd-1931 that is incorporated in the viral genome by the rdrp leading to the accumulation of deleterious mutations and viral inactivation 24 the four current regimens in solidarity and discovery focus on antiviral drugs rather than treating ards symptoms that are actually the cause of the virus morbidity and mortality hyperinflammation in coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 could be a driver of severity that may be managed with immunomodulatory therapeutic options 2526 low-dose corticosteroid therapy shock-reversal over no corticosteroid therapy is suggested for adults with covid-19 and refractory shock in mechanically ventilated adults with covid-19 and respiratory failure but without ards the routine use of systemic corticosteroids is not suggested however in mechanically ventilated adults with covid-19 and ards using systemic corticosteroids is suggested 27-29 importantly the use of hydroxychloroquine with or without the co-administration of azithromycin may not be beneficial for the treatment of critically ill patients admitted to the icu 30 and is not recommended 2731 immunomodulatory drugs such as tocilizumab actemra anti-il6 have been tested during the pandemic however great caution in inhibiting host antiviral responses should be taken 26 tocilizumab actemra is a recombinant humanized anti-human il-6 receptor monoclonal antibody currently used for rheumatoid arthritis 32 xu et al demonstrated that giving tocilizumab in addition to routine therapy to patients diagnosed as severe or critical covid-19 is an effective treatment 33 covacta is a newly initiated randomized double-blind placebo-controlled phase iii study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous actemraroactemra added to standard care in adult patients hospitalized with severe covid-19 pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard care the primary and secondary endpoints include clinical status mortality mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit icu variables 34 finally the use of stem cell therapy to treat covid-19 is currently considered with multiple clinical trials from china registered at wwwclinicaltrialsgov 35 in a recently published clinical trial with a limited number of patients 7 patients 1 critically serious 4 serious and 2 common infected with the coronavirus received one dose of stem cell therapy with 3 patients in the control group 3 serious did not all patients with stem cell therapy recovered whereas in the control group one patient died while another patient developed ards and only one patient in the control group was stable 36 important considerations in the successful testing and use of currently available and future therapies for covid-19 are the timing of the treatment the viral load of the patient and markers predictive of lung injury antiviral treatment is more efficient as a prophylactic measure and at earlier times during the infection when virus replication is at its peak conversely immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory treatments may be more effective later and may be combined with careful monitoring of the patient viral loads the emergence of zoonotic human viruses causing pandemics are probably not going to be limited to the sars-cov-2 and represent enormous threats to global health pandemic preparedness in the future broad-based vaccines and therapeutics which are active against the higher risk virus families prone to emergence are desperately needed as well as global efforts to minimize their emergence  clinical trials on drug repositioning for covid-19 treatment sandro rosa g wilson santos c   we performed a search on march 12 2020 at the clinicaltrials gov database with the descriptor coronavirus in the simple search field conditions or disease search without restrictions on languages disease conditions results or locations the eligibility criteria for the retrieved studies were contain a clinicaltrialsgov base identifier number describe the number of participants and the study period describe the patients clinical conditions and interventions utilize medicines already studied or approved for any other disease in patients with covid-19 clinicaltrialsgov is a resource from the us national library of medicine and it contains clinical studies conducted by 209 countries we identified 24 clinical trials table 1 in which 19 studies were at clinical phases 2 3 or 4 the pharmaceutical interventions found for covid-19 treatment include human immunoglobulin interferons chloroquine hydroxychloroquine arbidol remdesivir oseltamivir favipiravir carrimycin methylprednisolone bevacizumab thalidomide vitamin c pirfenidone bromhexine fingolimod danoprevir ritonavir darunavir cobicistat lopinavir xiyanping and traditional chinese medicines tcm chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are antimalarial drugs they have antiviral effects against human immuno-deficiency virus hiv namely by inhibiting virus entry into host cells another antiviral mechanism is related to the post-translation alteration of newly synthesized proteins via glycosylation inhibition 12 hydroxychloroquine is already being used in clinical trials on acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids treatment 13 in a recent trial with patients on covid-19 treatment 14 100 of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine in combination with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin were virologically cured comparing with 571 in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone and 125 in the control group currently chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will be tested 1516 in patients with pneumonia caused by 2019-ncov and chloroquine as preventative medicine for covid-19 as shown in table 1 immunoglobulins are useful in several diseases such as idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura itp guillain-barre syndrome gbs chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy cidp kawasaki disease and in multiple neurological autoimmune disorders refractory to standard immunosuppressive treatments 17 broadly neutralizing antibodies can recognize a wide variety of glycoproteins gps in virus surfaces or the protein shell of a non-enveloped virus however hiv-1 dengue virus denv influenza viruses hepatitis c virus hcv and ebola virus ebov can mutate superficial gps in order to evade the antibody response an obstacle in the development of new therapies against such infections 18 trial nct04261426 19 is utilizing human immunoglobulin in patients with pneumonia caused by 2019-ncov table 1 two clinical studies refer to the use of remdesivir in severe 20 or mild 21 respiratory infections by sars-cov-2 remdesivir is a nucleotide analog inhibitor of the ebov rna-polymerase rna-dependent rdrp dyer et al 2019 22 described preliminary findings of a mortality rate of 33 in 499 patients treated with remdesivir against the ebov disease in early infection stages the same authors noted a mortality rate of 75 almost 1 900 people of non-treated infected patients during the same epidemic period 22 wang et al 2020 23 presented data showing that remdesivir is effective against the 2019-ncov in vero e6 cells ec90 176 m the suggested mechanism for remdesivir involves the host cells post-entry stage 23 arbidol also known as umifenovir is approved in russia and china for the treatment of influenza virus infections it does not have significant adverse effects and is patented for sars treatment 24 as shown in table 1 four clinical trials will be conducted for covid-19 treatment one with arbidol in comparison with the basic treatment 25 and the other three studies comparing effects with oseltamivir 2627 lopinavir-ritonavir 27 and carrimycin 28 the arbidol anti-viral mechanism against influenza a and b involves viral fusion inhibition with the targeted membrane which blocks virus entry into the cell 24 oseltamivir is another drug approved for influenza a and b treatment it inhibits the viral neuraminidase and consequently blocks the release of viral particles from host cells reducing the spread in the respiratory tract 29 additionally the use of oseltamivir was already reported during the covid-19 epidemic in china either with or without antibiotics and corticosteroids 30 oseltamivir is also used in a clinical trial with multiple combinations with chloroquine and favipiravir 31 a nucleoside analog that is well-known as a broad-spectrum antiviral drug it has shown 23 an ec50 of 6188 m against sars-cov-2 and low toxicity cc50 400 m the lopinavir-ritonavir combination is approved for aids treatment in several countries both drugs are hiv protease inhibitors but ritonavir is also a cytochrome p450 and gp inhibitor a fact that endorses the lopinavir pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic activities against hiv 32 such a combination plus -1b interferon is in phase 2 for the mers treatment 33 several trials involve lopinavir-ritonavir treatment in comparison with the use of other drugs for covid-19 arbidol 2627 carrimycin 28 tcm 3435 xiyanping 3637 danoprevir-ritonavir 38 and interferon inhalation 3438 nevertheless one previous article argued that in a clinical trial with 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection the lopinavir-ritonavir combination was not associated with clinical improvement comparing with standard care procedures 39 carrimycin is a macrolide antibiotic with effects against some gram-positive bacteria and in vitro effects on mycobacterium tuberculosis 40 danoprevir is an hcv ns3 protease inhibitor approved in china for the treatment of non-cirrhotic genotype 1b chronic hepatitis c in combination with ritonavir peginterferon-a and ribavirin 41 traditional chinese medicine tcm uses phytotherapeutic formulations such as teas pills powders or tinctures and cultural components that originated 5000 years ago in chinese medicine 42 tcms were already used for sars-cov infection in 2002 as coadjuvant therapy with the enhancement of patients symptoms increased oxyhemoglobin arterial saturation they proved useful in the early stages of this infection 42 interferons ifns are proteins that bind to cellular surfaces receptors and initiate jak-stat signaling cascades with transcriptional regulation of genes controlled by interferons and effects against some viruses like hepatitis b virus and hcv 43 xiyanping is a tcm preparation with andrographolide as a principal component it has significant antibacterial and antiviral effects 44 darunavir in combination with cobicistat will be used in trial number nct04252274 45 in patients with covid-19 pneumonia the united states food and drug administration fda currently approves such a combination in aids treatment darunavir is another hiv protease inhibitor and cobicistat like ritonavir is a booster for enhancing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of darunavir by cytochrome p450 cyp3a inhibition 4647 recombinant human interferon 2 is described to have inhibitory effects on mers-cov and sars-cov 48 and the purpose of the clinical trials found for this paper is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of recombinant human interferon 2 in treating patients with new coronavirus infection 49 thalidomide will be used in two trials against covid-19 49 50 thalidomide has an anti-inflammatory action due to its ability to speed up the degradation of messenger rna in blood cells and thus reduce tumor necrosis factor- tnf furthermore thalidomide can increase the secretion of interleukins such as il-12 and activate natural killer cells 51 the corticosteroid methylprednisolone will be tested against covid-19 52 long et al 2016 53 reported that corticosteroid therapy methylprednisolone dexamethasone and hydrocortisone is beneficial in treating sars-cov patients it significantly prolongs the survival time of clinical cases nevertheless other authors described the use of corticosteroids in the early stages of sars infection with increasing values of viral load 54 furthermore studies with corticosteroids in the adjuvant therapy of mers-cov infection were unable to prove efficacy because all patients died 55 methylprednisolone has already been used in covid-19 patients in combination with antibiotics oseltamivir and oxygen therapy 56 finally vitamin c ascorbic acid pirfenidone bevacizumab fingolimod and bromhexine hydrochloride are going to be tested on covid-19 57-61 vitamin c has antioxidant activity and may reduce oxidative stress and inflammation 5762 effects that improve vasopressor synthesis enhance immune cell function improve endovascular function and provide epigenetic immunologic modifications clinical trials have demonstrated promising data on mortality improvement in sepsis but more extensive studies are necessary to validate these conclusions 63 pirfenidone has been used in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis diseases due to anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects namely by inhibiting il-1 and il-4 58 trial nct04282902 claimed 58 that anti-inflammatory effects may be helpful in sars-cov-2 infection bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets vascular endothelial growth factor vegf 5963 and it may reduce the levels of vegf caused by hypoxia severe inflammation and upregulation of the infected respiratory tract epithelium all of which might suppress the edema in patients with covid-19 63 fingolimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor regulator fty720 with an effective immunology modulator that is useful in multiple sclerosis 60 according to some pathological findings of pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation the use of immune modulators together with ventilator support should be considered for severe patients to prevent the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards study nct04280588 aims to determine the efficacy of fingolimod for covid-19 60 bromhexine is a transmembrane protease serine inhibitor such a protease is responsible for the activation of s-glycoprotein of sars-cov and mers-cov for viral entry through the plasma membrane 6164 one study 60 will evaluate the efficacy of bromhexine combined with standard treatmentstandard treatment in patients with covid-19 in conclusion the who declared an epidemic of pneumonia caused by the sars-cov-2 in 2020 in this review we found 24 clinical trials that have already started with the repositioning of more than 20 medicines for covid-19 treatment such as human immunoglobulin interferons chloroquine hydroxychloroquine arbidol remdesivir favipiravir oseltamivir thalidomide methylprednisolone bevacizumab and tcm the hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin combination was the first drug repurposed with excellent results in clinical trials against sars-cov-2 but further more extended studies with a higher number of patients are needed to confirm these results besides its limitations repositioning clinical trials are still an attractive strategy they may facilitate the discovery of new classes of medicines they may reduce the costs and time to reach the market there is an existing pharmaceutical supply chain for formulation and distribution and there is the possibility of combinations with other drugs in treatments that are more effective than monotherapy most of the studies found in this article are scheduled to end in 2020 and we hope these repositioning trials may help to find solutions for covid-19 treatment by this year authors hold sole responsibility for the views expressed in the

renal transplantation sreedhar adapa avantika chenna mamtha balla ganesh merugu prasad narayana koduri murty subba daggubati rao vijay gayam srikanth naramala venu konala madhav   a series of pneumonia cases from unexplained etiology in wuhan china since december 2019 has created the public health concern and resulted in the identification of the viral cause the initial reports of this viral infection were traced to the huanan seafood market wuhan china and the etiological agent was identified as coronavirus 1 the world health organization who has named the virus as 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov on january 12 2020 and has declared as public health emergency globally on january 30 2020 2 the disease caused by the virus was named as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 on february 11 2020 3 the international committee on taxonomy of viruses designated the etiological coronavirus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 4 the number of cases has been multiplying at an alarming rate globally resulting in mortality and who has declared covid-19 as pandemic on march 11 2020 5 on may 2 2020 there were 34 million confirmed cases of covid-19 infection cases globally and the number of reported deaths were 244213 6 after sars and middle eastern respiratory syndrome mers covid-19 is the third known zoonotic cov infection and all belong to the beta-cov cluster 1 there was no determination on the animal species carrying the ncov the preliminary studies showed that the ncov is closely related to the coronavirus isolated from bats postulating the theory of possible transmission from bats to humans 1 the genome homology sequence of sars-ncov and sars-cov was 795 and sars-ncov had high homology with bat cov 7 all the studies suggest the evidence strongly that the sars-ncov might have originated from the bats the intermediate host in transmission to humans yet to be ascertained ji et al have found that snakes are the wildlife repositories for the sars-ncov 8 various studies have reported the epidemiological data on sars-ncov most of the studies have shown that elderly patients are affected higher male preponderance and mortality is higher in the elderly with severe comorbid conditions 9 the case fatality rate was estimated at 14-15 depending on the case series described 9 10 the median incubation period is 14 days and the median time from the first symptom to death is less in the elderly 1 mode of transmission is through close contact with people who has an infection through respiratory droplets when the infected person coughs or sneezes another possible mechanism is through infected surfaces and objects after the sars-cov2 spike s protein attaches to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors the s protein is cleaved and activated by transmembrane serine proteases family tmprss which allows the virus to release fusion peptide that aids in the membrane fusion 16 prior studies have shown that positive sars-cov ribonucleic acid rna polymerase gene fragments were detected by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization in kidney specimens of autopsy patients died from sars 17 mers-cov infections also have been shown to cause kidney epithelial cell damage by apoptosis mediated through receptors 18 these studies suggest that the injury from coronavirus is a direct cytotoxic effect on kidney epithelial cells diao et al analyzed the kidney tissue in six patients on autopsy immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid np protein in the kidney tubule possibly related to potential direct tubular injury from the virus 19 the sars-cov-2 rna was detected in the urine of the patients by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction qrt-pcr 20 the normal human lung has type 1 and type 2 alveolar epithelial cells which express ace2 and is expressed in 83 of type 2 cells men have a higher expression rate of ace2 levels compared to women and similarly asians express higher ace2 levels compared to white and african american populations 1 the analysis by xu et al found that ace2 receptor expression in the kidney is no less than the lung on comparative analysis 16 podocytes and proximal convoluted tubule cells significantly co-express ace2 and tmprss genes that are potential targets for sars-cov-2 the kidney tissue expresses the ace2 gene higher than that of lung tissue the binding affinity of sars-cov-2 to ace2 receptors is 10 - 20 times higher than sars-cov as described by wrapp and colleagues 21 the pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were elevated in covid-19 infection and probable activation of t-cell response 9 the possible occurrence of cytokine storm in severe cases is evidenced by the significantly higher cytokine levels in the cytokine storm the immune system damages healthy tissues rather than sars-cov-2 16 on the autopsies of six kidney tissues the light microscopy revealed cluster of differentiation 68 cd68 macrophage infiltration of the tubulointerstitium and severe atn the tubules showed complement 5b-9 deposition in all six cases but deposition in glomeruli and capillaries were seldom seen some cd8 t lymphocyte cells and cd56 natural killer cells were seen in kidney tissue 19 cheng and colleagues analyzed a large cohort of 710 patients for kidney disease with confirmed covid-19 admitted to tongji hospital from january 28 2020 to february 11 2020 22 all the patients were above 18 years of age patients who have a history of renal transplant and on maintenance dialysis were excluded from the study the baseline serum creatinine was elevated in 110 patients on admission the patients in the elevated serum creatinine group were elderly had a higher percentage of males and the days from onset of illness to hospital admission were shorter these patients also had severe disease and co-morbidities compared to those with normal baseline serum creatinine these patients had more pronounced aki and higher rates of mechanical ventilation and the hospital mortality rate was higher patients with elevated serum creatinine also had leukocytosis lymphopenia thrombocytopenia prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and higher d-dimer levels the patients with elevated baseline serum creatinine had a higher percentage of increased procalcitonin aspartate aminotransferase and lactic dehydrogenase levels most of the aki occurred within 7 days but was much quicker and severe in elevated baseline serum creatinine group patients with normal baseline creatinine had later onset of aki and recovered quickly there was elevated blood urea nitrogen bun creatinine high-grade proteinuria and hematuria in elevated baseline serum creatinine patients along with significantly lower estimated glomerular filtration rate egfr there was a significant gap between peak and baseline creatinine in the elevated serum creatinine group patients with elevated serum creatinine from baseline had worse outcomes compared to patients with normal baseline serum creatinine the study by li et al 14 analyzed 59 cases of inpatients from multiple hospitals around wuhan from january 21 2020 to february 7 2020 with covid-19 disease and 28 patients were diagnosed with severe cases according to the chinese nation health guidance three of the patients died in the severe cases 14 proteinuria was present in 63 of the patients and many of them had detected protein on the first day of admission suggesting the presence of prior renal impairment bun was elevated in 27 of the patients and an also higher level of bun was present in two patients who died serum creatinine was elevated in 19 of the patients and the patients who died had extremely high levels the density was reduced on the computed tomography ct images of the kidney suggestive of edema and inflammation in a study by wang et al 26 the patients needing icu admission had higher bun and creatinine levels at hospital admission compared to non-icu admission patients and overall patients in general the bun and creatinine levels continued to get worse in non-survivors until the death 26 we summarized the finding from multiple studies including patient characteristics co-morbidities incidence of aki in general as well as icuseverely ill patients number of patients requiring continuous renal replacement therapy crrt extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo and mortality in table 2 9-11 13 19 22-24 26-32 all the health care personnel should follow the centers for disease control and prevention cdc-recommended personal protective equipment ppe and safety guidelines during their interactions with the patients all the health care personnel should work as a team to limit the exposure to the infection indications for rrt are similar to other patients with aki and providers with significant expertise should place dialysis catheters the patients should be cohorted in dedicated icus if possible the preferred dialysis modality is crrt or slow low-efficiency dialysis sled if available intermittent hemodialysis ihd can also be performed if crrt and sled are not available crrt is preferred over ihd in the setting of isolation as ihd needs one-on-one nursing support the patients needing crrt exceeds the machines available prolonged intermittent treatments eg 10 h instead of continuous with higher flow rates eg 40 - 50 mlkgh and after terminal cleaning can be used for another patient the patients should be cohorted on the dedicated floor if possible patients with active or suspected covid-19 needing dialysis treatment should not be transported to a central acute dialysis unit ihd should be provided with one-on-one nursing care if the patient is in negative pressure room if all the covid-19 patients are isolated on one floor one dialysis nurse may be able to monitor two or three patients during ihd if video electronic monitoring is available the nurse enters the room if the patient needs anything or to troubleshoot the machine the peritoneal dialysis can be continued as automated peritoneal dialysis apd to limit the exposure of medical staff the dialysis equipment should be cleaned with the disinfectant before removing it from the room hospital infection control and policy directs the proper disposable of rrt machine equipment as per the hospital protocol crrt filters need to be changed every 72 h or longer continuous venovenous hemofiltration also known as cvvh or continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration cvvhdf are the preferred techniques in the usa continuous venovenous hemodialysis cvvhd is the most common modality used volume overloaded patients can be treated using slow continuous ultra-filtration scuf to keep fluid balance net negative 35 temporary dialysis catheters are recommended for the vascular access and the providers with significant expertise should place dialysis catheters it is recommended to use double-layered protection for the personnel performing the procedure filters with high ultrafiltration coefficient and high molecular weight cut-off membrane with 8 - 10 nm membrane pore size are suggested 36 this would help in clearing high molecular weight inflammatory mediators however albumin would need to be replaced as it can be removed concurrently it is essential to assess the patients bleeding risk before choosing anti-coagulation patients with severe covid-19 infection having high bleeding risk it is recommended to avoid anticoagulation in normal or hypercoagulable states one can use heparin or citrate-based anticoagulation depending on hospital protocols when using crrt in combination with ecmo anticoagulation is not needed as ecmo utilizes systemic heparinization 35 it is essential to pay a very close attention to hemodynamics and volume status of patients with covid-19 infection by using arterial and central venous pressure cvp monitors patients should have frequent renal panels checks every 4 - 6 h and monitor strict input and output to maintain a net negative fluid balance in ards patients in patients without ards the volume status should be assessed to maintain in euvolemic state the patients should be monitored for recovery of kidney function on daily basis and the rrt should be discontinued once the patient is non-oliguric euvolemic and improved ventilation requirements this should also be supported by improved laboratory findings without alarming electrolyte or acid-base imbalance aki was associated with increased in-hospital mortality so the patient should be meticulously managed by providing hemodynamic support avoiding non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs nsaids nephrotoxins and contrast early institution of crrt will improve the outcomes proteinuria and hematuria were also associated with in-hospital mortality so close attention should be paid to urine analysis both in-patient and out-patient settings the experience from various published studies on patients infected with covid-19 infection showed that aki is associated with mortality shi et al analyzed 101 patients who died from covid-19 infection showed that 23 had aki and 11 of patient had underlying ckd bun and myoglogin levels were higher in patients who died within 3 days and median time from hospitalization to death is 4 days 37 cheng in his analysis showed that elevated baseline serum creatinine elevated bun peak serum creatinine  15 proteinuria hematuria aki stages 2 and 3 are all associated with mortality after adjusting for confounding factors 22 the impact of covid-19 infection on ckd has not been reported the incidence of known ckd patients varied from 07-476 depending upon the series described 27 29 there was increased mortality in patients described in one study 29 the incidence of aki was higher in patients with established ckd 22 the studies analyzed the kidney function in patients admitted with confirmed covid-19 infection revealed the incidence of proteinuria and hematuria 14 22 a significant number of patients had proteinuria on the day of admission which could be related to the cytotropic effects of the virus on the podocytes proteinuria may result from direct podocyte injury from an expression of ace2 16 the patients who recovered from the covid-19 infection with proteinuria and hematuria need to be followed closely for the resolution the patients who have sustained aki during the infection need to be monitored for ckd the ongoing outbreak of covid-19 has amassed great concern worldwide but its influence on transplant recipients is unknown previously experienced coronavirus outbreaks have taught us that transplant recipients can be easily affected by these infections 38 39 with this being said very little is known about the risk of the donor to receive transmission of the disease several factors concerning donor exposure like infectivity incubation period etc can play an important role although there are no strict guidelines about donor restrictions it would be advisable for potential donors to hold off on organ donation if suffering from a respiratory illness the american red cross and european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc recommend 28-day and 21-day period delay respectively for potential organ donors with a history of recent travel to high-risk areas or contact with a person with suspected or proven coivd-19 40 41 the ecdc recommends a 28-day delay after recovery from a confirmed infection michaels and colleagues recently well described possible risks associated with transplants in covid-19-positive recipients 42 andrea et al from italy described in their experience that in their institution they have been limiting liver transplantation to the most urgent cases for the residents in the epidemic area 43 a more liberal allocation policy is used for patients outside epidemic areas however all recipients are screened to avoid transplantation in sars-cov-2-positive subjects the internal board consistently reviews and updates the transplant list every 2 weeks according to the new insights on covid-19 they continuously train their healthcare providers and screen them with nasopharyngeal swabs at frequent intervals providing timely information to patients and their caregivers to raise awareness and at the same time to avoid panic and confusion is important 43 as per the review of the literature to the best of our knowledge only one case of covid-19 infection has been described in kidney transplant recipients of 12 years 44 the patient was successfully managed initially with the cessation of all immunosuppression he was given intravenous stress dose steroids to prevent adrenal insufficiency once the patient improved clinically immunosuppression was resumed gradually the overall clinical characteristics including the symptoms radiological findings on lung imaging and laboratory findings were similar to those of other non-transplanted adult patients with covid-19 pneumonia this being the only case reported so far it is difficult to say that it is not possible to see atypical findings or more severe presentations of covid-19 disease in transplant recipients healthcare providers should be aware of that the experimental drugs like remdesivir and lopinavirritonavir could cause drug-drug interactions with calcineurin inhibitors 42 it is therefore recommended to use these drugs with extreme caution regarding the treatment of kidney transplant recipients with covid-19 infection there is not much information available to help guide therapy and immunosuppression regimens for now it would be recommended to use due diligence and tailor management and treatment options based on the patients clinical status duration of transplant and severity of illness as the pandemic progresses we now expect that we will have more information available for guidance no vaccine has been developed against the sars-cov-2 virus to date the critical aspect of management is supportive care multiple treatments such as empiric antibiotics antiviral therapy and systemic corticosteroids have been used worldwide several investigative drugs have been studied drugs approved for other indications have been used and several clinical trials are underway all across the globe one of the most promising of these therapies is remdesivir it inhibits viral replication by premature termination of rna transcription and has shown activity against beta coronaviruses and in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 45 it has received emergency use authorization by the food and drug administration fda in the usa for use in patients hospitalized with covid-19 it is recommended for 5 days in patients who are not on mechanical ventilation or ecmo and recommended for 10 days in patients who are on mechanical ventilation or ecmo 46 it is not recommended in patients with lower gfr gfr  30 mlmin 47 others drug that has gained more attention was chloroquine hydroxychloroquine either alone or in combination with azithromycin chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine both have in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 45 they are both used in several countries for treating covid-19 infection based on anecdotal data and in-vitro studies there was a news report from china where chloroquine increased viral clearance decreased disease progression and improved radiological findings 47 48 there was another clinical trial reported from france which is a non-randomized open-label trial of 36 patients compared to hydroxychloroquine or a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin versus standard of care in the control group the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in six patients resulted in superior viral clearance compared with hydroxychloroquine monotherapy 49 there was a recent study among 368 veterans which found no benefit of hydroxychloroquine but associated with more risks due to its side effect profile 50 these medications should be used with caution in patients with renal and hepatic impairment and they can cause qt prolongation in the electrocardiogram hydroxychloroquine use for pre and post-exposure prophylaxis and treatment for sars-cov-2 infection is currently under investigation several clinical trials are planned in the usa to test the usage of hydroxychloroquine for treatment and prophylaxis for covid-19 clinicians are using different doses of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis and treatment a recent clinical trial in china did not show the efficacy of lopinavir-ritonavir for the treatment of pneumonia for covid-19 patients but this trial was underpowered 30 who launched a global mega trial called solidarity of four most promising coronavirus treatments remdesivir chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine ritonavirlopinavir ritonavirlopinavir and interferon beta 51 when antiretroviral medications for coronavirus treatment are used like lopinavir and ritonavir dose adjustments to medications during crrt are not needed as they are 90 protein bound particular attention should be paid to the dosing of the drugs other drugs are interferon beta interferon alpha mefloquine favipiravir darunavir ribavirin umifenovir tocilizumab and type ii transmembrane serine protease tmspss2 inhibitors support to therapies using vitamin a b c d e thymosin alpha 1 thymopentin selenium zinc and pyrithione combination have been used for treatment against sars-cov-2 infection 47 52 covid-19 infection is spreading rapidly and causing mortality daily worldwide unfortunately knowledge about the novel virus is limited and it causes a significant clinical threat to the general population and healthcare workers several countries have imposed strict regulations on the public to limit the spread of the virus many government agencies like cdc fda and hospitals public health systems are working every day in the usa to contain the spread of infection studies have shown that there is the involvement of kidneys with covid-19 infection and can be associated with high mortality health care providers should recognize this aspect early and appropriate management should be instituted as soon as possible the patients with underlying kidney problems and renal transplant patients are vulnerable to developing covid-19 infection there is limited understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease virulence of the virus at this moment so prevention is the critical aspect in the management several vaccines and promising treatments are undergoing clinical trials with the hope of finding a cure for this global crisis soon  a comprehensive review on drug repositioning against coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 maryam rameshrad majid ghafoori amir mohammadpour hooshang mohammad nayeri javad hossein hosseinzadeh   coronaviruses are a large family of positive single-stranded rna viruses ssrna perlman and netland 2009 and classified into four major genera including alpha- and beta-coronaviruses that infect humans and gamma- and delta-coronaviruses that generally infect birds they are the main reason for respiratory infections and diseases ranging from the common cold to more severe ones middle east respiratory syndrome mers and severe acute respiratory syndrome sarsassociated coronavirus belong to the beta-coronavirus genus they are responsible for the recent epidemic worldwide in the recent 20 years a novel coronavirus cov named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-ncov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or sars-cov2 has caused the recent pneumonia outbreak named coronavirus disease 2019 or covid-19 since early december 2019 in wuhan city hubei province china wu et al 2020 which is now pandemic worldwide the pathophysiology and virulence mechanisms of coronaviruses are related to the function of structural and non-structural proteins proteases are one of the most important non-structural proteins within the viral replication cycle they are utilized to produce both functional and structural proteins papain-like cysteine protease plp2pro and chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease 3clpro25-30 also called mpro are the main proteases in sars-cov mukherjee et al 2011 interestingly papain-like cysteine protease can damper the antiviral response of host cells lindner et al 2005 niemeyer et al 2018 helicase and rna-dependent rna polymerase are the other crucial non-structural proteins that are encoded by coronaviruses genome zumla et al 2016 the high similarity between the main proteins of sars-cov and covid-19 zhou et al 2020 795 sequence similarity he et al 2020 suggests drug designed against these proteins in sars-cov mukherjee et al 2011 could be effective against covid-19 too the main structural proteins in coronaviruses include spike s glycoprotein membrane envelope and nucleocapsid proteins perlman and netland 2009 spike glycoproteins on the viral surface are composed of two subunits s1 and s2 the s1 subunit discovers the virus-host range and cellular tropism by the receptor-binding domain rbd and the s2 subunit mediates virus-host cell membrane fusion guo et al 2020 he et al 2020 su and wu 2020 similar to sars-cov covid-19 utilizes host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor to enter the cells with a 10- to 20-fold higher affinity than sars-cov he et al 2020 su and wu 2020 the clinical presentation of covid-19 varies from asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic forms to more severe conditions that need respiratory support sepsis septic shock and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome the most common sign and symptoms of this disease are fever 98 dry cough 76 myalgia or fatigue 44 and dyspnea 55 and the less common symptoms are sputum production 28 headache 8 hemoptysis 5 and diarrhea 3 and chest computerized tomography scans show pneumonia bassetti et al 2020 huang and herrmann 2020 laboratory markers include leukopenia 25 lymphopenia 63 thrombocytopenia 5 and high lactate dehydrogenase 73 bassetti et al 2020 the clinical features of the covid-19 are divided by their severity to the following forms wu and mcgoogan 2020a mild disease that occurred in 81 of cases with no or mild pneumoniasevere disease that occurs in 14 of cases and manifests in dyspnea respiratory frequency  30min blood oxygen saturation  93 the partial pressure of oxygenfraction of inspired oxygen ratio the ratio between the blood pressure of the oxygen and the percentage of oxygen supplied  300 lung infiltrates  50 within 24 to 48 hcritical disease that occurs in 5 of cases with respiratory failure septic shock multiple organ dysfunction or failure according to the world health organization who the centers for disease control and prevention and the us food and drug administration fda the management of covid-19 has mainly focused on infection prevention case detection and monitoring and supportive care however no specific anti-covid-19 treatments are recommended because of the absence of evidence beware of fraudulent coronavirus tests vaccines and treatments 2020 coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 2020 information for clinicians on therapeutic options for covid-19 patients 2020 given the urgency of the 2019-ncov outbreak researchers pay particular attention to the repositioning of existing antiviral agents that are approved or in development against infections caused by human immunodeficiency viruses hiv hepatitis b virus hbv hepatitis c virus hcv and influenza li and de clercq 2020 besides since most coronaviruses especially mers sars and covid-19 have a similar viral structure a similar infection pathway and a similar structure of the s proteins similar research strategies should be used for the covid-19 yu et al 2020 the general treatment strategies include bed rest and supportive treatment ensuring sufficient calorie and water intake maintaining water-electrolyte balance and homeostasis monitoring vital signs and respiratory support circulation support oxygen therapy when necessary measuring blood routine urine routine c-reactive protein and other blood biochemical indexes including liver and kidney function myocardial enzyme spectrum and coagulation function according to patients conditions blood gas analysis and timely re-examination of chest imaging should be performed when necessary shen et al 2020 nearly all patients accept oxygen therapy and the who recommends extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to patients with refractory hypoxemia guo et al 2020 nitric oxide inhalation chen et al 2004 and epoprostenol inhalation a prostacyclin with vasodilator properties alessandri et al 2018 searcy et al 2015 are the other recommended options to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome in vitro study revealed that nitric oxide can inhibit the replication of sars-cov kerstrm et al 2005 at the time of writing this article no drug is fda approved to treat covid-19 some old drugs are suggested to manage covid-19 and are being used anecdotally based on in vitro or in vivo studies however there are poor clinical data in supporting them these include remdesivir chloroquinehydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin tocilizumab and lopinavirritonavir coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 epidemiology virology clinical features diagnosis and prevention 2020 in march 2020 the who started a global mega trial of the four most promising coronavirus treatments in 10 countries called solidarity in response to the covid-19 pandemic remdesivir chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine lopinavirritonavir and lopinavirritonavir in combination with interferon beta are the experimental therapy currently being researched under this solidarity trial who launches global megatrial of the four most promising coronavirus treatments 2020 a group of korean specialist physicians in treating covid-19 recommended the following antiviral medication for treating older patients or patients with underlying comorbid and severe conditions the recommended regime is lopinavir 400 mg ritonavir 100 mg kaletra 2 tablets by mouth twice daily or chloroquine 500 mg by mouth daily or hydroxychloroquine 400 mg by mouth daily for 7 to 10 days depending on the clinical progress co-administration of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with lopinavirritonavir may cause serious arrhythmias and drug interaction according to their advice combined therapy is just recommended in very limited cases physicians work out treatment guidelines for coronavirus 2020 a group of iranian physicians and experts with experience in treating covid-19 have developed recommendations for the treatment of hospitalized patients with covid-19 based on the 6th edition of this recommendation the proposed antiviral monotherapy is chloroquine 500 mg q12h at the first day followed by 250 mg q12h orally or hydroxychloroquine 400 mg q12h at the first day followed by 200 mg q12h orally for 7 to 14 days based on the clinical progress in combination therapy lopinavirritonavir 400100 mg q12h orally is administrated with chloroquine 500 mg sd orally or hydroxychloroquine 400 mg sd orally for the first day that is followed just with lopinavirritonavir 400100 mg q12h orally for 714 days in combination therapy with atazanavirritonavir atazanavirritonavir 300100 mg sd orally plus chloroquine 250 mg q12h orally or hydroxychloroquine 200 mg q12h orally are administrated from the first day for 714 days it has been suggested that atazanavirritonavir has lower side effects drug interaction with chloroquine hydroxychloroquine arrhythmia gastrointestinal intolerance than lopinavirritonavir flowchart diagnosis and treatment of covid 19 disease at outpatient and inpatient levels 2020 there are two main ways in drug discovery including traditional drug development and drug repositioning the first way that usually takes 1015 years needs high investments and is very expensive and the success rate is very low the second one uses old drugs for investigating and approving new therapeutic in contrast with the first way it is more efficient economical and riskless xue et al 2018 these days there is an emergency to investigate appropriate drugs in covid-19 and it seems drug repositioning be so helpful in this review we are mainly trying to gather findings of the old drugscovid19 relationship to introduce a lead for suitable therapy however covid-19 therapy must be based on expert clinical experience and published literature and guidelines from major health organizations in this regard the recommended dosages for proposed drugs that are currently being trialed covid-19 based on the latest version of the who 21st march 2020 are included in table 1 coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 2020 there are other interventions with limited or no clinical data that are introduced in this article the relevant data that have been published since the start of 2020 were included by searching google scholar pubmed and valid encyclopedias furthermore bibliographies of eligible articles were examined for additional relevant studies the keywords used as search terms were novel coronavirus covid-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 therapy treatment virology clinical future and pathology there was no restriction on the type of studies all kinds of peer-reviewed or non-peer-reviewed research projects reviews letters comments editorials and ebooks that have been published or being be published in proof and press situation were included non-english language studies were studied using google translate software there are strong studies that proved the efficacy of chloroquine against intracellular microorganism as well as malaria coxiella burnetii and tropheryma whipplei colson et al 2020 chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is used against autoimmune diseases wang et al 2020b and has a worth effect against coronaviruses colson et al 2020 wang et al 2020b chloroquine prescription improves pneumonia and lung imaging findings in infected patients with covid-19 it shorts the disease course promotes a virus-negative stage and decreases the length of hospital stay gao et al 2020 it has a good distribution into the lungs wang et al 2020b this drug alkalizes endosomal ph and interferes with virus-endosome fusion that affects the virus entry or exit vincent et al 2005 it has been shown the sars-cov spike glycoprotein mediates viral entry through ph-dependent endocytosis yang et al 2004 chloroquine inhibits the glycosylation of ace2 receptor expression at the cell surface vincent et al 2005 it possesses immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory impacts through many pathways including the inhibition of phospholipase a2 activity and blocking cytokine production and release al-bari 2015 that may be worth full in a covid-19 cytokine storm it has been mentioned that the activity of hydroxychloroquine on covid-19 is probably the same as that of chloroquine colson et al 2020 although hydroxychloroquine seems to have more potent antiviral activity yao et al 2020 since chloroquine inhibits the attachment and fusion of the virus to host cells it could be a good prophylactic candidate against viral diseases some studies have shown prophylactic effects of chloroquine against saras-cov in both pre- and post-exposure a pre-exposure prophylaxis of 250500 mg daily and post-exposure prophylaxis at 8 mgkgday for 3 days has been recommended for prophylaxis against covid-19 however there is no certain evidence that proves the efficacy of chloroquine in prophylaxis against covid-19 chang 2020 and it has been postulated that prophylactic use of chloroquine may impair innate immune system response against this infection soraya 2020 qt interval at the baseline is the most important item in evaluation chloroquine toxicity in covid-19 cardiovascular and dermatological problems the exacerbation of porphyria severe hypoglycemia abdominal cramps anorexia diarrhea nausea and vomiting and endocrine metabolic and gastrointestinal problems are chloroquine related side effects chloroquine may cause hematological and immunological abnormalities it may raise liver enzymes and induce hypersensitivity reactions nervous system problems and neuromuscular skeletal ophthalmic and otic difficulties are the other reported side effects furthermore this medicine should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing auditory damage g6pd deficiency hepatic impairment porphyria psoriasis and seizure disorder since chloroquine is the substrate of cyp2d6 major and cyp3a4 major the risk of potentially harmful drug interactions must be considered in combination therapies chloroquine drug information 2020 niclosamide an old anti-helminthic drug has been reported to impose broad-spectrum antiviral properties such as sars-cov mers-cov zika virus japanese encephalitis virus hcv ebola virus human rhinoviruses chikungunya virus human adenovirus and epsteinbarr virus xu et al 2020 wu et al 2004 reported that niclosamide was able to inhibit sars-cov replication and eliminate viral antigen synthesis wu et al 2004 this drug stimulates autophagy in mers-cov and reduces viral replication gassen et al 2019 nitazoxanide is the other antiparasitic drug that has been fda-approved for treating cryptosporidium and giardia some studies have mentioned its broad-spectrum antiviral activity rossignol 2014 this drug has been suggested as an effective therapy against coronaviruses cao et al 2015 also it has been a candidate as a new drug for the treatment of mers rossignol 2016 in cells that are infected by foreign rna nitazoxanide amplifies host innate immune antiviral responses by triggering foreign cytoplasmic rna sensing and the type 1 interferon axis jasenosky et al 2019 in this respect nitazoxanide may have potential against covid-19 adnan shereen et al 2020 headache abdominal pain nausea and urine discoloration are reported in more than 2 of patients who receive nitazoxanide nitazoxanide drug information 2020 based on the previous studies it has been revealed that lopinavirritonavir alone or in combination with antivirals reduces the incidence and mortality of acute respiratory distress syndrome related to sars and mers diseases chu et al 2004 lopinavirritonavir inhibits hiv protease for protein cleavage and causes non-infectious and immature viral particles guo et al 2020 this therapy is also has been recommended in the management of covid-19 pneumonia but appears to have little to no effect cao et al 2020a the effectiveness of hiv protease inhibitors against covid-19 protease enzymes is uncertain based on two reasons the hiv proteases belong to the aspartic protease family while coronavirus proteases belong to the cysteine protease family c2-symmetric pocket the catalytic site of the hiv protease dimer that is inhibited by anti-proteases is absent in coronaviruses proteases li and de clercq 2020 skin rash dyslipidemia diarrhea vomiting nausea abdominal pain rise of liver enzymes and upper respiratory infections have been reported in more than 10 of patients who receive lopinavirritonavir medication also it may alter cardiovascular conduction lopinavir undergoes extensive metabolism via hepatic cyp3a isozymes so co-administration with cyp3a inducers decreases its level furthermore ritonavir is a potent cyp3a inhibitor and co-administration with drugs that are metabolized with this enzyme elevates their plasma concentration lopinavir and ritonavir drug information 2020 rna-dependent rna polymerase is an important enzyme in the life cycle of rna viruses including coronaviruses hcv and zika virus this enzyme is the target of some antiviral drugs sofosbuvir and ribavirin are nucleotide derivatives they inhibit rna-dependent rna polymerase and are used for hcv therapy idx-184 is another rna-dependent rna polymerase that is under clinical trials for hcv therapy an in silico study proved the efficacy of remdesivir against covid-19 rna-dependent rna polymerase elfiky 2020 remdesivir is a novel antiviral prodrug that has been developed against the ebola virus not only for treatment but also for prophylaxis post-exposure it showed a broad-spectrum antiviral activity in vitro against filoviruses arenaviruses and coronaviruses remdesivir has not been approved or licensed at the time of writing this article warren et al 2016 remdesivir is metabolized into an adenosine nucleotide analog that interferes with the action of virus rna polymerase post entry it seems to have good inhibitory effects against covid-19 at the cellular level guo et al 2020 in a case report remdesivir was started intravenously on day 7 in a patient with covid-19 with no side effects holshue et al 2020 nausea vomiting prolonged prothrombin time and raise of the liver enzymes have been reported with remdesivir consumption remdesivir united states investigational agent refer to prescribing and access restrictions drug information 2020 favipiravir is a prodrug and metabolized to a nucleoside analog and inhibits the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase furuta et al 2017 of rna viruses such as influenza ebola yellow fever chikungunya norovirus enterovirus and covid-19 it is an approved drug against influenza in japan de clercq 2019 in february 2020 this drug was being studied in chinese randomized trials for experimental treatment of the covid-19 li and de clercq 2020 indinavir atazanavir darunavir fosamprenavir saquinavir abacavir elvitegravir raltegravir enzaplatovir presatovir maribavir tipranavir darunavir jin et al 2020 are the other proposed antiviral drugs in threating covid-19 table 2 medication therapy against influenza including neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir peramivir zanamivir and drugs like ganciclovir acyclovir and ribavirin as well as methylprednisolone that were prescribed previously for treating covid-19 are not valid now guo et al 2020 although the use of antibiotics especially broad-spectrum types should be avoided in patients with covid-19 in these patients with a bacterial infection the use of antibacterial agents is recommended jin et al 2020 proposed antimicrobial agents against community-acquired pneumonia are amoxicillin azithromycin or fluoroquinolones in severe patients all possible pathogens should be covered by empirical antibacterial treatment until the pathogenic bacteria are clarified 43 moxifloxacin is the best recommendation for covering mycoplasma and chlamydia zhang et al 2020b azithromycin a macrolide is the best-proposed antimicrobial that has been added to the hydroxychloroquine regimen covid-19 and induced a synergic effect on virus elimination this combination therapy azithromycin 500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg per day the next 4 days and hydroxychloroquine sulfate 200 mg three times per day during 10 days reduced the number of viral carriages and viral carrying duration gautret et al 2020 azithromycin is an antibiotic from the macrolide group that has anti-inflammatory effects amsden 2005 beigelman et al 2009 iveti tkalevi et al 2006 furthermore it has antiviral iannetta et al 2017 menzel et al 2016 schoegler et al 2014 schgler et al 2014 properties this may be a reason why adding this drug to hydroxychloroquine improved the clearance of covid-19 in this regard there is a need to test azithromycin as first-line therapy for covid-19 it should be considered that both chloroquinehydroxychloroquine silva et al 2007 and azithromycin hancox et al 2013 are known to prolong qtc-interval so this combination therapy may increase the risk of cardiac side effects similar to the sars-cov covid-19 attaches to the host cell ace2 receptors through its receptor-binding motif located in the rbd of the s1 subunit of spike glycoprotein human cells expressing ace2 are more susceptible to be infected with covid-19 guo et al 2020 shanmugaraj et al 2020 so specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against host cell ace2 receptors or virus receptor-binding domain in spike protein interfere with virus attachment and entry some monoclonal antibodies against sars-cov have been proposed that due to similarity with covid-19 could be useful against this virus too some of them neutralize s1 fragment and block the interaction of s1 subunit protein with cellular receptor ace2 including 80r cr3014 cr3022 f26g18 f26g19 m396 and 201 1a9 monoclonal antibody binds to the s2 fragment of sars-cov and blocks the interaction of the s2 subunit protein with the cellular receptor s230 binds to rbd and blocks the interaction of s1 subunit protein with cellular ace2 receptor 4d4 and 68 are the other proposed neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against sars-cov shanmugaraj et al 2020 while cr3022 neutralizing antibody binds potently to both sara-cov and covid-19 spike protein some of these neutralizing antibodies including m396 and cr3014 that showed potent inhibitory against sara-cov spike protein does not bind to covid-19 spike protein probably due to differences in the rbd of these tow viruses cr3022 has a worth of potential therapy against covid-19 tian et al 2020 it has been reported that there is a direct interaction between cd147 and spike protein of sars-cov2 and it mediates a role in virus infection wang et al 2020a the inhibition of this receptor by meplazumab a monoclonal antibody against cd147 has shown a promising inhibitory effect against sar-cov2 both in vitro wang et al 2020a and in the clinic bian et al 2020 cd147 that is presented in on epithelial cells and activated inflammatory cells induces cytokine secretion and leukocyte chemotaxis by binding with cyclophilin a cyclophilin a participates in t cell chemotaxis and local inflammation dawar et al 2017a b convalescent plasma and intravenous immunoglobulin ivig are the other proposed strategies to improve the survival rate of patients with sars and maybe covid-19 a clinical study in shanghai has shown the positive effects of convalescent plasma strategy against covid-19 derebail and falk 2020 this therapy shorted the hospital stay and decreased mortality and viral load that should be related to neutralizing antibodies from convalescent plasma that suppresses viremia the other possible explanation for the efficacy of convalescent therapy is the acceleration of infected cell clearance chen et al 2020 there is a new about the decision of the fda in approving the use of convalescent plasma to treat critically ill patients with covid-19 tanne 2020 the administration of ivig with low molecular weight heparin anticoagulant therapy at the early stages of covid-19 can interrupt cytokine storm and enhance the immunity lin et al 2020 a series of case studies have revealed that administration of high-dose ivig 0305 gkg daily for 5 days at the early stage of covid-19 could block the progression of the disease lymphocytopenia and elevated inflammation markers although these three patients were not on the same antiviral medication the outcome of ivig therapy in improving passive immunity and modulating immune inflammation in covid-19 is worth full cao et al 2020b zhang et al 2020b the efficacy of immunoglobulin therapy has been revealed in sars ho et al 2004 and influenza liu et al 2016 diseases but there are not enough clinical trials on covid-19 hypotension and hypertension tachycardia and decreased heart rate headache fatigue chills pain rigors dizziness injection site pruritus sore throat and gastrointestinal problems hematological abnormalities the rise of liver enzymes and neuromuscular and skeletal problems are the common side effects in more than 10 patients who received ivig immune globulin intravenous subcutaneous and intramuscular drug information 2020 interferons ifns are immunomodulatory cytokines that are classified into types i ii and iii based on their receptors on the cell membrane surface type i of these glycoproteins ifn alpha and beta have been fda approved for some viral infections lin and young 2014 ifn  has been recommended to be effective against covid-19 ifn  showed a valuable efficacy against sars-cov replication in tissue culture hart et al 2014 and nonhuman primate model chan et al 2015 it has been shown that ribavirin in the combination of ifn -2a significantly improved survival at 14 days in patients infected with sars-cov omrani et al 2014 a published article advised the administration of ifn  atomization inhalation 5 million u per time for adults in sterile injection water twice a day jin et al 2020 it should be noticed that the use of nebulized drugs may distribute the virus into the air and disturb the infection control simonds et al 2010 as mentioned in previous sections ace2 is a cell surface protein expressed on the lung at2 alveolar epithelial cells and has a main role in 2019-ncov endocytosis and entry to the cells ap2-associated protein kinase 1 is one of the main promoters of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and its inhibition may disrupt the penetration of the virus into the cells and assembly of its particles the janus kinase jak is the other regulator of the passage of the virus into the lung cells it has been proposed that baricitinib 2 or 4 mg once a day by inhibition of these kinases may be useful in covid-19 acute respiratory disease this drug in one way blocks the virus entry and in the other way inhibits cytokine release and inflammation by inhibiting jak12 jak-stat signaling richardson et al 2020 tofacitinib baricitinib fedratinib and ruxolitinib all are jak-stat signaling inhibitors and have anti-inflammatory effects however baricitinib is better than fedratinib and ruxolitinib due to its high affinity for ap2-associated protein kinase 1 once-daily dosing and acceptable side effects it has low protein-binding properties and has no interaction with cyp drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters that cause good potential for combining therapy with baricitinib covid-19 richardson et al 2020 upper respiratory tract infection  10 nausea the rise of liver enzymes dyslipidemia anemia thrombosis lymphocytopenia and an increase in creatine phosphate and serum creatinine are the reported side effects with baricitinib it should not be used in combination with strong immunosuppressants including azathioprine or cyclosporine other jak inhibitors and biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs baricitinib drug information 2020 in the most moribund patients 2019-ncov infection is also associated with a cytokine storm which is characterized by an increase in the plasma concentrations of interleukins 2 7 and 10 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor interferon--inducible protein 10 monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha and tumor necrosis factor  in those who survive intensive care these aberrant and excessive immune responses lead to long-term lung damage and fibrosis cause functional disability and reduce the quality of life zumla et al 2020 previous studies proved the proinflammatory role of poly-adp-ribose polymerase 1 parp1 in inducing inflammatory disorders especially lung injuries acute respiratory distress syndrome and asthma jagtap and szabo 2005 parp1 activation enhances inflammation by activation of proinflammatory cytokines inducible nitric oxide synthase intracellular adhesion molecule 1 cyclooxygenase 2 and nadph oxidase as well as major histocompatibility complex class ii it promotes cytokine storm by activation of nf-kb-mediated proinflammatory signals and activation of ap-1 il-1 il-6 tnf- and downstream cytokines and chemokines pathways parp1 activation results in cellular energy failure necrosis and cell death zingarelli et al 2004 parp1 inhibitors suppress viral replication and inhibit the adp-ribosylation of viral core proteins suppress the binding of nucleocapsid protein to viral rna and interfere with the structure packaging of the viral genome liu et al 2015 furthermore parp1 inhibitors reduce energy failure and suppress nadatp depletion larmonier et al 2016 according to the aforementioned data parp1 inhibitors including cvl218 that binds to the n-terminal domain of nucleocapsid protein of covid-19 might be a worthy candidate for treating infected people with this virus ge et al 2020 some drugs mitigate the effects of cytokines released in response to the covid-19 and limit lung damage in patients with severe disease these include siltuximab a monoclonal antibody against il-6 that is approved for multicentric castlemans disease gritti et al 2020 and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs such as tocilizumab a monoclonal antibody targeting il-6 zhang et al 2020a sarilumab a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody specific for the il-6 singh et al 2020 and anakinra a recombinant human interleukin-1 il-1 receptor antagonist mehta et al 2020 edema pruritus skin rash weight gain hyperuricemia and upper respiratory tract infection are the most common complications in more than 10 of patients who receive siltuximab hypotension headache dyslipidemia dermatological reactions constipation thrombocytopenia hypersensitivity reactions and renal insufficiency are the other reported side effects siltuximab drug information 2020 more common side effects  10 in patients treated with tocilizumab are dyslipidemia the rise of liver enzymes and injection site reaction cardiovascular

drugs for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome is controversial and needs caution especially in systemic route it has been shown that the administration of corticosteroids to sars-infected patients decreased the degree of disease progression and dyspnea and alleviated clinical symptoms however this strategy had no effect on the length of hospital stay meng et al 2003 corticosteroid therapy should not be used for the management of covid-19-induced lung injury or shock outside of a clinical trial although corticosteroid treatment could have a role in suppressing lung inflammation it was associated with an interruption in the clearance of viral rna from respiratory tract secretions and had no positive impact on the decrease of mortality rate in critically ill patients russell et al 2020 corticosteroid therapy is accompanied by neutrophilic leukocytosis eosinopenia and a decrease in peripheral blood lymphocytic count especially in t cells coutinho and chapman 2011 according to the published articles in the 1990s the administration of corticosteroids induces a transient lymphocytopenia that peaks after 46 h and returns to the normal level after 2448 h this duration depends on the potency and dose of the administrated corticosteroids fauci and dale 1974 webel et al 1974 yu et al 1974 recently it has been proven that corticosteroid therapy induces immunosuppression predominantly by suppression of cell-mediated immunity and a minimal inhibitory effect on humoral immunity in t cell subsets cd4 is more susceptible than cd8 baris et al 2016 the viral diseases may get wild in the immunocompromised state rouse and sehrawat 2010 and the body cannot fight against covid-19 there are concerns in patients who had been treated with ace inhibitors eg captopril or angiotensin receptor blockers eg losartan it has been shown in patients who received these medications the expression of the ace2 receptor was high so the risk of infection of this virus increased fang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 however there are not enough data for approving this concern and the american heart association american college of cardiology and the other associations recommend continuing treatment with ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in this population russell et al 2020 while the possible antiviral activity of indomethacin a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug against sars has been reported amici et al 2006 now there is a concern in the use of these pharmacological drugs in patients with covid-19 in march 2020 the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen as an antipyretic drug in covid-19 has been warned and acetaminophen has been recommended there was a report that in 4 young patients with covid-19 and no underlying health problem the use of ibuprofen worsened the covid-19 symptoms it has been speculated that its anti-inflammatory properties could damp down the immune system and prolong viral shedding day 2020 it may reduce inflammation and fever in patients with covid-19 and diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections long-term use of ibuprofen may cause gastrointestinal bleeding fluid retention and renal dysfunction even at therapeutic doses in toxic doses it may result in respiratory depression hypotension or shock depressed mental status severe metabolic acidosis severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage life-threatening electrolyte imbalances or arrhythmias ershad and vearrier 2019 however there is no convincing evidence to support an association between ibuprofen and negative outcomes in covid-19 an outbreak of a covid-19 infection has posed significant threats to international health and the economy at present no specific antiviral therapy has been approved for the treatment of covid-19 in this urgent the researchers are trying to the repositioning of existing drugs against covid-19 old drugs that may be effective are from different pharmacological categories including antimalarials anthelmintics anti-protozoal anti-hivs anti-influenza anti-hepacivirus antineoplastics neutralizing antibodies immunoglobulins and interferons some of them focus on the sars-cov2 fusionentry process either by inhibition of s1-mediated virus attachment or by blocking of s2-mediated viruscell membrane fusion and some of them interfere with viral replication these proposed agents fight with the virus by modulating host immune response neutralizing inflammatory cytokines or inducing passive immunity convalescent plasma seems the best therapy until now in patients with covid-19 newly introduced agents focus mainly on the host cell ace2 receptors and s receptors on the virus table 2 fig 1 we suggest attention on bradykinin and its neutralizing agents could be worth full this pathway is not mentioned in recent research projects renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin systems are linked to each other through ace kallikrein converts kininogen to kinins including bradykinin that is converted to the inactive peptide via ace blocking ace with ace inhibitors antihypertensive drugs restricts the inactivation of kinins and increases the level of bradykinin alhenc-gelas et al 2019 bradykinin is the cause of dry cough in some patients on ace inhibitor drugs fox et al 1996 it is a proinflammatory peptide a potent endothelium-dependent vasodilator and a smooth muscle contractor in the bronchus in severe cases it may result in angioedema joseph and kaplan 2005 previously it has been reported that the bradykinin b2 receptor antagonist men1632 and the inhibitor of tissue kallikrein va999024 attenuated the response to parainfluenza-3 virusinduced inflammation and airway hyperactivity broadley et al 2010 it seems the feature of covid-19 is similar to over activation of bradykinin in the body the inhibition of this pathway is suggested as a therapy in patients infected with covid-19  coronavirus disease 2019 treatment a review of early and emerging options erin mccreary k jason pogue m   remdesivir gs-5734 is an investigational monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog that was developed by gilead sciences inc in response to the ebola outbreak in west africa from 2014 to 2016 in its active triphosphate nucleoside form remdesivir binds to ribonucleic acid rna-dependent rna polymerase and acts as an rna-chain terminator it displays potent in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 with an ec50 at 48 hours of 077 m in vero e6 cells 3 similar activity has been demonstrated against other zoonotic coronaviruses with ec50 values of 007 m demonstrated for both sars-cov-1 and mers-cov 36 remdesivir is highly selective for viral polymerases and is therefore expected to have a low propensity to cause human toxicity accordingly sheahan et al 6 demonstrated a wide therapeutic index for remdesivir in a human airway epithelial cell model the drug also displays a high genetic barrier to resistance in coronaviruses and has a long intracellular half-life that allows for once-daily dosing 7 8 the dose under investigation for treatment of covid-19 is 200 mg intravenously iv on day 1 followed by 100 mg iv daily for up to 10 days infused over 3060 minutes table 1 the therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir was first described in an animal model against ebola among infected rhesus monkeys in which once-daily dosing resulted in suppression of viral replication and protection from lethal disease 9 however in a human study remdesivir-treated patients with ebola experienced a 28-day mortality rate of 53 in a randomized controlled trial of 4 experimental therapies conducted in response to the democratic republic of congo outbreak of 2018 resulting in early termination of this study arm 10 it is worth noting that this trial did not have an active control arm and mortality rates for the other experimental treatments were 497 zmapp 351 mab114 and 335 regn-eb3 against mers-cov sheahan et al 5 evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir among infected mice and found treatment significantly reduced virus lung titers weight loss lung hemorrhage and lung injury scores the authors proposed the importance of early therapy initiation to diminish virus replication and promote pulmonary repair because remdesivir demonstrated less clinical benefit with high-titer virus inoculum most notably the authors also noted that prophylactic remdesivir diminished mers-cov replication and disease which was similar to their findings in a murine model with sars-cov-1 5 6 the first report of a remdesivir-treated patient with covid-19 in the united states was a 35-year-old male in snohomish county washington who received treatment on hospital day 7 illness day 11 due to developing pneumonia and persistent fevers 11 the patient experienced clinical improvement and negativity of oropharyngeal swab on hospital day 8 although nasopharyngeal swab remained positive no adverse events to remdesivir were reported for the patient which is consistent with previous case reports of use in other viruses 12 13 among the first 12 patients confirmed by the cdc to have covid-19 in the united states 3 were treated with remdesivir via compassionate use protocol 14 all patients reported transient gastrointestinal symptoms and aminotransferase elevation all patients are reportedly recovering but the authors were unable to assess the efficacy or safety of remdesivir based on the lack of comparator and confounding treatments including concomitant use of corticosteroids in one patient there are 4 clinical trials currently enrolling patients in the united states table 1 two additional trials recruiting only in china have been registered on clinicaltrialsgov nct04257656 severe disease and nct04252664 mildmoderate disease remdesivir may also be obtained through compassionate use and the emergency investigational new drug eind application process at the time of this review requests for compassionate use must be submitted online via httpsrdvcugileadcom compassionate use is only considered for hospitalized patients with polymerase chain reaction pcr-confirmed sars-cov-2 requiring mechanical ventilation in whom enrollment in a clinical trial is not feasible patients are excluded from the compassionate use program if they do not meet the above criteria have evidence of multiorgan failure are receiving vasopressors for hypotension have liver disease defined as alanine aminotransferase alt 5  upper limit of normal uln or renal impairment defined as creatinine clearance crcl 30 mlmin or receiving dialysis or continuous venovenous hemofiltration inclusion and exclusion criteria for compassionate use may change so applicants are encouraged to review the most up to date criteria for all potential patients clinicians should be cognizant that it typically takes a minimum of 72 hours for institutions to receive emergency institutional review board authorization if required protocol and consent forms from gilead us food and drug administration fda-approval for the eind and eventual drug shipment clinicians should coordinate with their local information technology teams to build a medication order sentence into the electronic health record during this time patients may receive other antiviral therapies during the waiting period but must immediately discontinue them if they receive remdesivir for compassionate use it is interesting to note that the adaptive clinical trial protocol originally stated remdesivir is a prodrug that is metabolized to its active form as a substrate of cyp-3a4 this implies the existence of a drug-drug interaction with cyp3a4 substrate inhibitors such as ritonavir or voriconazole however the protocol also stated although remdesivir is a substrate for cyp2c8 cyp2d6 and cyp3a4 in vitro coadministration with inhibitors of these cyp isoforms is unlikely to markedly increase remdesivir levels as its metabolism is likely to be predominantly mediated by hydrolase activity unlike the former the latter statement is substantiated by well described chemistry of the molecule the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases was contacted about this discrepancy and in collaboration with gilead this has been corrected there is no reason to believe that any significant drug interactions between remdesivir and cyp3a4 inhibitors or inducers are likely 8 emerging clinical evidence and available in vitro data suggest remdesivir is a promising agent for the treatment of covid-19 institutions should explore clinical trial enrollment or compassionate use remdesivir for moderate-to-severe patients additional clinical data are eagerly anticipated and should help further define the role of this agent in covid-19 chloroquine an antimalarial agent with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities has gained significant interest as a potential therapeutic option for the management of covid-19 in early february wang et al 3 demonstrated potent in vitro activity of chloroquine against sars-cov-2 with an ec50 at 48 hours of 113 m in vero e6 cells these data were consistent with previous data for chloroquines inhibitory activity against sars-cov-1 and mers-cov in various cell lines where ec50 values of 188 and 30 m were demonstrated respectively 15 these findings have supported the clinical use of chloroquine at a dose of 500 mg by mouth twice daily in numerous clinical trials in china during this outbreak although the rationale for this dosing regimen remains unclear and peer reviewed data from the trials are currently unavailable it was announced in mid-february that promising early results have been demonstrated per gao et al 16 thus far results from more than 100 patients have demonstrated that chloroquine phosphate is superior to the control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia improving lung imaging findings promoting a virus-negative conversion and shortening the disease course according to the news briefing severe adverse reactions to chloroquine phosphate were not noted in the aforementioned patients  although this development has been encouraging supply issues in the united states and cardiovascular toxicity concerns limit the use of chloroquine as an alternative hydroxychloroquine a compound that differs from chloroquine only by a single hydroxyl group has garnered interest hydroxychloroquine is perceived as having better tolerability than chloroquine which has led to long-term usage in rheumatological disorders historically very limited data were published assessing the activity of hydroxychloroquine against coronaviruses in 2006 biot et al 17 assessed the comparative inhibitory activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine against sars-cov-1 in vero cells the authors demonstrated that chloroquine had an approximately 5-fold increased potency ec50 of 65  32 m compared with that of hydroxychloroquine ec50 of 34  5 m against sars-cov-2 yao et al 18 performed a 2-part study assessing the comparative in vitro activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine and performed pharmacology-based pharmacokinetic pbpk modeling to assess comparative exposure and predicted activity of these 2 compounds in the lung in vitro analyses in vero cells demonstrated that the potency of hydroxychloroquine ec50 of 072 m was greater than that of chloroquine ec50 of 547 m against sars-cov-2 18 to inform optimal dosing of hydroxychloroquine the investigators then performed pbpk modeling in this analysis the investigators utilized human population pharmacokinetic and rat lung penetration data for each compound to estimate free trough concentrations in the lung to ec50 ratios rltec 18 because 500 mg of chloroquine by mouth twice daily has been reported to demonstrate efficacy against sars-cov-2 the target rltec for hydroxychloroquine regimens was set to 238 day 1 592 day 3 and 189 day 5 which were the rltec values predicted with the efficacious 500 mg by mouth twice-daily dosing of chloroquine 16 various dosing regimens were simulated but 2 are particularly notable the first was an oral loading dose of 1200 mg divided 800 mg then 400 mg on day 1 followed by 400 mg daily this regimen led to significantly higher rltec on day 1 333 day 3 551 and day 5 103 than those values demonstrated with chloroquine the second regimen was a loading dose of 800 mg 400 mg  2 on day 1 followed by 200 mg twice daily this was also associated with higher rltec values than chloroquine on day 1 3 and 5 corresponding to 210 389 and 854 respectively 18 the authors concluded that these data support the lower dose regimen because rltec values were significantly higher than those with the proven efficacious regimen of 500 mg of chloroquine by mouth twice daily clinicians should note that both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have half-lives of 40 days 19 and therefore short durations would likely provide prolonged courses of therapy this was exemplified in the pbpk modeling in which rltec values with hydroxychloroquine were predicted to still be above the targeted efficacy threshold on day 10 even with a 5-day course of therapy although these data are encouraging for the potential role of hydroxychloroquine against sars-cov-2 we caution against solely relying on these data to support dosing regimens for patients the use of 500 mg of chloroquine by mouth twice daily as the reference for efficacy is rational given initial reports from china 16 but it is important to note that this dosing still requires validation and the improved rltec values reported are largely driven by the finding that hydroxychloroquine was 76 times more potent than chloroquine in vitro although this enhanced potency may very well prove true as more data become available this report is counter to the relative potency demonstrated with the structurally similar sars-cov-1 strain in 2006 in which chloroquine was approximately 5 times more potent than hydroxychloroquine in addition a recently published study has demonstrated that the ec50 value for chloroquine is 113 m 3 similar to the value reported for hydroxychloroquine in the analysis by yao et al 18 because there are currently no efficacy data available for hydroxychloroquine in covid-19 additional consideration should be given to the optimal dosing strategy we use the following example to illustrate this point if one were to consider these 2 compounds to be equally potent identical ec50 values and utilize the pbpk data from yao et al 18 the 800 mg load 400 mg daily regimen for hydroxychloroquine would yield rltec values of 276 511 and 112 on day 1 3 and 5 respectively these rltec values would be slightly lower than those achieved with 500 mg by mouth twice daily of chloroquine on day 3 and significantly lower than those on day 5 suggesting the potential need for a higher dose to have similar activity although the 400 mg daily regimen is the most common regimen currently being assessed in clinical trials the rationale for that dose is currently unclear and at least 1 clinical trial in china is using a higher dose of 800 mg by mouth daily to this point gautret et al 20 recently published their initial experience on the impact of 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine by mouth every 8 hours on viral eradication in patients with covid-19 the authors reported on 36 patients 20 hydroxychloroquine and 16 control who were covid-19 positive and able to have nasopharyngeal sampling for the first 6 days of therapy in the treated arm the investigators demonstrated that hydroxychloroquine 14 of 20 70 was superior to standard of care 2 of 16 125 p  001 in eradicating sars-cov-2 from the nasopharynx it is interesting to note that 6 patients were prescribed azithromycin to prevent bacterial super-infection and the investigators found that viral eradication was numerically superior in this subgroup 6 of 6 100 compared with those who received hydroxychloroquine alone 8 of 14 57 the authors concluded that azithromycin reinforced the sars-cov-2 viral load achieved by hydroxychloroquine although these data are intriguing certain limitations to this data set must be acknowledged first although viral eradication is an important endpoint the authors did not report clinical outcomes in these patients second the cohort initially contained 26 hydroxychloroquine patients but 6 of them were removed from the analysis due to early cessation of hydroxychloroquine therapy including 3 pcr-positive patients who were transferred to the intensive care unit icu 1 pcr-negative patient who passed away and 1 pcr-positive patient who discontinued hydroxychloroquine due to nausea finally the hydroxychloroquine monotherapy arm included patients with significantly higher viral loads represented by lower cycle threshold ct values than those who received combination therapy if the hydroxychloroquine monotherapy patients with ct values 23 are separated from those with ct values 23 there is a notable discordance in viral eradication rates 1 of 5 20 vs 7 of 9 78 with this latter number approaching the 6 of 6 demonstrated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination therapy in which all patients had ct values 23 given this finding the small numbers in this study the lack of clinical outcomes presented the potential for additive toxicity with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin and the desperate need to practice good antimicrobial stewardship during the covid-19 pandemic we would caution clinicians against using these data to support combination therapy despite all of the unknowns the initial experience in china is encouraging for the potential role of chloroquine or alternatively hydroxychloroquine for the management of covid-19 clinicians are encouraged to closely follow subsequent peer-reviewed publications from the ongoing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine trials because others have raised concerns regarding the apparent in vitro andor in vivo discordance witnessed with chloroquine in other viral infections 21 furthermore if hydroxychloroquine is utilized careful consideration for dose selection should be given in accordance with the aforementioned data as well as considerations for when to initiate during the course of illness lopinavir is a human immunodeficiency virus hiv-1 protease inhibitor administered in fixed-dose combination with ritonavir lpvr a potent cyp3a4 inhibitor that boosts lopinavir concentrations lopinavir seems to block the main protease of sars-cov-1 inhibiting viral replication 22 in 2003 chu et al 23 evaluated a series of antivirals for in vitro activity against sars-cov-1 they reported lopinavir at 4 gml and ribavirin at 50 gml inhibited sars-cov-1 after 48 hours of incubation and that the agents were synergistic when used together 23 de wilde et al 24 later described the antiviral activity of lopinavir against sars-cov-1 and demonstrated an ec50 171  1 in vero e6 cells which is near the upper range of lpv plasma concentrations previously measured in patients with hiv 25 sheahan et al 5 evaluated the in vitro efficacy of lpvr in combination with interferon beta infb against mers-cov and found the addition of lpvr did not significantly enhance antiviral activity of infb alone ec50  160 vs 175 iuml respectively they also described the ec50 of lpvr 85 m and lpv alone 116 m suggesting similar activity to that described for sars cov-1 despite in vitro activity against mers-cov therapeutic doses of lpvr  infb in mice models failed to reduce virus titer and exacerbated lung disease 5 this is notable because this was the same study in which remdesivir demonstrated both more potent in vitro activity as well as in vivo efficacy however the in vivo animal data for mers-cov appears equivocal given that a nonhuman primate model demonstrated improved clinical and pathological features after lpvr treatment 26 a randomized controlled trial of lpvr and recombinant interferon-1b versus placebo is currently enrolling for patients with mers-cov which might help clarify the apparent discrepancy between in vitro and animal models 27 based on in vitro findings chu et al 23 utilized combination therapy with lpvr ribavirin and corticosteroids for any newly diagnosed patient with sars-cov-1 without acute respiratory distress syndrome ards starting in april 2003 patients receiving lpvr combination therapy n  41 were matched to historical patients receiving ribavirin plus corticosteroids n  111 and a significant reduction in the development of ards or death at 21 days was observed 24 vs 288 p  001 this was corroborated by an expanded case-control matched study of 75 lpvr-treated patients from the same center that demonstrated a significant reduction in pulse steroid use 273 vs 554 intubation 0 vs 11 and mortality 23 vs 156 among patients who received lpvr combination versus no lpvr respectively as initial therapy 28 more important the benefits of lpvr were only demonstrated in patients who received initial treatment with lpvr defined as initiation of drug at time of sars-cov-1 diagnosis there was no observed benefit when lpvr was added as rescue or salvage therapy death rate 129 vs 14 this compelling mortality difference in sars-cov-1 and continued investigation in mers-cov led to inclusion of lpvr in the chinese sars-cov-2 guidelines at a dose of 400 mg100 mg 2 capsulestablets by mouth twice a day for no more than 10 days even though to our knowledge no in vitro data for lpvr in sars-cov-2 exist 29 in pediatric patients weighing 1540 kg the recommended dose in the united states is 10 mgkg suspension by mouth twice daily there are 10 ongoing registered clinical trials in china korea thailand and hong kong evaluating lpvr as monotherapy or in combination with other antivirals eg ribavirin interferon beta-1b or traditional chinese medicine for treatment of covid-19 real-world data for treatment of covid-19 with lpvr are emerging young et al 30 reported outcomes of the first 18 patients infected with sars-cov-2 in singapore 5 of whom received lpvr monotherapy three patients had reduction in oxygen requirements after treatment initiation 2 deteriorated to respiratory failure two of 5 patients 40 experienced clearance of viral shedding on treatment and 4 of 5 80 experienced adverse events that precluded completion of the planned 14-day treatment course other published case reports or case series from korea and china comprising 6 total patients describe decreased viral load and clinical improvement after lpvr initiation these data are difficult to interpret in light of concomitant drug therapies varied time points of therapy initiation heterogeneous severity of illness amongst patients and the lack of comparator treatments 3133 finally early reports from wuhan have described some patients receiving lpvr in addition to other therapies including corticosteroids but clinical outcomes and adverse events are either not described or not delineated by treatment group 3436 most recently cao 37 et al reported the results of an open-label randomized trial comparing lpvr 400100 mg twice daily n  99 to standard care n  100 for the treatment of covid-19 pneumonia the primary endpoint was defined as the time from randomization to an improvement of 2 points on a 7-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality time until discharge and virologic response on repeat oropharyngeal swabs over the course of the study the median time from symptom onset to randomization was 13 interquartile range iqr 1116 days and this did not differ between the groups there was no significant difference in time to clinical improvement 16 iqr 1317 days vs 16 iqr 1517 days time from randomization until discharge 12 iqr 1016 days vs 14 iqr 1116 days or mortality 192  vs 250 absolute difference 58 95 confidence interval ci 173 to 57 between patients receiving lpvr and standard care when the 3 patients who died after randomization but before receiving lpvr were removed there remained no difference in mortality 167 vs 250 absolute difference 83 percentage points 95 ci 196 to 30 more important there was no difference between treatment arms in reduction of viral loads over time between the 2 groups with the available data it is difficult to assess whether lpvr has a role for the treatment of covid-19 either as monotherapy or in combination the data from sars-cov-1 are encouraging but this must be weighed against the inferior performance in mouse models against mers-cov the less potent in vitro activity compared with remdesivir and chloroquine for sars-cov-1 and limited data suggesting no advantage over standard care for sars-cov-2 more important it warrants comment that in the recent randomized controlled trial in covid-19 pneumonia the median time from symptom onset to initiation of therapy was 13 days and in the sars-cov-1 experience therapy appeared effective if started early but not as rescue andor salvage if used drug interactions must be screened and gastrointestinal toxicities including diarrhea nausea and vomiting and hepatotoxicity require close monitoring particularly because elevated aspartate transaminase or alt may exclude patients with covid-19 from clinical trials the lpvr tablets can be taken without regard to food but should not be crushed because this decreases systemic exposure solution should be used in patients who cannot receive intact tablets 38 nitazoxanide has demonstrated potent in vitro activity against sars cov-2 with an ec50 at 48 hours of 212 m in vero e6 cells 3 this potent activity is consistent with ec50 values for nitazoxanide and its active metabolite tizoxanide against mers-cov in llc-mk2 cells in which ec50 values of 092 and 083 m respectively have been demonstrated 39 nitazoxanide displays broad-spectrum in vitro antiviral activity against influenza respiratory syncytial virus parainfluenza rotavirus and norovirus among others in addition to coronaviruses 39 this broad-spectrum antiviral activity is believed to be due to the fact that the mechanism of action is based on interference with host-regulated pathways involved in viral replication rather than virus-specific pathways 39 due to its broad-spectrum antiviral activity nitazoxanide is being investigated for the management of influenza and other acute respiratory infections positive results were demonstrated in a phase 2b3 study for the outpatient management of influenza in which a dose of 600 mg by mouth bid of nitazoxanide was associated with a 1-day improvement in time to resolution of symptoms when compared with placebo p  008 40 three phase 3 randomized controlled trials in uncomplicated influenza have since been completed clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct01610245 march 2018 nct02612922 april 2018 and nct03336619 september 2019 although results are unavailable nitazoxanide failed to reduce the duration of hospitalization or the time to symptom alleviation in a phase 2 randomized controlled trial in patients with severe acute respiratory illnesses requiring hospitalization predominantly caused by respiratory viruses 41 although the in vitro activity of nitazoxanide against sars-cov-2 is encouraging more data are clearly needed to determine its role in the management of covid-19 tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits both membrane-bound and soluble interleukin-6 il-6 receptors interleukin-6 which is secreted by monocytes and macrophages is one of the main drivers of immunologic response and symptoms in patients with cytokine-release syndrome crs although tocilizumab was first approved by the fda in 2010 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis it has gained traction in recent years for treatment of patients with crs following chimeric antigen receptor t-cell car t therapy as a corticosteroid-sparing agent 42 indeed it received fda approval for severe or life-threatening car t-associated crs in 2017 due to its efficacy and safety profile although criteria for grading crs severity varies by cancer center it has been proposed to administer tocilizumab to crs patients with any of the following oxygen requirement 40 hypotension responsive to fluids or a low dose of a single vasoactive agent or grade 2 organ toxicity as defined by the common terminology criteria for adverse events 43 interleukin-6 antagonism may make a patient more susceptible to bacterial infection and has been associated with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in patients receiving chronic therapy with tocilizumab for giant cell arteritis or rheumatoid arthritis in a case series of 53 adult patients with relapsed or refractory b-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia grade 3 crs or higher was associated with increased risk of subsequent infection but it was unclear whether tocilizumab or corticosteroid use promoted this risk 44 there were no reported adverse events in the 60 tocilizumab-treated patients submitted to the fda for the crs indication which recommends a maximum of 4 doses for treatment 45 hyperinflammatory states and cytokine storming including elevated il-6 has been reported in severe covid-19 and were associated with increased mortality in patients in china 36 a preprint nonpeer reviewed case series of 21 patients treated with tocilizumab between february 5 and 14 2020 in china reported marked success including rapid resolution of fever and c-reactive protein decreased oxygen requirements and resolution of lung opacities on computerized tomography imaging 46 the authors state the patients all had routine treatment for a week before tocilizumab which was described as standard care according to national treatment guidelines including lopinavir methylprednisolone and other supportive care all patients had il-6 analyzed before tocilizumab administration with a mean value of 13238  27854 pgml normal 7 pgml it should be noted that in the united states il-6 monitoring is a send-out laboratory for most institutions with a turnaround time of 37 days no adverse events were described in the chinese cohort however long-term assessment was not done immunotherapy with tocilizumab is listed as a treatment option for severe or critical cases of covid-19 with elevated il-6 in the 7th edition of the national health commission of the peoples republic of china covid-19 diagnosis and treatment guide 29 the recommended dose is 48 mgkg or 400 mg standard dose iv once with the option to repeat a dose in 12 hours not to exceed a total dose of 800 mg there are 2 ongoing trials in china evaluating safety and efficacy of tocilizumab for patients with covid-19 pneumonia but none registered in the united states we anticipate that more data regarding tocilizumab use in patients with covid-19 will emerge and it will be imperative for clinicians to evaluate it closely the optimal timing of tocilizumab administration during the disease course is not yet defined nor is there a known il-6 threshold for progression to severe disease it is imperative to continue to follow the long-term outcomes in these patients to assess the risk versus benefit of tocilizumab similar to other severe respiratory tract infections there is significant interest and controversy surrounding the role of corticosteroids for the management of severe pneumonia due to coronaviruses the potential benefit of these agents to blunt the inflammatory cascade seen in severe disease needs to be carefully weighed against the concerns for secondary infections adverse events and other complications of corticosteroid therapy the data assessing the role of corticosteroids as adjunctive care for severe coronavirus sars-cov-1 mers-cov and sars-cov-2 pneumonia are difficult to interpret given the retrospective observational nature of these analyses there is significant confounding by indication that is difficult to control or correct for in addition to limited sample sizes patients who receive corticosteroids have a higher severity of illness are more likely to require invasive interventions and are more likely to be receiving intensive care in addition there is significant heterogeneity with regard to timing of corticosteroid initiation which can significantly impact disease progression and likelihood of response all of these features lead to patients who receive steroids being at increased risk for poor outcomes in addition there is great variation in agent and dosage used which can impact both safety and efficacy therefore clinicians making any therapeutic decisions based on the literature for corticosteroids need to keep these considerations in mind the clinical data for use of corticosteroids in sars-cov-1 infections are mixed multiple analyses show no impact on outcomes 47 one report demonstrates decreased mortality in critically ill patients 48 and others have documented worse outcomes for patients receiving steroids including increased time to viral clearance 49 or an increase in the composite endpoint of icu admission or death 50 in mers-cov receipt of corticosteroids has been associated with a delayed time until viral clearance in a large cohort n  309 of infected patients 51 however this same data set showed a nonsignificant reduction in 90-day mortality in patients receiving corticosteroids adjusted odds ratio  075 95 ci 052107 after accounting for differences between the groups in a regression model accounting for time-varying exposures finally recent evidence in sars-cov-2 suggested a decrease in mortality in patients with ards with the receipt of corticosteroids 23 of 50 46 vs 21 of 34 62 without hazard ratio 038 95 ci 020072 52 as demonstrated the data for corticosteroids are inconsistent confusing and inconclusive although target patients in whom corticosteroids will improve outcomes may exist eg those with cytokine-related lung injury who may develop rapidly progressive pneumonia that population remains ill-defined 53 clinicians need to carefully weigh the risks and benefits of corticosteroids on the individual patient level this need for a risk-benefit assessment in individual patients and careful consideration of dose is exemplified in the covid-19 diagnosis and treatment guide from the national health commission of the peoples republic of china where the authors state based on respiratory distress and chest imaging may consider glucocorticoid that is equivalent to methylprednisolone 12 mgkgday for 35 days or less note that large-dose glucocorticoid suppresses immune system and could delay clearance of sars-cov-2 29 a recent consensus statement from the chinese thoracic society recommends a lower dose 051 mgkg per day methylprednisolone for 7 days in select patients after careful consideration of risks and benefits 53 randomized controlled trial data are urgently needed to clearly define the role of corticosteroids in covid-19 ribavirin a guanosine analog that terminates rna synthesis was first approved in the 1980s and has been used clinically for respiratory syncytial virus viral hemorrhagic fever and in combination with interferon for hepatitis c as mentioned previously see lpvr section it was evaluated against sars-cov-1 in 2003 and used clinically in combination with corticosteroids andor interferon in the absence of other treatment options however outcomes were either poor or ill-defined 54 55 the doses required for antiviral activity against sars range from 12 to 24 grams by mouth every 8 hours which are associated with excessive toxicity to patients 56 wang et al 3 evaluated the in vitro activity of ribavirin against sars-cov-2 and found an ec50 of 1095 m which was over 100 times less potent than remdesivir the risk of hematologic toxicity at high doses likely outweighs potential clinical benefit and therefore ribavirin was not considered a viable candidate for further investigation by the who research and development plan for sars-cov-2 given its lack of in vitro efficacy toxicity profile and poor outcomes interferons   may stimulate innate antiviral responses and are expected to have in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 given the previously described activity demonstrated against mers-cov ec50 175 iuml however toxicities are substantial including severe cytopenias hepatotoxicity including fatality neuropsychiatric events and risk of developing fatal or life-threatening ischemia or infection particularly when combined with ribavirin this combination was not associated with improved mortality or enhanced viral clearance in a retrospective analysis of patients infected with mers-cov who were initiated on combination therapy within 13 days of icu admission 57 despite the limited to poor data chinese guidelines recommend ribavirin 500 mg iv 23 times daily in combination with lpvr or inhaled interferon- 5 million units nebulized twice daily as one of the standard treatment options for covid-19 various combinations of ribavirin interferon and other antiviral agents are currently being studied in several clinical trials based on the poor in vitro activity an absence of animal or human data supporting its use and a significant toxicity profile we recommend avoiding use of ribavirin in patients with covid-19 at this time although interferons may be useful as adjunctive care they pose a significant risk to critically ill patients and in the absence of supportive data they also cannot be currently recommended given their antiviral activity against influenza considerable attention has been paid to oseltamivir and to a lesser degree baloxavir as potential treatment options for covid-19 this was exacerbated by the initial report from huang et al 1 in wuhan where patients managed with covid-19 received oseltamivir in addition to broad-spectrum antimicrobials it is important to note that use of oseltamivir was not as targeted therapy of sars-cov-2 but rather driven by the lack of a knowledge of the causative pathogen at the time of treatment and the desire to empirically treat influenza the authors do not suggest the use of oseltamivir for covid-19 in that publication and there are no data that suggest in vitro activity of oseltamivir against sars-cov-2 in fact the only data assessing oseltamivir activity against coronaviruses demonstrated it to be ineffective at inhibiting sars-cov-1 even at a concentration of 10 000 ml 56 coronaviruses do not utilize neuraminidase and thus there is no enzyme to be inhibited by oseltamivir this would hold true for zanamivir peramivir or any other neuraminidase inhibitor agents similarly neither a defined mechanism nor in vitro data have suggested that baloxavir would demonstrate activity against sars-cov-2 or other coronaviruses therefore given the critical need for these agents in the management of influenza and concern for drug shortages with oseltamivir these agents should be avoided in patients with covid-19 once influenza has been ruled out 
table 2 lists agents that are being investigated andor theoretically considered for the management of sars-cov-2-infected patients at this time no recommendation can be made for any of these agents in general they should be avoided without additional supporting evidence appropriate management strategies for patients with covid-19 are a rapidly evolving therapeutic challenge and the optimal agents if any to treat infection or prevent progression to critical illness remain ill-defined although certain agents listed in this review are encouraging and the potential benefit of therapy likely outweighs the relatively minor risk of adverse events from short-course therapy the evidence remains inconclusive and changes almost daily patient populations who warrant therapy and the timing of initiation of therapy need to be defined given that disease progression can occur rapidly in stable patients and that viral loads are highest early in the infection course the authors of this review opine that rapid initiation of therapy in high-risk populations patients who are hospitalized or outpatients who are at high risk of complications is rational and should be considered ideally in the context of a well-controlled adequately powered trial more important however this strategy is not without risk and needs to be weighed against potential adverse events that remain poorly defined and impending drug shortages with increases in use of these agents to help address these concerns careful consideration should be given to duration of therapy with many clinical trials and institutional protocols recommending 57 days for uncomplicated disease duration of therapy should be individualized to the patient and the progression of disease clinicians must continually monitor and adapt as new literature becomes available caution should be applied because the bulk of the available clinical data are uncontrolled not peer reviewed or even unpublished given these limitations it is critical that institutions and clinicians report their experiences with the management and treatment of covid-19 to the medical community so that we may further modify and optimize treatment recommendations

ongoing clinical trials alexander muacevic john adler r deepika sarvepalli   coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is an acute respiratory viral infection related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the disease outbreak started in china in late december 2019 and quickly spread to the rest of the world resulting in a pandemic affecting 210 countries and territories worldwide so far 1 the current mortality rate of the disease is estimated at 61 with the total number of cases at 177 million by april 11 2020 1 the incidence of new cases is increasing in devastating proportions in the united states and is declared a public health emergency 2 this article provides a comprehensive review of the disease epidemiology pathogenesis diagnosis mitigation measures and treatment options it also provides insights into the ongoing clinical trials aimed at limiting the disease progression etiology of covid-19 coronaviruses are a group of viruses that infect humans other mammals and birds betacoronavirus is one of the four genera of coronaviruses and comprises some clinically important coronaviruses that can infect humans such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and sars-cov-2 coronaviruses are spherical enveloped viruses that contain single ribonucleic acid rna strand non-segmented positive sense and measure about 60-140 nm in diameter 3 the outer surface contains spikes measuring 9-12 nm in length which looks like a crown when looked under a microscope 4 the outer surface of the virus possesses four vital structural proteins which are spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n proteins 56 the s glycoprotein has the ability to attach to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor ace-2 which helps in the fusion and eventual entry of virion particles into the host cell 56 coronaviruses are zoonotic viruses and are spread from animals to humans there are two incidents in the past where human infections have resulted in severe disease the first event was the 2002-2004 sars outbreak where humans got infected by a betacoronavirus named sars-cov that was usually found in bats the epidemic started in china affecting 8422 people and resulting in as many as 916 deaths worldwide 7 later in 2012 another beta group coronavirus mers-cov of bat origin resulted in an outbreak that started in saudi arabia affecting nearly 3000 people and resulting in 858 deaths the mortality rate of the disease was high 34 8 sars-cov-2 pandemic timeline in december 2019 a novel coronavirus was discovered in wuhan city china which was linked to a group of pneumonia cases later the virus was assumed to be transmitted by wild animals to humans and all of the cases were associated with a seafood market 9 on december 31 2019 the world health organization who was informed by the chinese health department about the outbreak 10 the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv named the virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and who announced the name coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 to refer to the disease caused by the virus 1112 studies have shown that the virus is capable of spreading among humans through droplets fomites and direct contact this was confirmed in an epidemiological investigation on january 20 2020 where two patients with no travel history to wuhan were detected with the virus in guangdong province china far from the original outbreak 13 in january 2020 there was a rapid increase in the number of cases which coupled with global travel resulted in the spread of infection around the globe the who declared the outbreak as the sixth international public health emergency on january 30 2020 10 by march 2020 china had reported a total of 82160 cases of sars-cov-2 infection and the mortality rate was 4 resulting in 3341 fatalities 14 by the middle of february 2020 the infection spread to other countries such as italy iran united kingdom spain france and the united states 15 on january 20 2020 the first case was reported in the united states in the state of washington 16 since then the infection spread to all the 50 states by march 20 2020 1 by april 5 2020 it has affected 375000 people and resulted in almost 10000 deaths 1 the disease is more severe in people with underlying conditions resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multiorgan dysfunction 13 as of april 9 2020 the disease has spread to 205 countries and territories worldwide affecting nearly 16 million people and the mortality rate was estimated to be 595 95400 deaths as of april 9 2020 1 epidemiology clinical features and diagnosis the initial symptoms of covid-19 consist of fever chills dry cough sore throat nausea headache myalgias which are similar to those of influenza 17 the unique symptom reported in sars-cov-2 infection is the involvement of the gastrointestinal system vomiting and diarrhea which was not found in the case of sars and mers 18 another interesting feature of covid-19 infection is the presence of asymptomatic carriers who can shed the virus up to 21 days without any clinical signs or symptoms patients with severe illness can present with shortness of breath sob severe respiratory distress and pneumonia there is also increased reporting of new-onset anosmia and ageusia as the only presenting symptoms in some cases 19 the average incubation period for covid-19 is 2-14 days 19 however studies have reported an incubation period of as long as 19-27 days in some cases the incubation period of covid-19 is longer compared to that for mers 5 days and sars 2-7 days a study by wang et al of 138 hospitalized patients reported that the most common symptoms included fever 986 dry cough 594 and fatigue 696 also in that study the median time observed from the first symptoms to complications was five days for dyspnea seven days for hospitalization and eight days for ards 20 these findings are helpful for clinicians who are managing at-risk populations with comorbidities where early identification of complications and timely treatment helps in patient survival chen et al conducted a study of 99 hospitalized people and reported the common symptoms as fever 83 cough 82 and sob 31 21 the findings of the centers for disease control and prevention cdc report of china comprising 72314 case records including confirmed suspected diagnosed and asymptomatic cases were as follows the overall fatality rate was 23 out of 62 confirmed cases and the mortality was higher in the elderly 15 in those aged 80 years and 8 in those aged 70-79 years 22 another interesting finding of the report was that more than half of the critically ill patients had underlying comorbidities such as diabetes chronic lung disease cardiovascular disease and cancer studies have shown that older patients with comorbidities are more susceptible to complications such as respiratory failure multiorgan dysfunction such as shock acute cardiac injury acute kidney injury and even death in severe cases 22 several diagnostic tests were developed to detect the presence of covid-19 infection such as real-time polymerase chain reaction pcr reverse transcription polymerase chain rt-pcr reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification rt-lamp assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa 23 recently in the united states on march 28 2020 abbott laboratories got the fda approval for the portable point-of-care antibody test kit that can deliver test results within 15 minutes 24 studies have shown that the blood cell profile of covid-19 patients consists of decreased white blood cell wbc count lymphopenia thrombocytopenia rnaemia elevated aspartate aminotransferase ast elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr and c-reactive protein crp and mildly elevated procalcitonin secondary infection levels 25 moreover severe cases were associated with elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase ldh alanine transaminase alt creatinine and prothrombin time 13 radiological findings of covid-19 patients show a variety of changes such as ground-glass opacities bilateral lung involvement with multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation mottling and pneumothorax 13 in addition histological findings such as hyaline membrane formation fibromyxoid exudates diffuse alveolar damage and desquamation of pneumocytes were observed in critically ill patients 1325 the leading cause of mortality in critically ill covid-19 happened to be due to respiratory failure from severe bilateral pneumonia 13 studies have shown that sars-cov-2 causes cytopathic damage to airway epithelial cells which can result in the activation of severe and dysregulated immune responses ultimately leading to ards 13 histological examination of patients with ards has shown hyperactive cytotoxic t-cells filled with large volumes of cytotoxic granules 13 in addition studies have shown that critically ill patients with covid-19 have elevated levels of interleukin il 6 due to a hyperinflammation process called cytokine storm syndrome 26 high levels of il-6 are responsible for shock respiratory failure and multiorgan failure in these patients 26 in addition cellular immune mechanisms are also thought to be responsible for the grave prognosis in severe disease damage to t lymphocytes resulting in lymphopenia and increased susceptibility to secondary infections were also observed in critically ill patients 13 elevation of proinflammatory cytokines along with the suppression of anti-inflammatory cytokines suggests the cellular immune response against the sars-cov-2 13 the humoral immune response has a role in the pathogenesis of covid-19 there is a decrease in levels of immunoglobulins in covid-19 which indicates the effects on antibody-producing b lymphocytes 21 though antigens of sars-cov-2 have shown potential for stimulating antibody production the impact of overall lymphopenia may have caused depletion of immunoglobulins 21 the s and n proteins on the surface of the coronavirus are thought to elicit immune responses 27 in severely ill covid-19 patients the virus-specific antibodies are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of hyperinflammation cytokine storm and depletion of lymphocytes through a process called antibody-dependent enhancement 28 the blood profile of hospitalized patients showed an elevated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio along with a decrease in monocytes basophils and eosinophils 29 in addition a depletion of both t and b lymphocytes and natural killer nk cells was seen in critically ill patients with suppression of all subsets of t cells such as helper t cells regulatory t cells and suppressor t cells was observed the cytokine storm in severely ill patients results in elevation of proinflammatory cytokines in the plasma including interferon gamma ifn- il-1 beta tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf- granulocyte colony-stimulating factor g-csf and il-8 il-10 il-6 and il-2 29 therefore detection of il-6 can play a significant role in estimating the severity of the disease studies have shown that sars-cov-2 can result in hyperinflammation of lungs and further fibrosis by the release of il-1 mediated by the attachment of the virions to toll-like receptors tlr 30 therefore drugs targeting il-1 could be potentially beneficial in severely ill patients mitigation measures and clinical trials prevention is the mainstay of blocking the disease spread and lowering the mortality rate proper handwashing maintaining at least 6 feet of social distancing while in public and self-isolation and quarantining when suspicious of disease contraction are a few ways of preventing disease transmission there are several ongoing studies dedicated to assessing the treatment options for covid-19 some of the drugs under investigation include remdesivir chloroquine hydroxychloroquine tocilizumab and convalescent serum wang et al conducted in vitro studies on the sars-cov-2 specimen and investigated the effectiveness of antiviral drugs such as ribavirin penciclovir remdesivir gs- 5734 and favipiravir t-705 and few other medications such as nitazoxanide nafamostat and chloroquine in the treatment of covid-19 31 the findings of their study showed that remdesivir and chloroquine had the potential of inhibiting the virus in cell cultures remdesivir is a nucleotide analog that exhibits antiviral properties through incorporation into the nascent viral rna chains and further resulting in their early termination studies of remdesivir on the mice cell lines and nonhuman primate nhp cell lines have shown positive results against coronaviruses such as sars and mers-cov and on ebola virus 31 the results of the study by wang et al showed that remdesivir was able to attain the required concentrations inside the monkey cell lines infected with the virus moreover remdesivir was able to inhibit the infection effectively in the human liver huh-7 cells the second drug chloroquine is an immunosuppressive and anti-malarial drug traditionally used in rheumatoid arthritis and lupus in vitro studies have shown that chloroquine has the potential to inhibit sars-cov-2 through mechanisms including raising the ph inside the endosomes which prevents the fusion of the virus with the infected cell and interrupting the glycosylation of viral receptors 31 in addition to the antiviral properties the immunosuppressive properties of chloroquine showed a cumulative benefit in viral inhibition in cell lines 31 with that said in vivo studies and studies on patients infected with sars-cov-2 are necessary to assess the potential of these drugs in treating covid-19 with minimal to no side effects in france gautret et al conducted an open-label non-randomized small population study on hospitalized patients with covid-19 32 in their study patients were given a combination of chloroquine and azithromycin the criteria for patient selection were age  12 years and detection of sars-cov-2 antigens in the nasal swab on pcr test at admission irrespective of their clinical status 32 patients who were pregnant and breastfeeding and those with contraindications to chloroquine such as retinopathy qt prolongation and deficiency of glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase g6pd enzyme were excluded from the study the primary endpoint of the study was a negative test result on the nasopharyngeal swab test after six days of treatment the study enrolled 42 patients based on the above criteria out of which 26 people were put on hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as needed and the remaining 16 were put on the control group 32 patients were classified into three groups based on their symptoms asymptomatic upper respiratory tract infection urti group with symptoms such as fever body aches rhinitis and pharyngitis and lower respiratory tract infections lrti group with symptoms of bronchitis and pneumonia 32 the results of the study were as follows 100 of the patients who received both the drugs showed resolution of the viral load when compared with patients receiving hydroxychloroquine alone 571 and control population 125 32 moreover the effectiveness of the treatment was more significant in urti and lrti groups compared with asymptomatic patients by the end of february 2020 there were almost seven clinical trials that reviewed the effectiveness of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in covid-19 people in china 33 liu et al conducted in vitro studies evaluating the effect of both the drugs against sars-cov-2 33 their study demonstrated a similar drug profile to chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in terms of cytotoxicity drug concentration in target cells and tissue distribution previously several clinical studies have shown that hospitalized and critically ill patients with covid-19 exhibit excessive levels of cytokines in their plasma compared to the less symptomatic people suggesting the role of cytokines in disease severity 33 hydroxychloroquine possesses good anti-inflammatory properties and is thought to be more effective in these patients liu et al concluded their results by stating that hydroxychloroquine has the potential to inhibit sars-cov-2 infection effectively the study also highlighted the adverse effects of the drug and its low safety index 33 at this point further clinical trials are necessary to assess the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in covid-19 studies have reported that hyperactivation of humoral immune responses and release of il-6 was observed in critically patients with covid-19 26 therefore drugs targeting il-6 receptors such as tocilizumab could be a potential benefit for these patients tocilizumab is a biological agent used in moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis that acts by binding to il-6 receptors thereby inhibiting the effects of il-6 in china and italy a non-randomized open-label study was conducted where 21 critically ill patients with covid-19 were treated with tocilizumab 34 all the patients were put on a standard therapy consisting of lopinavir and methylprednisolone in addition to intravenous tocilizumab 400 mg all the patients in the study reported resolution of symptoms such as fever within 24 hours of the start of the treatment 34 moreover 75 of the patients reported a significant decrease in oxygen requirement within two to five days after receiving treatment and 90 of the patients had resolution of pneumonia radiologically as well 34 the study did not report any side effects of the treatment however more evidence in terms of positive outcomes in large patient groups is necessary to substantiate the results of the study in late april 2020 wang et al published the findings of their randomized case-control study on the effectiveness of intravenous remdesivir in severely ill covid-19 patients 35 the study recruited 237 patients from 10 hospitals in wuhan china who met the following criteria age  18 years lab-confirmed infection with sars-cov-2 onset of symptoms to enrollment  12 days oxygen saturation  94 on room air and chest x-ray findings positive for pneumonia patients who were pregnant or breastfeeding those with complications of liver disease such as cirrhosis elevated liver enzymes 5 times normal and renal impairment and dialysis patients were excluded from the study concurrent therapy with other medications such as steroids lopinavir-ritonavir and interferons was allowed clinical improvement within 28 days of starting remdesivir was the primary endpoint of the study the study reported that patients in the remdesivir group achieved clinical improvement faster when compared with placebo in patients with symptoms for 10 days hazard ratio 152 95 ci 095-243 35 however the results were not statistically significant and the relatively small patient population might be one of the reasons other limitations of the study include remdesivir introduction in the late stage of the disease and insufficient data on patient recovery as remdesivir was stopped early because of adverse effects anemia thrombocytopenia and elevated bilirubin 35 apart from the drug trials other notable studies include the effectiveness of passive immunization and the use of convalescent plasmaantibodies in critically ill covid-19 patients antibody treatment has been successfully used in the treatment of infectious diseases in the past a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of convalescent plasma in acute viral infections such as sars-cov and mers-cov has shown positive results in terms of decrease of viral load and case fatality rates 36 a study in china has reported that 10 critically ill people have shown positive results when treated with antibodies from recovered people including improved o2 saturation and decreased viral load 37 studies have postulated that the antibodies have the potential to neutralize the viral particles and inhibit further infection of new cells and to activate complement and phagocytosis however the treatment is associated with few adverse effects in addition to ethical issues and careful donor selection antibody treatment is associated with the risk of thrombosis 004-149 38 in addition to these studies there are some ongoing vaccine trials across the globe against the coronavirus finally there are more than 600 including withdrawn clinical trials dedicated to the management of covid-19 in the united states more than 50 active studies are currently being conducted and some of the clinical trials are shown in table 1 39 the covid-19 outbreak has been overwhelming to the nations in terms of economy and public health aspects of curbing the disease spread and keeping the incidence of cases to the lowest level possible furthermore disease management has been challenging for the clinicians and other medical personnel in terms of treatment options and the availability of personal protective equipment the off-label use of some drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and emergency use authorization of remdesivir can hopefully help the clinicians while treating critically ill patients the use of convalescent serum has also shown some interim benefit until a definitive treatment and preventive options are uncovered such as vaccines and other effective treatment regimens  treatment and preliminary outcomes of 150 acute care patients with covid-19 in a rural health system in the dakotas m enzmann o m erickson p c grindeland j s lopez m s hoover e d

with over 6 000 000 cases confirmed globally 1 2 the majority of available united states us-published reports present populations with community spread in urban areas 3 4 in this letter we describe the characteristics pharmacologic treatment and preliminary outcomes of 150 acute care patients with covid-19 within three hospitals of sanford health an integrated healthcare system in the upper

society of america covid-19 treatment guidelines published on 11 april 2020 only recommend treatment of covid-19 with pharmacological agents in the context of a clinical trial however rural health systems may not always have the capabilities and resources necessary to rapidly join open clinical trials 6 thus we feel it is important to outline how a rural healthcare system has deployed the therapeutic options available for covid-19 in our study patients with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection by positive nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction test seen in the emergency department or

common comorbidities observed were cardiovascular cv disease and diabetes mellitus fourteen patients were never admitted for inpatient treatment but rather discharged home after their emergency department encounter abnormal chest radiograph findings were observed in 89 patients and common admission symptoms included cough shortness of breath and fever
 pharmacological treatments prescribed for the treatment of covid-19 and its related sequelae are summarised in table 1 patients were selected to receive different pharmacological treatments based on physician discretion with the support of an internal covid-19 treatment guidance document that was continuously updated as new peer-reviewed literature became available risks and benefits of each treatment were explained within this document as well as guidance on which subsets of patients may benefit from certain treatments over others the median length of time after admission that patients received pharmacological treatment was less than 1 day at least a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was prescribed to 66 out of 150 covid-19 patients sixteen patients received convalescent plasma of note tocilizumab was administered to 12 patients with critical illness and elevated interleukin-6 il-6 levels 18 pgml andor elevations in other inflammatory markers five patients received two doses other therapies included zinc ascorbic acid lopinavirritonavir non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents therapeutic anticoagulation and corticosteroids when critically ill patients appeared refractory to other therapies or supportive care convalescent plasma was pursued no patient in our cohort received remdesivir as it was not yet available to our hospitals outside of the manufacturers compassionate use programme for pregnant or paediatric patients preliminary outcomes are also described in table 1 as of 1 june 2020 acute respiratory distress syndrome ards occurred in 40 out of 150 patients with 28 of 40 ards patients requiring mechanical ventilation vasopressor support was administered for 28 patients and acute kidney injury diagnosed in 31 patients a total of 127 patients have survived to hospital or emergency department discharge to date all 14 patients who were never admitted for inpatient treatment remain alive as of 1 june 2020 of those 14 patients only three received pharmacologic treatment specifically for covid-19 diagnosis which was in the form of a 5-day course of azithromycin follow-up was completed in the form of appointments with a provider in-person or via telephone after emergency department discharge four of the 14 patients not admitted for inpatient treatment do not have follow-up appointments scheduled as of 1 june 2020 of the 10 patients who had follow-up appointments the mean follow-up period was 14 days after their emergency department visit as of 1 june 2020 12 patients remain alive and hospitalised eight intensive care unit three general ward and 11 patients did not survive to discharge of the 11 patients who did not survive to discharge seven received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin of note one patient was transferred to a higher level of care for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation the average length of stay not including patients still hospitalised in a sanford facility as of 1 june 2020 in this cohort was approximately 8 days and the median length of stay was 5 days range 164 this report is the first to describe the treatment of acute care patients within a rural healthcare system in the usa which includes general ward and critically ill patients hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin appeared to be a common treatment strategy in our cohort but its impact on disease progression or survival is unclear and 11 deaths have occurred in this cohort as of 1 june 2020 the first confirmed covid-positive patient was admitted to our hospital system on 21 march 2020 all patients but one who received tocilizumab had an il-6 serum level above the upper limit of normal of 18 pgml the patient who received tocilizumab without an elevated il-6 serum level had elevations in other inflammatory markers ferritin c-reactive protein and d-dimer as with other therapies the impact of convalescent plasma on survival is not yet clear this report potentially signals a lower hospital mortality rate than the current national average however it is unknown how the covid-19 mortality rate in the dakotas will change as the projected surge in covid-19 approaches 2 the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin use with or without tocilizumab has yet to be clarified but was not without risks of corrected qt interval qtc prolongation and arrhythmias in our cohort of the 75 patients who received hydroxychloroquine 14 187 developed an arrhythmia and 15 200 developed a qtc  500 ms after initiation of therapy baseline ekgs did not reveal the presence of arrhythmias or prolonged qtc in these patients prior to the initiation of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin therapy additionally 10 of 14 71 patients with arrhythmia development had underlying cv disease while 10 of 15 67 patients with prolonged qtc  500 ms had underlying cv disease of the nine patients that received hydroxychloroquine without azithromycin none developed an arrhythmia or qtc  500 ms after therapy initiation the incidence of arrhythmias after initiation of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in our cohort 187 appears to be higher than the incidence of arrhythmias after initiation of hydroxychloroquine and a macrolide antibiotic 81 in the largest multinational registry analysis over 96 000 patients of hospitalised covid-19 patients to date although caution should be exercised in interpreting this comparison given the small size of our cohort 7 diarrhoea occurred in 19 127 patients constipation developed in 9 60 patients and nausea andor vomiting occurred in 22 147 patients of note it is possible that these gastrointestinal occurrences could be attributed to the sars-cov-2 virus itself rather than side effects of medications furthermore we did not appreciate any adverse effects that appeared related to tocilizumab or convalescent plasma administration in those patient subsets similar to other recent us reports our data are limited by a small but important sample and the use of preliminary outcomes however our findings may provide insight into the severity of the disease across a rural acute care cohort and the agents utilised for treatment when rapid clinical trial access may not be feasible we recognise that the unavailability of symptom duration prior to inpatient admission is a limitation of our report which may have helped to better characterise disease progression and duration statistical comparisons between treatment groups were also not pursued given the non-randomised patient selection and small sample size the use of medications in rural hospitals to treat covid-19 infection has yet to be clarified but is not without risks especially with regards to the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in patients with cv comorbidities larger trials with randomisation methods examining the efficacy and safety of pharmacologic therapies to treat covid-19 are needed urgently  andrographolide as a potential inhibitor of sars-cov-2 main protease an

traditional available plant several plant molecules obtained from medicinal plants were explored the outcome was that andrographis paniculata which was found to have anti-viral property and already reported in ancient texts could be investigated as a good bet we examined the main compound in andrographis paniculata and found that the main compound in the plant was andrographolide the plant compound has been evidenced to have anti-inflammatory anti-cancer anti-obesity and anti-diabetes dai et al 2019  andrographolide was found to have antiviral properties over many types of viral infections gupta et al 2017 and was found to have activity against chikungunya wintachai et al 2015 potential inhibitor of herpes simplex virus type-1 seubsasana et al 2011  also during the outbreak of dengue in india at 2006 aqueous extracts of andgrographis paniculata were given through the advice of ministry of ayush ayurveda unani siddha and homeopathy department of india which led to decrease in cases and infection of the disease as a preventive measure even to normal people acting as a immune booster the study of anti-dengue activity was found and published through quantification

viral outbreak hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin complex is being advised to be given for the affected in case of emergency though it has been studied to increase the ph of the protease and is published as a potent inhibitor of sars-cov-2 infection and spread heald-sargent  gallagher 2012 vincent et al 2005  the hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin complex mentioned above may be potent but the adverse side effects they bring to the patients are very alarming as shared already with these drastic side effects the need to bring equally or more potent alternatives in the form of plant derived drug is very essential as they are much safe and have no known side effects as we are interested only in finding pure potent plant compounds without adding any analogs or derivatives we found that the plant compound andrographolide intriguing due to its awesome properties the drug compound andrographolide can be isolated and produced easily by extracting from the plant andrographis paniculata when the compound was analyzed by in silico computational docking tools it successfully docked against the inhibitor region of the main protease of sars-cov-2 virus with docking score of -3094357 kcalmol the docking score showed great binding when compared to synthetic compounds when they are docked against m pro such as disulfiram tideglusib and shikonin which are -4616 kcalmol 6179 kcal mol and -1735 kcalmol  and it also shows great binding score when compared against recently proposed combination of three drugs namely lopinavir ostelmivir and ritonavir whose binding scores are -41kcalmol-465 kcalmol and -511 kcalmol muralidharan et al 2020  even some plant molecules which are studied to inhibit the main protease of sars-cov-2 failed to prove their binding score when compared with the andrographolide they are compounds such as kaempferol -941 kcalmol quercetin -858 kcalmol demethoxycurcumin -817 kcalmol curcumin -731 kcalmol catechin -705 kcalmol epichatechin gallate-724 kcalmol zingerol -667 kcalmol and gingerol -540 kcalmol respectively khaerunnisa et al 2020  even proposed inhibitor of m pro such as prd002214 has a docking score of -10466 kcalmol bouchentof  missoum 2020 which proclaims that andrographolide has better properties than other proposed inhibitors the compound possesses excellent properties of druggability as well small biomolecule the molar refractivity of the compound confirms that the drug compound is permeable through particular membranes and can remain constant even in the midst of strong or weak solute-solvent solventsolvent interactions and exemplary tpsa says that it has great transport properties through lipophilicity of the drug compound we can know that the compound has ideal property for oral and intestinal absorption and is able to be absorbed sub-lingual as well through water solubility properties predicted the drug is free soluble the pharmacokinetic data predicted about absorption and permeability echoes the predicted values of lipophilicity and solubility they also predict that is able to release phosphate from atp and simultaneous binding of adp to the glycoprotein thus the compound acts as a p-gp substrate the compound andrographolide does not inhibit liver metabolism by inhibiting cyp1a2 it does not stop the metabolism of several therapeutic drugs especially anti-ulcer anti-malarial anti-convulsant anesthetic and sedative drugs via inhibiting cyp2c19 it does not stop metabolism of anti-hypersensitive drugs b blockers anti-arrhythmic drugs and anti-depressants via inhibition of cyp2d6 it does not stop the metabolism of anti-clotting agents anti-seizure management of type-ii diabetes anti-hypertensive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs nsaids via cyp2d9 and it does not stop oxidation of steroids fatty acids and xenobiotics as well as for hormone synthesis and breakdown through cyp3a4 druglikeness factor rules were obeyed accordingly without any violation to this compound which describes the compound can act as a drug in the biological systems medical chemistry parameters exclaims that zero pan-assay interference compounds pains alert for the compound meaning that it is a progressive compound worthy of testing for biochemical assays the toxicity prediction says that the compound andrographolide is safe and can be given as a drug with the value of tolerance prescribed for human consumption as predicted by the website though these properties are appreciable in silico due to extensive lockdown and work from home command through the government the findings was not continued in a wet lab so further studies of in vitro and clinical studies dealing with sars-cov-2 should be considered for further studies  a review on possible modes of actions of chloroquine hydroxychloroquine repurposing against sar-cov-2 covid 19 pandemic satyajit tripathy barsha dassarma somenath roy hlupheka chabalala motlalepula matsabisa gilbert   the chloroquine cq and its analogue hydroxychloroquine hcq have been used as frontline drug for treatment and prophylaxis against all types of human malaria worldwide not only malaria but also the drugs have been used and tested against several pathophysiological conditions like hepatic amoebiasis lupus erythematosus light-sensitive skin eruptions and rheumatoid arthritis 34 there are plenty of studies in in vitro and in vivo against different cancers by monotherapy or combination therapy of cq intraperitoneal administration of cq at 60 mgkgday for seven days prolonged tumour growth in mice with epidermal growth factor receptor egfr-over expressing glioblastoma xenografts 5 in another study on glioblastoma xenograft mouse intracranial 5l of a 30mmday cq treatment for 17 days significantly reduced the mitotic cells with apoptotic cell number increases through the p53 pathway of apoptotic induction 67 to support its anticancer regimen several clinical studies on chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as anti-cancer or anti-tumour drugs are currently being undertaken httpsclinicaltrialsgov chloroquine has been found to act as an anti-tumour as well as an anticancer agent 8 and further indicating that chloroquine supplementation with conventional treatments on glioblastoma patients might improve the mid-term survival of these patients another study has found that chloroquine diminishes intratumoural hypoxia 9 as a result making the cancer cell more sensitive for radiotherapy or other oxygen-dependent therapies 10 and for dominant metastasis it is documented that autophagy promotes many cancers 11 autophagy occurs in cells under several conditions this degradative process forms auto phagosome that retains degraded cell components which then fuse with lysosomes to be recycled it is understood that autophagy is halted by chloroquine by disrupting the energy source of the autophagy pathway 1213 despite the inhibition of the autophagic flux of cq and hcq against cancer another study has reported that these drugs affect the toll-like receptor 9 p53 and cxcr4-cxcl12 pathway in cancer cells in addition in the tumour stroma cq affects the tumour vasculature cancer-associated fibroblasts and the immune system 7 cq has shown its wide-ranging properties against bacteria fungal protozoal parasitic and viral infections in a study newman et al 14 have shown that chloroquine boosts human macrophages to suppress the growth of yeast by limiting the availability of iron in macrophage chloroquine induced human mononuclear phagocytes kills the cryptococcus neoformans most commonly found in immune deficient patients 1416 besides such immune modulation by chloroquine in a combination therapy against drug resistant candida albicans chloroquine has shown promising effects by inhibiting biofilm formation at low concentrations 17 humans have been under threat due to an outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease covid-19 previously known as 2019-ncov 18 which was first reported in wuhan china in late december 2019 2 consequently the virus infection has been declared a pandemic as of 24th april 2020 about 2 620 000 people have been reported as confirmed cases with covid-19 and with over 181 000 deaths 1 covid-19 is an acute resolved disease which can be deadly if not immediately and properly managed the severity of the disease is for massively causing alveolar damage with respiratory failure and consequently death 2 however no pathology has been reported due to barely accessible autopsy or biopsy of affected patients 2 every country in the world is exhaustively trying to get a cure or preventative measures against this virus at present all treatments are symptomatic and supportive despite that anti-inflammatory and antiviral treatments have been employed no specific antiviral drugs have been confirmed effective given that the development of a vaccine is time dependent physicians and scientists are trying to find quick but effective treatments for the covid-19 scientific information currently available suggests that reports of several clinical trials are suggesting that the age-old antimalarial drug cqhcq could be a potent therapeutic agent against covid-19 infection accumulating scientific reports have proposed and highlighted the possible different modes of actions of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine particularly against viral infections chloroquine known as chloroquine phosphate a 4-amino-quinoline was introduced in 1945 as medicine against malaria hans andersag and co-workers at the bayer laboratories discovered it in 1934 it is a weak base drug and exists in protonated and unprotonated forms before it quinine from cinchona tree bark was natural antimalarial agent in 1891 paul ehrlichs group chemically synthesized cq with methylene blue a dye which can kill malaria parasite selectively through the chemistry work and the structure activity relationships sars by change of the basic methyl group resulted in a more effective antimalarial agent pamaquine subsequently the attachment of the basic side chain of pamaquine to several different heterocyclic ring systems resulted in the synthesis of an acridine derivative quinacrine which has an extra benzene ring further research resulted in the discovery of two chloroquine analogues sontoquine and primaquine which were improved and better antimalarial drugs 19 studies on these compounds then lead to the discovery of resochin during world war ii investigations on resochin lead to synthesis cq hydroxychloroquine hcq sulfate a derivative of cq was first synthesized in 1946 by introducing a hydroxyl group into cq and was demonstrated to be much less 40 toxic than cq in animals 204 fig 1
 it is also believed that hcq has less blood  retinal barrier permeability and is less toxic to retina than cq 2122 the pharmacokinetic properties of hydroxychloroquine are almost similar to that of chloroquine but it is reported that hydroxychloroquine is less active than chloroquine against resistant malaria parasite leaving chloroquine as the only age-old drug against malaria until emergence of cq-resistant malaria parasite the solubility of the drug andor its analogues in water and its absorption occurs almost entirely in the digestive tract the plasma level of the drug or its analogues has been found to reach a peak 412h after initial dose the half-live of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are long ranging from between 40 to 50 days chloroquine analogs have strong affinities to blood constituents highly protein bound particularly thrombocytes and granulocytes which reduces its plasma concentrations in addition a major fraction of the chloroquine analogs in plasma is bound to plasma proteins primarily albumin 232425 since the last decades humans have been confronted with emerging and reemerging of several viruses like dengue 26 27 28 ebola 29 30 avian influenza severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 31 32 middle east respiratory syndrome mers 33 hepatitis c chikungunya chikv 34 35 human immune deficiency virus hiv 36 37 38 39 and others in vitro study revealed that cq is effective at both entry and at post entry stages of sars-cov-2 infection in vero e6 cells 40 currently for sars-cov-2 virus which causes covid-19 there are no specific therapeutic strategies available physicians researchers and scientists are involved in several clinical trials of chloroquine andor hydroxychloroquine at different stages table 1

 from the cytoplasm because of the differences of ph the drug alters the acidic environment in the lysosomes and as a result the cell cannot proceed further with endocytosis exsosome release and phagolysosomal fusion in systematically 45 in addition an et al 46 have reported that cqhcq can also hamper the interaction between cytosolic dna and the nucleic acid sensor cyclic gmp-amp cgamp synthase cgas when in the cytosol 47
 the elevation of ph into the lysosomes by the interference of cq or hcq obstructs the antigen presentation chemotaxis proteolysis by the cell the reduction of antigen presentation due to the elevation of ph by cqhcq decreases the antigen-mhc complex as auto antigenic peptides have low affinity for self-mhc the reduced amount of self-peptide-mhc complex on antigen presenting ap cells consequence subordinate activity of other target cells as well as release of cytokines by immune cells like t-cells and other ap cells 48 moreover cqhcq causes a sporadic obligation between toll-like receptor tlr 7 and tlr 9 and their rnadna ligands due to changing of ph towards the basic in the cellular endosomal environment which suppressed tlr signaling 49 50 47 the impending of sting pathway tlr and cgas response of interferon genes results in the attenuation of pro-inflammatory cytokines like tnf il6 il1 fig 3
 51 47 on the other hand enveloped viruses are trapped within the endoplasmic and tgn vesicles for post-translational modification of its envelope glycoproteins this process involves proteases and glycosyl-transferases some of which require a low ph environment by neutralizing the acidic ph cqhcq becomes responsible for the deactivation of several enzymes in the vesicles like glycosylating enzymes glycosyltransferases which in turn are responsible for the inhibition of glycosylation the inhibition of glycosylation results in the host developing adaptive immune response against the infection 52 48 and impair the cellular receptor of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 for sars-cov-1 and blocks the fusion with the host cell 53 22 in connection it is believed that sars-cov-2 also employ ace2 receptor to enter the host cell 54 53 55 colson et al 55 have reported that the spike protein of sars-cov-2 is cleaved into the autophagosome formed by inhibition of cathepsins because of the changing of ph in lysosome as a result of cq accumulation in addition several studies showed that many human viruses like influenza 56 corona virus 57 58 which affects the respiratory tract enter into the cell with the help of sialic acid linked gangliosides 59 including sialic acid receptor 58 angiotensin converting enzyme receptor 2 ace2 60 transmembrane serine protease 2 tmprss2 61 62 and extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer cd147 also known as basigin 63 are under investigation of the researcher about the entry of such sever acute respiratory syndrome corona viruses into the human cell fig 4
 cq inhibits human corona virus hcov-o43 and orthomyxoviruses by inhibiting sialic acid biosynthesis through inhibiting quinine reductase-2 the viruses use the sialic acid moieties as receptors 23 considering the higher transmissibility of sars-cov-2 fantini et al 64 have observed that on cell surface attachment factor sialic-acid-containing glycoproteins and gangliosides by molecular modeling study the results support that cq and hcq bind readily to sialic acids with high affinity 58 also bind to sialic-acid containing gangliosides 64 in view of the ace2 receptor as regulator of the contagiousness for both sars-cov 65 and sars-cov-2 60 viruses cq can interfere the effective binding of spike protein with host cell by diminishing the glucosylation of ace2 66
 as the coronavirus pandemic infections and death have surpassed the globe faster than science can respond hospitals and doctors are prescribing cqhcq as treatment for covid 19 the proposed use of hcq for treating covd-19 infections is based on preliminary preclinical in vitro evidence where these drugs showed antiviral properties against sars-cov-2 67 68 in these studies cqhcq seem to work by interfering with the entry of the virus in human cell membrane and inhibited virus multiplication there are different views held by clinicians on the safety and efficacy of hcq for covid-19 cqhcq have multitude of serious complications of chloroquine analogues are retinopathy cardiomyopathy neuromyopathy and myopathy 4 cq and hcq use have not been reported in acute prevention so their efficacy is unknown but indicated for therapeutic use the beneficial impact of hydroxychloroquine 200 mg three times per day for 10 days for four days or hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin 500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg per day for next four days dependent on viral negativity on day 6 was reported by a non-randomized clinical trial open label in france enrolling covid-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine 20 patients or control arms 16 patients 69 in another study gautret et al 70 reported that at day 6 post-inclusion 70 of patients were cured with 600 mg hydroxychloroquine 200 mg 3 times daily for 10 days compared to 125 with patients in the control group p0001 recently two trials in china nct04261517 hcq 400mgday 5 days and chictr2000029559 hcq 200mg bd have released their findings based on context details from a clinical trial of china chictr2000029741 14 50 efficacy of chloroquine phosphate five days drugs was observed in covid-19 compared to 20 efficacy from lopinavir  ritonavir combinatorial five days drugs in chinese patients with pneumonia 71 huang et al 72 found in clinical study that chloroquine-treated patients 500 mg orally 10 days twice daily are better off than patients treated with lopinavir  ritonavir consequently chloroquine-treated patients have already been released from the hospital another clinical trial conducted with hundred chinese patients with covid 19 infection reported that cq phosphate had remarkable result both in terms of clinical outcome and viral clearance comparing to control group 73 the gao et al 73 also reported that the drug was effective in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia improving lung imaging a virus-negative and shortening the activity against covid-19 infection they recommended the drug for adding in guidelines for the prevention diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia caused by covid-19 74 there are some preliminary non-peer reviewed scientific reports now coming out which suggest that cqhcq may not beneficial for use in covid 19 another study report from brazil warns that the high-dose group patients had more severe qt prolongation syndrome of heart rhythm disorder causes arrhythmias and tendency near higher lethality compared to the low dose at the time of their reporting the overall fatality rate across both arms of the study was 135 they are indicating that the percentage of fatality rate was overlapping with the patients not taking cq 75 ehud chorin et al 76 from new york universitys langone medical center in their study of 84 adults patients with sars-cov-2 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine azythromycine hcqaz combinations found a statistically significant change in the qt prolongation from baseline in 30 of the patients and qt increased by more than 40 ms and 11 of the patients had their qt increase by greater than 500 ms they conclude that these patients represented a high risk group for arrhythmia they further concluded that the development of renal failure in these patients was a course of the extreme qt prolongation the group is advising not to take hcq drug as a treatment httpswwwwashingtonpostcom business20200421anti-malarial-drug-trump-touted-is-linked-higher-rates-death-va-oronavirus- patients-study-says the third other study joseph magagnoli et al 77 is a retrospective analysis of data from sars-cov-2 infected patients hospitalized in united states veterans health administration medical centres where a total of 368 patients were followed in this study patients were groups into those that received hydroxychloroquine alone hcq or hcq with azithromycin hcqaz as treatments in addition to a group that received no treatment but standard supportive management for covid-19 the analysis looked at two primary outcomes which were death and the need for mechanical ventilation the authors of this study concluded that they found no evidence of the efficacy of hcq alone or in combination with az they found that mortality was higher in patients receiving hcq alone 278  and in combination of hcqaz 221 while significantly lower in the group receiving no drug treatment 114 77 according to the authors they found association of mortality in patients treated with hcq alone although these studies are small and retrospective they highlight important decision making to not rush into widespread recommendation of these drugs for covid-19 considering the global health crisis for the covid-19 pandemic the option of using the drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine especially hydroxychloroquine drug in the treatment of sars-cov-2 might be the logical approach to follow with the available of scientific information the reports point to the diverse mode of actions of cq andor hcq that puts them as favorable choice for covid-19 on their effect for both pre and post viral infections but of course we need to put attention on doses as well negative effect of cqhcq on human health however with new evidence coming out there is need for precautionary measure to be taken not to rush in recommending the cqhcq for use for covid-19 patients we need to wait for results that would come out of larger prospective randomized dose determining controlled clinical trials before making clinical recommendations for hcq and indicating it for covid-19 in the meantime while looking for a vaccine which may be preventative in-depth but expedited responsive discovery and clinical research is needed and this include looking at traditional medicines-based research therapies

  review of emerging pharmacotherapy for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 ashley barlow kaitlin landolf m brooke barlow siu yeung yan jason heavner j cassidy claassen w mojdeh heavner s   pharmacologic therapies against sarscov2 target its viral structure and genome figure 1 sarscov2 expresses viral proteins on its outer surface that facilitate attachment on to host cells via angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 sarscov2 is a singlestranded ribonucleic acid rna beta coronavirus that replicates by recruiting nonstructural proteins such as 3chymotrypsinlike protease papainlike protease helicase and rnadependent rna polymerase
10
 these structural components have some similarities to other known viruses such as hepatitis b hepatitis c and human immunodeficiency virus hiv prompting repurposing of currently approved antiviral therapies targeted at these viruses nucleoside analogs available for hiv and respiratory viruses may have a therapeutic role in blocking rna synthesis by targeting the rnadependent rna polymerase found in sarscov2 furthermore the currently available hiv protease inhibitors have displayed some in vitro activity against the 3chymotryspinlike protease found in sars and mers
10

 it is critical to be aware that currently available therapies have been specifically designed to target the viral genome of a certain virus and the sarscov2 physical structure may differ limiting in vivo efficacy
10
 other nonstructural or accessory proteins have a role for potential therapeutic targets in development as shown in figure 1 as opposed to directly targeting viral replication other therapeutic approaches can be aimed at modulating the innate immune system to attack the virus or inhibit cytokines that are upregulated during viral replication to dampen the physiologic response to disease
11
 
12
 practical considerations for current therapies available against sarscov2 are summarized in tables 1 and 2 and discussed at length in the following sections remdesivir gs5734 is an investigational antiviral agent undergoing phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of covid19 remdesivir was initially developed for the treatment of ebola hemorrhagic fever with trials still ongoing however it has not been approved globally for any indication
13
 in vitro and in vivo animal data suggest activity against paramyxoviridae filoviridae and the coronaviridae including merscov sarscov and sarscov2
3
 
14
 
15
 
16

 remdesivir is a 1cyanosubstituted adenosine nucleotide analog
17
 as a prodrug remdesivir is metabolized in cells and tissues to an active nucleoside triphosphate gs443902 that inhibits viral rnadependent rna polymerases early in the viral infectious cycle
18
 
19
 other potential mechanisms of this adenosine nucleotide analog may involve lethal mutagenesis and chain termination
18
 the incorporation of active nucleoside triphosphate via remdesivir at the beginning stages of replication of murine hepatitis virus in vitro had the most profound effect at 2 hours pre and postinfection with a decreasing effect greater than 4 hours postinfection suggesting a timedependent effect for drug activity
18

 nucleotide analogs are used for viral rna or dna polymerase inhibition and have demonstrated decreased viral replication with their use resistance to mutagens of other medications in vitro has resulted in exoribonuclease proofreading and removal remdesivir has shown potential to avoid this proofreading and thus removal via the exoribonuclease
18
 in vitro studies in human airway epithelial cell cultures as a lung model have found activity against coronaviruses
15
 studies assessing the potency of remdesivir were efficacious among divergent coronaviruses in human airway epithelial cells
18
 based on the existing evidence for remdesivir activity against sarscov and similar viruses remdesivir is being investigated for its use against sarscov2 in the united states remdesivir has been used for compassionate purposes for a duration of 410 days in these patients remdesivir was continued until improvement in respiratory symptoms
20

 ongoing clinical trials are studying remdesivir with a loading dose of 200 mg intravenously followed by 100 mgday intravenously for 5 to 10 days in adult patients
21
 
22
 dosing for patients weighing less than 40 kg with a 5 mgkg loading dose followed by a 25 mgkg onceday maintenance dose has been studied for the treatment of ebola
23

 the existing remdesivir pharmacokinetic data are extrapolated from in vitro human cell data and in vivo mouse and nonhuman primate data remdesivir is converted from the parent metabolite to the active metabolite a triphosphorylated nucleoside via anabolic intracellular kinase
24
 
25
 mice received remdesivir subcutaneously as 50 mgkg onceday or 25 mgkg twiceday with a decrease in plasma concentrations of the prodrug and a steady concentration of the activated drug in the lung
15
 in the murine model twiceday dosing maintained lung concentrations for a longer duration in the in vitro human lung cell model and the in vivo nonhuman primate model onceday dosing was found to reach sufficient concentrations with remdesivir demonstrating an activated nucleoside triphosphate halflife of 20 hours
19
 
26

 no data are available to date regarding remdesivir dosing in patients with renal or hepatic impairment data on clearance of remdesivir in renal replacement therapy are also not yet available important pharmacokinetic considerations will need to be elucidated given that patients receiving remdesivir are likely to be critically ill with endorgan failure
9

 reported adverse effects of remdesivir after use in three patients in the united states included nausea vomiting gastroparesis or rectal bleeding with no other reported symptoms these patients also experienced elevated aminotransferase levels occurring 15 days after initiating remdesivir
20
 however it is unclear whether this laboratory change is due to the drug itself or the virus because a third of critically ill patients with covid19 have been observed with liver dysfunction
9
 in a study using remdesivir for ebola virus in humans one patient experienced hypotension during infusion of the loading dose necessitating discontinuation that patient ultimately died due to cardiac arrest
27
 a patient experienced neurologic complications after receiving remdesivir for ebola treatment in a phase 1 study however it is not clear if this was due exclusively to having received remdesivir
19
 currently the data on remdesivir use in humans are too sparse to have a clear adverse effect profile for this agent current phase 3 randomized clinical trials will provide more conclusive insight into the adverse effects of remdesivir
21
 
22
 
28

 remdesivir is manufactured as a lyophilized powder that requires reconstitution and is administered intravenously over 30 minutes the infusion duration has also been extended over longer times to obtain higher intracellular concentrations of the active metabolite
29
 no data are available regarding compatibility of remdesivir with other intravenous medications to date drugdrug and drugnutrition interactions have not been reported chloroquine analogs chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine have been used for the prevention and treatment of malaria since the early 1900s
30
 aside from their antimalarial properties chloroquine analogs possess immunomodulatory effects lending to their utility for the treatment of autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis the multimodal properties of chloroquine analogs and their minimal toxicity profile have led to their investigation in the treatment of virusinduced illness where the pathologic features are driven by an inflammatory response such as in hivassociated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome
31

 chloroquine analogs are weak bases that in their nonprotonated form penetrate and concentrate within acidic intracellular organelles such as endosomes and lysosomes once present intracellularly chloroquine analogs become protonated and increase intravesicular ph resulting in prevention of endosomal trafficking dysfunctional cellular enzymes and impaired protein synthesis
30
 chloroquinemediated ph alterations have been proposed to result in early inhibition of viral replication through interference with endosomemediated viral entry or late transport of the enveloped virus this mechanism has translated to the potential role of chloroquine analogs in the treatment of covid19 and also appears to interfere with the terminal glycosylation of ace2 receptor expression that prevents sarscov2 receptor binding and subsequent spread of infection
32

 clinical data supporting the use of chloroquine analogs in the treatment of coronavirus have centered around several in vitro studies from the sarscov outbreak in the early 2000s with the use of chloroquine one group tested the cytotoxic potential of chloroquine against sarscov in an in vitro cell culture chloroquine demonstrated a potent cytotoxic response with a 99 inhibition of viral replication at day 3
33
 further in vitro models supported its cytotoxic response and observed that application of chloroquine before viral exposure resulted in favorable inhibition of viral spread suggesting its potential role as an effective prophylactic intervention
32

 hydroxychloroquine a hydroxy derivative of chloroquine with an improved safety profile has also been studied in vitro against sarscov2 with a 3fold higher cytotoxic potential compared with chloroquine
34
 one study demonstrated potent antiviral effect at both entry and postentry states at plasma concentrations of 690 m this concentration can be safely achieved in humans
35
 clinical data in humans thus far have been limited with the best available evidence to date from more than 100 patients from 10 different hospitals in china during the current covid19 outbreak this pooled analysis demonstrated superiority of chloroquine compared with control in inhibiting exacerbations of pneumonia improving lung imaging findings promoting viral negative conversion and shortening the disease course in the absence of any adverse effects
36
 the dual mechanism of antiviral and antiinflammatory effects of chloroquine were proposed to account for its utility in preventing covid19related pneumonia ongoing trials for hydroxychloroquine are actively recruiting with hopes to further delineate its role in the treatment paradigm for covid19
37

 chloroquine is formulated as a tablet in a phosphate salt form for oral administration in the treatment of covid19 expert consensus recommends a chloroquine phosphate tablet at a dose of 500 mg orally twiceday for a duration of 10 days
38
 bioavailability after oral administration is complete 60100 and rapid within 30 minutes chloroquine is widely distributed into nearly every organ system including the eyes heart kidney liver and lungs where retention is prolonged
39
 chloroquine is metabolized into an active metabolite desethyl chloroquine via hepatic enzymes cytochrome p450 cyp 2c8 and cyp3a4 this metabolite accounts for a small portion of its pharmacologic activity chloroquine is a major substrate of cyp2d6 this enzyme accounts for 30 of its inactivation inhibitors of this enzyme should be avoided due to a heightened risk of accumulation and toxicity chloroquine is predominantly eliminated in the urine with 50 of a dose recovered unchanged no dose adjustments are needed if creatinine clearance clcr is above 10 mlminute however administration of 50 of the dose is required in patients on intermittent hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis or if clcr is below 10 mlminute patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy crrt should receive fulldose chloroquine
39

 hydroxychloroquine sulfate is available as a filmcoated tablet for oral administration dosing recommendations for covid19 are not welldefined and clinical trials and in vitro data are ongoing to assist with dose optimization current in vitro pharmacokinetic models suggest a loading dose of hydroxychloroquine 400 mg orally twiceday on day 1 followed by 200 mg orally twiceday for 4 days hydroxychloroquine has similar or possibly superior cytotoxic effects against sarscov2 as chloroquine 500 mg twiceday translation of the cytotoxic effects of hydroxychloroquine in vivo remains unknown
34
 a clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine for covid19 is actively recruiting with a planned intervention of 400 mg by mouth onceday for a total duration of 5 days
37
 the major difference in dosing strategies is the utility of a loading dose given that the terminal halflife of hydroxychloroquine is 50 days in blood and remains in the body for up to 3 months a loading dose is a reasonable approach until the clinical outcomes from ongoing trials are published hydroxychloroquine has rapid absorption after oral administration a wide volume of distribution vd and prolonged halflife metabolism and elimination of hydroxychloroquine differ from chloroquine because reliance on cyp enzymes for elimination is minimal and clearance is not correlated with renal function no renal or hepatic dose adjustments are recommended however cautious use with severe impairment is advised given the wide vd 155 lhr and high lipophilicity of the compound crrt is likely to have minimal impact on drug removal chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are generally well tolerated the most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal intolerances such as nausea vomiting abdominal cramping and a metallic taste acute toxicity in the setting of supratherapeutic dosing may manifest as cardiomyopathy neuropathy or myopathy retinopathy a hallmark toxicity of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine is predominantly associated with high doses longterm administration ie hydroxychloroquine for systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis and are unlikely of concern in the setting of covid19 treatment although the manufacturers labeling of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine cautions against their use in patients with glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase g6pd deficiency only limited data support this risk and no incidence of hemolytic anemia was seen in patients with g6pd in 30 years of drug exposure
39
 
40
 both agents are safe in pregnancy with minimal risk of congenital malformations
41
 albeit rare use in patients with preexisting cardiac disease or qtc prolongation should be avoided due to the risk of torsades de pointes concurrent administration of qtc prolonging agents and strong 2d6 inhibitors chloroquine only should be avoided to minimize cardiac adverse effects notable dermatologic adverse effects can include photosensitivity lichenoid reactions and drug eruptions with chloroquine and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis with hydroxychloroquine
39
 
40
 in postmarketing data case reports of hypoglycemia progressing to loss of consciousness occurred with these agents in patients with a history of diabetes on concurrent antidiabetic agents
39
 
40
 the proposed mechanism of hypoglycemia involves inhibited insulin degradation patients have required up to a 30 reduction in insulin doses with concurrent hydroxychloroquine administration
42
 baseline and routine monitoring of blood glucose and electrocardiogram for the qtc interval are recommended for patients on chloroquine analog therapy to mitigate nausea and vomiting it is recommended to administer chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with food chloroquine can be crushed and mixed with flavored syrups or enclosed in gelatin capsules to mask the bitter taste
39
 in patients who are mechanically ventilated chloroquine can be extemporaneously compounded into oral suspension hydroxychloroquine tablets should not be crushed or split at the bedside for administration but instead require removal of the film coating to be compounded extemporaneously into a solution for administration via enteral tubes neither agent is available for intravenous administration and would be an unfavorable option in patients who are not permitted to take anything by mouth or have no enteral access administration of antacids within 4 hours of chloroquine should be avoided due to a potential for chelation and reduced bioavailability this interaction is not present with hydroxychloroquine a theoretical drugdrug interaction exists between proton pump inhibitors ppis and chloroquine analogs because the blockage of h k atpase by ppis in lysosomes can raise the ph and reduce drug accumulation that could weaken immunomodulatory effects however effects of this interaction in vivo are unknown
39
 
40

 lopinavir lpv is an aspartic acid protease inhibitor developed for the treatment of hiv lopinavir is coformulated with ritonavir lpvr to boost the pharmacokinetic activity and halflife of lpv through inhibition of cyp450 lpvr provides potent and sustained viral load reductions for patients with hiv which has prompted interest in assessing its efficacy in other viruses that function with similar machinery
43

 proteases are essential enzymes for the production and maturation of viral genomes the primary antiviral effect of protease inhibitors is prevention of viral replication thus limiting spread into host cells
43
 the therapeutic rationale for lpvr arises from in vitro studies demonstrating inhibition of the 3chymotrypsinlike protease found in novel coronaviruses
44
 
45
 however lpv was specifically designed to match the structure of the c2 catalytic site within the hiv aspartic acid protease sarscov2 protease is a cysteine protease family and structurally dissimilar because it lacks a c2 catalytic site
10

 the therapeutic value of lpvr emerged from in vitro studies testing its utility for sars and mers in vitro testing of lpvr was performed for severe merscov in marmosets lopinavirritonavir improved clinical scores for weight loss and symptom burden improved radiologic clearance and decreased viral loads in necroscopied lungs
45
 the benefit of lpvr has yet to be clearly replicated in human cell cultures with some studies showing complete lack of in vitro activity
46
 clinical in vivo studies from sars and mers outbreaks demonstrated that the use of lpvr 400100 mg by mouth twiceday combined with ribavirin with or without corticosteroids initiated during the early phase of viral acquisition reduced rates of ards or death when compared with a matched cohort that received supportive care or ribavirin alone
44
 
47
 
48
 however these findings did not remain significant if lpvr was initiated later in the disease course reiterating the lack of pharmacologic effect against a viral genome that has been integrated into host dna
48

 available literature to date for lpvr in the treatment of covid19 stems from a descriptive case series of five patients in singapore receiving lpvr 200100 mg twiceday for 14 days three patients had reductions in ventilation requirements within 3 days of treatment initiation but two had progressive respiratory failure despite the lower dosing regimen compared with previous studies four of the five patients had premature treatment discontinuation secondary to nausea vomiting diarrhea and increased liver function tests no deaths occurred in the study but efficacy outcomes are difficult to interpret based on the lower dosing strategy compared with previous data this does raise concerns about the potential tolerability of the higher dose regimen
49

 another retrospective cohort showed that lpvr has limited influence on the duration of viral shedding that can occur for a median of 20 days after initially contracting the virus
49
 
50
 in a recent randomized controlled openlabel trial including hospitalized patients with sarscov2 infection patients receiving lpvr 400100 mg twiceday for 14 days versus standard of care found no benefit versus standard of care treatment
51
 multiple ongoing studies have evaluated the clinical utility of lpvr as monotherapy and in combination with other therapies such as ribavirin and interferon ifn
52
 
53
 
54

 lopinavirritonavir is available as a singletablet formulation kaletra in dosage strengths of 400100 mg or 200100 mg given the largest available evidence from in vitro studies if lpvr is used as an adjunctive agent for covid19 a dose of 400 mg100 mg by mouth twiceday for 14 days is recommended the drug is highly protein bound 98 and its primary pathway for elimination is through the hepatobiliary system no dose adjustments are required for renal impairment in patients receiving intermittent hemodialysis however onceday dosing is not recommended when indicated for treatment of hiv this does not influence use in covid19 because the recommended schedule is twiceday
43
 no dosage adjustments are recommended in hepatic impairment but caution should be advised if used in patients with advanced liver disease
55
 lower dosages of 200100 mg twiceday can be considered where adverse effects limit tolerability with the understanding that lower doses may not substantially mitigate toxicities based on information collected by the antiretroviral pregnancy registry an increased risk of teratogenic effects has not been observed in humans the health and human services perinatal hiv guidelines consider lpvr a therapeutic option for pregnant women living with hiv and can be continued if conception occurs during therapy
56

 the considerable potential for drugdrug interactions with lpvr requires a thorough review of concomitant medications ritonavir is a strong inhibitor of cyp3a4 a major enzyme responsible for the metabolism and elimination of many medications in addition ritonavir is a moderate inhibitor of pglycoprotein pgp organic anion transporter oatp1b1 oatp1b3 and is an inducer of udpglucuronosyltransferase
55
 patients requiring icu admission for covid19 are often elderly with multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy the potential therapeutic benefit of lpvr should be weighed against considerable interactions with commonly used medications in the icu eg midazolam fentanyl antiarrhythmics
3

 treatment with lpvr may result in intolerable gastrointestinal toxicities although administration with food may ameliorate the severity of these symptoms up to 24 of patients experience diarrhea although it usually improves within 2 weeks
55
 adverse events particularly relevant to icu patients include potentially fatal pancreatitis hepatitis hepatic decompensation among those with preexisting liver disease and increased pr intervals especially in those with congenital qtc prolongation
55

 previous studies using lpvr for sars demonstrated increased serum amylase and liver enzyme elevations compared with a matched cohort routine monitoring of liver function tests is critical and supportive care with antiemetics and antimotility agents should be considered
44
 cardiovascular and metabolic toxicities such as lipid abnormalities are commonly observed in patients with hiv receiving these therapies for prolonged periods these are less likely when used for the abbreviated durations for covid19 lopinavirritonavir tablets should not be chewed or crushed for patients unable to swallow
55
 in patients who are intubated or have limited oral access an oral suspension is available for delivery via a nasogastric tube
55
 of note the suspension does contain 424 ethanol available data suggest administration with enteral nutrition does not adversely impact drug concentrations
57
 coadministration with food that contains a moderate to high fat content can enhance lpvr bioavailability
55

 ribavirin is a purine nucleoside analog that elicits its antiviral affect through inhibition of viral rna synthesis ribavirin is a prodrug that undergoes metabolic conversion by the liver after which its metabolic structure closely mimics the purine analog guanosine that enhances its incorporation into rna the structural elements prohibit the subsequent addition of nucleoside analogs effectively halting the synthesis of rna
58
 ribonucleic acid is ubiquitous in many viruses which is why ribavirin has been studied in a broad range of viral diseases including hepatitis b c and respiratory syncytial virus
59

 the nonselective antiviral properties of ribavirin prompted investigators to evaluate its use during the sars and mers outbreaks during the initial sars outbreak ribavirin was used throughout hong kong in both oral and intravenous formulations
60
 however the distribution of the intravenous formulation which is not available in all countries including the united states was restricted in the midst of the epidemic given the concern for lack of in vitro susceptibility and considerable toxicity in 126 patients treated with ribavirin hemolysis and anemia occurred in up to 76 and 49 of cases respectively
61
 
62
 in vivo data suggest serum concentrations of ribavirin needed to blunt viral replication effectively is higher than what is safely achievable in humans
61
 in vitro data suggest rapid resistance against sars and mers when used as a monotherapy but potential activity when combined with other antivirals such as lpvr or chloroquine analogs
38
 
63
 outcomes for ribavirin use in combination with interferon ifn2a for merscov is discussed in the ifn section ribavirin is commercially available as an oral capsule oral solution and inhaled formulation
59
 the inhaled formulation has not been studied for sars mers or covid19 and the intravenous form is not available in the united states oral ribavirin has been dosed as a 4g loading dose followed by 12 g every 8 hours in two small studies for sars

 in the management of covid19 data are limited to ongoing studies using a dosing strategy of 400 mg by mouth twiceday for 14 days as a part of a combination regimen ribavirin has a prolonged halflife of 40 days loading doses may aid in achieving steady state more rapidly
65
 ribavirin is metabolized to its active form via extrahepatic enzymes
59
 however its use in hepatic impairment childpugh class b and c is not recommended given that it is metabolized by cyp enzyme pathways ribavirin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion requiring strict dose reductions for renal insufficiency that varies based on indication
59
 a review on the use of ribavirin in sars recommended a 50 dose reduction for clcr between 30 and 50 mlminute and a 75 reduction for cl of below 30 mlminute
65
 there is no established safety of ribavirin in patients receiving renal replacement therapy it should be restricted to those with stable renal function ribavirin carries a boxed warning for hemolytic anemia
59
 in a study assessing the adverse effects associated with the use of ribavirin use for sars the most common adverse effects were hemolytic anemia 61 hypocalcemia 58 and hypomagnesemia 46
66
 the onset of hemolytic anemia occurs as early as 35 days after therapy with high doses above 12 g that were used as loading doses for coronavirus
44
 
67
 the risk is highest in patients who are elderly or have poor renal function but consideration should also be taken in patients with preexisting cardiac disease where reduction in hemoglobin increases the risk of decompensation
59
 ribavirin is a teratogen with a significant potential for embryonic toxicity and contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in male partners of women who are pregnant if ribavirin is considered in women or men of childbearing potential use of systemic and barrier contraception must be strictly enforced because active metabolites of ribavirin persist in plasma for up to 6 months contraception is required both during treatment and for at least 6 months after treatment is completed
59

 ribavirin does not have drugdrug interactions because its metabolism and elimination does not rely on the cypp450 system however certain therapies should be used cautiously with ribavirin due to the potential for enhanced toxicities ribavirin in combination with other immunosuppressive therapies particularly azathioprine or ifn can lead to severe pancytopenia
59

 ribavirin administered orally as a solution or capsule has an absolute bioavailability of 4050 compared with the intravenous or as an aerosol formulation
59
 oral formulations have enhanced bioavailability when taken with a highfat meal and it is recommended to administer both oral formulations with food due to the teratogenic potential of ribavirin it was identified as a hazardous medication on the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh list and requires significant safety precautions with its use the capsules should not be opened crushed or broken
59
 health care providers handling ribavirin must also follow niosh recommendations to wear gloves when packaging administering or receiving intact capsules when handling the solution double gloving a protective gown and eyeface protection is required especially for administration of the oral liquid through a feeding tube nitazoxanide is a 2acetyloxyn5nitro2thiazolyl benzamide with an approved food and drug administration fda indication for its antiprotozoal activity to treat diarrhea caused by giardia parvum and giardia lamblia
68
 nitazoxanide has since been found to have activity against cryptosporidium and in vitro activity against anaerobic grampositive and gramnegative bacteria
69
 
70
 another studied use of nitazoxanide was for the treatment of influenza
71
 when nitazoxanide was studied for severe acute respiratory illness no benefit was seen in clinical outcomes specifically length of hospital stays
72

 nitazoxanide interferes with pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase enzymedependent electron transfer thus impairing anaerobic energy metabolism of protozoa
68
 nitazoxanide is metabolized to its active circulating metabolite tizoxanide
73
 tizoxanide selectively blocks the posttranslational influenza viral hemagglutinin maturation and intracellular movement in addition to blocking protein implantation into the plasma membrane
74
 nitazoxanide may potentiate the production of type 1 ifns produced by host cell fibroblasts that may potentiate antiviral activity via hemagglutinin inhibition
75

 nitazoxanide has demonstrated in vitro activity against merscov
71
 an anticoronavirus effect was observed with nitazoxanide in an in vitro screen of small molecules against a recombinant murine coronavirus
76
 in vitro studies of canine coronavirus found that the use of nitazoxanide inhibited viral replication
71
 based on this in vitro animal data it is thought that nitazoxanide may have activity against sarscov2 human data are limited regarding the efficacy of nitazoxanide against human coronavirus in a 260patient doubleblind placebocontrolled trial in patients with influenzalike illness five participants who received nitazoxanide were coronavirus positive
72
 subgroup analysis of these five coronaviruspositive patients found no difference in the primary outcome of days of hospitalization p061 the recommended nitazoxanide dosing for cryptosporidium parvum or g lamblia is 500 mg oral suspension or tablet every 12 hours for 3 days
68
 the dosing used for acute respiratory illness was twiceday for 5 days and dose strength was based on age patients 12 years of age and older received two 300mg tablets children 411 years old received 200 mg of the suspension and toddlers 13 years old received 100 mg of the suspension
72

 it is recommended that nitazoxanide be administered with food because pharmacokinetic studies found increased area under the curve auc and maximum concentration cmax of tizoxanide
68
 specifically a doubling of auc and 50 increase of cmax was observed when the tablet was administered with food when the suspension was administered with food there was a 4550 increase in auc and up to a 10 increase in cmax an important consideration is that the oral suspension is not bioequivalent to the tablet the suspension has a bioavailability of 70 necessitating dose adjustments when transitioning between these dosage forms
68
 in plasma tizoxanide is more than 99 bound to proteins metabolism of nitazoxanide to tizoxanide occurs via hydrolysis and then conjugation via glucuronidation nitazoxanide has not been studied in patients with impaired renal and hepatic function and no dosage adjustment recommendations exist
68
 data in geriatric and pediatric populations are not available the most common adverse effects of nitazoxanide are gastrointestinal mainly abdominal pain nausea and headache patients may also experience discoloration of eyes and urine diarrhea dizziness gastroesophageal reflux disease skin rash or urticaria compared with patients receiving standard of care and placebo patients receiving nitazoxanide did not have additional adverse effects and both groups of patients experienced gastrointestinal and respiratory effects
72
 headache and diarrhea were reported most in patients receiving placebo versus lowdose nitazoxanide versus highdose nitazoxanide for treatment of viral respiratory infection with no significant difference among all three groups
77

 nitazoxanide is available in dosage forms administered enterally including a controlledrelease filmcoated tablet and oral suspension nitazoxanide tablets can be crushed and mixed with food there are no existing data regarding the absorption of nitazoxanide when administered via gastric feeding tubes however if gastric feeding tube administration is needed the oral suspension can be used drugdrug interactions with nitazoxanide are not attributed to cytochrome cyp enzymes because in vitro metabolism data found no significant effect of tizoxanide on these enzyme pathways
68
 most notably nitazoxanide may have binding site competition with other highly proteinbound drugs a narrow therapeutic index drug that would be of concern in this case is warfarin however a pharmacokinetic study in which patients received nitazoxanide twiceday for 6 days with a onetime warfarin 25 mg dose compared with patients receiving warfarin did not result in pharmacokinetic or dynamic changes and was well tolerated
78

 nelfinavir is a hiv1 protease inhibitor originally developed for use in combination with antivirals that target hiv via alternative mechanisms with development of newer combination antivirals for hiv nelfinavir has fallen out of favor for this indication
79

 nelfinavir binds to the site of hiv1 protease activity and inhibits cleavage of viral gagpol polyprotein precursors into functional proteins that are needed for hiv what remains are nonviable hiv particles that are no longer infectious during the 2002 sars outbreak nelfinavir was identified as a potential agent with activity against sarscov based on in vitro studies
80
 nelfinavir was found to inhibit the replication of sarscov in vero e6 cells originating from the african green monkey most recently nelfinavir was identified via homology models based on threedimensional sars structures specifically at the main protease or chymotrypsinlike protease
81
 these models assessed the ability of small molecule drugs to dock to the sars structures the sarscov was used because its sequence is 96 similar to that of sarscov2 of 30 drugs assessed nelfinavir was found to have the most promising activity against sarscov2 nelfinavir has not been studied in humans for its efficacy against sarscov or sarscov2 the recommended dosing of nelfinavir for the treatment of hiv is 750 mg by mouth 3 timesday or 1250 mg by mouth twiceday the halflife of nelfinavir is 355 hours the effective dose for treatment of covid19 is unknown nelfinavir dosage adjustments do not need to be made with renal impairment because less than 2 of nelfinavir is excreted in the urine
82
 for patients with hepatic impairment nelfinavir is not recommended in patients with childpugh class b or c
79
 
83
 
84
 pharmacokinetics in patients using nelfinavir with chronic liver disease may be unpredictable
85
 no dosage adjustments are recommended for use in patients with childpugh class a impairment nelfinavir is metabolized by cyp3a4 and cyp2c19 and could potentially interact with medications that are inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes in vitro data found that only cyp3a enzymes were inhibited by nelfinavir at therapeutic concentrations
82

 the major adverse effect of nelfinavir is gastrointestinal intolerance primarily diarrhea nausea and flatulence a nonspecific rash may also occur the incidence of other side effects are minimal occurring less than 2 of the time in phase 2 and 3 trials
82

 nelfinavir is available in a tablet dosage form the 250mg tablets can be dissolved in water and readily dissolve for patients with a gastric tube as enteral access nelfinavir can be crushed dissolved in water and administered via gastric tube after dissolving nelfinavir should be taken or administered immediately notably nelfinavir may have a bitter taste if mixed with acidic food or juice
82

 absorption of nelfinavir was found to result in less pharmacokinetic variability and higher nelfinavir levels when taken with food nelfinavir has a volume of distribution of 27 lkg and is highly protein bound more than 98
82

 interferons are endogenous signaling proteins released by host cells during response to infections or inflammation upregulation of ifns stimulates the immune system to blunt viral replication and eradicate offending pathogens
86
 two ifns mediate host immune responses  and  interferon elicits a potent hostmediated immune cell response that has generated interest in the treatment of viral diseases such as hepatitis b and c and various cancers such as melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia interferon has been primarily used in the treatment of the autoimmune condition multiple sclerosis
87
 these nonspecific immunomodulatory effects have gained attraction by investigators for other viral illnesses including covid19 during the 2002 sars outbreak it was observed that after viral inoculation sarscov was able to effectively evade upregulation of ifns in human macrophages this allowed for continued viral replication due to suppression of the innate immune response
87
 two ifn products are available  and  it is currently unknown whether both products would influence coronavirus disease expression interferon has the most studies related to its use thus far human data for the use of ifn for novel coronaviruses are sparse during the sars outbreak pegylated ifn was assessed in an in vitro analysis of macaque cells at different periods of sars exposure
88
 when used before sars inoculation ifn reduced viral replication and excretion however these results were not observed postsars exposure
88
 an in vitro analysis assessing ifn as monotherapy for mers demonstrated the serum concentrations required to effectively inhibit viral replication were higher than what can be safely achieved in humans
63
 nevertheless in vitro isolates of ifn or  as a multimodal regimen with ribavirin for sars displayed potent synergy against the virus
89
 
90
 in vivo studies have yet to be able to replica the same benefits with some studies showing no influence on the disease course for mers whereas others suggest a small improvement in survival at 14 days but not 28 days when used in combination with ribavirin
91
 
92
 these viruses may display different in vitro and in vivo susceptibilities than the current sarscov2 extrapolation to the current covid19 pandemic is difficult this has not dampened the potential application of this therapy and investigators await the results of ongoing studies assessing the efficacy of ifn2b as a part of combination therapy with ribavirin for covid19 to further elucidate any benefit from ifn treatment
93
 
94

 interferon2b also comes as a pegylated form to prolong its halflife from 46 hours to 2260 hours permitting a lower dosing frequency
87
 due to the lack of established human data with ifns for covid19 this therapy should only be considered for covid19 as a part of a clinical trial there is no established dosing regimen for ifn in the treatment of covid19 the only in vivo data are with ifn2a for the treatment of mers using a dose of 180 g per week for 2 weeks similar to hepatitis b virus
92
 there is no established dosing regimen for ifn in the treatment of covid19 the only study currently recruiting at the time of this publication is using ifn1b at a dose of 025 mg 8 million iu on day 1 3 and 5 in combination with other therapies ribavirin lpvr
93
 additional studies evaluating ifn1b are evaluating its utility as an inhaled therapy
94

 if used as a part of a trial there are key clinical considerations to consider for safe use the drug labeling provides a cautionary statement for use in childpugh class b or c
87
 renal elimination accounts for 30 of total clearance dose reductions required for patients with a clcr below 50 mlminute when ifn is used in combination with ribavirin for hepatitis c
87
 given that these agents are both under investigation for covid19 if used as a part of combination therapy the same precaution should be considered interferon therapies have an increased risk of adverse effects when used during renal replacement therapy thus caution is recommended in this population
95
 
96

 interferon does not pose a risk of drugdrug interactions through cyp enzyme pathways concomitant medications that enhance the myelosuppressive or hepatotoxic effects of ifn should be used sparingly
87

 interferons are associated with significant adverse reactions even when used as a shortterm therapy injection site reactions resulting in flulike symptoms fever myalgias and headaches occur within the first 28 hours after administration rotation of injection sites application of ice before and after application and premedication with acetaminophen can mitigate these reactions additional adverse reactions include leukopenia lymphopenia autoimmune hepatitis and thyroid disease patients exposed to ifns for currently approved indications can develop neutralizing antibodies that reduce the therapeutic efficacy of this agent the development of neuropsychiatric adverse effects is not expected to occur with shortterm use
97
 the safety of ifn in pregnancy has not been established
87

 interferon is available in injectable and inhaled formulations the current study is enrolling patients using 1b injected subcutaneously in the abdomen or thigh
93

 baricitinib is a janus kinase jak inhibitor originally developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis it is approved by the fda for moderate or severe active rheumatoid arthritis in patients who have not responded to one or more tumor necrosis factor antagonists baricitinib reversibly and selectively inhibits jak1 and jak2 with less inhibition of jak3 and tyrosine kinase inhibition of jak results in inability of signal transmission from cytokine or growth receptors resulting in decreased hematopoiesis and immune cell function
98
 this inhibition of signal transmission prevents phosphorylation and thus activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription baricitinib has a high affinity for associated protein kinase 1 aak1 binding and could prevent the intracellular passage of viral cells and development of viral particles
99

 covid19 may result in secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis shlh as a result of viral infection
100
 patients with covid19 have exhibited ferritin and inflammatory marker elevations similar to shlh including elevated interleukin il2 il7 granulocyte stimulating factor and tumor necrosis factor tnf evaluation of risk factors for mortality of covid19 cases in wuhan found ferritin and il6 levels to be higher in those who ultimately died versus survivors p0001
101
 considering the potential for increased lung injury with corticosteroid use in patients with covid19 and reported use of tocilizumab for covid19 jakstat inhibitors were theorized to have an effect on the hyperinflammatory state that occurs in covid19 baricitinib may also prevent endocytosis and viral infection by inhibiting aak1 activity baricitinib has not been studied in humans for covid19 baricitinib is typically dosed as 2 mgday by mouth for rheumatoid arthritis
98
 no data exist for treatment of covid19 however it is proposed that a 7 to 14day course would be needed
102
 dose adjustments are recommended for patients with lymphopenia neutropenia and anemia
98
 it is recommended to hold baricitinib in patients with an absolute lymphocyte count less than 500 cellsmm2 an absolute neutrophil count less than 1000 cellsmm2 and hemoglobin less than 8 gdl in patients with hepatic impairment baricitinib is not recommended dose adjustments are recommended with renal impairment for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate egfr less than 30 mlminute173 m2 it is recommended to hold baricitinib for patients with an egfr 3060 mlminute173 m2 it is recommended to decrease dose to 1 mg onceday there are no dosing recommendations for patients requiring crrt baricitinib reaches peak concentrations within 1 hour of oral administration with steady state achieved at 23 days
98
 baricitinib has an oral bioavailability of 80 and is not significantly impacted by taking with or without food the baricitinib volume of distribution is 76 l it is 50 bound to plasma proteins and 45 bound to serum proteins it is a substrate of pgp breast cancer resistance protein oat and multidrug and toxin extrusion protein transporters metabolism of baricitinib occurs mainly by cyp3a4 and elimination is 75 renal relevant drugdrug interactions with baricitinib include strong oat 3 inhibitors that may increase baricitinib exposure
98
 for patients concomitantly taking strong oat 3 inhibitors the recommended dose of baricitinib is 1 mg onceday several boxed warnings exist for baricitinib including risk of infection particularly upper respiratory tract infection malignancy and thrombosis
98
 of note these side effects were higher in patients receiving the 4mg dose of baricitinib that is not a recommended dose due to these safety concerns patients in clinical trials also experienced increased incidence of neutropenia platelet elevations aminotransferase elevations lipid elevations creatinine elevations creatine phosphokinase elevations and nausea monitoring for longterm treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is recommended with baseline complete blood counts including neutrophils liver function tests and lipids
98
 monitoring for signs and symptoms of infection while treating with baricitinib is recommended in addition to skin examinations in patients at an increased risk for skin cancer baricitinib is available as a filmcoated immediaterelease tablet for enteral administration
98
 it can be given with or without consideration of food no data are available regarding crushing baricitinib and administration via gastric feeding tubes although baricitinib is not on the niosh list of medications it is carcinogenic by virtue of the adverse effect profile and it may be treated as a hazardous drug tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody with fda approval for chimeric antigen receptor cart cellinduced cytokine release syndrome crs giant cell arteritis rheumatoid arthritis and polyarticular or systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis
103

 evolving data suggest patients with severe covid19 experience significant lung injury secondary to a surge of inflammatory cytokines resulting in a cytokine storm viral replication activates the innate immune system to secrete various signaling proteins such as ils that results in hyperinflammation and further lung damage interleukin6 is a key inflammatory protein involved in this pathway
100
 tocilizumab binds to il6 receptors thereby blunting cell signaling and effectively downregulating the excess inflammatory response
103

 the rationale for use of tocilizumab in covid19 stems from data discovered with sars and mers the sars patients were noted to have crs as a result of proinflammatory marker release including il6 and tnf
104
 patients with mers were discovered to have elevations of il6 il8 and il1
105
 the data from wuhan in critically ill patients with covid19 have also found increased levels of cytokines including il6 and granulocytecolony stimulating factor
8
 
106
lung tissue obtained postmortem from a patient with covid19 showed elevated inflammatory factors suggestive of a cytokine storm
107
 interleukin6 may be a key driver of the robust inflammatory response within the lungs of icu patients with covid19 recently published data from wuhan indicate that tocilizumab added to lopinavir methylprednisolone and oxygen therapy in 20 patients with severe covid19 resulted in rapid reductions in fever in all patients improvement in oxygenation for 75 and facilitated discharged from the hospital in 95 of patients
108
 additional studies are underway with tocilizumab combined with other antivirals or compared against renal replacement therapy for management of crs associated with covid19
109
 
110
 sarilumab another antiil6 antibody is currently under evaluation for the treatment of covid19 it will be studied against supportive care measures and provide enhanced insight into the utility of targeting this pathway
111

 tocilizumab for most indications is weight based with a maximum dose of 800 mg the dosing of tocilizumab for covid19 is not well established when used in a case series of patients with covid19 a onetime dose of intravenous tocilizumab 400 mg was administered
108
 
112
 for crs secondary to chimeric antigen receptor car tcell therapy three additional doses of tocilizumab can be given with at least 8 hours between each dose in the covid19 reports three patients received an additional dose of tocilizumab 12 hours later as a result of continued fevers
108

 tocilizumab auc varies based on body weight and the vd of intravenous tocilizumab at steady state is 64 l
103
 there are no published data regarding the use of tocilizumab 400 mg in obese patients with covid19 and whether the 400mg dose is adequate the halflife of tocilizumab is concentration dependent at 11 days when dosed 4 mgkg and 13 days when dosed 8 mgkg tocilizumab should be held when the absolute neutrophil count is 1000 cellsmm2 or below platelet count is 100000 cellsmm2 or below or liver enzymes are more than 35 times the upper limit of normal this is particularly relevant for the treatment of covid19 that was demonstrated to elevate liver enzymes in severe cases
113
 tocilizumab elimination is not influenced by renal dysfunction no dose adjustments are required in patients receiving tocilizumab for covid19 only one patient had a history of chronic kidney disease and no patients had reported hepatic impairment
108

 limited efficacy data with tocilizumab should be weighed against its significant cost and potential for toxicities secondary to interference with the host immune response infections ranging from bacterial viral and fungal sources may develop
103
 patients should be screened for active or latent tuberculosis infection before administering tocilizumab gastrointestinal perforation after the use of tocilizumab was reported in patients with a history of diverticulitis or receiving highdose corticosteroids
103
 infusion reactions causing hypertension headache and skin reactions within 24 hours of administration were reported after administration of tocilizumab
103

 tocilizumab is recommended to be administered intravenously over 1 hour
103
 
112
 tocilizumab should not be administered in the same line with other medications because it has not been studied for compatibility
103

 pertinent drugdrug interactions with tocilizumab may occur as a result of increased cyp450 enzyme activity in vitro studies reported that tocilizumab may increase cyp1a2 cyp2b6 cyp2c9 cyp2c19 cyp2d6 and cyp3a4 activity in vivo studies reported that tocilizumab may interact with simvastatin via increased activity of cyp3a4 resulting in decreased simvastatin exposure findings were also similar when omeprazole and tocilizumab were combined resulting in decreased omeprazole auc through increased cyp19 activity passive immunity delivered as anticoronavirus antibodies from convalescent human plasma may offer a novel therapeutic approach for covid19 the proposed mechanism of benefit from convalescent human plasma derived from survivors of the coronavirus is the transfer of passive immunity in an effort to restore the immune system during critical illness and neutralize the virus to suppress viremia
114
 the main driver for the investigation of convalescent human blood products in the treatment of covid19 originated from its use in the h1n1 pandemic during which patients derived a clinically significant mortality benefit and improved viral clearance from convalescent blood products
115

 in a retrospective review of 40 patients with sars who failed treatment with methylprednisolone and ribavirin at 3 days 74 19 of patients who received convalescent plasma were discharged by day 22 compared with only 19 21 of patients who received highdose corticosteroids p0001 five deaths were reported in the steroid group compared with no deaths with convalescent plasma to obtain the greatest benefit from convalescent plasma treatment should be used early in the course of disease before day 16 because viremia from sars was shown to peak in the first week of treatment followed by a primary immune response by days 10 to 14
116
 preliminary data from ongoing convalescent plasma therapy data in the covid19 outbreak suggest improvement in clinical symptoms with no signal of adverse effects
117

 targeted antisarscov2 antibodies that allow for a more selective therapy against coronavirus are in development and some companies have begun active recruitment for investigation into its clinical efficacy and safety treatment of covid19
118
 takeda pharmaceutical has announced investigation into a new plasmaderived therapy coined tak888 this plasmaderived therapy involves removing plasma from covid19 survivors extracting coronavirusspecific antibodies to administer to infected patients to stimulate a potent immune response against sarscov2 convalescent therapy remains in the experimental phase but appears it may favorably influence the treatment course and enrollment of patients into a clinical trial will aid in defining its role in therapy given lack of efficacy and risk of delayed viral clearance the world health organization consensus document on the management of covid19 strongly recommends against the use of corticosteroids unless alternative indications are present acute lung injury and respiratory distress syndrome secondary to systemic inflammation are wellcharacterized sequelae of sars and mers outbreaks with pulmonary histology demonstrating evidence of inflammation and diffuse alveolar damage
119
 corticosteroids were proposed to be of benefit in suppression of lung inflammation in mers and sars due to their immunomodulatory properties however clinical data are now clear that patients derive no benefit from corticosteroids in the management of sars mers or covid19 but have instead demonstrated evidence of increased risk of harm including prolonged mechanical ventilation avascular necrosis delayed viral clearance and secondary infections
120
 
121

 a retrospective observational study of critically ill patients with mers who received hydrocortisone 300 mg per day did not find a 90day mortality benefit adjusted odds ratio 08 95 confidence interval ci 0511 p012 but did find delayed viral clearance adjusted hr 04 95 ci 0207 p00005
122
 the lack of survival benefit was further supported by a systematic review of corticosteroids in patients with sars but showed an increased risk of psychosis avascular necrosis prolonged viremia and hyperglycemia with corticosteroid treatment
120
 although severe potentially lifethreatening ards can occur generalizing the evidence for corticosteroids to the covid19associated ards is problematic and fails to account for the differing pathogenesis of viralinduced lung injury
121

 corticosteroids should only be considered if required for an alternative indication ie septic shock bronchoconstriction despite the lack of benefit defined in previous trials a clinical trial is actively recruiting to assess the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone 1 mgkgday for a duration of 7 days in noncritically ill patients to further identify the risks and benefits of therapy
123

 in addition to the drug therapies previously discussed several additional drugs are being evaluated as potential therapies for covid19 in clinical trials arbidol a drug used in russia and china for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza and respiratory viral infections works by blocking viral fusion to the target cell membrane and has demonstrated activity against several viruses including sars
124
 arbidol is currently being evaluated for the treatment of covid19 in several studies in china and is currently a recommended treatment option for covid19 there arbidol is not available in the united states favipiravir a drug licensed in japan for the treatment of influenza is another potential agent due to its activity against a wide spectrum of rna viruses including coronaviruses
125
 several studies are underway evaluating favipiravir for the treatment of covid19 other antiviral agents being evaluated in china for the treatment of covid19 include antiretroviral agents darunavircobicistat and emtricitabinetenofovir alafenamide as well as the influenza drug baloxavir finally oseltamivir a neuraminidase inhibitor used for treatment of influenza is also being studied for treatment of covid19 however oseltamivir is unlikely to be active against sarscov2 based on previous studies with sarscov
61

 drugs to decrease the inflammation associated with covid19 are also being evaluated one of these drugs is thalidomide that may decrease inflammation through its antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory effects
126

 the covid19 pandemic has presented an enormous global health crisis the pharmaceutical industry is working to develop novel treatments targeted at sarscov2 in the meantime the medical community is trialing a variety of therapies that target different antiviral and immunomodulating mechanisms to combat this virus some of the drugs are investigational and some are old drugs being repurposed for a new pathogen as we gain more information both about the effectiveness of the drugs against sarscov2 and their pharmacokinetics especially in the complex setting of critical illness we will be better equipped to optimize therapeutic strategies  ncov-19 peptides mass fingerprinting identification binding and blocking of inhibitors flavonoids and anthraquinone of moringa oleifera and

et al 2020 ace2 is the essential receptor that interacts with spike protein on the host cell membrane hasan et al 2020 the common signs and symptoms of coronavirus include fever trouble coughing difficulty in breathing pyrexia potentially lethal pneumonia more severe types of kidney failure fatigue diarrhea rhinorrhea vomiting and nausea senior citizens are prone to be infected by this disease chen et al 2020 gyebi et al 2020 kumar et al 2020 lobo-galo et al 2020 in this study the peptide mass fingerprinting pmf technique was conducted on sars-cov-2 peptide mass fingerprinting is one of the significant methods used to identify peptides especially through the deployment of molecular masses of peptides pmf is chosen on the basis of simple and most effective process for the detection of peptides with specific masses and is one of the key technologies driving the growth of proteomics henzel et al 2003 in this technique first the protein of interest is digested into small fragments called peptide with the aid of endonucleases typically trypsin owing to its satisfactory and magnificent characteristics matthiesen 2013 second the mass spectroscopy analysis is performed to test the precise mass of the peptides and this step gives the catalog of the peak inventory of such identified peptides third this number of peak list associated with the abstract number of peaks obtained by in-silico digestion using various databases then the computer software identifies the protein by creating the leading match for it one of the key advantages of the pmf is that it does not rely on protein sequencing for protein identification and is very simple to do liebler 2016 medicinal plants are commonly used for the treatment of bacterial and noninfectious diseases and disorders emerging infectious diseases present a relentless danger to human life aanouz et al 2020 shinwari et al 2020 so we selected a medicinal plant and a drug to check its activity against covid-19 the medicinal plant moringa oleifera is extremely nutritional and serves as an antiretroviral lead molecule to improve the activity of immune-system with antipyretic antiulcer antispasmodic antiulcer antibacterial antioxidant antihypertensive cardiac and circulatory analeptic properties moringa oleifera is often known to be a miracle tree because of its strong immune-boosting and antimicrobial characteristics categorize in the family of moringacae busani et al 2011 kini et al 2017 by phytochemical screening and extraction of m oleifera shows the presence of alkaloids saponins tannins glycosides carbohydrates flavonoids resins acidic compounds and proteins in various parts of plant in specific seeds leaves fruits flowers barks and unripe pods kini et al 2017 shinwari et al 2020 flavonoids often have an inhibitory effect against viruses especially a respiratory syncytial virus das et al 2020 many of the works reveals that m oleifera derived gist inhibits initiation of the viral replication cycle shinwari et al 2020 the presence of phytochemical anthraquinone in moringa oleifera extract serves as an antiviral and antifungal agent to rehabilitate minor diseases found in many plants kasolo et al 2010 this compound exhibits the antiviral properties towards the human cytomegalovirus hcmv strain and displays the inhibitory effects against the polioviruses it also indicate a strong degree of antiviral activity towards hiv-1 barnard et al 1992 schinazi et al 1990 semple et al 2001 in moringa oleifera both the ethanolic and aqueous extracts are rich in flavonoids 383  002 356  003 and anthraquinone 1086  006 1168  004 respectively nkechinyere onyekwere  felix 2014 moringa oleifera is chosen due to these essential antiviral components which have demonstrated significant antiviral activity against viral diseases though the hydroxychloroquine hcq a derivative of chloroquine prescribed for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and anti-inflammatory agents is virulent than chloroquine hcq is also included in the triallist to treat covid-19 liu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 there is theoretical experimental preclinical and clinical evidence of the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in patients affected with covid-19 the hydroxychloroquine works by suppressing lysosomes and reducing various cell functions of immune cells thats why it is used in rheumatologic conditions and its anti-inflammatory effects many in vitro studies confirm that hydroxychloroquine is more potent in inhibiting sars cov-2 schrezenmeier  drner 2020 yao et al 2020 in computer-aided drug designing and structural molecular biology a key tool in molecular docking it aims to identify the major binding modes of a ligand docking is important for broader libraries of compounds for virtual screening barnard et al 1992 elmezayen et al 2020 muralidharan et al 2020 autodock vina is an effective readily available molecular docking technique that is recognized for its successful usage in research analysis and drug discovery forli et al 2016 it is considered as a standardized system that uses a highly structured method from its local optimization from its local optimization mechanism with a single assessment trott and olson 2010 it acquires systematize files for ligand and receptor then test and offers optimal dock conformities with well-tested default procedures this is commonly used in various aspects primarily virtual screening forli et al 2016 in our study by using the mass fingerprinting technique we use moringa oleifera as an effective inhibitor against ncov-2019 the extract of this medicinal plant will improve the immune system to produce antibodies against sars-cov-2 figure 1 the whole genome sequence of novel coronavirus was obtained through ncbi httpswwwncbinlmnihgov with accession no mn9089473 29903bp in length and described as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 originated from wuhan-hu-1 on 18 march 2020 kruse 2020 the obtained sequence of sars-cov-2 was translated into protein for the identification of peptides the translation was done by embl emboss transeq httpwwwebiacuk it translates the nucleotide sequence into an amino acid sequence it gives three forward and three reverse frames this may also result in multiple outputs at once rice et al 2000 the protein sequence was digested by protein prospector baker et al 2008 and the mass of peptide was calculated from online bioinformatics tool peptidemass httpwebexpasyorgpeptidemass the purpose of peptidemass tool is to help peptide-mapping experiments culminating in the analysis of peptide-mass fingerprinting pmf and mass-spectrometry data wilkins et al 1999 trypsin was used to cut the protein sequence in order to estimate the number of peptide masses and mass to charge ratio of protein gundry et al 2010 the peak list of peptides was generated by mass to charge ratio of protein from protein mass calculations the homology modeling of the identified peak list was conducted by the mascot server tsugita et al 2000 this server determines the active peptides by comparing the calculated peak lists with already existing masses of peptides in the database resulting in the active peptides with additional information the peptides structures were predicted through the pep-fold3 server which is a de novo approach for peptide prediction it predicts the structure of peptides having a sequence between 5 and 50 amino acids pep-fold3 is quicker and gives results in a few minutes lamiable et al 2016 the selected active peptides of sars-cov2 were docked with selected three antiviral activity containing compounds to check their efficacy against sars-cov-2 flavonoids and anthraquinone are the phytochemical extracts of moringa oleifera which contain antiviral properties shinwari et al 2020 and hydroxychloroquine which is the derivative of chloroquine and is used to treat autoimmune diseases liu et al 2020 the compounds were tested for lipinski rule of 5 by acdi lab while their toxicity was checked by the protox server drwal et al 2014 masunov 2001 resultant docked complexes were analyzed and visualized through pymol and biovia discovery studio 2016 to check and compare the accurate binding of different antiviral compounds that provide a three-dimensional 3d platform for the visualization of the results such technologies are developed to facilitate the study and simulation of the docked complexes in drug designing phase gusman  shoemake 2017 yuan et al 2017 the complete genome of sars-cov-2 was downloaded up to 30 kb in size from ncbi the length of the sequence was enough so we do not need to split the sequence into fragments as for peptide mass fingerprinting this nucleotides sequence was then forwarded for further analysis sars-cov-2 sequence was translated into an amino acid sequence to accomplish the targeted goal and calculate its peptide masses we use the emboss transeq server to translate the ncov-2019 genome sequence for every possible outcome we selected the whole amino acid sequence to calculate the peptide masses the protein structure of the translated amino acid sequence is shown in figure 2 the in silico based peptide mass calculation produced up to 45 decimals masses of peptides for all amino acids sequences based on enzyme digestion average monoisotopic and isotopic mass values were also given for these modifications peptide mass online server is used to identify peptide masses we have digested the amino acid sequence of sars-cov2 in silico with trypsin and selected some online parameters a threshold value as the resultant peptide must be greater than 500 daltons peptides below this threshold may be too small to visualize in a mass spectrum and we also allow 1 missed cleavage and then generated the masses of peptides peptide mass also results in masses values of concerned protein and theoretical points protein prospector was also used for cross validation in the results 997 of the sequence was covered the estimated masses of sars-cov-2 peptides and overall in silico fragmentation of the protein sequence are shown in table 1 we searched the mascot database against the peptides obtained from digestion the peak list is needed for peptide mass fingerprint the peak list was created by translating the raw file to peak list through peaking or peak detection the mascot server is used for peptide mass fingerprinting it is an important tool to use mass spectrometry data for peptide identification several other programs are similar to mascot but it is unique since it integrates all the validated searching methods damodaran et al 2007 as ncov-2019 is a viral disease we selected the whole taxonomy of viruses to be looked for in mascot with cleavage enzyme trypsin and missed cleavage 1 which implies that it will allow up to 1 mutation in related peptides the peak list was entered as a peptide mass fingerprinting data file we picked swissprot for the search database because it is nonredundant and fairly small helpful for statistically meaningful matches bairoch and apweiler 2000 in the homology search results we found three most substantial matches by a significant threshold p-value of less than 005 with the highest score of 93 two of them match with the sars coronavirus maier et al 2015 while the other one belongs to pseudomonas phage b3 a brief description is shown in table 2 mascot database identifies the viruses and proteins which contain the matched peptides sequences along with complete annotation we screened the highest scored matched peptides as shown in table 3 as we have to predict the structures of identified peptides because the 3d structure determines their function stryer nd so we predicted the peptide structures for each matched peptide sequence from the de novo peptide predicting approach pep-fold 3 online server was used for this purpose lamiable et al 2016 the 3d structures of identified peptides are given in table 4 with the peptide sequence and missed cleavages the identified peptide structures of sars-cov-2 peptides were bound with a drug and a medicinal compound before binding it was important to test if the compounds are valid or not so for this purpose the properties of the compounds were checked by acdi labs and protox server lipinski rules were identified by acdi labs for either less or no adverse effects gupta et al 2020 hamza et al 2019 and it consists of 5 properties molecular weight should be less than 500 da hydrogen bond acceptor hba 10 hydrogen bond donor 5 topological polar surface area tpsa  140 and logp  5 while the toxicity was predicted by the protox web server this includes the details of both chemical and molecular targets according to the globally harmonized system ghs toxicity has been classified into six classes on the scale class vi is non-toxic class v is moderate class iv is less toxic class iii is toxic while class ii and i are fatal hamza et al 2019 all the three selected compounds fulfill the lipinski rules and lie in the safe zone of toxicity as shown in table 5 the ability of the protein to bind a drug-like molecule with high affinity is considered as the druggability of protein the pocket druggability of the selected peptide was predicted through the pockdrug server providing consistent druggability results with several estimation methods hussein et al 2015 the selected peptide gvithdvssainrpqigvvrefltr for docking was chosen and the pocket of peptide is shown in figure 3 autodock vina was used to bind the sars-cov-2 peptides to our chosen antiviral compounds autodock vina is an open-source and free for its users chang et al 2010 jaghoori et al 2016 yang  sharp 2006 autodock vina input requires pdbqt files of both ligand and receptor while it outputs a poses list ranking by g in kcalmol the binding energy for the maximum number of poses output the nummodes were set to 20 while the energy range to 10 the best poses were screened using rmsd values ranging from 0  15 first of all we prepared our peptide gvithdvssainrpqigvvrefltr for docking receptor was saved as macromolecule in the pdbqt file then by default the grid options xyz dimensions to 26 and spacing angstrom  1 to cover the maximum area of a peptide were set second ligand compounds were prepared by adding torsions  6 and saved in the pdbqt file in the configuration file we selected the exhaustiveness  8 and performed further simulations of docking the best poses obtained from molecular docking are shown in figures 24 along with interacting residues with peptides position the energies obtained from autodock vina for hydroxychloroquine was 51 kcalmol kaempferol flavonoid 62 kcalmol and anthraquinone 60 kcalmol figures 24 shows the visualization of the drug complex visualized through pymol and discovery studio the drug compounds accurately fit into the hydrophobic surface of peptides that ensure the optimal attachment of drug compounds to the target peptides in the figures 2d structures of drug compounds shows different types of bonding with receptor molecules it does not produce any unfavorable bumps that can affect the nature of bonding so from the aforementioned findings it is confirmed that the chosen antiviral compounds are effective inhibitors against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and can help the immune system to fight against covid-19 figures 5 and 6 since peptides are shorter in length and could be embedded in the full-length protein a question arises that whether the ligand compound can meet the target peptide for binding mechanism but the surface was exposed to the chosen binding and can easily be accessed by a ligand compound successfully results in a docked complex the selected peptide is modeled as yellow color in figures 7 and 8 in this research work the viral peptides of sars-cov-2 were identified through peptide mass fingerprinting technique this approach involves the mass calculation of protein translated from the whole genome of sars-cov-2 these masses were searched against databases for the identification of viral peptides fifteen viral peptides were identified for which the 3d structures were predicted in this study three compounds hydroxychloroquine kaempferol and anthraquinone were chosen on the basis of their antiviral properties which could bind to the target and were nontoxic for molecular docking of viral peptides and antiviral compounds autodock vina was used for molecular docking of viral peptides and anti-viral compounds because it is more accurate and reliable than other online servers or techniques autodock vina conforms to the ligand rotational and conformational shifts and results in the optimum poses of the compounds the chosen compounds provided strongest interaction with peptides in future it is suggested that these compounds should be considered and clinically tested for new effective antiviral compounds against covid-19
