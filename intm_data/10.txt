on 20th january 2020 epidemiologists at the chinese centre for disease control and
prevention published an article stating that the first cluster of patients with
pneumonia of an unknown cause had been identified on 21st december
2019 in wuhan  bfpg 2020 a city with a
population of more than 11 million following this announcements were made -- that
thousands of cases were identified in china and substantial numbers of cases were
broadcasted in many countries around the world on 30th january whos
director-general declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of
international concern  who 2020 given
that thousands of cases have been reported reaching all corners of the world in one
month this declaration was coupled with a number of recommendations related to
early detection of infection isolating and treating infected cases contact tracing
and social distancing measures that correspond to the level of risk in each country
with a key objective to interrupt or delay and hopefully limit the virus spreadwithin the united kingdom public health england announced it is moving the risk
level to the british public from very low to low on
22nd january this is also when first two patients in the uk tested positive for
coronavirus after two chinese nationals from the same family staying at a hotel in
york fell ill a plane clearing britons from wuhan and evacuees went into a 14-day
quarantine at a specialist hospital in merseyside  bfpg 2020 after confirming the first transmission of
disease within the uk the government decided not to follow italy and china where
the highest figures of infection and death were recorded the lockdown approach that
imposes restrictions on liberty and movement was not favoured by the government
instead throughout february 2020 the government advised a range of voluntary
restrictions such as social distancing and if any symptoms are
exhibited self-isolation and quarantine on the 5th march infected cases were
reported in all areas of the uk 105 in england six in scotland three in wales
and one in northern ireland  bbc
2020by the third week of march the prime minister announced a further set of measures as
part of a nationwide lockdown  beadsworth
2020 this was due to the continuous increase in infected and death
cases which reached according to public health england a total of 14543 cases
and 759 deaths on 27th march  phe 2020
the virus is highly infectious and at the time of writing this article there is no
known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for covid-19 disease despite claims
by various governments that a vaccine or treatment is being developed the key
measure of the global public health campaign in response to the pandemic is social
distancing which in essence is avoiding face contact and encouraging physical
distancingthe significant contributions to stop and treat viruses and associated diseases fall
within various academic disciplines and professions most important medical
scientists biologists and public health researchers are the key contributors to a
pandemic of this nature and scale they conduct laboratory research to understand
the attributes of the virus and the characteristics of the family of viruses it
belongs to they experiment develop test and advance vaccines for mass use and
eventually identify effective treatments professionals and scholars from other
disciplines are also contributors such as mathematicians and computer scientists
whose work through modelling techniques enable an effective understanding of
global patterns of virus spread and mortality rates social and behavioural
scientists contribute to the development of policies in the sense that they enable
institutions and organisations to identify risks and manage responses as they relate
to their employees and communities while addressing issues related to anxiety
loneliness and mental healtharchitecture and urbanism as academic disciplines and professions that influence in
many different ways individuals communities and societies can support efforts
through developing new insights into the impact of a pandemic on cities and urban
environments now and in the future developing new understandings relevant to the
characteristics of urban spaces which ensue from these insights conducting research
to comprehend the socio-spatial implications of covid-19 measures and guidelines
introduced by governments and authorities to fight the spread of the disease
identifying new conceptions related to emerging lifestyles which stem from the new
spatial environments that integrate working and living patterns and ultimately
developing design responses towards creating healthy environments that successfully
accommodate the infected populations while addressing the associated social and
psychological ramificationsat the time of writing this article there is no sufficient or available empirical
research conducted to address to the preceding areas of potential contributions both
at the architectural building and urban city scales this article nonetheless
aims to interrogate these areas by instigating important questions while striving to
generate responses through conceptualisation operationalization and referencing
the available literature the fundamental aim is to underscore relevant factors
originate insights of potential use to policy makers architects and planners
highlight areas where future research will be critically needed and emphasise the
positive role architecture and urban design and planning fields can play in
developing healthy environments in a globally virtual worldsocial distancing measures are a vital part of mitigating pandemics they complement
other measures in decreasing the prospect of the spread of disease the current body
of knowledge points out that social distancing is not a new measure to mitigate the
spread but has been introduced and practiced during the past several decades
researchers have developed important evidence on the potential impact of social
distancing arguing that it is moderately effective  ahmppi 2019 therefore where socio-economic impacts are
insignificant social distancing has been viewed at least as an acceptable
temporary measure while referred to as physical distancing in many writings social
distancing is a set of infection control actions envisioned to slow down or delay
and eventually stop the spread of an infectious disease  harris et al 2020 it aims to reduce the
likelihood of contact between persons carrying an infection and others who are not
infected so as to reduce virus transmission sickness and minimise mortality 
hensley 2020despite the suggestion made by ahmppi
2019 there appears to be growing evidence of the effectiveness of social
distancing when infection is transmitted through droplet contact which may result
from all forms of physical contact between people and contact with contaminated
surfaces and fabrics it is also effective when transmission is airborne where the
virus can survive in the air for a period of time there is no clear evidence
however that social distancing is effective when infection is transmitted through
contact with water food or through insectssocial distancing measures were introduced by the world health organization in
response to the initially gradual and then exponentially global spread of
coronavirus the measures were generic in nature and were subject to various
interpretations of governments in the global north and the global south so they can
respond to the level of risk in each country or even residential neighbourhood or
locality these interpretations range from flexible or minor social distancing
measures to lockdown or in some countries various types of curfews during defined
timeframes within the day or the weekmeasures of social distancing are practiced at both institutional and individual
levels at an institutional level there is common agreement on what social
distancing entails as evidenced in government documents of countries around the
world  phe 2020 pancap 2020 in this context the key elements are school
closure workplace closure and cancellation of mass gatherings this is further
expanded to include closure of small businesses restaurants cinemas theatres
bars pubs and clubs according to phe
2020 at an individual level social distancing entails reducing or
minimising interaction between people and involves a avoidance of non-essential
use of public transport especially during rush hours b working from home where
possible with regulations set for employers to support this c avoidance of contact
with someone who is displaying symptoms of coronavirus covid-19 which include
high temperature andor new and continuous cough d avoidance of large gatherings
and gatherings in smaller public spaces and e avoidance of gatherings with friends
and family with recommendations to use distance technology including phone
internet and social mediastrikingly many social media posts online newspapers portals and discussion
boards and academic platforms are now introducing and discussing the notion of the
new normal portraying this as a new paradigm which will involve
many new realities and intensive online activities that range from retail and
shopping to banking and higher education prevision to name a few it is argued
social distancing is here to stay for much more than a few weeks it will
upend our way of life in some ways forever  lichfield 2020 there is strong evidence that there is now
a high degree of acceptability among governments institutions organisations and
universities that contemporary societies are approaching a new era characterised by
intensive digitalvirtual practices to which the way of life must be adapted in
particular and in the immediate future until it becomes actually
normal there is a general appreciation that such a new normal will have
negative consequences which include loneliness reduced productivity unhealthy
sleeping and eating habits potential obesity and loss of various benefits
associated with reduced human-human and human-environment interactionswith social distancing measures the remarkable shift from the physical to the
virtual and the acceptance of this there are many social and spatial implications
that architects planners and built environment professionals would be keen to
examine in this respect key questions arise to address various scales and scopes
and can be outlined as followsthe preceding questions do not cover the entire spectrum of issues and potential
impacts arising from social distancing and the new normal for example issues
associated with risk management construction processes and practice management are
not included yet the questions cover some fundamentals that are believed to be of
interest to the global community of architects and urban designers and planners and
that are predicted to generate new conceptions develop new insights and eventually
inform new thinking about the future of architecture and urbanism this would also
instigate a discourse on role of architecture and urbanism in developing healthy
environments and supporting emerging lifestyles in a post pandemic virtual eraanswering complex questions like the ones presented in the preceding section requires
responses underpinned by a commitment to trans-disciplinarity it should be seen as
a form of research involving co-operation among different parts of society
professionals and academia  dunnin-woyseth
 nielsen 2004 pohl  hirsch
hadorn 2008 in order to meet complex challenges in the context of
covid-19 spread and the resulting new normal and eventually the actual normal
therefore trans-disciplinarity is about blurring then transcending the boundaries
of different disciplines starting from tangible real-world problems knowledge is
developed produced and reproduced based on a collaboration of people from different
disciplinary backgrounds  doucet  janssens
2011 its hybrid nature and non-linearity enables it to transcend and
indeed incorporate any academic disciplinary structure adopting trans-disciplinary
thinking at conceptual and critical analysis levels a framework is developed
through which responses to the questions are based on operationalization of concepts
and theories derived from various disciplines as they relate to architecture and
urbanism  figure 1 outlined as followswhile the discussion does not fully address every single discipline shown in the
diagram all the perspectives and dimensions discussed have to do with researching
and designing built environmentsit is argued that infectious disease has a direct relationship with urban
development and would result in significant impact on our understanding of
urbanism hang 2020 suggests that
the increasing density of cities has generated conditions for the rapid spread
of viruses by comparing the spread of sars-cov in 2003 and sars-cov-2 in
201920 it is evident that population density has a direct impact on the rapid
spread in the case of sars-cov within china more than 5000 people were
infected and more than 300 died over a period of eight months yet in the case
of sars-cov-2 more than 4000 people were infected over a period of seven weeks
this could be attributed to the fact that chinese cities have developed into
both dense and sprawling urban areas with higher population density resulting
from migration from rural to urban areas klaus 2020 interviewed michele acuto professor of global urban
politics in the school of design at the university of melbourne and the
question of density and density management were central to the discussion and
were portrayed as the  long term survival in a pandemic
world klaus
2020 supports this view and argues  part of the
history of urbanization is building and managing your way out of infectious
diseases such as cholera outbreaks in the middle of the 19th
century
badger 2020 adopts an opposing view
and argues that high density is not necessarily a public health issue she
evidences this by putting the case of singapore and hong kong as urban
environments that are dense or denser than new york and how they were able to
develop early testing and extensive tracing of coronavirus cases rather than
extensive isolation she advocates density for the multiple benefits it brings
to cities unique cultural richness these include facilitating mass
transportation creating walkable environments enabling the masses to enjoy
public spaces supporting childrens needs through urban parks and
playgrounds limiting climate emissions supporting personal and public safety
to name a few it is increasingly acknowledged following sennett 2016 and shenker 2020 that the future of cities will involve a renewed
focus on developing architectural and urban solutions that enable people to
socialise without higher densities and sardines-like
packingthe work of keil et al
2020 suggests that there is a close relationship between urban
development and new or re-emerging contagious diseases rapid means of
transportation the continuous expansion of urban sprawl and connectivity
between urban life and nature are factors that contribute to such a spread from
urban peripheries to urban centres however patterns of disease emergence and
spread within urbanisation would require in-depth empirical modelling and
investigations of historical cases and juxtaposing these with the case of
coronavirus spreadthe persistent question that urban design and planning experts will face in the
future is about balancing conflicting value on the one hand densification and
making cities more compact and concentrated for the environmentally and socially
sustainable benefits compactness is viewed to bring on the other hand
compartmentalisation and separation of populations through various measures
including social distancing as a key tool being used to delay or stop virus
spread while compactness and density are important determinants for successful
urban environments in cultural social and environmental terms current
discussions suggest that the future development of cities will witness
encounters between contested requisites including public health climate and
socio-economic dynamicsin meeting the challenge of the covid-19 spread cities are adopting various
strategies at a large scale while cities are at the forefront of the response
to the pandemic they will likely see enduring transformation and permanent
changes while it is argued that cities and urbanism have been shaped by
contagious disease for centuries the global nature of covid-19 is anticipated
to bring significant changes to policies and the associated institutional and
individual behaviours in essence these changes while they have already
started to alter the way people live and work will alter how cities are planned
and managed for decades to come null 
smith 2020 identified a number of areas that delineate various
strategies restricting access to travel and questing for alternatives to public
transitlocally and globally measures for limiting travel are most apparent in the sense
of how cities are now operating in a short period of time travel restrictions
among other measures have had negative impacts including destroyed economies
unemployment and a dramatic reduction in industrial production however some
positive impacts are also witnessed in terms of a reduction in air pollution and
carbon emissions in the cases of italy and china nasa satellite data
illustrate significant changes in air pollution levels  nasa 2020 and a 25 drop in carbon emissions as
lockdown and restrictions started to show results  null  smith 2020coupled with the reduction in train and bus operations in many cities around the
world local and global travel restrictions are expected to have significant
implications on the what and how of urban planning in the future given the
established correlations between morality rates and urban air pollution with
positive impacts on the health of urban societies however these will need to
be balanced in the context of climate change and sustainability if the city is
expanded rather than compacted this must be associated with better connectivity
through alternative forms of public transport as people avoid crowds and
movement is restricted reports suggest that public transit use has taken a
sharp decline  hawkins 2020 moovit 2020 nuki 2020 the planning of future cities would be
derived from enhanced policies that further support cycling and walkingcontagious disease outbreaks are indeed global incidents as evident in the
spread of coronavirus from wuhan to various cities around the world lockdown
and quarantining of many mega and global cities is impacting the global
condition at various scales including globalised urban lifestyles the rapid
spread of disease takes place through infrastructures of globalisation which
includes global air travel links keil
et al 2020 argue that airports are often
located at the peripheries of cities and urban areas and this raises questions
about responsibility and accountability in terms of managing disease spread to
the wider urban regions in 2003 sars impacted global centres of trade and
commerce including beijing hong kong singapore and toronto however covid-19
has severely impacted global cities in the global north such as london and new
york and global infrastructure such as airport hubs aviation networks and
places of industrial productionan interesting phenomenon emerges out of the current discussion of the threat of
covid-19 there is a heavy focus on discussing repercussions of spread in
universal terms and this reinforces existing inequalities  wilkinson 2020 in particular
informal settlements and slums in the global south and the associated urban
poverty do not seem to have enjoyed a sufficient share within current
discussions and media reports this could be attributed to the fact that these
settlements are already on the margin and that communities are already
underrepresented where crises are the norm and thus there is nothing new
despite the significant lack of information there is a risk that infection
rates and transmission will be significantly higher than in planned cities and
urban areas to alleviate the negative consequences of these and introduce
positive interventions in informal settlements in the long term architects and
planners would need to establish new lenses through which they can comprehend
health and living conditions that generate relevant intervention strategiesgeographical locations refer to the key places and areas that influence
peoples perception of the city such as living working shopping and
entertainment places or destinations derived from the theory of territoriality
home zone and home range are constructs that
represent areas which influence peoples mental image of important
geographical locations establishing links between the physical environment and
social behaviour theorists and researchers have examined these insights in
various contexts  abdel-hadi et
al 2011 altman
1975 rapoport 2005 salama et al 2013 in
this respect it is important to discern how these constructs can be
differentiated home zone signifies an environment with minor or no requirement
for transportation this includes locales that are accessed effortlessly through
walking thereby stimulating a sense of ownership and belonging among the
residents within these locales irrespective of scale and size home range
denotes a more inclusive mental image of the entire residential environment
placing emphasis on the perceived geographical boundary such as that of
residential neighbourhood or clusters of housing developmentswithin urban design and planning disciplines a city is perceived as a fluid
dynamic system which involves material and non-material inputs and outputs that
flow in out and within this relates to the notion of geographical locations
and represents at a larger scale a process of movement and mobility within the
city and beyond in historical writings  burgess 1925 sorokin
1927 and contemporary debates  geyer  kontuly 1996 movement and urban mobility have been
discussed from various perspectives in the past the focus was on social and
behavioural factors recently however the notion of networks the spatial
structure and the peoples perception of both were introducedunderstanding urban mobility or movement patterns within the city will be crucial
to conceiving interaction measures between geographical locations within the
spatial structure urban networks and the associated operational requirements
the distribution of functions and uses peoples movement patterns and
the rhythm of commuting between geographical locations within the city will all
constitute important design and planning criteria that carefully consider health
and the potential spread of disease within the citys urban structure
acting as imperatives these considerations will enable lessening or
eliminating the spread of viruses to various geographical locations from the
urban peripheries and around airports to urban cores or residential
neighbourhoods this incudes in depth modelling of how far from and how long it
takes to commute to the city core from living areas to work areas public
places entertainment places and within residential neighbourhoods such
modelling should also embed user types and age ranges with a focus on
vulnerable groupssince social distancing measures are currently planned to last at least six
months it is believed that they will have various forms of impacts on both
urban researchers and the public concepts and theories related to place
attachment personal space and relationships between individuals and groups as
well as proximity to nature will need to be revisitedplace attachment is highly influenced by an individual and his or her personal
experiences  rollero  de piccoli
2010 it is multi-dimensional and cannot be explained through a
cause and effect relationship since it depends on a reciprocal relationship
between human behaviour and past and current experiences  giuliani 2016 scannell  gifford 2010 in essence it relates to affect
cognition and behaviour places of attachment include the home neighbourhood
urban settings and natural landscapes attachment to these places is typically
measured through many qualities depending on the typology and use of place
these qualities include aesthetics heritage family connection recreation
therapeutic biological diversity wilderness home intrinsic spiritual
economic life-sustaining learning and future post pandemic place attachment
conception would involve reweighing many of these qualities with more emphasis
placed upon on qualities related to healthy hygienic sanitised and healing
environments this may also lead to the rise of disaster psychology which aims
to examine the relationship between a city urban area or neighbourhood and
their inhabitants attitudes and emotions in the context of detrimental
incidents such as coronavirus spread and an increasing sense of personal safety
and healththe established canons of personal space and proximity relationships introduced
in the mid 1960s  hall 1966 and
hall  hall 1966 are
critical to grasp in the context of social distancing measures personal space
determines how people relate socially and psychologically and can be represented
by an area bubble with an invisible boundary surrounding the persons
body into which intruders may not come such a bubble is carried everywhere one
goes based on intensive empirical studies hall 1966 explained the relative distances between people
depending on the relationships they have and classified them in four discrete
distance ranges intimate distance 1 to 46 cm personal distance 46 to 122
cm social distance 12 to 37 m and public distance 37 to 76 m and
more with social distancing measures and the minimum allowance of 2 meters
personal distance the relative distance ranges would entirely change
especially if social distancing measures are viewed in the future as accepted
standardscurrently there is a growing interest in designing healing environments ryan et al 2014
argues that the surge of interest in creating spaces and places that support
health and wellbeing is viewed as a renaissance in design thinking and the way
in which buildings and cities are designed and built salingaros 2015 contends that biophilic design
effectively eliminates stress and anxiety from the built environment and is
achieved by maintaining thoughtful engagement with nature recently researchers
have been investigating the syntactic relationships between people and nature 
asfour 2019 rice 2019 to 
grierson 2019 in such a quest they attempt to demonstrate the
role of architecture and urbanism in developing healthy and healing environments
and how design can be informed to allow critical humannature associations to
prosper social distancing measures may encourage less association with people
in urban settings and may give further rise to biophilic design trendsthe urban has been defined as a place of encounter
assembly simultaneity  lefebvre
1970118 it is argued that there are two polar perspectives
associated with the term which stem from various disciplinary territories
urban form and urban life while urban from is the sphere of urban designers
architects urban planners and transportation engineers urban life is the
territory of social scientists human geographers and sociologists as argued
by susser 2002 urban form refers to
the spatial concentration of populace within a specific area of land limits to
building and population densities and certain qualities of buildings and
spaces urban life epitomises the collective which refers to
the diffusion of the system of values attitudes customs and behaviours of a
specific group of people associations between urban form and urban life have
been studied thoroughly  salama et
al 2017a through a sustained and consistent
understanding that they cannot be discussed in isolation where urban form is
shaped and influenced by urban life and urban life arises from urban formthe urban place has been expressed in various studies as having contrasting
attributes based on the characteristics of form and the nature of the activities
taking place within that form positive attributes include diversity tolerance
association integration personal network-formation  fischer 1977 and frequent spontaneous interactions
while these qualities represent an ideal condition and confirm lefebvre 1970 postulation the urban
place has been portrayed in negative attributes  halpern 1995 that include anonymity detachment
loneliness formalised social control segregation isolation fear and mental
illness the covid-19 social distancing measures will have an impact on the
perception of some of these qualities especially if these measures in part or
in whole become the norm and part of the new normal an example for this is
that spontaneous interactions would become less or non- spontaneous while
formalised social control will take place as a positive rather than a negative
attributethe suggestion made by walzer 1986
that public space is where we share with strangers people who
arent our relatives friends or work associates could entirely
change given the cognizance of users regarding the risks associated with
engaging with others they do not know if social distancing measures become part
of the collective psyche of societies it could lead to a significant change in
comprehending the needs in public spaces by revisiting the notions of social
interaction assembly and simultaneity active engagement which represents the
direct experience a person has with a place and the people within it would be
limited or directed more towards passive engagement that involves meeting the
need for encounter without becoming actively involved this includes watching
the passing scene rather than talking or doingsince the mid 1970s urban theorists have conceived various triadic relationships
that established a common understanding of places canter 1977 developed an understanding of the
constituents of place which include psychological conceptions physical
attributes and actions and behaviours punter 1991 introduced mental image form and activity while
mongomery 1998 discussed factors
that generate a sense of place involving meaning physical setting and activity
post pandemic urban design would need to emphasise factors relevant to spatial
proximity as it relates to health in order to limit the potential spread of
viruses or reacting to peoples awareness of it this could eventually
lead to altering the triadic relationships which were part of urban discourse
for several decadessocial distancing guidelines coupled with operating in a post pandemic virtual world
will instigate new living and working patterns which will result in different
spatial requirements and place standards to understand the spatiality of these
dynamics it is crucial to relate to the body of knowledge developed within social
sciences  adler et al
1987 which has significant implications on the notion of place as a
human product involving human choices following giddens 1984 and pred
1984 these products and choices are based on factors relevant to how
different elements of a society interact and a critical understanding of people
organisations agencies and the power that each element of a society has this
understanding can be further elaborated based on ethnographic and anthropological
perspectives as they relate to the built environment  salama 2011 salama
et al 2017bfrom an ethnographic perspective the concept of life-mode  hojrup 2003 offers insights into the understanding that
human values are constrained by cultural-relational dialectics and are products of
cultural life modes which can be classified according to work styles self-employed
mode wage-earner mode and career-oriented mode from an anthropological
perspective douglas 1996 discusses a
life style scheme that relates to attitudes rather than work these attitudes can be
envisaged as sub-cultures that include competition and individualism isolation and
avoidance of social controls equity and negotiation and hierarchical communities
the two perspectives have direct spatial implications on how post pandemic emerging
patterns of living and working will be spatially accommodatedthe spatial implications resulting from the two perspectives can be extrapolated when
looking at various manifestations of the home environment and home choices  salama 2011 in terms of work the
self-employed life mode is where means of production are owned and included within
the house this means that the home environment is conceived as an integrated living
and working place where work time and spare time are not separated the wage-earner
life mode means that the home environment is regarded as either a primary place
serving recreational purposes or a place where important spare-time family or
personal activities are undertaken the career-oriented life mode means that the
home environment reflects the personal progress position social status and past
and recent experiences additionally the notion of sub-cultures determines housing
preference based on social attitudes especially isolation and avoidance of social
control and will manifest in post pandemic housing choices including preferred
aspects related to the house integration within the neighbourhood and the overall
house size and imagewhether work-based or status- and attitude-based the spatial attributes of home and
work environments post pandemic should be seen as a product of distancing measures
and of operating in a virtualdigital world which will instigate new living and
working patterns these implications will influence the existing housing stock and
working places which will require appropriation and adaptation and the new
developments of home and work environments requiring new standards and
specificationsthe public health catastrophe caused by coronavirus and the rapid spread of covid-19
disease has significant impacts on societies and cities around the world the
trans-disciplinary conceptual framework utilised for analysing urban and
socio-spatial implications of covid-19 measures reveals important insights into the
factors that will impact future education research and practice of architecture
and urban design and planning these factors act as a base for potential
contributions of architecture and urbanism as academic disciplines and professions
to develop new insights into the impact of a pandemic on cities and urban
environments and the socio-spatial implications of covid-19 measures and guidelines
immediate research areas were classified under three key areas urban dynamics
during and post covid-19 socio-spatial implications of distancing measures and the
requirements of the new spatial environments to accommodate post pandemic emerging
living and working patterns  figure 2 as the
spread of covid-19 has influenced individuals communities organisations and
governments its impacts will be on every level and scale from global networks and
infrastructure to global cities and urban regions and from residential
neighbourhoods and public spaces to home and work environments and will continue
for many years to comeaccording to forsyth 2020 
the current pandemic brings the question of designing for infectious
diseases back to the forefront however and raises important questions for
future research and practice therefore the development of
healthy environments must be central to architecture and urbanism in the future
despite that health does seem to be absent within the education and practice of
architecture and urban design and planning professions forsyth 2020 asserts this view and argues 
for the past decades those looking at the intersections of planning
design and public health have focused less on infectious diseases and more on
chronic disease hazards and disasters and the vulnerable
rice 2019 maintains that the design
of the built environment is a determinant of health and thus there is an increasing
need for greater synergy between architectural and urban education research and
practice and public healththe spread of the disease generated a condition which is labelled as the new normal
resulting from social distancing measures and is characterised by human detachment
isolation and engagement in a virtual world coupled with an emphasis on working
from home through the utilisation of information and telecommunication technologies
the acceptability of the new normal as a result of attempting to limit the disease
spread appears to be a catalyst for a future stable condition the actual normal
while addressing health in a post pandemic virtual world negative consequences
emerge where many people around the world will be living and working in confined
spaces surrounded by gigantic cities and massive high-rise agglomerationsthe new normal  to be the actual normal  was foretold in the writings
of theorists in architecture and urbanism manuel castells in his book the rise of the network society economy society
and culture 2000 developed a methodical theory of the information
society which is based on the overpowering impacts of information technology in a
contemporary global world his assumption that the global city is not necessarily a
place but a process seems to manifest in the future stable condition the visionary
trilogy of the late william mitchell is clear evidence that the actual normal
represents the prospects of societies and citiesthe stable condition of the actual normal is palpable in the city of
bits  mitchell 1995 where
mitchell examines architecture and urbanism in the context of the digital
telecommunications revolution the continuing miniaturization of electronics the
commodification of bits and the growing domination of the digital over the
physical in the e-topia 1999 mitchell
examines the way in which an electronically connected world will shape cities of the
future and the associated urban relationships with a focus on digital
infrastructure and its implications for future daily lives mitchell asserts that we
must extend the definitions of architecture and urban design to integrate virtual
places as well as physical ones and interconnection by means of telecommunication
links as well as by pedestrian circulation and mechanized transportation systems he
proposes strategies for the creation of cities that not only will be sustainable but
also will make economic social and cultural sense in an electronically
interconnected and global world while this conceptualisation would seem an
imaginary future it appears now as a representation of the stable condition of the
actual normal mitchells book me the
cyborg self and the networked city 2003 answers the question of how the
transformation of wireless technology and the creation of an interconnected world
are changing our environment and our lives he argues a world governed less and less
by boundaries and more and more by connections requires the reconstruction of our
environment and our cities and reconsideration of the ethical foundations of
architecture urbanism and allied disciplinesin a transition period called the new normal which will eventually become a stable
condition of the actual normal societies communities and individuals appear to be
at odds speculating the future that future seems to have already arrived at our
doorsteps perhaps forcefully perhaps arbitrarily perhaps in a shock and
awe manner but surely at the expense of disease panic mental illness and

contact with contaminated objects or surfaces and through inhalation of respiratory droplets from both symptomatic and asymptomatically-infectious humans 11 there is also limited evidence that the virus can be exhaled through normal breathing 12 the incubation period of the disease ranges from 2-14 days 3 13 14 15 most infections over 80 show mild or no symptoms 16 common symptoms of the disease include fever coughing and shortness of breath for mild cases and pneumonia for severe cases 1 2 7 in the absence of pharmaceutical interventions such as a safe and effective vaccine for use in humans and a covid-19 anti-viral efforts aimed at containing covid-19 are focused on the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social-distancing using face-masks quarantine of suspected cases isolation and hospitalization of confirmed cases contact-tracing and quarantine mass testing etcin particular since the novel coronavirus is transmitted among people who come in close contact with each other the implementation of strict social-distancing measures has been the primary tool for curbing the spread of the pandemic as of april 7 2020 stringent social-distancing mechanisms mandatory lockdownsstay-at-home orders have been imposed in over 42 states of the united states together with washington dc guam and puerto rico representing over 95 of the us population involving approximately 316 million americans 17 the state of new york the current epicenter for covid-19 has even imposed a fine against people who fail to comply with its stringent social-distancing measures that took effect march 22 2020 common social-distancing measures or guidelines being employed in the us include temporary closures of schools and non-essential businesses avoiding crowded events and mass gatherings moving in-person meetings online etc the city of wuhan lifted its 76-day strict lockdown on april 8 2020 this was done in a phased way with the first relaxation of measures on february 9 2020contact-tracing is another major public health strategy for combating the spread of covid-19 contact-tracing involves searching for or identifying individuals with whom the confirmed case has closely interacted within a certain time frame eg two days prior to the onset of symptoms 18 interviewing testing and isolating or hospitalizing them if they have the disease 19 20the use of face-masks in public by members of the general population has historically been a common practice to try to limit or combat the spread of respiratory diseases dating back to at least the 1918 h1n1 pandemic of influenza 21 22 23 24 25 26 face masks may have been instrumental in limiting the community spread of the 20022003 sars epidemic in asia particularly in china singapore hong kong and taiwan 27 28 as well as the containment of the covid-19 pandemic in taiwan 29 face-masks have dual purposes if worn by a susceptible individual the mask offers efficacy against the acquisition of infection on the other hand if the wearer is already infected but is asymptomatic or mildly-symptomatic and unaware heshe is ill the face-mask offers efficacy against their ability to transmit infection to susceptible individuals 12 30 31 32 33predicting the course or severity of a pandemic such as covid-19 as well as the realistic assessment of proposed public health intervention strategies for combating them in real time is a major challenge to both the public health and the scientific community a number of models have been developed and used to study covid-19 dynamics ferguson et al 34 used an agent-based model to investigate the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on human deaths from covid-19 and in reducing burden on healthcare facilities and equipment they projected that in the absence of control measures over 81 of the populations of the us and great britain might become infected and covid-19 may cause up to 22 million deaths in the us mizumoto and chowell 35 used a mathematical model and incidence data to study changes in covid-19 transmission potential as the outbreak progressed through the diamond princess they obtained a higher reproduction number and noticed a substantial decrease in the effective reproduction number after improved quarantine was instituted hellewell et al 36 used a stochastic model with covid-19 data to examine the impact of contact-tracing and isolation on disease control and suggested that for most instances covid-19 spread can be contained in 3 months if these measures are highly effective using a stochastic model kucharski et al 37 examined the covid-19 trajectory in wuhan from januaryfebruary 2020 showing a reduction in transmission a 13 reduction in the associated effective reproduction number of the model when travel restrictions were implemented consequently there is a need to examine the combined impact of multiple non-pharmaceutical interventions applied together or in sequencethe present study is based on the development of a new mathematical model for studying the transmission dynamics and control of the covid-19 pandemic in the us particularly in the state of new york the epicenter of covid-19 the model takes the form of a kermackmckendrick compartmental deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations 38 it incorporates features pertinent to covid-19 transmission dynamics and control such as the quarantine of suspected cases and the isolationhospitalization of confirmed covid-19 cases similar to the models developed in 39 40 41 the model parameterized using available covid-19 mortality data more reliable than case data provides a realistic real-time assessment and estimate of the burden of the pandemic in the us state of new york in addition to assessing some of the main intervention strategies being implemented in the state in particular quarantine isolation contact-tracing social-distancing and the use of face-masks in public
we designed and analyzed a novel kermackmckendrick-type mathematical model for the transmission dynamics and control of covid-19 in a population 38 the model which incorporates the main non-pharmaceutical interventions being implemented to curtail covid-19 transmission in a community such as social-distancing quarantine of suspected cases isolation of confirmed cases contact-tracing testing and use of face-masks in public is formulated based on stratifying the total human population at time t denoted by nt into the mutually-exclusive compartments of non-quarantined susceptible sut quarantined susceptible sqt non-quarantined exposed ie newly-infected individuals who do not yet show symptoms of the disease and cannot transmit infection eut quarantined exposed eqt symptomatically-infectious iut asymptomatically-infectious iat hospitalizedisolated iht intensive care patients iicut and recovered rt so that ntsutsqteuteqtiutiatihtiicutrt
it should be mentioned that the asymptomatically-infectious compartment ia also includes those with mild symptoms of covid-19 data from the world health organization shows that about 80 of covid-19 confirmed cases show mild or no symptoms 16 and that individuals in this category particularly those who are in the 65 age group or those with pre-existing health conditions can develop a mild form of pneumonia that might require self-isolation or hospitalization 42 43 44 45 furthermore some individuals in this compartment particularly those who show no clinical symptoms 46 can be detected via testing andor tracing and testing of the contacts of confirmed covid-19 cases and sent to self-isolation or hospitalization it is worth mentioning that although the self-isolation or hospitalization of individuals in the ia class is associated with contact-tracing the ia to ih transition can also result from improvement in or scaling up of testing as is the case in iceland 47 in fact in our study contact tracing is very much inter-linked with testing contact tracing is carried out after a confirmed case is diagnosed following testingdiagnosis of a confirmed case furthermore individuals in the quarantine class sq or eq are those who have been traced following the positive diagnosis of someone they have had close contact with ie a confirmed covid-19 case they have been exposed to people in quarantine can be susceptible or newly-infected but unaware of their infection status and are continually monitored tested to determine their status those who test positive are moved to the eq class and those who remain negative after the incubation period are returned to the su class thus the process of quarantining individuals suspected of having had close contacts with an infectious individual can be interpreted as contact-tracing in addition to contact-tracing of contacts of confirmed cases people can be placed in quarantine because of other factors such as having traveled to areas with high covid-19 transmission eg new york italy china spain uk etc quarantine and isolation can either be at home self-quarantine and self-isolation or at designated healthcare facilities furthermore hospitalization in the context of this study includes self-isolation at home and isolation at the hospital hence hospitalization and isolation will be used interchangeably in this studythe model is given by the following deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations where a dot represents differentiation with respect to time 21su1p1qpqpsuqsqsq1psujqsqeu1qpsuuueueqqpsuueujsqqeqiuf1ueuuuuiuihf2ueurqequiuaiahhhihia1f1f2ueu1rqeqaaaiaiicuhihicuicuiicuruiuhihaiaicuiicuwhere force of infection

correctly and consistently in public and 0m1 is the efficacy of the face-masks low values of cm imply limited use of face-masks by members of the public while values of cm that are closer to unity imply widespreaduniversal use of face-masks in the community furthermore values of m that are closer to zero imply that the face-masks are not very effective in preventing acquisition if worn by a susceptible human or transmitting infection if worn by a symptomatic or asymptomatically-infectious human while m close or equal to unity implies that the face-masks used by the members of the public are of near or perfect efficacy against the acquisition or transmission of infection reduction in the contact rate parameter  can be thought of a measure of effectiveness of strategies that limit contacts between people to avoid community transmission notably social or physical distancing the parameter 0a1 measures the relative infectiousness of asymptomatically-infectious humans in the ia class in relation to symptomatic individuals in the iu class similarly 0h1 is a modification parameter accounting for the relative infectiousness of hospitalizedisolated infectious humans in the ih class in relation to individuals in the iu class the parameter 0q1 is a measure of the effectiveness of quarantine hospitalizationisolation and icu admission to prevent infected quarantined hospitalizedisolated individuals and icu patients from transmitting infection in particular q0 implies that infected quarantined hospitalizedisolated individuals and icu patients mix freely with the rest of population and can transmit at the same rate as other infectious individuals on the other hand q1 implies that the efficacy of quarantine hospitalizationisolation and icu admission in preventing infected quarantined hospitalizedisolated individuals and icu patients from transmitting infection is perfect in other words q1 means infected quarantined hospitalizedisolated infectious humans and icu patients are no longer part of the actively-mixing population hence do not contribute to disease transmissionin the model 21 the parameter 0p1 is the probability of infection per contact while q is the proportion of non-quarantined individuals that are infected at the time of quarantine the parameter q measures the rate at which quarantined-susceptible individuals revert to the wholly-susceptible non-quarantined class su at the end of the quarantine period the modification parameter 0j1 is a measure of the efficacy of quarantine to prevent the acquisition of infection by quarantined-susceptible individuals during quarantine it should be mentioned that in the formulation of the model 21 the quarantine rate is defined as a function of the proportion of infectious individuals in the community in particular the quarantine rate of susceptible individuals is 1p while that of newly-infected exposed individuals in the eq class is qp where  is the force of infection in other words the more the number of confirmed covid-19 cases in a community the more the number of residents of that community that are quarantined the parameters uq is the rate at which exposed non-quarantined quarantined individuals progress to the symptomatic hospitalized class ie 1u and 1q is the intrinsic incubation period of non-quarantined and quarantined exposed individuals respectively a proportion f1 of exposed individuals move to the iu class at the end of the incubation period at the rate f1u similarly another proportion f2 moves to ih class at the rate f2u and the remaining proportion 1f1f2 moves to the ia class at the rate 1f1f2u noting that f1f21 the parameter a represents the rate at which asymptomatically-infectious humans are detected via contact-tracing and hospitalized the parameter a represents the rate at which asymptomatically-infectious humans are detected via contact-tracing and hospitalized a proportion r of exposed quarantined individuals move to the ih class at the end of the incubation period at a rate rq while the remaining proportion 1r moves to the ia class at a rate 1rq the parameter u represents the rate at which exposed non-quarantined individuals are detected by contact-tracing and placed in quarantine the parameter uahicu is the recovery rate for individuals in the iuiaihiicu class while h is the rate at which hospitalized individuals are placed into icu furthermore the parameter uahicu represents the covid-induced mortality for individuals in the iuiaihiicu class it is worth mentioning that in the formulation of the model 21 the community transmission rate  is assumed to be the same for both the symptomatically-infectious iu and the asymptomatically-infectious ia classes it may be possible that the community contact rate for asymptomatically-infectious individuals is higher than that of symptomatically-infectious individuals this is due to the fact that the former are less sick or are not even aware that they are infected and may therefore be having more contacts and causing more infections the assumption for the homogeneity in the community contact rate allows for a more tractable assessment of the impact of social-distancing and other community contact reduction strategies as well as mathematical tractabilitythe model 21 is an extension of the quarantine model for ebola viral disease developed by denes and gumel 39 by adding epidemiological compartments for asymptomatically-infectious humans and hospitalized individuals in icu as well as incorporating contact-tracing of suspected cases and the use of face-masks by members of the general public to the authors knowledge this may be the first deterministic model for covid-19 that incorporates five non-pharmaceutical interventions quarantine isolation contact-tracing use of public masks and social-distancing in addition to allowing for the assessment of the impact of asymptomatic transmission on the trajectory and burden of covid-19 by adding a compartment for asymptomatic-infectious humans a flow diagram of the model is depicted in fig 1 and the state variables and parameters of the model are tabulated in table 1 table 2 to keep track of covid-19 related deaths required for calibrating our model with cumulative death data for covid-19 and for quantifying and predicting the public health impactburden of disease we define the book-keeping state variable dt to measure the number of covid-deceased individuals it then follows from some of the equations of the model 21 that the rate of change of the population of deceased-individuals is given by 22duiuhihaiaicuiicu

we estimated the baseline epidemiological parameters of the model from available covid-19 data and sources from the published literature since the generally recommended period for quarantine of people suspected of being exposed to covid-19 is 14 days 6 16 we set the rate at which quarantined susceptible individuals revert to the non-quarantined susceptible class q to be q114
per day further while some studies have estimated the incubation period for covid-19 to range from 214 days with about 975 of infected people developing disease symptoms within 115 days of infection 13 14 15 other studies have estimated the incubation period to be 56 days 3 we consider an average incubation period taken from these ranges of 51 days so that uq151
per day 13 similarly we set the progression rate from the asymptomatically-infectious class ia to the isolatedhospitalized class ihto be a14
per day following 34 48 we consider an infectious period of about 10 days so that the recovery rate from covid-19 infection  is set to uicu110
per day ferguson et al 34 estimated the average time covid-19 patients spent in hospital for infections that do not lead to complications requiring icu admission to be about 8 days therefore we set h18
per day furthermore following ferguson et al 34 it is assumed that there is a short time lag of about 5 days between the onset of disease symptoms in non-quarantined humans and hospitalization hence we set the hospitalization rate u to be u15
per day some studies have suggested that most covid-19 infections over 80 show mild or no symptoms about 14 show severe symptoms but without requiring icu admission and 6 show critically-severe symptoms requiring icu admission 16 49 50 consequently we set f202 and assume that half of the 80 of cases that show no or mild symptoms are asymptomatic hence we set f104 and 1f1f204 the modification parameter for the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic people a was estimated from 34 51 to be 05 further li et al 51 estimated this parameter to be between 042 and 055 hence we set ah05 since about 15 of covid-19 patients die 34 we estimated uh0015
per day to obtain estimates for a and icu we assume that a05u so that a00075
per day and icu15u so that icu00225
per day 52 the parameter for the efficacy of quarantine to prevent acquisition of infection during quarantine j is estimated to be j05we estimated the efficacy of face-masks m based on the results of a number of clinical trials for instance data from driessche et al 53 shows that surgical masks reduced p aeruginosa infected aerosols produced by coughing by over 80 in cystic fibrosis patients a similar study by stockwell et al 54 shows that surgical masks reduced colony-forming unit cfu count by over 90 these two studies in 53 54 show that the n95 masks respirators were more effective similarly van der sande et al 55 show that home-made tea-cloth masks had an inward efficiency between 58 and 77 over a 3-hour duration of wear while inward efficiency ranged 7285 and 9899 for surgical and n95-equivalent masks consequently following eikenberry et al 52 we estimate inward mask efficacy to range widely between 2080 for cloth masks and at least 50 for well-made tightly fitting masks made of optimal materials and 7090 for surgical masks and over 95 typical for p in the range of properly worn n95 masks based on this we set m05 we set the proportion of quarantined exposed individuals who are hospitalized r to be r07 there is no good data for the efficacy of isolationhospitalization to prevent disease transmission by symptomatic individuals in isolationhospital nonetheless it seems plausible to assume that at the later stage of the pandemic such as at the present moment the public health system capacity has been greatly improved to the extent that such transmission do not occur hence we set q1 the parameter h for the rate of icu admission is estimated to be h0083
per day based on data from 56 it is in the range of 612 the remaining parameters of the model 21  cm a and u were estimated from the mortality data for the state of new york and the entire us 4 5 6 7 based on the fitting of the state of new york data in fig 2a and data for the entire us in fig 2b the estimating process involved minimizing the sum of the squares of the difference between the predictions of model 21 cumulative deaths and the observed covid-19 cumulative deaths data from new york state for the period from march 1 2020 to april 7 2020 in particular the fitted values obtained using the state of new york mortality data were 08648

the quantity c is the control reproduction number of the model 21 it measures the average number of new covid-19 infections generated by an average infected individual introduced into a population where basic public health interventions quarantine isolation social-distancing testing etc are implemented the quantity rc is the sum of the constituent reproduction numbers associated with the number of new covid-19 cases generated by symptomatically-infectious humans cu hospitalizedisolated individuals ch and asymptomatically-infectious humans ca the epidemiological implication of theorem 31 is that a small influx of covid-19 cases will not generate a covid-19 outbreak if the control reproduction number c is less than unity it is worth mentioning that for kermackmckendrick-type mathematical models with no vitaldemographic dynamics ie births or natural death processes or waning immunity to continuously feed the susceptible class such as the model 21 it is instructive to compute the final size of the epidemic 40 59 60 61 62 the final epidemic size relations which are natural quantities associated with the dynamics of epidemic models with no vitaldemographic dynamics allow for the realistic quantification of disease burden and can be used to assess the impact and effectiveness of various intervention and mitigation strategies 40 the final size relations for the epidemic model 21 are calculated in section 32
in this section the final size of the covid-19 pandemic will be calculated using the notation in 59 let xr6 yr2 and zr represent the sets of infected susceptible and recovered components of the model thusit follows from the model 21 that xt

using the above change and variables and definitions the model 21 reduces to 32xdyxyzbxvxydyxyzbxzwxwhere w is a kn matrix with the property that the ij entry represents the rate at which individuals of the jth infected compartment transition into the recovered ith z compartment upon recovery and the matrix v is as defined in section 31 it is worth stating that the reproduction number c of the model 21 or equivalently 32 can be recovered using the definition c0y0z0bv1dy0 given in theorem 21 of 59 it should be noted that this theorem also allows for recovering the local asymptotic stability result for the family of disease-free equilibria of the model 21 given in section 31 furthermore the results below for the final size relations of the model 21 or equivalently 32 can be established using theorem 51 of 59

we simulated the model 21 using the baseline parameter values tabulated in table 3 unless otherwise stated to assess the population-level impact of the various control and mitigation strategies against the spread of covid-19 in the us state of new york discussed in section 21 we also simulated the model using the calibrated parameters in table 4 together with the other estimated parameters in table 3 to assess the population-level impact of various control measures in the entire us it should be mentioned that in all the simulations carried out the various non-pharmaceutical interventions are maintained at their baseline values unless otherwise stated
we simulated the model to first of all assess the impact of social-distancing which in our study extends beyond individuals staying 2 meters or 6 ft apart to include school and non-essential business closures staying at home avoiding large gatherings etc further in our study we measured the effect of social-distancing by the overall reduction in the baseline value of the community contact rate parameter  the simulation results obtained depicted in fig 3 show a projected 66300 patients in hospital or in self-isolation at the pandemic peak expected to be attained on may 5 2020 fig 3a and 105100 cumulative number of deaths fig 3c for the state of new york under the baseline scenario ie for the baseline level of social-distancing similarly the projections for the entire us under the baseline nation-wide social-distancing scenario are 115000 daily hospitalizations at the pandemic peak fig 3b and 164000 cumulative number of deaths fig 3d it is noteworthy that our projection for the cumulative mortality for the entire us of 164000 falls markedly below the 22 million mortality projected by ferguson et al 34 our us-wide mortality projection however falls within the range of 38243162106 estimated by murray et al 65 when social-distancing is improved above the baseline effectiveness levels ie increase in efficacy and adherencecoverage of social-distancing fig 3 shows a dramatic reduction of covid-19 burden for both new york state and the entire us in particular for a social-distancing regimen that reduces the contact rate parameter  by 10 from its baseline value the expected number of daily hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases at the peak of the pandemic decreases to 50380 corresponding to a 24 decrease in hospitalizationsisolation from baseline for the state of new york similarly nation-wide hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases at the peak of the pandemic decreases by 21 to 89930 furthermore for a highly-effective social-distancing strategy such as a social-distancing strategy that results in at least 40 reduction in the baseline value of  the peak hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases for new york state and the entire us dramatically reduce to 5000 and 14000 respectively this represents a 92 and 88 reduction in peak hospitalizations for the state of new york and nationwide respectively similarly for this scenario the cumulative mortality for new york state and the entire us reduce respectively to 20700 and 59600 thus implementing a highly-effective social-distancing strategy which can reduce the baseline community contact rate  by at least 40 will avert over 80 and 64 of the predicted baseline deaths in new york state and nationwide respectively the effectiveness levels and coverage of social-distancing in new york state and the entire us has greatly improved by april 2 2020 66 67 68 69 to the extent that it is plausible to assume that 40 reduction in the baseline value of  has already been achieved in both the state of new york and nationwide therefore this study shows that the state of new york and the entire us could have recorded catastrophic covid-19-induced mortality between 100000 to 200000 if not for the high effectiveness levels and coverage of the strict social-distancing measures implemented in the state and nationwide our study suggests that if the current level of social-distancing effectiveness and coverage is maintained through may or june 2020 in the state of new york and nationwide covid-19 can be eliminated from both the state and the entire nation extending the simulations for fig 3 shows that the current level of the social-distancing regimen in the state of new york should be extended until late september 2021 to guarantee the elimination of covid-19 in the context of fig 3 covid-19 elimination is measured in terms of when the cumulative mortality stabilizes similarly for the entire us social-distancing needs to be maintained until march 2021additional simulations were carried out to assess the population-level impact of the duration and timing of when to terminate the current strict social-distancing protocols for the best-case scenario where the current strict social-distancing protocols were assumed to be implemented right from the very beginning of the covid-19 pandemic in new york state march 1 2020 and the entire us january 20 2020 and maintained until early december 2020 the results obtained for the cumulative mortality recorded for new york state and the entire us are 25000 and 60000 respectively this represents 76 and 63 reductions respectively in the cumulative mortality for new york state and the entire us in comparison to the baseline scenario ie worst-case scenario where the social-distancing and other community contacts-reduction strategies have not been implemented at the stringent levels blue curves in figs 4af furthermore if the social-distancing regimens were implemented on the days they were officially implemented in new york state march 22 2020 and the entire us march 16 2020 but maintained until early december 2020 the cumulative mortality to be recorded will be 55000 and 75500 this represents 48 and 53 reductions respectively in the cumulative mortality from the baseline magenta curves in figs 4afthe effect of the timing of when to terminate the current strict social-distancing protocols was also monitored our simulations show that terminating the current strict social-distancing by the end of april 2020 ie the 40 reduction in the baseline value of  is now lost due to the termination of the social-distancing measures a significant rebound of covid-19 burden will be recorded in as early as july 2020 in particular new york state will record 144000 deaths representing a 37 increase from the baseline scenario fig 4a while the entire us will record up to 156000 deaths this represents a mere 5 reduction of cumulative mortality in relation to the baseline scenario fig 4d in other words the early termination of the current strict social-distancing measures by the end of april 2020 will result in catastrophic covid-19 burden similar to the dire projections made for the pre-social-distancing period ie all the gains of the social-distancing and other control and mitigation measures will essentially be lost however if the strict-distancing measures were to be terminated by the end of may 2020 the cumulative mortality figures are projected to be 91800 for new york state and 118300 for the entire us this represents a 13 and 28 reduction respectively in the baseline cumulative mortality figs 4b and e finally if the social-distancing measures are terminated at the end of june 2020 the projection for the cumulative mortality figures are 33200 for new york state and 50300 for the entire us this represents 68 and 69 reductions respectively in the baseline cumulative mortality figs 4c and f these projected mortality numbers for the early termination of social-distancing fall within the range given by murphy et al 65 our study clearly shows that the clamor to relax or terminate the social-distancing measures that have proven to be hugely successful in both the state of new york and the entire us as part of the move to re-open the state and the country would undoubtedly trigger a devastating rebound of covid-19 in both new york state and the entire us data has already shown that certain countries that have relaxed the successfully-implemented social-distancing measures such as taiwan hong kong and south korea are now witnessing a rebound of covid-19 70 in particular hong kong announced 84 newly-confirmed cases on march 28 followed by over 70 new daily cases in the next three days further taiwan reported more than 20 newly-confirmed cases per day in mid-march up from barely 5 cases per day late in january south korea reported 83 newly-confirmed cases on april 3 2020 70
it is worth mentioning that the aforementioned simulations for the effect of social-distancing were carried out for the case where other interventions contact-tracing quarantine face-mask usage etc are also implemented at their baseline values in table 3 table 4 if face-masks are not used then the above cumulative numbers will be even more catastrophic for instance if the strict social-distancing protocol is terminated in new york state by april 30 2020 and no face-mask-based intervention is implemented about 150800 deaths will be recorded by july 2020 furthermore terminating the social-distancing protocols by end of may 2020 or end of june 2020 will result in projected 108500 and 44300 deaths respectively in the state the corresponding numbers for the entire us for the case where mask-based intervention is not implemented are projected to be 167000148000 and 91900 respectively thus this study strongly suggest that utmost caution should be exercised before terminating the current strict social-distancing protocols being implemented in the state of new york and nationwide at the very least a careful state-by-state or county-by-county phase withdrawal based on the updated covid-19 incidence mass testing data and proximity to covid-19 hot spots should be carried outthe effect of quarantine of individuals suspected of being exposed to covid-19 is monitored by simulating the model 21 using the baseline parameter values and various levels of effectiveness of quarantine to prevent the acquisition of infection during quarantine j the results obtained depicted in fig 5 show that quarantine of susceptible individuals has only marginal impact in reducing covid-related hospitalizations for both new york state fig 5a and the entire us fig 5b in particular at the baseline quarantine efficacy j05 the state of new york will record 66000 daily hospitalizations the implementation of a perfect quarantine in the state ie j0 reduces the number of hospitalizations marginally to 60000 the numbers for the entire us for the baseline and perfect quarantine are 115000 and 97000 respectively the marginal effect of quarantine in minimizing covid-related hospitalizations is even more pronounced when the isolation strategy is perfect figs 5c and d that is for the epidemiological scenario where the isolation or hospitalization of confirmed cases is perfect that is individuals in isolation at home or in hospital are not part of the actively-mixing population so that q1 the community-wide implementation of mass quarantine of individuals suspected of being exposed to covid-19 will have very marginal impact on covid-19 burden measured in terms of reductions in covid-19 hospitalizations this result is consistent with that reported in 71 thus this study suggests that since self-isolation and isolation in hospitals have been implemented at high effectiveness levels in both the state of new york and in the entire us the mass quarantine of suspected cases may not be a cost-effective public health strategy for combating the spread of covid-19 in both new york state and the entire us figs 5c and d illustrate the dynamics of the model 21 for various effectiveness levels of quarantine and isolation for both new york state and the us further emphasizing the marginal nature of quarantine even for the cases where isolation was not implemented at a perfect level in minimizing covid-19 hospitalizationsthe effect of contact-tracing measured in terms of the detection of asymptomatic cases following testing diagnosis of a confirmed covid-19 case they may have had close contacts with or random testing on the transmission dynamics and control of the covid-19 pandemic is also monitored by simulating the model 21 using the baseline parameter values in table 3 and various values of the contact-tracing parameters u and a in particular the simulations are run by increasing the values of u and a simultaneously and by the same amount from their respective baseline values fig 6 depicts the solution profiles obtained showing the worst case scenario of 49400 cases in the state of new york and 64600 cases nationwide on the day the pandemic peaks on april 26 2020 if no contact tracing is implemented if implemented at its baseline rate contact tracing reduces the size of the pandemic peak number of new covid-19 cases by 27 for the state of new york and by 22 nationwide while a 75 improvement in contact-tracing will reduce the predicted number of confirmed cases to approximately 31300 for the state of new york and 41200 nationwide this represents 13 and 10 reduction from baseline and shows that while contact-tracing implemented even only at baseline is important in reducing the size of the pandemic peak number of new covid-19 cases investing much resources towards contact-tracing beyond the baseline rate might not be cost-effectivesimulations were further carried out to assess the population-level impact of the widespread use of masks in public by running the model 21 with various values of mask efficacy m and coverage cm the results obtained depicted in fig 7 show a marked decrease in the number of hospitalizations for both new york state figs 7a b and c and the entire us figs 7d e and f with increasing values of the mask efficacy and coverage further using an efficacious mask such as a mask of efficacy 50 can greatly flatten the pandemic curve in addition to significantly reducing the burden of the pandemic measured in this case in terms of hospitalizations however such a mask will fail to lead to the elimination of the disease fig 7b it is worth emphasizing that although the use of masks with low efficacy may not lead to disease elimination they still are highly useful by causing a significant decrease in the burden of the pandemic ie significantly reduce hospitalizations if a significant proportion of the populace wear them for instance if 75 of the populace in new york or the entire us wear masks with efficacy as low as 25 ie cloths masks the number of hospitalizations will be reduced by 63 and 64 respectively compared to the scenario were masks were not used figs 7a and d a contour plot of the reproduction number of the model c as a function of masks efficacy m and compliance cm is depicted in fig 8 if masks of higher efficacy such as surgical masks with estimated efficacy 70 are used in the state of new york disease elimination is indeed feasible if at least 70 of the populace wear the masks figs 8a and b similar results were obtained for the entire us figs 8c and dadditional simulations were carried out to assess the combined impact of public face-masks use strategy and strict social-distancing strategy which reduces the baseline value of the community transmission parameter  by 40 on the control of covid-19 in new york state and the entire us the results obtained depicted in fig 9 show that combining the strict social-distancing strategy with a strategy based on using moderately-effective face-masks with efficacy m05 in public will lead to the elimination of the disease in new york state if only 30 of the population use face-masks in public fig 9a this clearly shows that disease elimination in new york state is more feasible if the face-masks-based strategy is combined with the strict social-distancing strategy similar results were obtained for the entire us fig 9b where in this case only 10 compliance in mask usage in public will be needed for covid-19 eliminationin summary the above simulations show that the use of face-masks even those with low efficacy but with high coverage in public offers significant community-wide impact in reducing and mitigating the burden of covid-19 in both new york state and the entire us in other words the use of low efficacy face masks with high coverage is always useful further combining the face-masks use strategy with a strategy based on the implementation of strict social-distancing is more effective in curtailing and eliminating covid-19 in comparison to the singular implementation of either strategythe world is currently experiencing a devastating pandemic of a novel coronavirus caused by sars-cov2 that emerged in wuhan city of china in december of 2019 the deadly covid-19 pandemic has spread to over 210 countries causing over 3 million cases and 230000 deaths worldwide by the end of april 2020 with some parts of asia europe and now the us suffering the brunt of the burden there is currently no safe and effective vaccine for use in humans against covid-19 there is also no safe and effective antiviral consequently control and mitigation efforts against covid-19 are limited to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social-distancing which involves keeping a physical distance of at least 6 ft from other humans in public lockdowns of communities closure of schools malls places of worships and other gathering places quarantine of suspected cases contact-tracing isolation at home or in hospital of confirmed cases and the use of face masks both low quality cloth masks and the higher quality surgical masks in public this study is based on the design analysis and simulations of a new mathematical model for providing deeper insights into the transmission dynamics and control of covid-19 in a community specifically the model designed in this study was parameterized using covid-19 data from the us state of new york and the entire us population the model was used to assess the population-impact of the aforementioned control and mitigation interventionswe parameterized the model using covid-19 data from new york state and the entire us and extensive numerical simulations were carried out using the parameterized model to assess the population-level impact of the various intervention strategies with the baseline levels of the four main intervention strategies considered social-distancing quarantineisolation contact-tracing and the use of face-masks the state of new york is projected to see a peak of the pandemic around mid april 2020 with 66300 number of hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases and 105100 deaths at the peak while the entire us will see its peak around end of april 2020 with 115000 hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases and 164000 deaths at the peak our projections for baseline worst-case mortality for the us are much lower than the 22 million deaths suggested by ferguson et al in the absence of interventions 34 but fall within the range estimated in 65 our projected numbers for covid-19 burden morbidity and mortality dramatically decreases if strict social-distancing measures are implemented at high adherence levels for instance it was shown that strict compliance to the statewide lock-down in new york state which corresponds to reducing the baseline contact rate in our model by at least 40 will reduce the peak values for hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases and mortality by 92 and 80 respectively similarly the peak values for cases and mortality in the entire us if a nation-wide lockdown capable of reducing baseline contact rate by at least 40 will decrease by 88 and 64 respectivelythe duration and timing of the termination of strict social-distancing measures are critically-important in the battle to effectively combat pandemics of respiratory diseases such as the devastating covid-19 pandemic while the rapid implementation of strict social-distancing measures during the early stage of the pandemic maintained over a relatively long period of time eg until the summer will undoubtedly effectively combat the burden of the pandemic early termination of these measures will cause catastrophic outcomes for instance our study shows that relaxing or terminating the strict social-distancing measures in the state of new york and the us as a whole by end of april 2020 will trigger a devastating second wave generating covid-19 burden similar to those obtained during the pre-strict-social-distancing time in the state and in the entire nation by the end of july 2020 with cumulative mortality numbers in the range reported in 65 for both new york state and the entire us in particular up to 144000 and 156000 cumulative deaths will have been recorded in the state of new york and the entire us if the social-distancing measures are shut down by the end of april 2020 extending the termination of social-distancing such as to end of june 2020 significantly reduces the likelihood of a second wave in addition to significantly reducing the associated burden of the pandemic consequently a great deal of caution must be exercised before decisions are made to relax or terminate the existing highly-successful social-distancing protocols in both the state of new york and the entire us it is noteworthy that countries that have recently relaxed these measures such as taiwan hong kong and south korea have already started seeing a rebound of covid-19 our study suggests that the decision to relax or terminate the social-distancing measures should by on a case-by-case ie state-by-state or county-by-county basis and should be informed by updated covid-19 incidence and mortality data number of covid-19 tests both antibody and surveillance tests and proximity of a locality to covid-19 hot spots in particular our study shows that strict social-distancing should be maintained until the year 2021 up to late september 2021 for new york state and early march 2021 for the entire us to eliminate covid-19quarantine of people suspected of being exposed to a respiratory disease is perhaps the oldest public health control measure in human history our study shows that widescale implementation of quarantine intervention may not be very effective in minimizing the burden of covid-19 if the strategy of isolating confirmed cases is effective in other words our study suggests that if isolation can be implemented effectively high efficacy and coverage then quarantine of people suspected of contracting covid-19 may not be necessary this result is consistent with what was reported by day et al 71 tracing the contacts of confirmed cases known as contact-tracing was also shown to only be marginally-effective in minimizing the burden of the pandemic in particular even if contact-tracing is implemented at the highest possible level represented in our study based on increases in the contact-tracing parameters by 75 the decrease in the burden of the pandemic recorded was only marginal 13 and 10 for cases in new york state and nationwide respectively and 5 and 3 for mortality for new york state and nationwide respectivelythe use of face-masks in public in times of outbreaks of respiratory diseases has a rich history although quite popular in some parts of the world notably asia the use of face-masks in public is somewhat controversial this was more evident in the us during the covid-19 leading ultimately to the recommendation to use face-masks home-made cloths masks in public by the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc on april 2 2020 our study shows that the use of high efficacy masks such as surgical masks with estimated efficacy of at least 70 will lead to a dramatic reduction of covid-19 burden if its coverage is high enough at least 70 in fact our study shows that even face-masks of low efficacy home-made cloths masks will lead to a dramatic reduction of disease burden albeit this will not lead to the elimination of the disease for example even face-mask efficacy of 25 can lead to a 63 and 64 reduction in the number of hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases at the pandemic peak in new york state and nationwide if 75 of the population wear face-masks in public these results are consistent with those reported by eikenberry et al 52 furthermore by generating contour plots for the control reproduction number of the model 21 c as a function of mask efficiency m and coverage cm our study shows that the use of high efficacy masks such as surgical masks with estimated efficacy of 75 will indeed lead to the elimination of covid-19 in both the state of new york and in the entire us nation if the coverage is high enough about 80 this study shows that the use of face-masks in public is always useful and their population-level impact increases will increases efficacy and coverage in particular even the use of low efficacy masks will greatly reduce the burden of the pandemic if the coverage in their usage in the community is high enough furthermore our study shows that combining the masks-based strategy with the strict social-distancing strategy is more effective than the singular implementation of either strategy for instance our study shows that covid-19 can be eliminated from the state of new york if the strict social-distancing measures implemented are combined with a face-masks strategy using a moderately-effective mask with efficacy of about 50 if only 30 of the residents of the state wear the masks the masks use compliance needed to eliminate the disease nationwide under this scenario with strict social-distancing nationwide is a mere 10in summary our study suggests that like in the case of the other coronaviruses we have seen in the past namely sars and mers 10 covid-19 is a pandemic that appears to be controllable using basic non-pharmaceutical interventions particularly social-distancing and the use of face-masks in public especially when implemented in combinations the factors that are obviously critically-important to the success of the anti-covid-19 control efforts are the early implementation and enhancement of effectiveness of these intervention measures and ensuring their high adherencecoverage in the communitythe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paperwho declared the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 to be a pandemic on march 12 20201 on march 18 2020 the un educational scientific and cultural organization estimated that 107 countries had implemented national school closures related to covid-19 affecting 862 million children and young people roughly half the global student population this situation had rapidly escalated from 29 countries with national school closures a week before2 school closures are based on evidence and assumptions from influenza outbreaks that they reduce social contacts between students and therefore interrupt the transmission3
school closures can affect deaths during an outbreak either positively through reducing transmission and the number of cases or negatively through reductions in the health-care workforce available to care for those who are sick studies of uk children and young people report that the mean number of daily social contacts during school holidays are approximately half that of school term days4 5 however contacts continue and mixing between children and adults and between children at different schools actually increases during holidays and school closures4 5 6 7 the evidence for the effectiveness of school closures and other school social distancing measures comes almost entirely from influenza outbreaks for which transmission of the virus tends to be driven by children it is unclear whether school measures are effective in coronavirus outbreaksfor example due to severe acute respiratory syndrome sars or middle east respiratory syndrome mers and most specifically covid-19 for which transmission dynamics appear to be differentfour systematic reviews8 9 10 11 of the effects of school closure on influenza outbreaks or pandemics suggest that school closure can be a useful control measure although the effectiveness of mass school closures is often low school closure strategies might be national regional local or reactive closure of individual schools in response to student infection rates a systematic review8 commissioned by the uk department of health in 2014 to inform influenza pandemic preparations included 100 epidemiological and 45 modelling studies and concluded that school closures can reduce transmission of pandemic influenza if instituted early in outbreaks school closures result in greater reductions in peak than in cumulative attack rates and according to modelling studies are likely to have the greatest effect if the virus has low transmissibility reproductive number r 2 and if attack rates are higher in children than in adults a second review9 of modelling studies by the same authors drew similar conclusionsa 2018 review10 of 31 studies that addressed whether school closure had a quantifiable effect on influenza transmission reported that school closure reduced the peak of the related outbreak by a mean of 297 and delayed the peak by a median of 11 days they also reported that earlier school closure predicted a greater reduction in the outbreak peak although these estimates did not come from formal meta-analyses10 a 2015 systematic review11 of social distancing practices including school closures for influenza pandemics reported a wide variation in the reduction of transmission range 150 but noted that up to 70 of students might shift social contacts to other non-school sites during closures reducing the effect of closures a 2020 systematic review12 of school closures and other social distancing measures during influenza outbreaks also found compelling evidence that closures reduced transmission particularly among school-aged children 517 years however there was substantial evidence that transmission surged again once schools reopened and there was little consensus on the appropriate timing of closures let alone reopening of schoolsone way that school closures are effective during outbreaks might be through forcing parents to work at home and thus reducing work-related contacts however reviews have also noted the adverse effects of school closure including economic harms to working parents health-care workers and other key workers being forced from work to childcare and to society due to loss of parental productivity transmission from children to vulnerable grandparents loss of education harms to child welfare particularly among the most vulnerable pupils and nutritional problems especially to children for whom free school meals are an important source of nutrition8 10 11 social isolation itself brings a range of psychological harms13 a rapid review13 found evidence that during unplanned school closures childrens activities and contacts decreased but did not cease with some evidence that this was particularly so among older children and those whose parents disagreed with closures7
the economic harms of school closures are high a uk study14 from 2008 suggested that approximately 16 of the workforce are the main caregivers for dependent children and are at very high risk of absenteeism if schools are closed a proportion that rises to 30 in the health and social care sectors in the usa unpublished estimates suggest that 29 of health-care workers have childcare obligations15 a 2010 economic modelling analysis16 of school closures as mitigating interventions during influenza outbreaks suggested that 4-week or 13-week closures reduced the clinical attack rate minimally but markedly increased the economic cost to the nation in particular through forced absenteeism by working parents in the uk france belgium and the netherlands costs have been estimated to be as high as 021 of uk national gross domestic product gdp per annum for school closure for 1213 weeks14 or up to 3 of gdp for an 8-week closure in us studies17 reviews have not summarised economic harms from school closure in detail but economic modelling from an influenza outbreak in hong kong china suggested that the most cost-effective models were selective local closures rather than city-wide closures18
notably regardless of official school closure or other distancing policies unofficial student and staff absenteeism whether due to illness or precautionary can be very high during epidemics staff absenteeism can lead to forced local school closures19 school dismissalwhereby all students except the most vulnerable and children of health-care and other essential workers are sent home but the school stays openhas been suggested to be a less strict intervention than school closure although there is no evidence supporting its use separately to full closure20
there are many other potential social distancing actions available for schools that are less drastic than full closure although these have received little attention21 a 2018 systematic review21 of such strategies noted that potential practices include suspending affected classes or year groups or changing the school organisation structure to reduce student mixing eg by closing playgrounds cancelling non-essential activities and meetings keeping students in constant class groups or classrooms increasing spacing between students in classes shortening the school week and staggering school start and lunch or break times across year groups or classes the review concluded that few studies have been done but that a small number of modelling studies supported the use of alternative strategies during influenza outbreaks22 23 there were no uk studies included in this review21 in the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic taiwan instituted class suspensions rather than school closures facilitated by keeping students in a homeroom class with a core teacher and having other teachers routinely moving between classes studies suggest that this approach was an effective social distancing measure in this outbreak while reducing social disruption24
to reduce the transmission of covid-19 many countries had instituted large-scale or national closure of schools by march 2020 these actions appear largely based on assumptions that the benefits apparent in influenza outbreaks are also likely to be true for covid-19 there are several theoretical reasons why school closures might be less effective in covid-19 than in influenza outbreaks children contribute more to influenza transmission than do adults25 with low levels of immunity and high levels of transmission due to symptomatic disease however in the covid-19 pandemic thus far children appear to form a much lower proportion of cases than expected from their population although evidence for this is mixed and some data suggest that children might be as likely to be infected as adults but largely remain asymptomatic or have a mild form of the disease26 it remains unclear whether the low proportion of confirmed covid-19 cases among children in mainland china relate to a reduced risk of infection having subclinical or milder infections or specific population factors eg one-child policy evidence of covid-19 transmission through childchild contact or through schools is not yet available although family transmission has an important role in the outbreakin some previous coronavirus outbreaks evidence suggested that transmission in schools was very low or absent27 as modelling studies of school closures for influenza outbreaks rely on assumptions about the proportion of cases transmitted in schools being relatively high28 these models cannot be assumed to be informative regarding effectiveness for covid-19 emerging epidemiological data suggest little evidence of transmission of covid-19 through schools in china although this might reflect closure of schools during most of the outbreak notably school closures began with not reopening schools after the chinese new year holidays29 as of april 3 2020 taiwan has been recognised to have effectively minimised spread of covid-1930 but with national policies that avoided widespread planned school closures and instead mandated initially local class closures and subsequently local temporary school closures based on low thresholds for infected cases within individual schools30 in view of the scarce information and pressure on countries to consider school closures to deal with the covid-19 pandemic we did a systematic review of the literature to answer the question what is known about the use of and effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of school closure and other school social distancing practices on infection rates and transmission during coronavirus outbreakswe sought to include quantitative studies using diverse designs to model or empirically evaluate the effects of school closure and other school social distancing practices on infection rates and transmission during coronavirus outbreaks our search was designed to be inclusive of any studies providing data on

medrxiv for all papers using the search terms sars or mers or coronavirus or covid-19 we did not find it useful to include search terms relating to schools as the search facilities were not sophisticatedall articles were triple screened by sjr hc and jp on title and abstract we excluded opinion pieces systematic reviews studies addressing other viruses university-specific settings epidemiological studies not examining intervention effects eg of prevalence of infection in schools and studies in other languages with no english translation all full-text articles identified were reviewed by rmv for each retrieved full-text article we hand searched included references and examined the citation chain for additional studies we did not attempt to rate the quality of included studies in this review we considered findings from preprint articles separately to published peer-reviewed articlesthe pubmed search identified 119 articles of which 22 full-text articles were assessed and eight included in the review searching the who global research database on covid-19 did not return relevant articles the search on medrxiv yielded 480 articles of which 36 full-text preprint articles were assessed and six included in the review hand searching of full-text articles identified one additional reference and one additional modelling study31 published as a non-peer-reviewed report was identified and included in total 16 studies were included in this review figure
all published articles concerned the 2003 sars outbreak one preprint article32 concerned the effect of school closures on transmission of other endemic coronaviruses 229e nl63 oc43 and hku1 and five preprints and one report31 concerned the covid-19 pandemicsix papers described or evaluated school actions as part of control measures undertaken in response to the sars outbreak in taiwan24 singapore33 34 35 and beijing china36 37 two papers were modelling studies that estimated sars transmission in schools38 or the effect of school closure39 on transmission in sars outbreaks one paper reported qualitative research with health-care workers after the sars outbreak relating to the effect of school closures40 five preprint articles reported on school closures during the covid-19 outbreak in mainland china41 42 43 and hong kong12 44 one preprint article described the impact of school closure on winter transmission of other human coronaviruses32 one report modelled the impact of school closures in the uk on transmission of covid-1931
preprint studies41 42 report that school closures were initiated nationally across mainland china in late january 2020which manifested as delaying the restarting of schools after the chinese new year holidaysas part of a broader series of control measures during the covid-19 epidemic no data are available on the effectiveness of school closure as there was little variation in timing of closures closures were reportedly applied in all chinese cities uniformly and without delay and school closures were part of a broad range of quarantine and social distancing measures both of these studies concluded that the overall package of quarantine and social distancing was effective in reducing the epidemic in mainland china41 42 although the relative contribution of school closures was not assessedpreprint studies of actions in hong kong related to covid-19 noted that a 4-week school closure was initiated across the city on feb 1 2020 approximately 1 week after the first cases were identified in hong kong school closures were implemented at the same time as a number of other stringent social distancing measures with school closures extended initially to march 2020 then to april 202012 44 collectively these measures were considered to have reduced the r below 1 controlling the spread of the outbreak12 as in mainland china no data were available from either paper on the effect of school closures separate from other measures cowling and colleagues12 noted that the social distancing measures implemented during the covid-19 outbreak reduced community transmission by 44 which was much greater than the estimated 1015 reduction in influenza transmission conferred by school closures implemented alone during the 2009 pandemic in hong kong44
during the sars epidemic schools in beijing were closed on april 24 2003 approximately 6 weeks after the beginning of the outbreak and remained closed for over 2 months one study36 concluded that school closures made very little difference to the prevention of sars in beijing given the very low attack rate in schools before the closure and the low prevalence of disease in children a second study37 estimated the effective r for each day of the beijing sars outbreak noting that school closures occurred after the r had dropped below 1 and that school closures in this case added little to control of the outbreak class cancellation strategies in which upper high-school and college students remained on college campuses but did not attend classes were also widely used during the sars outbreak in mainland china45 there was no recorded transmission of sars in schools during the outbreak in mainland china46
a review33 of the 2003 sars outbreak in singapore noted that twice daily mandatory temperature screening of all children aged 616 years in schools was part of the containment measures instituted pupils were excluded from school if their temperature was more than 378c for students aged 12 years or younger or more than 375c for students older than 12 years although there were school children diagnosed with sars in singapore none of them were identified through temperature screening35 all educational facilities in singapore were closed for 3 weeks from march 27 2003 the sars outbreak ran from late february to may 2003 together with suspension of other activities to prevent the congregation of large groups of children34
a review24 of responses in taiwan to the sars outbreak and 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic noted that schools were designated as alternative health-care sites in case the health system was overwhelmed during the sars outbreak but that there were no school social distancing measures including closures introduced during the sars outbreak this finding is in contrast to the use of class suspensions during the h1n1 pandemic in taiwan24
schools were also closed in hong kong during the sars epidemic however the extent to which this was at a city-wide or local level is unclear there was no evidence of spread of the infection in schools with spread among children almost entirely through family settings and living in the same apartment blocks as infected cases27
a preprint study by jackson and colleagues32 used routine viral surveillance to examine the effects on transmission of endemic human coronaviruses 229e nl63 oc43 and hku1 and other viruses of a 5-day closure of nearly all schools in the greater seattle metropolitan area in february 2019 due to extreme weather on transmission of these viruses their study estimated that the school closure resulted in a 56 95 ci 4169 reduction in coronavirus infections similar to influenza h1n1 76 5297 but higher than influenza h3n2 31 2532 all of which were prevalent at the time32
a preprint modelling study43 examined the effect of school closure together with other social distancing measures in wuhan china the study used transmission data representative of covid-19 but it was unclear whether epidemiological data from the outbreak were used further in the modelling this study concluded that the package of social distancing measures was effective in reducing the final size and peak incidence of the outbreak while also delaying the peak43 however it did not examine the effect of school closures relative to other measures it modelled different timings of relaxation of social distancing measures and concluded that earlier relaxation after 2 months of restrictions risked a second peak whereas 3 months of restrictions did not result in a second peak43
only one study examined the effect of school closures separately to other social distancing measures in a non-peer-reviewed but widely cited report from an established group ferguson and colleagues31 modelled the estimated effects of a range of different social distancing measures and combinations of measures they used uk population and schools data together with data on transmission dynamics reported from the covid-19 outbreak in wuhan using data from previous influenza outbreaks they assumed that per-capita contacts within schools were double those in households workplaces or the community and that overall approximately a third of transmission occurred in schools they modelled a scenario in which all schools and 25 of universities were closed and where the effect on non-school social contacts was an increase of 50 in household contact rates for families with children and a 25 increase in community contacts during the closure they concluded that school closure as an isolated measure was predicted to reduce total deaths by around 24 during a covid-19 outbreak in the uk whereas single measures such as case isolation would be more effective and a combination of measures would be the most effective the authors concluded that school closure is predicted to be insufficient to mitigate never mind suppress the covid-19 pandemic in isolation which is in contrast to seasonal influenza epidemics where children are the key drivers of transmission31
an early modelling study of a sars-like illness in school children concluded that a school closure policy would reduce the effective r by 1241 depending on the proportion of between-household mixing that occurred during school hours the study noted that modelling was based on plausible assumptions regarding characteristics of the sars virus noting that obtaining good quality estimates of epidemiological parameters for sars was difficult as the outbreak was contained rapidly39
a modelling study of the transmission of sars in hospitals and in elementary school classrooms in taiwan using data from the 2003 sars outbreak concluded that a single case of sars would infect an average of 26 secondary cases in a population from transmission in hospital whereas less than 1 secondary infection would be generated per case in a school classroom38
conflict between the work and family requirements of health-care professionals during the sars epidemic was explored in qualitative research with 100 canadian emergency and critical care nurses many of whom had been involved with the sars outbreak40 the study found that health-care workers experience substantial personal dilemmas in balancing work and family commitments particularly relating to childcare needs if schools are closed and childcare services are unavailable the study concluded that there was a need for provision of adequate resources to protect the families of health-care workers during outbreaks to maintain maximal staffing40
this review provides the first summary of data on school closures and other school social distancing practices during coronavirus outbreaks we were able to include only nine published studies and seven non-peer-reviewed studies we decided to include unreviewed studies as data would not otherwise be available on covid-19 although findings were interpreted with caution except for one modelling study none of the included studies were designed to specifically examine the effectiveness of school distancing measures thus data provided on the effect of school measures were of relatively low qualitywe identified a remarkable dearth of policy-relevant data on the implementation of school social distancing during coronavirus outbreaks this finding is perhaps not surprising for the rapidly emerging covid-19 pandemic but previous coronavirus outbreaks such as sars and mers provide limited information about the effectiveness of school closures and no data on cost-effectiveness no data on other less disruptive school social distancing practices during coronavirus outbreaks were identifieddata from the sars outbreak in mainland china hong kong and singapore suggest that school transmission played no substantial role in the outbreak and that school closures and other activities such as school temperature monitoring did not contribute to control of infection transmission it is possible that these findings reflect an effect of school closures in rapidly stopping transmission however this is unlikely as schools remained open for prolonged periods during the early part of the outbreak modelling studies from the sars outbreak produced different results although becker and colleagues39 estimated that school closure resulted in potentially important reductions in transmission liao and colleagues38 estimated that transmission in school classrooms was lowschool closures were rapidly deployed across mainland china and hong kong in early 2020 as part of a wider set of control measures for covid-19 with the result that no data were available on the comparative effectiveness of school closure interventions in isolation authors of preprint studies41 44 concluded that school closures likely contributed to the control of covid-19 in china as part of a package of very broad quarantine measures however they provide no data to support this assertion and indeed it might be very difficult to disentangle the relative contribution of school closuresmodelling studies from the covid-19 pandemic support the use of national school closure as part of a package of social distancing measures yet the only study to examine school closures as a separate intervention warned that the impact was relatively marginal given the reasonable assumptions that household and community contacts would rise as a consequencethere are few data available from the literature on coronavirus outbreaks to guide countries on the use of school closures or other school social distancing practices during the covid-19 pandemic available evidence is consistent with a broad range of impacts of school closures from little effect on reducing transmission through to more substantial effects yet the economic costs and potential harms of school closure are undoubtedly very highas evidence from coronavirus outbreak control is scarce we must turn to evidence for the benefits of school closures from influenza epidemics and pandemics school closures have been widespread in some countries during influenza pandemics and many studies report important effects on reducing transmission and the size of the pandemic yet there is considerable heterogeneity in the impact of school closures on transmission depending on characteristics of influenza serotype transmission systematic reviews of influenza outbreaks suggest that school closures are likely to have the greatest effect if the virus has low transmissibility r2 particularly if attack rates and transmission are higher in children than in adults8 although our information on sars-cov-2 remains incomplete this appears not to be the case with covid-19 outbreaks reported r values for covid-19 are high 2547 although children appear to contract infection at the same rate as adults they largely have mild or asymptomatic forms of the disease and appear to be less likely to spread the virus through coughing or sneezing however a precise understanding is as yet lacking notably analyses using uk clinical data from the 1957 asian influenza pandemic suggest that school closures would reduce the epidemic size by less than 10 when the r was similar to that of covid-19 ie 253548 reviews also note that the benefits of school closure might be less than what have been assumed or modelled as social contacts between children and between children and adults continue as part of informal childcare and non-school gatherings of children and young people11 this conclusion is a particular concern for covid-19 with its higher mortality among older people as around 40 of the uks grandparents provide regular childcare for their grandchildren49
the who director-general noted on march 12 2020 that all countries must strike a fine balance between protecting health preventing economic and social disruption and respecting human rights1 currently the evidence to support national closure of schools to combat covid-19 is very weak and data from influenza outbreaks suggest that school closures could have relatively small effects on a virus with covid-19s high transmissibility and apparent low clinical effect on school children at the same time these data also show that school closures can have profound economic and social consequencesmore research is urgently needed on the effectiveness of school closures and other school social distancing practices to inform policies related to covid-19 we also need more detailed knowledge about how covid-19 affects children and young people as the role of school measures in reducing covid-19 transmission depends on the susceptibility of children to infection and their infectiousness once infected12 however observational studies might be uninformative if closures are national and implemented at the same time as other mitigation measures better learning might come from countries that have instituted later or subnational closures modelling studiesparticularly those parameterised for covid-19 in children and those that can consider interaction with other contextual factors eg timing parents working from home and additional social mixing as a consequence of school closures or different strategies national vs staged roll outare likely to be more informative and are urgently neededthese findings pose a dilemma for policy makers seeking measures to protect populations school closure presents an apparently common-sense method of dramatically reducing spread of disease and the evidence from previous influenza outbreaks appears compelling however policy makers need to be aware of the equivocal evidence when proposing or implementing national or regional school closures for covid-19 given the very high costs of lengthy school closures during pandemics decisions about closures and their timing and length involve a series of trade-offs between conflicting factors and a substantial loss of health-care staff to childcare duties during closures might substantially reduce any benefit to health systems and populations brought by closures of schools50 nonetheless in a context of high rates of staff absence through disease school systems will be under strain and schools remaining open only for the children of health-care and other essential workers might be a better strategy than a haphazard process of schools closing and therefore providing no childcare for any essential workersthe scale and speed of school closures are unprecedented globally it is unclear how long countries can maintain tight suppression measures before behavioural fatigue in the population occurs31 given predictions that social distancing measures might need to be in place for many months or even years31 there is an urgent need to identify how countries can safely return students to education and parents to work education is one of the strongest predictors of the health and the wealth of a countrys future workers and the impact of long-term school closure on educational outcomes future earnings the health of young people and future national productivity has not been quantifiedonce the number of covid-19 cases begin to fall the measures used to achieve suppression might evolve over time schools have begun to reopen in parts of china2 and it will be essential for studies to monitor the effect of the reopening of schools on the numbers of covid-19 cases examining countries that have not implemented school closures will also be important taiwan reopened schools in late february 2020 relatively early in the outbreak it has not yet initiated further large-scale closures but has been recognised to have effectively minimised spread of covid-19 policy makers and researchers should also look to other school social distancing interventions that are much less disruptive than full school closure and might substantially contribute to maintaining the control of this pandemic although strong evidence is not available for the effectiveness of these practices they might be implementable with much less disruption financial costs or harms modelling and observational studies are urgently needed to guide policy on the opening of schools once the pandemic is under controlthe global outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus-2 sars-cov2 and associated coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has crippled major health care systems and economies in a way that no one could have imagined1 at the time of this writing waves of infected people are being identified across north america and europe with concerns about explosive growth in developing countries such as india2

3 moving quickly from the containment phase in which widespread testing and isolation of infected people was attempted countries around the world implemented unprecedented school closures and social distancing4 after china was the epicenter of the outbreak these measures appear to have helped china slow the spread of covid-19 infections5 there is evidence that social distancing and school and group facility closings seem to also be working in parts of the united states that were impacted earliest by covid and that responded with early implementation and enforcement6 it is important to highlight the ripple effects that school closures have on a community children at home means parents missing work after-school programs are closed sports and recreational activities are canceled teachers and educational staff are out of work school-based lunch and food programs are impacted it is also important to note that school closures without simultaneous social distancing means that children gather in parks libraries and other facilities and could still transmit to each other and fuel spread in the community at the time of this writing much of the debate around social distancing has focused on how long these measures need to be implemented and what should be expected in terms of new cases once social distancing recommendations are lifted4

7 many of these questions were posed back in 2009 when the pandemic of infection with the hemagglutinin type 1 and neuraminidase type 1 h1n1 influenza strain emerged to cause similar global disruption albeit with less severe clinical illness8 the purposes of this commentary were to review the events of the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic emergence to examine how only limited school closures with minimal social distancing were implemented and to offer a discussion about the likelihood of subsequent waves of covid cases once these measures lapsebeyond its rapid global spread and disproportionate impact on children young adults and pregnant women the timing of the emergence of the 2009 h1n1 influenza virus pandemic created significant challenges to the response during a typical influenza season eg 20152016 activity starts in late november and december peaks in january and february and tapers off by march and april fig 1
 part a9 in sharp contrast the onset of the 2009 h1n1 pandemic came in late march with many respiratory illnesses being reported in mexico and then spreading to the united states and other parts of the world over the next several weeks fig 1 part b9 10 11 the onset of infections in early spring caused several school-based outbreaks in new york city and other areas12 individual schools did close but early cases never matched the explosive spread of the current covid-19 pandemic because of the focused geographic activity of 2009 h1n1 and because schools would be adjourning for summer break national school closures were never seriously considered while social distancing was discussed as part of a general public health strategy for managing a pandemic no specific measures were put into place8
the other issue with emerging in late march was that the pandemic occurred almost 2 months after global decisions about strain selection for the 20092010 seasonal influenza vaccines were made a pandemic vaccine would need to have been prepared in parallel to the seasonal vaccine with a lag of about 2 months assuming no delays no other community-based preventive measures were put into place beyond the accelerated pace of trying to produce a pandemic vaccineover the summer of 2009 h1n1 cases continued to be identified in the united states but spread was more modest the southern hemisphere did experience an influenza season within their conventional months that was dominated by 2009 pandemic h1n1 activity13 in the united states when schools reopened in late august and early september there was a surge of new infections fig 1 part b9 as one can see in the fig 1 with the timing of school reopenings and frequent close contact of children as vectors for influenza transmission the second wave of cases peaked at a level far beyond the initial spring peak a study showed that school closures instituted in the fall had no impact on transmission14 new infections continued until november and early december before tapering off the irony of the situation was that the massive efforts were put forth to create an h1n1 vaccine but the initial strains did not grow well and vaccine production was delayed by several weeks15 by the time a vaccine was available in november and early december the pool of susceptible children had likely been depleted and peak activity had long since passedit is important to acknowledge major differences between the circumstances of the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic and the current covid-19 pandemic first a global influenza pandemic was a known commodity something the international community had experienced in the past and expected to return in the future while the initial sars-cov outbreak in 2003 temporarily grabbed the worlds attention it petered out within a few months never to return16 therefore this sars-cov2 virus was not an outbreak that the world had anticipated which has hampered the rapid response required for better containment second because influenza is a global and consistent seasonal health problem there is an established infrastructure for surveillance prevention and treatment that can be applied to any new pandemic strain public health officials know they can collaborate with industry partners to create a vaccine within a few months and indeed this did happen in 2009 albeit too late to impact the second wave of cases there is no existing vaccine or treatment infrastructure for coronavirus so all candidates must start with phase i studies or the rapidly conducted but highly flawed open-label treatment studies that are being rapidly published and disseminated17

18 assuming no major adverse events good efficacy and easy phase i and ii testing it will be at least a year before a vaccine candidate would be ready for use in the general population last varying levels of influenza immunity exist in the community and help to limit the spread and severity of circulating strains for example in the 2009 h1n1 pandemic the elderly were relatively protected because they had archived immunity to h1n1 epitopes after having been exposed to the similar 1918 strain earlier in life19 aside from those already infected with sars-cov2 the entire population is nave and at risk for infection while it is possible that there may be some degree of cross-protection with other coronaviruses the rapid spread of sars-cov2 suggests otherwisewith all that being said there are still important lessons that can be drawn from the 2009 h1n1 pandemic experience the first are the expected effects of social distancing and a potential second wave of cases schools did not close initially in 2009 due to summer being near at hand the influenza surveillance data from the centers for disease control and prevention fig 1 part b demonstrated that there was ongoing person-to-person transmission during the summer when typically there is no detectable activity once widespread close contact in schools was reestablished children with h1n1 infected other children who subsequently spread influenza to adult contacts and influenza cases surged once the fall peak of cases was underway school closures implemented at that time had no impact on transmission or total flu cases14 data from the 1918 pandemic suggest that us cities that instituted social distancing and school closures earlier and for a longer period of time had fewer overall cases and better economic outcomes in the long term20

21 it is very likely that once social distancing measures are lifted for covid-19 and school or summer activities resume there will be a second wave of cases this second wave has already been seen in hong kong5 given how immune-nave the population is to this virus and given how sars-cov2 has proven to be much more contagious than seasonal influenza a second wave of cases is a virtual certainty22

23 the goal of social distancing is to blunt the first wave and allow the medical system time to manage cases without being overwhelmed over time with widespread testing and prompt diagnosis social distancing could transition to a more targeted cohorting of infected persons and cocooning isolation of highly susceptible people such as the elderly and those with chronic respiratory andor cardiovascular conditions sadly it appears that the social distancing and school closures were implemented too late and in too regional a fashion to allow for optimal containment24
the 2009 h1n1 pandemic experience offers a detailed example of what is likely to happen if social distancing or school closures are lifted too soon in the current covid-19 epidemic these actions would likely invite a severe second wave of infections the lessons are there for those who wish to heed themthe author has indicated that he has no conflicts of interest with regard to the content of this articlethe coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic is an ongoing outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 so-called sars-cov-2 the outbreak was identified in wuhan china in december 2019 1 the world health organization who declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on january 30th 2020 and a pandemic on march 11th in brazil the first confirmed case was on february 25th 2020 when a man from so paulo tested positive for the virus since then brazil has been severely affected as of june 26th 2020 the country reached more than 1220000 confirmed cases and more than 55000 deaths by covid-19 according to official data by the brazilian ministry of healthin addition to the public health crisis the coronavirus has impacted all aspects of life politics education economy social environment and climate it is also having an unprecedented impact on global supply chains and production the only known effective course of action to fight the disease outbreak is to implement highly restrictive social distancing measures on the population as reported by a number of studies and systematic reviews 2 3 4 many countries are implementing such interventions with different degrees of successgiven the complexity of the societies it is hard to predict the implications of such actions in the short and medium terms 5 therefore modeling and simulating the covid-19 epidemic is a relevant and helpful way to understand the spread of the disease and the epidemiological effects of social distancing interventions for this purpose many studies in the literature have developed or adapted equation-based models to simulate the covid-19 epidemic using the susceptible-infected-recovered sir model or the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered seir model to characterize the dynamics see references in section 2 nonetheless agent-based models have also been proposed for this goal see for instance 6 7 and other studies discussed with more detail in section 2in this paper we develop an agent-based model abm to simulate the dynamics of the covid-19 epidemic and the epidemiological and economic effects of social distancing interventions the proposed abm aims to emulate a closed society living on a shared environment consisting of agents that represent people houses businesses the government and the healthcare system each one with specific attributes and behaviorsa society living over a territory is a complex and dynamic system such systems have many interacting variables present nonlinear behavior and their properties evolve over time their behavior is generally stochastic and may depend on the initial conditions it can be affected by neighbor societies with different policies and dynamics and it can show emergence of complex behaviors and patterns agent-based simulations abs are a good choice to simulate such systems due to their simplicity of implementation and accurate results when compared with real data 8 the main goal of abs is to simulate the temporal evolution of the system storing statistics derived from the internal states of the agents in each iteration and the global behaviors that emerge due to the interactions between the agents over the iterations this approach allows the simulation of systems with intricate nonlinear relationships complex conditions and restrictions that may be hard to describe mathematically since in this paper we are interested in simulating the effects of different social-distancing interventions and other control measures that affect the behaviors of agents and groups of agents it is much easier to simulate these scenarios with an agent-based model the epidemiological and economic effects are observed as emerging from the interactions of the agents in the simulationthe abm proposed here not only simulates the epidemic dynamics but also models the economy in this society of agents which can help us estimate the economic impact under different types of interventions the model described in section 3 allows the design of scenarios that correspond to different types of interventions performed in the society by changing the simulation environmental variables and measuring their effects therefore the proposed abm becomes a useful tool to assist politicians and health authorities in planning their actions against the covid-19 epidemic the model was implemented in python version 36 programming language and encapsulated in the covidabs package whose source code is available at httpsbitlycovid19abssystem the source code of all the experiments reported herein is available at httpsbitlycovidabsexperimentsthe main contributions and findings are listed belowa new seir agent-based model to simulate the covid-19 epidemic using a society of agentsassessment of the economic effects of seven different scenarios with specific social-distancing interventions via simulation of covid-abs 1 do nothing 2 lockdown 3 conditional lockdown 4 vertical isolation 5 partial isolation 6 use of face masks and 7 use of face masks together with 50 of adhesion to social isolation these scenarios and their simulated results are described in section 5the simulations support the notion that lockdown and conditional lockdown are the best scenarios in terms of controlling the number of infected and deaths which is primary goal economical countermeasures and subsidies are required by the government since this scenario presents the worst economic losses to the industry with potential unemployment and recession can be observed during the lockdown period also to be effective these scenarios depend on the ability of the government to enforce the social isolationour simulations present additional evidence that the so-called vertical isolation simply does not work although it is the policy advocated by some governments like the brazilian one1
the scenario combining the use of masks and partial isolation of the population could be a good compromise and it is more realistic for implementation in terms of social cooperation the infection curve is flattened and the economy has smoother effects than the scenarios with lockdown
the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a brief review of related work with focus on the mathematical modeling for epidemics and some recent papers related to the sars-cov-2 section 3 details the proposed agent-based system modeling section 4 describes the experimental methodology and section 5 shows the simulations results and some discussions related to the pandemic section 6 concludes the paper and gives future directionssince who announced the coronavirus disease 2019 the scientific community has been working hard to investigate sars-cov-2 epidemiological dynamics some works used the sir model to characterize the covid-19 dynamics 9 10 11 12 however more precise simulations usually used an approach based on the seir model 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 given that this disease has a known incubation period 31 some authors added new states to refine the model for instance super-spreaders 32 or isolated 13 14 16 18 19 20 23 24 26 27 hospitalized 13 14 19 20 23 27 and asymptomatic infected 18 20 21 23 28we note that equation-based models to simulate the epidemic represent the majority among those proposed in the literature nonetheless some papers with agent-based models have also been proposed for it for a discussion about abm and its advantages over equation-based models we refer the reader to 8 33 in the report released by ferguson et al 6 an individual-based simulation model was used to explore scenarios for covid-19 in gb and usa and the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the healthcare demand bossert et al 7 developed an agent-based model combining socio-economic and traffic data to analyze covid-19 spreading in a south africa city under social isolation scenarios the prediction suggests that lockdown strategy is useful to mitigate the disease another study using an abm also analyzed several scenarios and highlighted that with 90 of the population in isolation it is possible to control the disease within 13 weeks when joined with effective case isolation and international travel restrictions considering the australian context 34 an appealing characteristic of agent-based modeling is the easiness to simulate different scenarios for instance the scenario that considers universal use of masks integrated with social distance is the recommended one to control the pandemic according to braun et al 35 and kai et al 36 given the flexibility of the agent-based approach previous works have employed this method to simulate specific topics in the covid-19 context such as testing policies 37 strategies for reopening public buildings 38 hypothetical effective treatments 39 and a spatio-temporal strategy for vaccination 40few works in the literature used agent-based models to simulate the economic impacts of the covid-19 for instance inoue and todo 41 quantified that a possible one month lockdown in tokyo would lead to a total production loss of 53 in japanese annual gross domestic product gdp dignum et al 42 proposed a tool to analyze the health social and economic impacts of the pandemic when the government implements a number of interventions such as closing schools requiring that employees work at home and providing subsidy for the populationin this work we use a seir agent-based model to simulate the health and economic impacts of the covid-19 epidemic we perform analysis to seven possible scenarios 1 do nothing 2 lockdown 3 conditional lockdown 4 vertical isolation 5 partial isolation 6 use of face masks and 7 use of face masks together with 50 of social isolation we use data from brazil for all scenarios considered but the proposed agent-based model is fully parameterized and can be easily transferred to other contexts given that corresponding data is providedsome parameters in table 2 were empirically estimated in a way that the epidemiological response variables present in table 3

9 and 
10 respectively and the remaining population consists of susceptible individuals there is also a dead status since part of the population dies due to the disease and its complications 59the possibility of contagion happens by the interaction of the agents by proximity or contact hence the higher the mobility of a person the greater the probability that heshe approaches an infected person and gets infected each simulation considers a contagion distance threshold 
1 which is the minimal distance that two agents have to be to occur the viral transmission and a probability of contagion 
2 in case of contactthe model of the medical condition evolution of the infected agents follows 60 61 once an agent is infected it can be in one of these sub-states a asymptomatic which includes mild symptoms without hospitalization b hospitalization and c severe used in cases of hospitalization in intensive care unit icu these states and their transitions are illustrated in figure 2
the evolution of the medical condition is stochastic and follows the probabilities summarized in table 6
 represented by the parameters

7 and 
8 respectively the hospitalization cases require medical infrastructure which is limited it varies from country to country but is always less than the total population in each simulation a critical limit 
11 is considered it represents the percentage of the population that the healthcare system is capable to handle simultaneously as a consequence if the number of hospitalizations and severe cases increase above this limit there are no beds in hospitals to manage the demandthe secondary goal of this study is to simulate the impact caused in the economy by the different types of mobility restrictions 62 63 64 65 imposed by the authorities
figure 3
shows the transactions by which agents exchange wealth in the simulation the economic dynamics follows seasonal routines that also depend on the type of the agentthe business contact action happens hourly when an a1 agent in its free time gets in contact with an a3 and occurs the transference of wealth from a1 to a3 these economic transactions are the most sensitive to the a1 agents mobility the more the agents move the more they spend and affects the a3 agent income in pandemic times that can happen in almost all scenarios since the population tends to leave their houses just to buy essential items or to solve a problem which could not have been solved over the internet the values exchanged in business contact depend on the social stratum of the a1 agents and the higher the quintile the higher the spending following the wealth distribution 
1 in each day the wealth of a2 and a3 agents is decreased by its minimal fixed expenses proportional to the sum of the expenses of housemates and employees respectivelythe accounting actions happen monthly for a2 a3 and a4 agents accounting is the payment of taxes from a2 and a3 agents to a4 and it represents the major income of a4 during accounting a3 agents also pay salaries to their a1 employees determined in the initialization by the social stratum finally a2 agents transfer money to a random a3 agent representing supplier paymentsthe accounting of the government agent a4 transfers funds to a5 agent equivalent to its fixed expenses and the daily expenses of the hospitalized agents eventually the a4 agent pays aids for unemployed and homeless a1 agentsconsidering the periodicity of the economic transactions it is necessary to execute at least one complete cycle 720 iterations in order to execute all economic transactions at least oncethe proposed model tries to apprehend the complexity of the social epidemiological and economical relationships but without being simplistic then the complexity of the model reflects the complexity of the system being modelled although on a smaller scaleprevious versions of the model did not consider social constraints and routines and despite the good performance of the epidemiological response variables it could not accurately represent the economic dynamics the introduction of social constructs as families and businesses and periodical routines such as working hours free time and bed time brought more feasibility to the simulation and improved the performance of the economic response variables when compared with the real world valuesthese social constructs and periodic routines are hard-coded although they can be adapted by users major flexibility is provided by the parameter set that can be adjusted to represent from a single community to a complete countryin the next section the experimental methodology is discussed as well as the performance metrics and their evaluationto evaluate the proposed approach seven different scenarios that reflect adopted andor hypothetical social distancing interventions have been formulated the proposed abs model was implemented in python version 36 programming language and encapsulated in the covidabs package whose source code is available at httpsbitlycovidabsexperiments and httpsbitlycovid19abssystemeach scenario simulates the impact of a given social distancing policy considering the values of the parameters in table 2 on the response variables summarized in table 3 for each scenario 35 executions were performed each one with t1440 iterations since each iteration corresponds to one hour each execution covers exactly 2 months and one complete accounting cycle for houses government and business with one salary and tax payment which occur in the 30th day of the month the monthly accounting event is important for a2 a3 and a4 agents due to its severe cash impact and wealth transfers among agentsthe main goal of social interventions is to minimize the death curve dt it is directly related to flattening the infection curve it in order to keep the hospitalization ith and severe its cases below the critical limit of the healthcare system

9  0 and 
10  1despite the economic result of this simulation it is artificial data and consequently it does not represent the reality of any country nonetheless we argue that it is based on projections before the pandemic outbreak see for instance the references regarding each parameter listed in table 2the evolution of gdp is illustrated in figure 4
 the gdp indicates a recession chart where the population a1 and government a4 is losing wealth and the businesses a3 are floating at the equilibrium point when the incomes and expenses are equal initially the a3 are profiting but in the accounting day the profits are settled by the labor and tax expenses the baseline scenario is consistent with the economic predictions of stagnation in brazilthis scenario represents what could happen if politicians decided not to take any actions to avoid the increase of the number of people infected by the sars-cov-2 virus usually this decision only targets the economic point of view figure 5
shows the epidemiological and economical average curves of this scenario and their variances it can be seen that the economic curves look closer to the ones of the baseline confirming the economic motivation of keeping the environment without interventionshowever when the contagion curve it is considered it is possible to note how the healthcare system critical limit 
11 was trespassed pushing the death curve dt up the high number of lost lives makes this the most catastrophic scenario despite its economic resemblance with bthis scenario represents the complete social isolation following the who recommendations during a well defined date range in this scenario all a1 agents are kept in their houses and the walk freely and go to work routines are suppressed also 
6  1 reducing the mobility amplitude of all a1 even the homeless as discussed in section 331 the lockdown is unconditional meaning that from t0 to t all the restrictions are appliedthis scenario is highly conservative in healthcare terms and the main goal is to save as many lives as possible by minimizing viral spreading in the impossibility of effective testing the entire population stays in lockdown for a predefined period of time broadly speaking the infected agents only have contact with their housemates and the it and especially its stays below the healthcare critical limit 
11 and the deaths dt  0 meaning that the healthcare system could handle effectively all cases using its available resources3
considering the economic point of view see figure 6
 this scenario is the worst for the industry because the a1 agents cannot generate wealth but keep receiving their labor incomes4
 a3 does not have income but keeps paying taxes to a4 and labor expenses to a1 in this scenario after two months the businesses lost 20 of its gdp share see wsta3 in figure 6the key point for the success of lockdown policy is staying at home voluntarily or under laws economical countermeasures to its harm can also be adopted by a4 as tax exemptions and universal income in order to minimize the wealth losses in the impossibility of implementing this scenario another one that considers protective and distance measures should be evaluatedthis scenario imposes the same restrictions on a1 mobility presented in scenario 2 but conditionally in the system when the infection curve grows above a certain threshold it  005 the lockdown restrictions are activated being released when it  005as we can see in figure 7
 the viral spreading represented by the infection curve it is controlled not allowing the explosion of dt curve economically recession can be observed during the lockdown period w3ti lower than wbtii but as soon as the restrictions are released the business performance is recovered w3ta3 remains below wbta3 but above the complete lockdown curve w2tiless conservative than scenario 2 and also less efficient in terms of dt this scenario was implemented in new zealand 66 and it depends on an effective healthcare system that is capable of carrying out the necessary tests in the population granting reliability in it estimates and as in scenario 2 the governmental ability to enforce the social isolationvertical isolation is the name given to the social intervention policy where the known infected people and the known risk groups  elderly and people with pre-existent diseases  are kept in social isolation whereas young people and adults are allowed to work regularly this policy has for instance been advocated by the brazilian president5
in terms of the proposed model over 65 below 18 years old and symptomatic regardless of the age stay at homethe assumption of this policy is that all the people outside the risk groups would not develop the severe cases of the disease this assumption was proved to be fragile and this policy showed to be ineffective by 67 the results shown in figure 8
are in accordance with the literature 67 and produced almost the same epidemiological and economical results of scenario 1 ie the same results of doing nothingin the scenarios with lockdown 2 and 3 the mobility of all agents must be restricted requiring restrictive public policies enforced by the government when these policies are non-existent or are not taken seriously by the entire population partial isolation levels are reached the partial isolation level il  0 1 means the percentage of the population that is fulfilling the isolation while the remaining 1il is notthen it is possible to define that in the lockdown il  09 considering that essential services and a few industries can not stop in order to avoid supply breakdown on the other hand the scenarios 0 and 1 have il  01 and the scenario 4 has il  02 because of the age distribution and the definition of risk groupsthis scenario aims to assess the effects of intermediate ils it was simulated by randomly choosing agents a1 with probability il  05 to stay at homeobserving the results in figure 9
 although the it curve is flattened when compared with scenarios b and 4 it is still less efficient than scenarios 2 and 3 notice the dt still grows exponentially before reaching the peak for the economic perspective this scenario behaves similarly to the baseline these metrics offer evidence that il  05 is not enough for effective epidemiological control and a level of isolation greater than that is recommendedthe impact of different isolation levels can be seen in figures 10
and 11
 for il  03 09 which represents the response of epidemiological and economical curves for increasing il in figure 10 it is possible to see how the infection curve it flattens as the isolation level increases from no isolation towards lockdown figure 11 shows that as the value of il increases wealth loss of the a3 agents is higher represented by wsta3 curve showing the importance of agents mobility in the economyevidence was found about the use of masks and gloves as measures against viral spreading 68 this scenario represents the policy of mandatory usage of face masks and physical distancing but without imposing restrictions on the mobility of agentsthis scenario was implemented by reducing the contagion distance 105 and the contagion rate 203 as the effect of using masks and physical distancing figure 12
shows a flatter it curve when compared to scenario 5 while still keeping economic performance close to b notice however that dt is significantly higher when compared with scenarios 2 and 3this scenario combines the policies used in the scenarios 5 and 6 granting the necessary use of face masks plus partial isolation of the population this scenario was implemented by using 105
203 and il05
figure 13
shows the dynamics of this scenario although the dt is still above the values of scenarios 2 and 3 it presents less resistance from the general population the it is flattened and the economy despite the downturn suffers less than it would in scenarios with lockdown this scenario has already been discussed in 68 with similar resultsthe it curves averages of each scenario are shown in figure 14
 there the effects of each intervention policy in flattening the curve can be observed and contrasted the epidemiological effectiveness of the scenarios are shown in figure 15
 which compares the infection peak ip reached in each case the number of days tip to reach the peak ip and the max number of deaths dt as a proportion of the populationas expected scenarios 2 and 3 have the best epidemiological values followed by scenario 7
figure 16
shows the economic result of each scenario for the agent types a1 a3 and a4 assuming that businesses are not firing anyone from the point of view of the citizen scenarios 2 and 3 are not economically damaging on the other hand the same scenarios are the worst from the business perspective at this point it is important to explain that the expenses of government in our simulation are related with the costs of the healthcare system thus in scenarios with a high number of deaths such as scenarios 1 and 4 the cost of maintaining the healthcare system is increased which demands an increase of public expenses
figure 17
shows the scatter plots of the wealth increase with respect to the baseline of each type of agent by the percentage of deaths in the populations it can be seen that from a life preservation perspective there is no better policy than the lockdown scenario 2 furthermore in the simulated model scenario 2 pareto dominates6
all the scenarios for both people an government on the other hand it represents the worst case financially for businessesin the impossibility of enforcing a lockdown discarding scenarios 2 and 3 which may happen in underdeveloped countries the best solution is represented by scenario 7 from the remaining pareto optimal solutions for businesses it is the one with lowest number of deaths it also becomes the best solution for government and people in both wealth and number of deathsthe covid-19 pandemic brought to humankind many challenges including the demand for new medical treatments social policies and economical approaches the fast response of the scientific community to deal with coronavirus was divided into studies of the epidemiological aspects proposals of new treatments and diagnostic tools and new models to forecast the viral spreading including sir and seir models among others nonetheless few studies focused on looking at the pandemics as a governmental policy-making problem with this viewpoint although the epidemiological aspects are priority the social and economical aspects can not be neglectedthe present work proposed an agent-based model abm that simulates the epidemiological and economical effects of covid-19 pandemic in a closed society whose results can be generalized for wider contexts and used by governmental rulers to prospect social policies and assess its potential effectiveness in real scenariosthe model was encapsulated in the free and open source software library covid-abs which contains 29 epidemiological social demographic and economic input parameters and 10 output response variables new features can be designed and the library can be easily extended to other scenariosin a wider perspective the proposed approach can be used as a decision-support system for the governments and scientific community policy-makers can design scenarios and evaluate the effectiveness of social interventions through different simulations and analyse how the p parameters in the time horizon of t can affect the response variables tseven different scenarios were elaborated to reflect specific social interventions lockdown and conditional lockdown were the best evaluated scenarios in preserving lives these scenarios present a slower evolution of the epidemic a smaller number of infections and deaths given the impossibility of implementing lockdown policies the scenario with 50 of social isolation with using masks and physical distancing was the best approach in the preservation of lives on the other hand the vertical isolation scenario is totally ineffective and resembles the do nothing scenariothe results showed that covid-abs approach was capable to effectively simulate social intervention scenarios in line with the results presented in the literature also the results showed that policies adopted by some countries for instance us sweden and brazil are ineffective when the objective is to preserve lives governments that chose to preserve the economy by not using severe isolation policies fatally reached a situation with a high cost in human lives and still embittered economic losses the evidence provided by the simulation model shows that there is a false dichotomy between healthcare and the economy in the scenarios where it was tried to save the economy by not taking hard social isolation policies consequently the social costs ended up impacting negatively into the economycovid-abs is an open software and can be easily extended and customized also new scenarios can be designed taking into consideration the specificities of each region under study future research aims to improve the model by implementing mechanisms to close and open companies as well as allowing people to get fired in addition it will be integrated with optimization libraries for automatic scenario creation and multi-criteria decision making tools that could help governmental crisis committees to plan and manage the social policies to mitigate the covid-19 effects

could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paperacross millennia disease outbreaks have impacted societies and reinforced the human perception of frailty and mortality 2 dramatic demographic shifts in the past century have escalated the difficulty in containing a pandemic and the rise of globalization and urbanization have facilitated the rapid spread of pathogens from one continent to another in a flight of just a few hours yet when a comparison is drawn between the 2019 coronavirus pandemic and the 1918 influenza pandemic the most widely available tools to respond to these disease outbreaks have remained nearly the same public health interventions have been and are still the first line of defense against a pandemic in the absence of a vaccine 3 understanding that the environment plays a significant role in disease dynamics and in determining the health of individuals has always been an essential aspect to controlling and managing infectious diseases for example the history of urban planning in the past century has highlighted how built environments can have an effect on preventing both chronic and infectious diseases 4 however the function of human behaviors and social ideologies stemmed from the darker side of humanity must also be acknowledged as an important component to determining who lives and who survives during the deadliest periods of disease pandemicsin the midst of world war i the influenza pandemic spread worldwide during 1918-1919 and was outstanding in its lethality 5 while there is not a universal consensus on the pandemics origin it is understood to have been was caused by a h1n1 subtype of an influenza a virus with avian and swine genetic origins 678 over the course of the pandemic an estimated one third of the worlds population approximately 500 million persons became infected and the total deaths were estimated at 50 million or arguably as high as 100 million 7 historically the curve of influenza deaths in humans has been u-shaped with peaks among infants and the elderly nevertheless this 1918 influenza pandemic exhibited a w-shape age-related fatality with the addition of a third peak among young adults 79 as such death rates for individuals 15 to 34 years of age were 20 times higher than in previous years 710the influenza pandemic occurred in three distinctive waves over a 12-month period in europe asia and north america the first wave of the pandemic which began in spring 1918 and lasted approximately six months was not particularly virulent and mimicked typical seasonal flu symptomology and mortality 7811 however due to a possible viral mutation over the course of the summer and wartime troop movements this first wave was then followed by a rapid succession of more fatal second and third waves in the autumn of 1918 septembernovember and the winter and spring of 1919 january-may respectively 712131415 in the united states the first outbreak of flu-like illnesses was detected in march 1918 with more than 100 cases at camp funston in fort riley kansas 1617 within a week the number of influenza cases quintupled throughout the army installation 16 by the end of the month approximately 1100 soldiers were hospitalized and 38 had died after developing pneumonia 18 nevertheless thousands of soldiers were continually deployed for world war i and traveled across the atlantic ocean in europe the disease first appeared in april 1918 among american soldiers in a military camp near bordeaux france 517 the influenza presentation was in the form of a benign fever accompanied by cold-like symptoms and the attending american doctors believed the underlying cause was haemophilus influenzae a pathogenic bacterium formally called pfeiffers bacillus 19 the spring 1918 wave of influenza affected nearly 15000 soldiers from april to july but only five american soldiers died 19 although the mortality of this first pandemic wave was minor in comparison to the waves to come spain was the first european country in which the disease spread to wide sectors of the population thus causing a significant level of mortality in may and june 1918 there were 276 influenza deaths in madrid which represented a mortality rate of 042 deaths per 1000 people 19 during this same period another 852 unconfirmed influenza deaths were attributed to different respiratory system pathologies if these unconfirmed deaths were combined with the confirmed influenza deaths the mortality rate would have been 131 per 1000 people the highest mortality figure traceable to this pandemic 19 up until this point very little was written or documented about the strain of the outbreak or its epidemiologic indications due to wartime censorship however this mortality rate from one single etiological agent could not be overlooked in may 1918 the spanish newspaper el sol first published a report about a sickness which had not yet been diagnosed by doctors and headlines around the world labeled this as one of the worst pandemics in human history 1920 thus the derivation of spanish influenza was conceived 5in september 1918 the second and most deadly wave of the pandemic emerged within the united states 21 soldiers at camp devens an army training camp just outside of boston massachusetts and sailors aboard the receiving ship at commonwealth pier in boston began reporting flu-like symptoms 1622 by months end more than 14000 cases were reported at camp devens approximately one-quarter of the total camp and 757 soldiers succumbed to influenza 16 the massachusetts department of health informed local newspapers of the epidemic and stated that unless precautions are taken the disease in all probability will spread to the civilian population of the city 22 at the nearby navy radio school within harvard university in cambridge massachusetts cases of influenza were reported among the group of 5000 young men studying radio communications as 1918 concluded cambridge experienced 3014 cases of influenza among its meager population of 109000 residents ultimately leading to a mortality rate of 541 per 100000 23 during this time in new york state the board of health in new york city added influenza to the list of reportable diseases and required all cases to be isolated at home or in a city hospital 16 moreover in a document entitled fighting influenza with transit systems the board of health adopted a plan to set operation schedules for many business which would then elongate the time window for transit service and reduce congestion 2425 in lieu of subway suspension royal copeland the city health commissioner staggered workdays by industry so that instead of everyone arriving at work at 900 am some were to come in later or earlier 26 other cities such as seattle washington followed suit in controlling the transmission of influenza within public transit environments by requiring passengers to wear face masks before boarding streetcars figure 1 27interestingly commissioner copeland did not issue an order to close schools or the prohibition of public gatherings at theaters in new york city he stated that his rational to not issue general closing orders and making a public flurry over the situation was to keep down the danger of panic and that he wanted people to go about their business without constant fear and hysterical sense of calamity 29 unlike new york city public gatherings were prohibited and social distancing was encouraged with the closure of theaters movie houses and night schools in other cities namely chicago illinois reno nevada and madison wisconsin 3031 there was also a call for volunteers to help nurse the infirmed in chicago and other cities throughout the united states due to the severe deficit of professional nurses a shortage resulting from the deployment of nurses to military camps and the failure to use trained african american nurses 16 despite the social distancing efforts employed in new york city and chicago philadelphia pennsylvania choose to ignore these initiatives on september 28 1918 the city held its fourth liberty loan drive a parade that gathered over 200000 philadelphians within days after the parade over 1000 people were dead another 200000 cases of influenza were reported every bed in the citys 31 hospitals was filled and the city was forced to close churches schools theaters and all other places of public amusement 223233 a week after the parade 2600 philadelphians had died 34 with the pile up of corpses in philadelphia cold-storage plants were used as temporary morgues and a trolley car manufacturer donated 200 packing crates to be used as coffins 16 by early october single day influenza deaths reached record numbers in philadelphia 289 deathsoctober 6 1918 and new york city 851 deathsoctober 15 1918 22 the virus continued to journey westward to louisiana texas new mexico utah california and washington the wearing of six-ply gauze masks became mandatory in washington and parts of california 1622 for example in san francisco california individuals were fined 5 us dollars usd an equivalent of approximately 85 usd today if they were seized in public without face masks 33 in salt lake city utah officials placed quarantine signs on the doors of 2000 homes where occupants had been infected with influenza 16 the end of the second wave which left its mark as being the deadliest of all three waves coincided with the end of world war i on november 11 1918 1121 as people celebrated armistice day with parades and large gatherings a public health calamity was lurking with an influenza resurgence in some cities 1622 by december 1918 the second wave of the pandemic had passed but the health threat was far from overin australia a third wave erupted in january 1919 and eventually drifted back to europe and the united states 18 there were 1800 cases and 101 deaths reported in the first five days of january in san francisco and on the other side of the country in new york city 706 cases and 67 deaths were reported 16 even though eradication of influenza appeared in louisiana and washington many residents in san antonia texas began complaining that a new surge of influenza cases were not being reported 1622 as a precautionary measure states like massachusetts and illinois began to request special appropriations for the study of influenza treatment and to train women as practical nurses in response to the nursing shortage 16 the nursing shortage was so dire in some areas of the country that the american red cross asked local businesses to grant workers a day off if they volunteered in the hospitals at night 35 the mortality rate of the third wave was just as high as the second wave but the end of the war eliminated the conditions that enabled the rapid and widespread transmission of the virus deaths from the third wave paled in comparison to the annihilation during the second wave 18 with one-quarter of the american population infected with influenza the pandemic was affecting everyone it was believed that president woodrow wilson contracted the virus in april 1919 while negotiating the treaty of versailles to end world war i 18 the pandemic finally came to an end during the summer of 1919 although a very minor fourth wave appeared in spring 1920 throughout isolated areas of new york city the pandemic ended simply because individuals who were infected either died or developed immunity with an estimated death toll of 675000 people in the united states the pandemic lowered the average life expectancy by more than 12 years 10during world war i the worst cases of the influenza pandemic came from overcrowded military barracks and ships with poor ventilation 36 it was quickly found that one way to heal infected wounds was to expose patients to sunlight and open-air in june 1915 sir arthur everett shipley an eminent scientist of the time determined that open-air treatment of infirmed and wounded soldiers at the first eastern general hospital was a success particularly for those with influenza related pneumonia 3738 when the pandemic clinched the united states health officials converted schools halls and large private houses to emergency and open-air hospitals 37 as such open-air hospitals became a common practice by the time of the 1918 pandemic 3940 a combination of outdoor air and sunlight reduced the number of infections and deaths reported at open-air hospitals specifically medics found that regular meals warmth and plenty of fresh air and sunlight helped severely ill patients recover better than indoor nursed patients 41 researchers also revealed that healthcare facilities designed with high ceilings and large windows had the same effect as open-air hospitals 42 accordingly natural ventilation and fresh air was the best way to prevent the transmission of influenza as well as other infectious diseases 43 open-air therapy was one of the popular techniques in dealing with common and often deadly respiratory infections of the time until antibiotics replaced it in the 1950s 44in the absence of a vaccine for novel pathogens and antibiotics to protect against influenza secondary bacterial infections many authorities suggested non-pharmaceutical interventions for the control of a pandemic 4546 social distancing had become the most well-established non-pharmaceutical public health measure to slow the spread of communicable diseases social distancing measures were implemented through the closing of schools restaurants and theaters as well as the banning and restriction of public gatherings and transportation among cities in the united states during the 1918 pandemic 3 the point of initiation duration and decision to relax social distancing measures profoundly impacted mortality rates during this period 47 for example cities such as philadelphia 748 deaths per 100000 at 24 weeks that initiated social distancing measures later and for shorter periods tended to have spikes in deaths and overall higher death rates figure 2 348 in philadelphia the first cases of the influenza appeared on september 17 1918 47 however the philadelphia public health director dr wilmer krusen understated the risk of disease transmission dr krusen assured people that sick soldiers were suffering from casual seasonal influenza which could be avoided by staying warm he allowed large public gatherings notably the fourth liberty loan drive parade on september 28 1918 as mentioned previously as a result philadelphia experienced a mortality acceleration that was 360 higher than the average american city 49 in comparison cities such as minneapolis minnesota 267 deaths per 100000 at 24 weeks that ordered social distancing measures sooner and for longer periods slowed the transmission rate and lowered overall death rates 348 furthermore cities that relaxed social distancing measures prematurely experienced multiple spikes in deaths this was observed in st louis missouri due to its low death rate the city lifted restrictions on public gatherings less than two months after the influenza outbreak began however a sharp and higher spike of new cases soon followed 348 research comparing 17 american cities has suggested that the implementation of early interventions to control the spread of influenza may have significantly decreased the rate of transmission and mortality observed 47 cities across the united states including milwaukee wisconsin and indianapolis indiana had the most effective interventions and reduced transmission rates by up to 3050 50 the lower level of mortality was due to the quick public health response in the first days of the epidemic and the introduction of broad measures designed to promote social distancing 4750initially the american medical community minimized the scale and scope of the influenza pandemic to create a false sense of security in the countrys largest cities including philadelphia 11 yet this was an issue beyond the medical community this was a public health crisis that brought to light urban environment deficiencies namely the proliferation of municipal waste and unsanitary living conditions 51 while not always well understood the presence and threat of infectious diseases has shaped urban planning in the united states during this early 20th century pandemic urban environments in new york city chicago and other american cities were densely populated and characterized by crowded tenement housing in proximity to factories animal yards and slaughterhouses with little airflow or light 452 even before the 1918 influenza outbreak cities were plagued with cholera tuberculosis and typhoid epidemics 4 medical models specifically the miasma theory an idea that diseases were caused by a noxious form of bad air prevailed but there was also a sense that the congestion pollution lack of sunshine and poor airflow contributed to illness 452 in response urban planning efforts introduced zoning to spatially segregate residential commercial and industrial uses and housing regulations to require light and airflow in order to improve overcrowding and unsanitary urban living conditions 452 during the 1918 pandemic urban reformers and engineers again tried to prevent infection by improving waste removal and housing quality and creating technological enhancements to control environmental nuisances and hazards but trivial cooperation from municipal government leadership and interference of the private interest sector often blocked immediate and effective action 51 as a result the schism in the public health community ultimately impacted the lives of millions 53epidemic diseases have not been random events that afflicted societies capriciously and without warning they typically unfold across a wide spectrum of communities that are diverse by race age gender and socioeconomic status 5455 the 1918 pandemic affected the youngest and wealthiest people without any boundaries racially the composition of the country during this time was predominately black and white and up until this point medical and public health reports had documented that african americans suffered higher morbidity and mortality rates for several diseases in comparison to white americans 56 specifically web du bois a prominent sociologist and civil rights activist found through an analysis of the 1900 us census that the african american mortality rates were two to three times higher for several diseases including tuberculosis pneumonia and diarrheal disease in comparison to the white american mortality rates 57 dubois argued that these disparities reflected social conditions and not racial susceptibilities 57 in poor and working-class urban neighborhoods social conditions like overcrowded housing poor sanitation service and unsafe drinking increased the vulnerability of influenza 51 in 1910 the us census set 2500 as the minimum population threshold for the urban category and by the 1920 us census over 50 of the american population was defined as urban 58 before the onset of the pandemic urban environments within american cities were composed of a predominantly 9345 white population 59 during this period more than 90 of the african american population lived in southern parts of the united states but millions began migrating to the north in search of better job opportunities and living conditions 60 with this first great migration from the rural south to northern cities starting in 1910 a larger share of african americans lived in urban areas during the 1918 pandemic 61 still on average and in comparison to white americans fewer african americans less than 5 lived in high population density urban areas which were the epicenters of the outbreak 62 hence the norms of disease morbidity and mortality for african americans changed during the pandemic during the second wave in fall 1918 african americans had lower influenza morbidity and mortality rates but a higher case fatality rate in comparison to the white population 63 this was an unexpected phenomenon as african americans were expected to have higher influenza morbidity and mortality explanations for this 1918 pandemic norm crossover have included 1 an unequal exposure based on where african americans lived eg urban vs rural environments 2 a higher exposure to the less virulent spring wave which provided some african americans with immunity 3 a military segregation which allowed for less crowding among african american soldiers and 4 an underreporting of influenza cases and deaths for african americans 63 while there has been no evidence that the first spring wave was especially rampant in the south to induce a higher influenza exposure among the majority of african americans living in rural southern areas there has been a clear understanding that the first great migration left a large portion of african americans in cramped dilapidated impoverished and segregated conditions with less access to sanitation and urban social programs in northern cities the segregated african american neighborhoods may have functioned as a makeshift quarantine yet in cities such as baltimore maryland and detroit michigan the segregation created crowded urban ghettoes where tuberculosis became one of the top three causes of death among urban african americans 64 individuals with tuberculosis lung damage were more susceptible to influenza which would explain why a higher proportion of african american influenza cases developed pneumonia and also had higher case fatality rates during the second wave 63 the entrenched racial and economic discrimination within the united states seemed to have both protected and endangered african americans to the 1918 pandemicthroughout world war i many doctors had been called into military service and the shortage of the doctors nurses and medical staff caused hospitals to reject patients particularly african americans 56 the american red cross served as the recruiter of nurses for the army with the racial discriminatory practices of the american red cross african american women who tried to gain entry as nurses were rebuffed while the devastation of the pandemic forced the army to drop its ban on african american nurses the racial discrimination still surpassed the need for healthcare in some areas the november 2 1918 edition of the chicago defender reported that the dean of ohios hiram college refused to allow an african american nurse named olive walker to care for influenza patients at the college 5665 african american doctors also found the color line to be rigid in trying to care for white americans during this time 66 racism and legalized segregation restricted african americans and other non-white americans access to healthcare professionals and facilities in cities across the nation african americans received substandard care in segregated hospitals or in confined hospitals that served only african americans many infected people died without seeing a doctor due to the sheer number of bodies that overwhelmed the capacity of hospitals and the heavy burden of the medical staff 67 african american influenza patients exceeded the limit of the frederick douglass memorial hospital one of philadelphias two african american hospitals and pushed the medical director to establish an emergency annex in an african american parochial school 56 in richmond virginia african american patients received care in a hospital basement until the city opened a separate hospital staffed by african americans at an elementary school 5668 the baltimore afro-american newspaper criticized provident hospital the only african american facility in the city for turning patients away 5669 a prohibition on public gatherings that included funerals and wakes prevented families from properly grieving many victims were buried without coffins or were thrown into unmarked burial grounds native americans who practiced different burial practices became exposed to the virus at alarming rates in september 1918 more than 2000 navajos died of influenza in apache county new mexico 22 across the country mass graves were dug to accommodate the pile of corpses 36 african american bodies in particular were neglected by the general public infrastructure in baltimore sanitation department employees refused to dig graves for african american influenza victims after the citys only african american cemetery could not accommodate any more graves 65the 1918 pandemic took a heavy human toll on entire families and communities with the devastation and bereavement violence erupted in some areas people were shot for not wearing masks and rates of homicides and suicides skyrocketed 22 white supremacist ideologies and racist scientific theories advanced bigoted and false notions of the biological physiological and moral inferiority of african americans when they were blamed for the pandemic 56 throughout the first great migration period african americans were highly visible and thought of as diseases the 1918 pandemic heightened these existing prejudices which were further reinforced by contemporary newspaper headlines such as rush of negroes to city starts health inquiry negros arrive by thousandsperil to health or negro influx brings disease 70 the memory of the 1918 pandemic left a lasting blemish on public health planning and practice and reflected the moral relationships and deterioration of humanity during that period the magnitude of events and death with the influenza pandemic have served as a reference point and hopefully as a severe if not worst-case scenarioin december 2019 the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was detected in the wuhan hubei province of the peoples republic of china 71 in the following weeks infections spread across china and other countries around the world 7273 covid-19 was first confirmed to have spread to the united states in january 2020 when a 35-year-old man returned to washington state on january 15 2020 after traveling to visit family in wuhan china was diagnosed 74 on january 30 2020 the first case of person-to-person covid-19 transmission was confirmed in the united states between a married couple after a 60-year-old wife returned from china 75 she subsequently became symptomatic and transmitted the infection to her husband by march 11 2020 there were over 125000 cases and 4500 deaths worldwide 76 as such the world health organization classified the covid-19 outbreak a pandemic as of june 21 2020 there were over two million confirmed cases and 119810 deaths in the united states 77 these numbers however to do include the thousands of americans such as an estimated 5200 people in new york city who died without being tested for covid-19the coronavirus pandemic in the united states which has the highest number of known cases in the world exploded over the course of march and april 2020 at the start of march most of the cases were tied to overseas travel and there was extremely limited testing available in many parts of the country such as in new york maryland indiana north carolina and louisiana there was a period when the number of cases was doubling every 7 to 14 days 77 one precipitating source of community transmission unique to covid-19 has been cruise ships cruise ships have previously been settings for infectious diseases outbreaks because of their compact closed environments contact with travelers from many countries and crew transfers between ships more than 800 confirmed covid-19 cases occurred on the diamond princess and grand princess cruise ship voyages the latter of which sailed roundtrip departing san francisco from february 11 to 7 march 2020 78 four stops were made in mexico voyage a and most of the 1111 crew and 68 passengers from voyage a remained on board for a second voyage that departed san francisco on 21 february 2020 voyage b with a planned return on 7 march 2020 78 a healthcare provider in california reported two patients who had traveled on voyage a with covid-19 symptoms and one of whom with a confirmed positive covid-19 test subsequently more than 20 additional covid-19 cases among voyage a passengers were confirmed in california on 5 march 2020 a centers for disease control and prevention cdc response team was transported by helicopter to the grand princess cruise ship to collect specimens from 45 passengers and crew with covid-19 respiratory symptoms among these 45 individuals 21 467 had positive covid-19 test results which included two passengers and 19 crew members this high attack rate among passengers and crew has been partially attributed to a high proportion of asymptomatic infections until disembarkation passengers and symptomatic crew members were asked to self-quarantine in their cabins and room service replaced public dining when the grand princess cruise ship docked in oakland california on 8 march 2020 everyone was transferred to land-based sites for a 14-day quarantine period as of 21 march 2020 78 166 of 469 persons with available test had positive covid-19 test results additional covid-19 cases linked to several additional cruises were also reported across the united states 78 by 17 march 2020 the cruise lines international association announced a 30-day voluntary suspension of cruise operations in the united states and the cdc issued a level 3 travel warning for all cruise travel to be deferred worldwidethe first preliminary description of outcomes among covid-19 patients in the united states was reported in march 2020 by the cdc this report indicated that fatality was highest in persons aged 85 ranging from 10 to 27 this was then followed by persons aged 6584 years 3 to 11 aged 55-64 years 1 to 3 aged 2054 years 1 and aged 19 years 0 79 pediatric 18 years covid-19 cases less than 2 of the total cases in the united states have demonstrated much milder symptoms and may not even have a cough or fever 80 although severe covid-19 illness leading to hospitalization including intensive care unit icu admission and death can occur in adults of any age 31 of cases 45 of hospitalizations 53 of icu admissions and 80 of deaths have occurred among adults aged 65 years 79 likewise long-term residential care facilities were particularly at risk for covid-19 in washington a female resident of a long-term care skilled nursing facility contracted covid-19 an epidemiologic investigation determined that 129 cases of covid-19 were associated with this facility including 81 residents 34 staff members and 14 visitors the majority of covid-19 cases were women 651 and the median age was 81 years range  54100 years among facility residents 425 years range  2279 years among staff members and 625 years range  5288 years among visitors out of the total 129 covid-19 cases associated with this nursing facility 568 of residents 357 of visitors and 59 of staff members were hospitalized ultimately 23 persons 22 residents and 1 visitor died as a result of covid-19 81 while it is believed that limitations in effective infection control and prevention and staff members working in multiple facilities contributed to the spread within and between facilities the existence of underlying medical conditions has been found to be a very important risk factor among these facility residents the most common chronic underlying conditions were hypertension 691 cardiac disease 568 renal disease 432 diabetes mellitus 370 obesity 333 and pulmonary disease 321 81by mid-march 2020 the entire united states including four territories had reported cases of covid-19 on 7 april 2020 nationwide case doubling time was approximately 65 days yet for areas such as louisiana the doubling time was 55 days 82 moreover during this time louisiana ranked 5th in the nation with approximately 16200 confirmed cases and nearly 700 deaths of which 70 were african american 7783 the explosion of cases in new orleans has been anecdotally linked to the influx of travelers for mardi gras yet this theory does not explain the situation of shreveport another louisiana hotspot for covid-19 cases 84 initially race and ethnicity data were not reported for covid-19 cases but then the covid-19associated hospitalization surveillance network covid-net was created using the existing infrastructure of the influenza hospitalization surveillance network flusurv-net and the respiratory syncytial virus hospitalization surveillance network rsv-net in order to conduct population-based surveillance 85 during the first month 130 march 2020 of surveillance in the united states 1482 patients hospitalized with covid-19 were surveilled among the covid-19 patients with underlying conditions data 893 had one or more underlying medical conditions the most common conditions were hypertension 497 obesity 483 chronic lung disease 346 diabetes mellitus 283 and cardiovascular disease 278 85 hence the majority of persons hospitalized with covid-19 had underlying medical conditions among patients with race and ethnicity data 450 were white 331 were african american 81 were hispanic 55 were asian and 79 were of other or unknown race 85 again considering that african americans only comprise 13 of the united states population the overrepresentation of african american covid-19 cases sheds light on issues that have often been overlookeddr frank m snowden a professor emeritus of history at yale university stated in an interview with the new yorker that epidemics reflect our relationships with the environmentthe built environment that we create and the natural environment that responds 86 communicable diseases have existed in humankind since the days of hunting and gathering but when the shift to a more agrarian life occurred thousands of years ago the formation of communities by way of built environments created ideal conditions for epidemics built environments the man-made settings constructed and operated for the purpose of human activity include the physical sites where humans live and work and range in scale from homes in neighborhoods to buildings in cities some evidence has shown that high occupant density built environments can encourage the transmission of airborne pathogens that can cause the common cold influenza chicken pox whooping cough tuberculosis and even covid-19 because of increased social interactions and direct contact between individuals 87 open interior spaces where there is a high degree of spatial connectivity and more opportunity for social encounters can facilitate the spread of these pathogens as well as others 88 therefore the coronavirus pandemic has put a spotlight on the relationship between built environments pathogenic infections and public healthon march 15 2020 the cdc recommended social distancing also called physical distancing in modern society 798990 most states followed suit and issued stay-at-home orders with detailed directives such as every person is ordered to stay at his or her place of residence except as necessary to perform essential activities and essential activities included grocery shopping obtaining medical prescriptions or service providing care for others or outdoor physical activity 91 many states including maryland and massachusetts prohibited gatherings of more than 10 people and mandated that individuals stay at least six feet apart 91 states throughout the country had ordered most businesses to close banned all non-essential gatherings of any size and implemented telework policies when possible for instance in new york only pharmacies some retailers hospitals manufacturing plants and financial institutions were allowed to open 92 the closure of the schools businesses restaurants without a carry-out or delivery options and leisure activities including theaters and fitness facilities have in essence created an abandonment of many built environment structures many restaurants even with carry-out or delivery options have still needed to cut hours switch to mobile payment systems and create new protocols of operation to face the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic 93 some retailers namely grocery stores have implemented a daily senior shopping hour for this at-risk population and added six feet apart points at checkout lines to help customers maintain a physical distance 9495 amid the coronavirus pandemic companies have enabled work-from-home structures to keep businesses running and assist employees with social distancing compliance nonetheless working remotely has been a growing trend for a while and this pandemic essentially created millions of teleworkers overnight 96 the public transportation infrastructure another essential feature of built environments has also been impacted by the severity of the coronavirus pandemic in compliance with social distancing directives many cities significantly reduced public transit service eg subways buses thereby negatively affecting many individuals needing transit access new yorks metropolitan transit authority closed non-essential lines concentrating resources to transit routes that supported essential personnel and those with urgent personal business 97 new orleans regional transit authority has defined a set of essential destinations and eliminated routes that do not serve these locations 98 the list of essential destinations included only healthcare facilities pharmacies and grocery stores many agencies like the chicago transit authority have also imposed ad-hoc sanitation regimes to minimize the spread of the virus as well as the requirement of face masks for all riders 99 the necessity of these preventative measures were underscored when a detroit city bus driver vented on social media his anger over a coughing bus rider and then subsequently died 11 days later from covid-19 100 in addition to a reduction of public transit in various municipalities throughout the united states the service of commuter trains with amtrak was also disrupted throughout the coronavirus pandemic due to social distancing and shelter-in-place orders on 16 march 2020 amtrak announced a 40 reduction suspension or complete cancellation of various train lines throughout the northeast corridor of the country including the amtrak hartford and winter park express lines 101 amtrak has also required passengers to wear face masks 102 furthermore the department of homeland security dhs issued a notice of arrival restrictions in early march 2020 whereby all airline passengers arriving from china iran and certain european countries were required to travel through one of 13 airports where dhs had established enhanced entry screening capabilities 103 by march 31 2020 the department of state disseminated a global level 4 health advisorydo not travel and advised american citizens to avoid all international travel due to covid-19 104airborne pathogens can be easily transmitted through indoor air and unfortunately indoor environments have not been designed to prevent the rapid dissemination of new diseases 105 ventilation and the pattern of airflow controls the direction of droplet distribution generated from the respiratory activities of building occupants thus it is essential that environments with high occupant density and mobility such as hospitals schools and offices are designed to minimize the spread of airborne infections 105 administrators and building operators have been searching for ways to promote good design and amenity of built environments even before the coronavirus pandemic new design and planning policies were trying to provide achievable guidance to environmental decision-makers building operators and all indoor occupants in an attempt to minimize infectious disease transmission particularly in dense urban environments 106 consequently the new sars-cov-2 virus has made a profound impact on planning environmental laws and urban infrastructures according to the university of oregons biology and the built environment center stringent social distancing measures and building cleaning efforts needed to be put in place to reduce exposure to sars-cov-2 88 moreover a more involved series of strategies including changes to ventilation systems eg increased outside air fractions to improve indoor air and window operations eg open windows to dilute indoor contaminants have also emerged from the research center 88 these modifications as well as architectural techniques combined with public health interventions can be used to efficiently disable diseases virulence and protect occupants in buildings from airborne pathogens 107108classifications and guidelines have shown that filtration as part of the ventilation system is a proven way to block the penetration of the outside pathogens into buildings 109110 filtration can improve the indoor air quality and effectively reduce the pathogen loads released in the air 111112 natural light and ultraviolet lights following proper protocols may also have the ability to inactivate sars-cov-2 88 studies have shown that some viruses are susceptible to ultraviolet germicidal irradiation uvgi factors including humidity airflow patterns uvgi energy intensity and duration have been able to impact uvgi effectiveness in inactivating pathogens 113114115116 indoor humidity levels have also been discovered to be vital in the survivability of covid-19 a research team found that indoor humidity levels of 4060 may help minimize the spread and survival of sars-cov-2 and with little risk of indoor mold growth 88 while most designs of air-conditioning systems have not supported central humidification a targeted in-room humidification may be necessary during episodes of pathogen transmission risk 88the coronavirus pandemic has exposed weaknesses in the american healthcare system specifically the consortium of hospitals there are more than 6000 hospitals with approximately 920000 beds in the united states but even before the pandemic there were fewer doctors and fewer beds per capita than most other developed countries 117118 according to data from the organization for economic cooperation and development the united states has approximately 3 beds per 1000 people 117 the higher rates of hospitalizations for chronic conditions that should not require hospitalization including diabetes mellitus and asthma has compounded the shortage of hospital beds during this pandemic furthermore hospital emergency departments in many areas including rural communities have not been well equipped for modern ailments or the pressures of the coronavirus pandemic 119 designing guidance can aid healthcare facilities and clinics to cope with the increasing volume of covid-19 cases and create small scale segregation rooms 120 the guidance for controlling covid-19 in healthcare settings indicated that patients should be isolated and placed in private rooms with a private bathroom moreover airborne infection isolation rooms should be used for patients who will be undergoing aerosol generating procedures such as intubation or chest compressions 121 to combat the ongoing covid-19 pandemic a dutch architecture firm suggested a studio prototype vital house constructed quickly from sustainable prefabricated wooden materials this vital house a temporary healthcare center could provide icus communication and a large green patio to enable faster patient recovery 122 building pop-up triage tents immediately outside of hospitals has been a solution employed by medical centers throughout the unites states a 14-tent 68-bed hospital in new york citys central park and a 19-feet by 35-feet tent for 40 patients in durham north carolina were constructed exclusively for covid-19 patients when the number of cases needing care exceeded the hospital capacity 123124 these standing tents in empty spaces under hospital overpasses and in proximity to emergency rooms have enabled healthcare workers to rapidly sequester crisis pandemic patients 125another environmental issue that may have amplified covid-19 transmission was the infection of healthcare workers who may have inadvertently spread the disease to patients for example covid-19 was found to have spread across four buildings of life care center a consortium of skilled nursing facilities in washington 126127 the course of events points to inadequate infection prevention and control measures in hospitals and other healthcare facilities stated by the world health organization sars-cov-2 can survive on surfaces for a few hours up to several days for example sars-cov-2 rna was identified on a variety of surfaces in cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers up to 17 days after cabins were vacated on the diamond princess cruise ship but before disinfection procedures had been conducted 78 reducing the number of flat surfaces where germs can sit has been deemed another way to keep pathogens and viruses from transferring between patients and healthcare workers around the building 125 to control germs and bacteria on surfaces designers have often avoided difficult-to-reach areas or tight corners in buildings and overly-complicated designs in high-touch surfaces 128 according to markovitz hospital designers have attempted to find smart materials and infrastructure that can easily be disinfected and washed 125 also certain materials already standardized in healthcare may find application in other public spaces including antibacterial fabrics and finishes non-porous materials that already exist eg copper as well as those that will inevitably be developed to facilitate cleaning and sanitizing 128 moving forward it will also be important for architectures to immediately remove the high-touch design features of buildings 125 some large public spaces such as airports hotels hospitals gyms and offices have begun moving toward more automation to mitigate contagion this coronavirus pandemic has revealed that using technology to remotely control the most-touched surfaces and developing touch-less technology eg automatic doors voice-activated elevators cellphone-controlled hotel room entry hands-free light switches and temperature controls can significantly mitigate the spread of viruses 96much of the united states with the exception of essential workers has undergone nearly three months of social distancing in addition to shelter-in-place orders during the coronavirus pandemic compared to others who are currently employed and working from home essential workers must work outside the home these workers including healthcare workers grocery store staff or transit operators have been more likely to be african american and approximately 70 did not have a college degree 129 furthermore one in four essential workers have said that they or someone in their family is a healthcare worker an employment classification that has been considered essential throughout the united states 129 essential workers have been putting themselves at risk in order to keep others alive and maintain a functioning society through the countrys shelter-in-place orders in addition to this risk many essential workers have also been designated as economically vulnerable one in three essential workers reported living in a household that made less than 40000 usd a year and one in seven lacked health insurance 129 moreover millions of essential workers rely on government assistance programs 130131132 with a lack of options many of these workers cannot afford to quit their jobs in spite of the heightened risk to sars-cov-2 exposure through their employment a polarization has emerged among essential workers as a result of the inherent inequalities that persist within the united states for example there has been a clear economic and social distinction between a salaried pulmonologist who treats the respiratory system of covid-19 patients and an hourly waged grocery store cashier who processes and bags customer purchases yet both are considered essential aside from the difference in wages the highly educated pulmonologist has been socially revered and showered with personal protective equipment campaigns while the grocery store cashier has been largely ignored undervalued and unsupplied with simple face masks it is clear that some essential positions require relatively few educational credentials or certifications and the skills necessary tend to be easy to learn and nontechnical therefore the pool of these particular workers is large and it has been easy for employers to hire and fire these workers at-willwhile simple economic concepts such as supply and demand can only partly account for the polarization of essential workers during the coronavirus pandemic the norms of inequality within the united states contributes to the bulk of the circumstance the jobs of essential workers have been more likely to be held by women people of color and immigrants by the end of april 2019 the cdc reported that there were 4913 essential workers diagnosed with covid-19 in 115 meat or poultry processing facilities throughout 19 states and that 20 people had died 133 it was also disclosed that these processing employees communicated through language and cultural barriers lived in crowded multigenerational housing and commuted to work together likewise workers were incentivized to work through illness thereby indicating a lack of appropriate healthcare options 133 many essential workers have been poorly compensated because they were members of marginalized and underrepresented groups who generally have less political and economic capital compared to the white american male in addition to poor compensation 13 of essential workers lack health insurance and over 30 of these workers would have to borrow money to pay for an unexpected 500 usd medical bill 129 within communities of color many of whom are essential workers as stated previously covid-19 testing inequities have been observed in several areas throughout the country there has been a lack of access to covid-19 walk-up testing as well as widespread testing 134 in some observations it has been reported that physicians may be less likely to refer african americans for covid-19 testing when they arrive with signs of infection 135136137 reasons for this have included the dismissiveness of african american health complaints and the inequitable race-based or income-based hierarchy of patients 138 pilot data have shown that in comparison to white patients african american patients with covid-19 symptoms were six times less likely to receive testing or treatment 138 institutional and structural inequalities fueled by racism sexism and other forms of discrimination have impeded the ability of people of color to secure employment with livable wages healthcare access and insurance and an opportunity for upward mobility plus given the societal expectation that these groups and women in particular provide service and care this type of work has often been undervalued 139 women of color stand at the intersection of multiple oppressive identities and experience the amalgamated effects of racial ethnic and gender biases deep-rooted cultural attitudes and stereotypes about women of color have often devalued their work and deprioritized their needs 139 this has been historically and contemporaneously shown through wage disparities as an example for every dollar earned by full-time year-round working white men hispanic women earn 54 cents and african american women earn 62 cents while white women earn 79 cents 139140 the social distancing industry disruptions have greatly exacerbated the preexisting economic fragility of these women as essential workers many women of color have employment in healthcare or the service industry that places them on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic table 1 139141 although an overwhelming percentage of these women work as housekeeping cleaners 60 nursing assistants 50 and personal care aids 46 women of color also disproportionately work in several industries that have also been hit hardest by pandemic related job losses 139141 women of color and all women comprise 24 54 and 30 80 of the accommodationsfood services and healthcaresocial assistance industries respectively the two hardest hit industries of unemployment as reported by the us department of labor 139142the impact of social distancing is not just limited to economic and social inequalities geographic disparities of covid-19 cases and mortality have been just as alarming compared to other states the first case of covid-19 was not reported in louisiana until march 9 2020 yet as of june 21 2020 with more than 49497 confirmed cases and 3104 deaths louisiana ranked 7th in mortality rate 67 deaths per 100000 people 7783143 these geographic variations do not necessary function exclusively as regional or spatial imbalances but these variations are a manifestation of the residential segregation practices that have been and are still currently held in the united states 144 overwhelmingly at one point 70 of louisianas covid-19 deaths were african american despite this racial group comprising only 32 of the states population 7783145146 although african americans 54 still maintain the highest percentage of covid-19 deaths in louisiana the current racial breakdown of deaths are 44 white 62 of louisiana population 2 latinx 5 of louisiana population and 08 asian 16 of louisiana population 147 since the majority of deaths in louisiana are african americans the intersection of race or racism with this covid-19 epidemiological trend seems to be a strongly suggestive hypothesis of inequality especially since similar trends have been identified throughout the united states including illinois michigan north carolina wisconsin and even in the nations capital washington dc 148149150151 while the exact cause for this racial disproportionality in covid-19 cases and mortality has yet to be uncovered the effect of underlying racial health disparities namely kidney disease asthma diabetes mellitus and obesity that are also risk factors for covid-19 needs to be closely examined 152153154155 the notion that economic and social disparities create and perpetuate health disparities cannot be ignored as discussed previously institutional and structural inequalities have played a significant role in the social determinants of health or the conditions of birth growth living learning working playing and aging for african americans for example several african americans as well as other communities of color tend to live in food transit or recreational deserts more polluted and densely impoverished areas and have been raising children in single-parent households 156157158159160161 these social determinants of health have contributed to poorer covid-19 outcomes additionally many african americans reside in areas where people have been unable to effectively social distance such as prisons and homeless shelters 162 finally systemic racism as a barrier to healthcare treatment for african americans was present well before the coronavirus pandemic research has shown that african americans rate health-related information they receive from family members and churches more highly due to an overarching sense of medical establishment distrust stemming from historical injustices eg tuskegee syphilis experiment among this population 163164165166167 unfortunately this has impeded access to medical care and magnified existing health disparitiesthe coronavirus pandemic has also endangered communities of color through other very recognizable routes of discrimination in early april 2020 the cdc took at 180 degree turn and instructed the use of cloth face coverings such as bandanas without considering the implications of gang affiliation violence or racial profiling 168169 this created a sense of anxiety among communities of color which was not unfounded specifically african american men have been racially profiled when wearing surgical masks in an effort to reduce their covid-19 risk or have expressed a level of psychological distress due to the fear of being racially profiled 170171 a released video showed two african american men with facemask being followed in a walmart store by a police officer in wood river illinois although this incident occurred in march 2020 prior to the cdc face covering recommendation all individuals throughout the country were well within their rights to use self-protecting efforts to reduce their covid-19 risk african americans have not been the only targeted community of color there has been an increase of anti-asian discrimination because of the origination of covid-19 in wuhan china 172 the federal bureau of investigation reported that asian americans were experiencing increased hate crimes due to the coronavirus global outbreak 173 in midland texas three asian american family members including a 2-year-old baby and 6-year-old child were stabbed at a sams club store and the suspect indicated that he attacked the family because he thought the family was chinese and infecting people with the coronavirus 174 also in new york city teenagers attacked a 51-year-old woman on a city bus spewed anti-asian statements and accused her of causing the coronavirus while another 13-year-old allegedly kicked a 59-year-old man for the same racist motives in a separate incident 174 even in the midst of these remarkable times hatred and bigotry have continued to reign in the united statesepidemics are a category of disease that seem to hold up the mirror to human beings as to who we really are that is to say they obviously have everything to do with our relationship to our mortality to death to our lives they show the moral relationships that we have toward each other as people and were seeing that today 86 while there are distinct similarities and differences when comparing the 1918 and 2019 pandemics the historical accounts of the influenza pandemic and the current coronavirus pandemic have demonstrate that poverty inequality and social determinants of health create and support the conditions for disease transmission and the exacerbation of existing health conditions and disparities table 2 175 interestingly the public health response to both pandemics albeit tempered by varying levels of political resistance impacted human behavior through mandated social distancing or the use of face masks however unlike the influenza pandemic widespread daily protests and demonstrations within at least 140 american cities and throughout the world completely eclipsed and overshadowed public health orders for social distancing and public gathering prohibition during the coronavirus pandemic 176177 these protests rallied against the systemic police brutality of african americans specifically the killing of george floyd by minneapolis police and in support of the black lives matter movement 176177 this unique moment in history has illustrated the convergence of two public health crises 1 coronavirus pandemic 2 african american genocide both of which are impacted by the annihilation of institutional structural systematic and systemic racism within the united states as a new normal for post covid-19 is reimagined the fundamental dynamics and entrenched ideologies of acceptable living and equality for all need to be addressed and strongly reexamined in order for the country to move forwardsocial distancing and shelter-in-place orders have been in place throughout the country since approximately the middle of march 2020 this has bought the country some time to curb the spread of the virus limit the number of covid-19 cases and deaths reduce the healthcare system strain and allow a reflection for the preparation of the next phase 178 following the pandemic containment and mitigation phases the third suppression phase which allows for a slow emergence from the quarantine status requires essential elements in order to prevent an ascent of covid-19 infections 178 the elements include measurable benchmarks with surveilling epidemiological trends eg decline in covid-19 deaths for 14 days fortifying the healthcare system eg sufficient personal protective equipment for all healthcare workers and transforming public health infrastructure eg demonstrated ability to convey social distancing recommendations that change behavior in most residents 178179 once these elements have been implemented aspects of social distancing can be relaxed yet the old normal of living still cannot return and most likely will not return during the initial reopening of establishments gatherings should still be capped at 10 people and restaurants will need to adopt social distancing seating to welcome patrons however it is recommended by governmental and public health officials that individuals over 60 years of age and those who are medically vulnerable continue to shelter-in-place until the final phase of reopening 180 a staggered or partial reopening approach with new environmental safeguards such as temperature and ventilation checks and mandatory handwashingsanitizing at every entry and periodically throughout the day may be used for schools and businesses 179 there also may need to be a quarantine of travelers from high prevalence covid-19 areas governmental regulations may institute proof of immunity documentation or spending fourteen days in isolation before entering a new country for travelers beyond a successful initial reopening and after at least four weeks of no significant increase in new covid-19 cases the six feet social distancing measure may be paused but there should still be a ban on gatherings which exceed 50 people until four months after the initial reopening 179 throughout these phase transitions it is critical for all public health leaders political administrators and the overall general public to work together in order to control mitigate and eradicate covid-19 as stated by secretary-general antnio guterres of the united nations the coronavirus pandemic is a public health emergency that became an economic social and human rights crisis specifically by working together and respecting human rights in this time of crisis more effective and inclusive solutions for the emergency of today and the recovery for tomorrow can be achieved 181even with a new kind of normalcy everyone may still practice consistent and better hygiene with handwashing coughing and sneezing and greet and interact with each other differently 178 people may need to create new ways of meeting with friends and colleagues impressively within the past couple of decades the sharing economy has expanded and created environments with new components of how multiple people share the same spaces these shared spaces including co-work environments eg wework rooms in homes eg airbnb cars eg uber bikes eg capital bikeshare and other elements of the built environment which can increase the potential and opportunities for environmentally mediated pathways of pathogen exposure will need to be reexamined 182 the coronavirus pandemic also may accelerate the development of risk-mitigating efforts designed to reduce human-to-human interactions upgrade building ventilation and physical barriers and adopt automation technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence vision systems 183 given the severity of the pandemic and in compliance with social distancing directives many american cities significantly reduced public transit service as mentioned previously while agencies like the chicago transit authority implemented sanitation regimes to minimize the spread of the covid-19 many transit agencies may move to a new standard where face masks will always be required once anyone boards a train or bus 99 while social distancing measures prompted organizations to embrace videoconferencing virtual classrooms and telemedicine these types of interactions may become more of the norm moving forward with the fear of contagion companies have shifted their protocols of operation prior to the coronavirus pandemic many businesses were already abandoning cash payments and in the wake of the outbreak many more may permanently switch to digital only paymentsstructural building modifications eg voice-activated elevators or environmental adjustments eg telework capabilities may be a much easier acclimatization for many americans in the wake of a post covid-19 existence yet changing perceptions attitudes and behaviors that have been deeply entrenched in the american way of living will be a much more challenging hill to climb issues surrounding injustices related to many social determinants of health are not new and this pandemic has just illuminated these issues the overwhelmingly disproportion covid-19 mortality rates of african americans only highlights the need to address longstanding inequalities racism in the united states has created inequality in access to healthcare housing wealth education and employment all of which are social determinants of health that can either promote or undermine ones health and longevity in order to move forward racism needs to be addressed and there needs to be new and tailored approaches to reach those who have been disadvantaged as well as the circumstances that have been generated through racist ideologies practices and politices for instance when louisiana initially launched drive-through testing an african american 90-year-old woman walked a mile in the heat to get tested 184 this demonstrated that this covid-19 testing site was not accessible to many individuals who do not have cars or who live in transit deserts or who cannot afford private transit upon learning this public health officials targeted zip codes with the highest rates of covid-19 reported deaths and deployed testing in those areas population-based testing and contact tracing during this pandemic has been vital in order to predict where to allocate resources control the spread of the virus and implement evidence-based interventions to high-risk areas however evidence-based interventions are only achievable when there are accurate data and evidence it was not until early april 2020 that the cdc began including race and ethnicity data in its morbidity and mortality weekly report 85 many states have yet to release demographic data on deaths while sars-cov-2 may be exploiting inequalities in the united states this virus similar to past as well as future pathogens does not discriminate by race or any other social construct that man has created if covid-19 is not contained in the most vulnerable populations it will continue to spread to all communities and alter the future of human existence
this pesky flus all over town and white and black and rich and poor are all included in its tour 185author unknownprose poem on the 1918 influenza pandemicfor thousands of years disease outbreaks have devastated societies and the 2019 coronavirus pandemic is no different as densely populated and urban environmental conditions shaped the 1918 influenza pandemic the experience of the current day coronavirus pandemic is quite similar while the influenza and coronavirus pandemics occurred nearly a century apart there is one similarity of these events that is undeniable the public health response to disease outbreaks has remained virtually unchanged with social distancing and face covering efforts unfortunately the role of human behaviors and social ideologies stemmed from the darker side of humanity on the effect and response to the coronavirus pandemic has also not progressed considerably this review has revealed how the american burden of inequalities and injustices as related to environments and human behavior significantly impacts morbidity and mortality rates among the most vulnerable communities as observed with the 1918 influenza pandemic the present-day coronavirus pandemic has revealed and exposed the many inequalities that inhabit the united states however an opportunity has been presented which can allow for improvements advancements and an overall social uplift of our societychina reported a novel coronavirus in wuhan hubei province on december 31 2019 gralinski and menachery 2020 wuhan is an urban town located in the central part of china it is a significant transportation and business hub suspected and confirmed cases began to appear in various parts of the state china shared the novel coronavirus pneumonia gene sequence in january 12 2020 as of january 22 2020 571 cases of covid-19 had been reported in 25 provinces including districts and cities in china lu 2020 the patients showed typical respiratory symptoms such as fever coughing shortness of breath and inflammatory lung infiltration and other symptoms such as fatigue myalgia and diarrhea huang et al 2020 some cases were atypical or showed asymptomatic symptoms in this epidemic on february 11 2020 the world health organization who named this pneumonia coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 as of april 13 2020 novel coronavirus pneumonia cases were confirmed in 200 countries and regions worldwide the case fatality rate cfr of covid-19 was 23 441023 much lower than that of sars 10 and mers 36 de wit et al 2016 wu and mcgoogan 2020 suspected covid-19 patients with symptoms could be diagnosed by chest ct and polymerase chain reaction pcr kit however there were no specific effective antiviral drugs for treatment and the vaccine was still in the experimental stage zumla et al 2016humans have a very old but extremely effective way to respond to sudden outbreaks of infectious diseasesisolation the core of the infectious disease outbreak lies in its infectivity it can be transmitted directly or indirectly from a person to one or more people li 2020 if a person who has the disease cannot spread it to more than one person the disease will gradually disappear like other viruses such as sars and mars although each infectious disease has its new characteristics prevention and control involve three factors the pathogen transmission route and susceptible population there are three core elements of isolation find and manage the source of infection cut off the transmission channels protect vulnerable groups mikulska 2019in china the state took decisive measures to implement medical isolation for patients and close contacts block traffic cancel public activities and require people to wear masks and frequently wash their hands strong control measures were implemented in cities such as wuhan where the source of infection was concentrated while other provinces and cities also conducted careful screening and isolation of the exported cases interestingly after this strategy was identified the provinces and areas responded positively and quickly the residential areas also formulated relevant travel systems using social software to control the travel of each resident and the flow of people between different areas was also strictly controlled for example one person from every family could go out every 2 days to purchase necessities in public places the distance between people in line needed to be  2 m express delivery and takeout also allowed contactless delivery research showed that social distancing measures were most effective when large-scale return to work took place in early april this reduced the median number of infections by 92 iqd 6697 and 24 iqd 1390 in mid-2020 and by the end of 2020 respectively prem et al 2020 this time compared with the sars outbreak in 2003 the situation was more complicated including the time of the outbreak in the geographical location of wuhan because of movement related to the spring festival but highly effective control of the spread of the pandemic was shown in chinasocial distancing involved keeping a distance of 15 m between people which can prevent the spread of most respiratory infectious diseases social distancing is one of the most effective measures to reduce the spread of the virus which is transmitted by air droplets the droplets produced by coughing sneezing or forced speaking have a certain transmission distance by keeping this distance we can reduce the spread of the virus wearing masks washing hands frequently and disinfecting with alcohol also help to prevent the virus from spreading from one person to another to control the disease the world health organization recommended that countries should strengthen case detection track and monitor contacts practice isolation from close contacts and isolate cases as well as implement traffic control and suspend large gatherings a novel coronavirus pneumonia prediction model was established by using the big data of the university of washington health index and evaluation center ihme ihme 2020 analysis of the epidemic situation in seven locked down cities in wuhan italy and spain showed that maintaining social distancing really achieved results because these cities implemented lockdowns the epidemic quickly reached a peak so far not climbing again erin mordecai a biologist at stanford university and a team of researchers developed an interactive simulator to simulate the spread of covid-19 over time demonstrating the role of social isolation and social distancing in epidemic control erin 2020notably the government quickly adopted the correct strategy eg social distancing thus controlling the rate of the increase of cases and winning more time for doctors if this had not been the case it would have been impossible for medical staff from another provinces to go to wuhan for support and wuhan appeared to be the only outbreak city in terms of cost social distancing also saves medical resources such as masks hand sanitizers alcohol-based disinfectant etc this gives our healthcare professionals hospitals and other institutions more valuable time to prepare prevent the disease and help people who have been diagnosed with coronavirus there were 50633 confirmed cases in hubei on february 18 2020 because of a peak after the closure of the city then the number of cases began to decline as of april 13 the number of confirmed cases in hubei province was 244however there are objections to social distancing thomas abel reported that social distancing might lead to depression and anxiety in some people abel and mcqueen 2020 and that social distancing measures are not appropriate in this situation because they will cause more panic and anxiety among people which will also have an impact on social stability of course this crisis has psychological impacts on patients health care workers and the population however we should routinely provide psychological support instead of stopping social distancing measures kim and su 2020the way novel coronavirus pneumonia is transmitted means that taking certain social distance measures is the most effective practice to prevent and control the disease whos south east asia region director poonam khetrapal singh found that we could reduce the virus transmission by following social distancing measures the spread of this disaster is global to fight the epidemic people from all countries need to unite to see the coming of hopethe first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 in china outside of hubei province was addressed with the implementation of aggressive public health measures1 these measures relied heavily on massive mobility restrictions universal fever screening in all settings and neighbourhood-based household-focused social distancing that was enforced by large teams of community workers as well as pervasive deployment of artificial intelligence-based social media applications and the use of big data2 whether some or all of these measures would be acceptable and feasible in settings outside of mainland china has been questioned3
hong kong is a special administrative region of china that operates with a large degree of autonomy it is located outside the mainland on the southern coast of china neighbouring guangdong provincewhich has recorded the largest number of confirmed cases of covid-19 1490 cases as of march 31 2020 outside of hubei having been one of the most heavily affected epicentres during the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic in 2003 the community in hong kong has been prepared to respond to emerging infectious diseases a range of public health measures have been implemented to delay and reduce local transmission of covid-19 and there have been major changes in population behaviourthe initial containment or current suppression measures used to control covid-19 in hong kong include intense surveillance for infections not only in incoming travellers but also in the local community with around 400 outpatients and 600 inpatients tested each day in early march 2020 once individuals are identified to be positive for covid-19 they are isolated in hospital until they recover and cease virus shedding their close contacts are traced from 2 days before illness onset and quarantined in special facilities including holiday camps and newly constructed housing estates because not every infected person will be identified containment measures only work if social distancing measures or behavioural changes also reduce so-called silent transmission in the community as a whole
research in context
evidence before this study
coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 was first identified in late december 2019 in a cluster of cases of atypical pneumonia in wuhan infections increased through january until the implementation of a lockdown of wuhan and other affected cities since january 2020 covid-19 cases have been reported outside china in increasing numbers with many countries not taking strong control measures such as lockdowns until relatively larger numbers of cases had been reported in hong kong singapore and taiwan public health measures to prevent community epidemics were quickly implemented and were able to avoid the need for complete lockdowns we searched pubmed on march 31 2020 for studies reporting the impact of alternative public health measures against covid-19 using keywords including covid-19 2019-ncov novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia sars-cov-2 lockdown social distancing isolation contact tracing and quarantine we scanned 227 published studies and found six that estimated the impact of public health measures in wuhan or elsewhere in mainland china one study that described the early application of testing and contact tracing in singapore and one study reporting the impact of quarantine on transmission on the diamond princess cruise ship
added value of this study
we estimated the effective reproduction number of covid-19 in hong kong as a measure of transmissibility over time and found that it has remained at approximately 1 for the past 8 weeks we described the public health measures that have been introduced to contain covid-19 transmission and the behavioural changes reported by the population and found that distancing measures and changes in behaviour were associated with rapid declines in influenza activity the speed of decline in influenza activity in 2020 was quicker than in previous years in which school closures were implemented but there were no other social distancing measures or voluntary changes in behaviour
implications of all the available evidence
the experience in hong kong indicates that covid-19 transmission can be contained with a combination of testing and isolating cases plus tracing and quarantining their close contacts along with some degree of social distancing to reduce community transmission from unidentified cases
hong kong offers an opportunity to study the impact of public health interventions and population behavioural changes that could be rolled out in resource-sufficient settings in other countries we aimed to quantify the effect of containment measures on covid-19 in addition to identify whether social distancing and behavioural changes have been associated with reducing silent transmission of covid-19 we analysed data on influenza activity as a proxy for potential changes in transmission of infection in line with the interventions implemented assuming a similar mode and efficiency of spread of influenza and covid-19 the specific objective of this study was to quantify population behavioural changes in hong kong during the covid-19 outbreak and to describe the likely impact of the behavioural changes and public health measures on covid-19 transmission and influenza transmission in the communitydata on laboratory-confirmed covid-19 cases were obtained from the hong kong centre for health protection which provides daily updates with individual case data on a dedicated webpagewe obtained sentinel surveillance data on influenza-like illnesses in a network of around 60 general outpatient clinics from the centre for health protection these include weekly reports on the proportion of outpatient consultations that were in patients with influenza-like illness defined as fever plus cough or sore throat we obtained laboratory surveillance data from the public health laboratory services on influenza testing results on specimens from public hospitals and sentinel surveillance sites including the weekly number of specimens tested and the number testing positive for influenza by type and subtype data on the current population of hong kong by age and sex were obtained from the census and statistics department of the hong kong government we obtained the daily hospitalisation rates for influenza-positive cases among children in hong kong using the daily hospital admissions for influenza to the paediatric departments of two large hospitals in hong kong and the relevant catchment populations4
we did three cross-sectional telephone surveys among the general adult population in hong kong on jan 2023 feb 1114 and march 1013 2020 the methods and survey instruments used were similar to those used for surveys during the sars epidemic in 20035 6 the influenza a h1n1 pandemic in 20097 and the influenza a h7n9 outbreak in china in 20138 participants were recruited using random-digit dialling of both landline and mobile telephone numbers telephone numbers were randomly generated by a computer system calls were made during both working and non-working hours by trained interviewers to avoid over-representation of non-working groups respondents were required to be at least 18 years old and able to speak cantonese chinese or english new respondents were recruited for each survey round within each household an eligible household member with the nearest birthday was invited to participate in the survey which was not necessarily the person that initially answered the telephone survey items included measures of risk perception attitudes towards covid-19 and behaviours taken against contracting covid-19 including hygiene face masks and reduction of social contact in the second and third surveys respondents who were parents of school-age children were asked to answer additional questions about social contact patterns of their children because schools were closed at the time of the interviews ethical approval for this study was obtained from the institutional review board of the university of hong kong all participants gave verbal informed consentmeans and proportions of survey responses were directly weighted by sex and age to the general population categorical variables with ordinal likert-type response scales including risk perception and attitudes towards covid-19 were first dichotomised as either above or below a threshold responses to perceived susceptibility were dichotomised as 1 likely very likely or certain versus 0 never very unlikely unlikely or even chance responses to perceived severity were dichotomised as 1 serious or very serious versus 0 very mild mild or moderate responses about worry were dichotomised as 1 moderately worried or very worried versus 0 not at all worried or slightly worried responses about attitudes towards covid-19 were dichotomised as 1 agree or strongly agree versus 0 strongly disagree disagree or neutralwe estimated changes in covid-19 transmissibility over time via the effective reproduction number r
t which represents the mean number of secondary infections that result from a primary case of infection at time t values of r
t exceeding 1 indicate that the epidemic will tend to grow whereas values below 1 indicate that the epidemic will tend to decline we estimated the time-varying reproduction numbers from serial intervals and incidence of covid-19 cases over time9 10 assuming a serial interval of 75 days11 we extended the approach used by thompson and colleagues10 to allow for undetected cases due to censoring and imperfect detection of local cases we assumed that 99 of imported cases and 80 of local cases would be detected we developed a data-augmented markov chain monte carlo algorithm to jointly estimate the time-varying reproduction number the delay distribution from onset to reporting which can be used to inform censoring and undetected cases time-varying estimates of reproduction numbers were made with a 7-day sliding windowto measure changes in influenza transmissibility over time we first calculated the influenza proxy12 13 for influenza a h1n1 during the 201920 winter by multiplying the weekly influenza-like illness consultation rates by the weekly proportions of specimens positive for influenza a h1n1 which was the predominant strain this influenza proxy is a better correlate of the incidence of influenza virus infections in the community than either influenza-like illness rates or laboratory detection rates alone13 we interpolated daily influenza proxy values from the weekly influenza proxy values with use of flexible cubic splines14
using the daily influenza proxy we estimated daily transmissibility via the daily effective reproduction number r
t we used a simple branching process model for epidemic spread to estimate the time-varying intensity of transmission15 we assumed the serial interval distribution for influenza followed a gamma distribution with a mean of 285 days and sd of 093 days16 we repeated these analyses for the daily influenza a h1n1 hospitalisation rates among children in two large local hospitals queen mary hospital and princess margaret hospital we evaluated the changes in transmissibility by comparing the r
t values during the 2 weeks before and after the start of the school closures including the chinese new year holidays for the 201920 winter influenza season the 95 cis for the change in r
t were calculated using fiellers theorem17 we compared the reductions in 201920 with reductions in previous years when the chinese new year holidays occurred during influenza epidemics all analyses were done with r version 362the funder of the study had no role in study design data collection data analysis data interpretation or writing of the report the corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publicationas of march 31 2020 hong kong had confirmed 715 cases of sars coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection including 386 individuals that were presumed to have acquired infection outside of hong kong imported cases 142 cases that could not be linked to any other case unlinked local cases and 187 cases that were linked to the other known cases secondary cases appendix p 1 among these 715 cases of sars-cov-2 infection 94 were asymptomatic infections and 621 were symptomatic infections figure 1
shows the timeline of interventions that were implemented by the government in hong kong including travel restrictions and bans flexible working arrangements and school closures from kindergartens up to tertiary and post-tertiary institutions including tutorial centres some religious organisations cancelled services from feb 13 onwards and many conferences and other local mass gatherings have been cancelled quarantine orders have been issued to the close contacts of individuals with confirmed infection as well as travellers arriving from affected countries figure 1although unlinked covid-19 cases have been detected in increasing numbers since early march transmissibility r
t remains around the critical threshold of 1 figure 2
 increases in local cases could be attributed to the transmission of infections into the community resulting from an increasing number of imported infections since early march with a local effective reproduction number of 1 a gradual increase in the incidence of local infections would be expecteddata on influenza activity based on the community influenza proxy were consistent with the rate of hospitalisation of children with influenza a h1n1 in hong kong figure 3a b
 influenza incidence peaked in the third week of january with influenza a h1n1 predominating and declined to low levels by the second week of february the r
t for influenza a h1n1 gradually declined from the second week of january but was greater than 1 before the start of the school closures and chinese new year the r
t then declined to less than 1 shortly after the school closures and continued to decrease until early february figure 3c d the estimated r
t was 128 95 ci 126130 during the 2-week period before the start of the school closures and 072 070074 during the first 2 weeks of school closures corresponding to a 44 3453 reduction in transmissibility figure 3c similarly the r
t calculated from hospitalisation data was 110 106112 before the start of the school closures and reduced to 073 068077 after school closures corresponding to a 33 2443 reduction in transmissibility figure 3din comparison during the 201011 winter we estimated the reduction in transmissibility of influenza associated with the chinese new year holidays to be 15 95 ci 1119 declining from an r
t of 110 108113 in the 11-day period before the start of the school holidays to 095 092096 during the 11-day school holiday figure 4
 in the 201415 winter the reduction in transmissibility associated with the chinese new year holidays was 14 722 declining from an r
t of 094 093096 in the 11-day period before the start of the school holidays to 081 075086 during the 11-day school holidaywe interviewed 1008 participants on jan 2023 22 response rate 1000 participants on feb 1114 23 response rate and 1005 participants on march 1013 response rate 15 appendix p 3 respondents included a broad cross-section of the adult population of hong kong appendix p 2 respondents perceived that they had similar susceptibility to covid-19 as they did to seasonal influenza but that covid-19 was a much more serious infection and around half of the respondents reported worrying about being infected with covid-19 compared with around a third of respondents for seasonal influenza table
 in survey 2 764 of respondents agreed with the statement that complete border closure would be effective in preventing the spread of covid-19 to hong kong 841 were worried about the availability of medical supplies including face masks but only 277 were worried about the availability of living supplies including food and household goods in hong kong tablewe identified considerable increases in the use of preventive measures in response to the threat of covid-19 in recent years face masks have mainly been used by individuals in the general community who are ill and by those who feel particularly susceptible to infection and want to protect themselves we found that 745 975 and 988 of respondents wore masks when going out 613 902 and 851 avoided going to crowded places and 711 925 and 930 reported washing or sanitising their hands more often in surveys 1 2 and 3 respectively table in surveys 2 and 3 880 and 838 reported staying at home as much as possiblein surveys 2 and 3 we asked the subset of respondents who were parents of school-age children about their support for school closures and the activities of their children during the school closures among respondents who were parents 249 954 of 261 and 192 937 of 205 agreed or strongly agreed that school closure was needed as a control measure for covid-19 in hong kong and 209 801 of 261 and 141 688 of 205 responded that their children had no contact with people other than their household members on the preceding dayour findings suggest that the package of public health interventions including border entry restrictions quarantine and isolation of cases and contacts and population behaviour changes such as social distancing and personal protective measures that hong kong has implemented since late january 2020 is associated with reduced spread of covid-19 in the 10 weeks corresponding to about ten generation times since the first known individual with covid-19 in hong kong began to show symptoms there has been little sustained local transmission of the disease our findings strongly suggest that social distancing and population behavioural changesthat have a social and economic impact that is less disruptive than total lockdowncan meaningfully control covid-19the increasing number of imported infections in march poses a challenge to suppression efforts this increase has occurred at the same time as relaxation of some voluntary avoidance behaviours in the general community without a strengthening of social distancing measures local infections are likely to continue to occur given that the effective reproduction number is approximately 1 or slightly higher than 1 travel measures and testing tracing and treating efforts are particularly important in maintaining suppression although these measures will be increasingly difficult to implement as case numbers increasein addition to the identification of cases with isolation contact tracing and quarantine social distancing has also likely played an important role in suppressing transmission we found that control measures and changes in population behaviour coincided with a substantial reduction in influenza transmission in early february 2020 this observation suggests that the same measures would also have affected covid-19 transmission in the community because there will be some similaritiesas well as some differencesin the modes of transmission of influenza and covid-19 the potentially higher basic reproduction number for covid-19 indicates that it might be more difficult to control than influenza11 because a variety of measures were used simultaneously we were not able to disentangle the specific effects of each one although this may become possible in the future if some measures are strengthened or relaxed locally or with use of cross-national or subnational comparisons of the differential application of these measuresthe estimated 44 reduction in influenza transmission in the general community in february 2020 was much greater than the estimated 1015 reduction in transmission associated with school closures alone during the 2009 pandemic18 and the 16 reduction in transmission of influenza b associated with school closures during the 201718 winter in hong kong19 we therefore estimate that the other social distancing measures and avoidance behaviours have had a substantial effect on influenza transmission in addition to the effect of school closures however if the basic reproduction number of covid-19 in hong kong exceeds 2 it was 22 in wuhan11 we would need more than a 44 reduction in covid-19 transmission to completely avert a local epidemic a reduction of this magnitude could however substantially flatten the peak of and area under the epidemic curve thus reducing the risk of exceeding the capacity of the health-care system and potentially saving many lives especially among older adultsthe postponement of class resumption in local schools in hong kong after the chinese new year holiday is technically a class dismissal or suspension rather than a school closure because most teachers are still required to go to school premises to plan e-learning activities and set homework full school closures have been implemented locally in previous years including during the sars epidemic in 20036 during the influenza pandemic in 200918 and to control seasonal influenza epidemics in 2008 and 201819 20 although school closures can have considerable effects on influenza transmission their role in reducing covid-19 transmission would depend on the susceptibility of children to infection and their infectiousness if infected both of these factors are major unanswered questions at present21 22 despite this acknowledged uncertainty our surveys revealed considerable local support for school closuresindividual behaviours in the hong kong population have changed in response to the threat of covid-19 people have been choosing to stay at home and in our most recent survey 85 of respondents reported avoiding crowded places and 99 reported wearing face masks when leaving home using similar surveys face mask use during the sars outbreak in 2003 was 795 and it reached a maximum of 10 during the influenza a h1n1 pandemic in 20097 these changes in behaviour indicate the level of concern among the population about this particular infection and the extent of voluntary social distancing in addition to the distancing created by school closures however we did identify evidence of reductions in voluntary social distancing behaviours in our third survey in march perhaps indicating some fatigue with these measuresour study has some limitations first we could not identify which measure was potentially the most effective and whether border restrictions quarantine and isolation social distancing or behavioural changes are most important in suppressing covid-19 transmission it is likely that each plays a part unlinked cases have been identified in the community and will continue to be identified indicating that not every chain of transmission has been identified by contact tracing from known cases although we have noted major effects of control measures and behavioural changes on influenza transmission the effects could be of a different magnitude for covid-19 because of differences in transmission dynamics second our surveys of population behaviours could have been affected by response bias because we relied on self-reported data they also could have been affected by selection bias away from working adults although this should have been reduced by conducting surveys in non-working as well as working hourswe were unable to assess potential selection bias without a baseline survey before jan 23 2020 we could not compare changes in behaviours although the results of similar surveys from previous epidemics can be used for comparison6 7 8 11 finally although we identified reductions in the incidence of influenza virus infections in outpatients and paediatric inpatients it is possible that these time series were affected by reduced health-care-seeking behaviours and limited health-care access that probably resulted from private clinic closure which occurred around the period of the chinese new year holidayin conclusion our study suggests that measures taken to control the spread of covid-19 have been effective and have also had a substantial impact on influenza transmission in hong kong although the transmission dynamics and modes of transmission of covid-19 have not been precisely elucidated they are likely to share at least some characteristics with influenza virus transmission because both viruses are directly transmissible respiratory pathogens with similar viral shedding dynamics23 the measures implemented in hong kong are less drastic than those used to contain transmission in mainland china and are probably more feasible in many other locations worldwide if these measures and population responses can be sustained avoiding fatigue among the general population they could meaningfully mitigate the impact of a local epidemic of covid-19data on the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 and influenza activity are freely available from the centre for health protection website httpswwwchpgovhkenindexhtml survey data are available from the corresponding author on requesta 2019 novel coronavirus disease covid-19 broke out initially in china and spread globally with such speed and dire effects that the world health organization declared it a public health emergency of international concern in january of this year world health organization 2020 covid-19 attacks the respiratory system more aggressively than other circulating coronaviruses that cause common cold-like illness and presents pronounced health risks of many sorts because there is not yet any pre-existing immunity available vaccine or proven treatment an airborne virus it spreads easily through human contact and has triggered exponential growth in cases hospitalizations and deaths around the globe the actual extent of the virus can only be estimated as the affected can be contagious during lengthy asymptomatic incubation periods with only mild flu symptomsraging spread has resulted in an ongoing global pandemic that at the time of writing has resulted in well over eight million cases and 454000 deaths worldwide with over two million cases and nearly 130000 deaths in the united states that certainly will be considerably higher by time this issue is in print the capacity of countries health systems to respond to the pandemic the extent of testing and reporting transparency vary considerably across and within countries so data is more approximate than exact the virus is truly worldwide and apt to linger over multiple waves with china italy iran india the united kingdom and most recently brazil and russia joining the list headed by the united states as the most plagued nations per johns hopkins covid-19 dashboard statistics not since the influenza of 1918 has the world experienced such a widespread pandemic so there is only a minimal experiential reference base to guide an informed responseas the coronavirus impacts almost every part of public and professional life social scientists have quickly pivoted to collect real-time data on a vast range of pandemic issues the effects of limited human contact contraction anxiety unemployment and heightened domestic strife are but a few topics of interest to psychologists and public health researchers economists have unprecedented disruptions to employment and to supply chains and related market implications to address and political scientists have pandemic politics wherein virtually every government position involves a tradeoff between protecting public health and reinvigorating the economy  a reality only magnified by the media during this election year adolph et al 2020for criminology and criminal justice the new normal of virus life presents a flood of similarly complex choices between protecting public safety and protecting the health of those under control of the criminal justice system as well as those working in it most pundits anticipate the virus will drive increases in some types of crime eg commercial burglary resulting from absenteeism effecting lack of guardianship while retarding others eg residential burglary per increased home presence and guardianship that increased domestic violence will ostensibly reflect the limits of social isolation and that the justice apparatus will be challenged topics representing but a fraction of crime and justice research focinational themed social problems tend to invite quick descriptions of phenomena and fast research conclusions toward crafting solutions a handful of empirical works for example have already reported early data on covid-19 crime and justice topics brantigham 2020 payne  morgan 2020 mohler et al 2020 and gerell  kindgren 2020 but similar to the time realities of vaccine approval high quality applied research takes time and ideally employs mixed methods which means qualitative as well as quantitative data collection and analysis usually facilitated through site visits that per the virus are largely suspended in general and altogether at detention facilities this is not to say that early research is wrong necessarily lacks rigor or consequence but first look explorations of phenomena do not always represent realities accurately and are typically too limited from which to make strong policy generalizations in that research shapes policy positions and practices it is prudent to move forward cautiously rather than invest too heavily on sole studies without replicated resultperhaps the most direct impact of the pandemic on the criminal justice system results from the concern over contagion of covid-19 among the individuals the system controls in prisons and jails which arrestees should be sent to jail awaiting trial and which should be released into the community for people convicted should they be incarcerated or released on probation of people serving time in prison which ones can be safely released into the community either because of their high risk if infected or because4 of their low risk of committing crime on the outside these decisions of pretrial release probation and parole have traditionally been addressed daily but they could well take a different form in the context of the virus the concern about contagion puts additional weight favoring release in order to reduce the density in the inevitably crowded prison or jail environmentsthe two foremost focal concepts of the covid-19 pandemic are contagion and containment these interrelated ideas posit arenas of case confirmation and reaction around the objective of minimizing contagion and propagation shelter-in-place epitomizes the national response of social distancing - a universal mandate of separation for everyone to stay at home and prohibition of aggregation of more than a specified number of people but these vary across and even within states - thereby canceling sporting events and entertainment events shutting down restaurants all non-essential businesses and meetings of all sorts stay-home policies and closing of significant portions of the economy has spiked unemployment social isolation and competition for basic needs while forcing home schooling and virtual workplaces drastically altered daily life due to virus rules and compliance enforcement ranging from response to defiance of stay-at-home orders and restrictions on public gatherings and punishment for assault of medical workers usually through coughing spitting or sneezing all these have fostered anomalous responses presenting a wide array of situational and global consequences that raise important research questions regarding individual and programmatic effectscontainment measures then are strategies implemented as social ordinances designed to limit transmission of the virus among individuals there is unsurprisingly a great deal of variation in the ways in which different countries states and cities have approached the pandemic and the types of containment measures they have employed and then the timing and type of relief from those measures as the viruses impacts are diminished lack of a unified national strategy contributes to the considerable cross-state variation in the initiation and growth patterns of virus severity and of deaths in the united states and in regional variations in virus severity but without question has resulted in containment measures and their alleviation that vary wildly from state to state and even within states as they and their citizenry vary in their trade-offs between economic recovery and aversiondespite containment measures differences each jurisdictions response has involved some combination of travel restrictions and border controls quarantine requirements social isolation and distancing requirements and the large-scale closure of various services business and educational facilities while the primary concern of government has been to minimize the health impacts of covid-19 attention has also turned to the other effects of the pandemic government and regulatory interventions include stringent domestic and international travel restrictions and now a raft of phased stay-at-home and changing social distancing regulations the scale of these containment measures has left criminologists wondering what impact this will have on various kinds of crime throughout the remainder of the virus and beyondalthough the federal government has guided social distancing recommendations through semi-regular centers for disease control briefings that have made public health officials drs anthony fauci and deborah birx household names it has been left to states and cities to implement measures on when to close and when to open different places of business schools and public events and local law enforcement agencies to effect compliance policy choices can both stimulate or inhibit criminal activity and in doing so will thereby generate both intended and unintended consequences and those effects compared to pre-virus crime should be one focus of future research since the virus is not only ongoing but currently spiking in almost half of the states it is now certain that it will be with us for some time thereby accentuating the need for empirically informed policy guidance as well as providing the opportunity to develop that guidanceas the virus has blown up online-virtual life normal human contact has been largely replaced with intra-family interaction and computerized linkages which have enabled essential government education and some business affairs to continue functioning despite the social distancing but not without consequences increased screen time not only elevates exposure to and victimization from already embedded online scams and fraudulent transactions but also virus-specific cyber-bullying and hate crime through often anonymous social mediums social distancing to flatten the curve thus impacts some routine activities known to condition criminal opportunities and guardianship cohen  felson 1979 lifestyle alterations around contagion threats theoretically should have an impact on the volume and distribution of crime with domestic and family violence correlated with quarantine economic stress and increased exposure to harmful relationships during periods of limited support options perhaps the most obvious crime threat of forced isolation usher et al 2020 bradbury-jones  isham 2020 social distancing should also have an effect in reducing interpersonal violence other than perhaps domestic violence sex offenses illicit street markets and intergang conflicts more generally empty streets could well be an indicator of a reduction in the opportunities for conducting robberies auto theft and other street crimes and bolster police patrol and surveillance of crime in traditional hot spot neighborhoodsthe police executive research forum perf analyzed crime reports from thirty cities across the united states between mid-march and mid-april of 2020 and compared observations to the same timeframe in 2019 httpswwwpoliceforumorgcoronavirus while the police role in the virus is pronounced and invites obvious research attention to ordinance compliance domestic violence the shut-down of the economy has also reduced autonomous revenue generation for law enforcement agencies that fund overtime opportunities eg speeding citations asset forfeitures off-duty traffic services and security services as all but one place prince george county maryland saw fewer calls for service than in 2019 violent crime generally declined for the most part over the first 100 days of the virus in roughly 60 of the nations cities but is now either stable or on the uptake in most places robberies and aggravated assault thus far have declined markedly 83 and 57 respectively 83 of cities experienced an overall drop in property crime and there were 43 less burglaries compared to same months in 2019 as staying home has bolstered online commerce cybercrime and package theft has increased amidst all of this virus crime data to sort out march and april of 2020 witnessed the highest numbers of gun-related deaths 2100 in the country since 2016 which could well be related to the reports of a significant rise in thefts of guns from gun shops and this could well be related to the reports of a significant rise in thefts of guns from gun shops as we move deeper into the quarantine and virus life the crime trend landscape is sure to shift as society attempts to balance re-opening with virus resurgencethe virus is compelling a range of reactions from law enforcement the courts and corrections that also signal research opportunities in an effort to limit officer exposure to the virus police departments in several states have begun scaling back arrests for lower level offenses in order to reduce covid-19 exposure within their detention facilities the nashville police department for example has already discontinued misdemeanor arrests with the exceptions of domestic violence and drunk drivinglaw enforcement in some places face shortages in personal protective equipment and access to testing while increasingly and somewhat ironically tasked with more virus generated risky work as more officers contract the virus and agency budgets become strained some departments will be forced to scale back non-essential services the los angeles police department has already closed its front desk to the public in order to ensure distancing and slow the spread us customs and border protection officials are enforcing new restrictions on travel and commerce along the borders with canada and mexico and the drug enforcement administration has had to reprioritize away from traditional investigations to ensure regulated medicines needed to fight the virus are available to their staff and in turn has loosened restrictions on telemedicine prescription of controlled drugsfederal courts around the united states have closed and delayed trials and most state courts have suspended jury trials utilized mass plea hearings and most have pivoted to video proceedings the impact on jails and prisons in terms of decisions to de-carcerate and whom in terms of risk assessment has probably been the major impact on the cjs and especially in terms of risk measurement particularly with long-time older prisoners usually with excessive mandatory-minimum or life sentences tracking various releasees in terms of recidivism represents an opportunity for research that should be included and emphasized more covid-19 outbreaks in detention facilities has also moved courts to rethink pre-trial custody and disincentivized custodial sanctions skolnik 2020 the supreme court delayed oral arguments for at least a month  the longest delay in its proceedings since the 1918 spanish flu prisons and jails have suspended visitation and facility transfers limited attorney entry and moved to video for personal visits legal meetings and telemedicine still contagion in seemingly super-spreader prisons and jails should remain a constant concern pressure on correctional facilities to release offenders is a focal point of a general de-carcerating movement sivashanker et al 2020 though it is the courts and probation and parole offices that actually effect release wherein risk assessment is more needed and vital than everthe dynamic of the response to the pandemic will certainly have an effect on the changing impacts on the criminal justice system the first phase of the social distancing with a high rate of staying at home is largely ending as pressure to restore the economy dominates decisions the threat of resurgence remains the pressure to reduce contagion in jails and prisons will present natural experiments around early release policies that may demonstrate reconsideration of the incarceration and public safety relationship that in turn invites reconsideration of mass incarceration policies more broadly it is certainly reasonable to anticipate that recidivism rates will be higher in jurisdictions with more risky release practices but analyses of these and the justice practices and interventions contributing to them should provide useful indications of where to rethink current incarceration and release policies the increasing prevalence of long and life sentences approximately 15 of the total inmate population means a large percentage of prison cells are occupied by older and less risky offenders who are reasonable candidates for release to reduce the density of prison population vulnerable to virus contagion according to the aclu report a living death life without parole for nonviolent offenses almost 80 of the over 3000 people serving life without parole will die in prison from nonviolent drug offense convictions aclu foundation 2013 certainly a basis for review of such life sanctions resulting from naively presumed deterrence effects which are undercut by the drug markets recruiting replacements and retributive arguments for the life sentences for a single serious crimethe second phase for consideration of the interaction between the pandemic and the criminal justice system will be centered around re-opening as bars and restaurants are opened and travel increased to some extent the problem of crime and offenders should begin to return as before but it will certainly be interesting to see the degree to which crime drops noticed during the separation period are erased and to what extent new crimes that emerged continue also one can anticipate somewhat of a reduction in the staffing levels at different parts of the criminal justice system due to the impact of covid-19 particularly as a consequence of their interactions as part of carrying out their professional responsibilities as the stress from the virus intensifies over time mental health issues will likely increase encounters between officers and those with mental disorders that in turn will only compound officer resiliency problemsa third phase that is expected to begin in the mid to late fall of 2020 is the hardest to predict there is some speculation that the warmth of the summer will diminish the prevalence of the coronavirus but the cooler weather of the fall will reinitiate the pandemic one would hope that planning for this phase would involve careful assessment of what went well and what went poorly during the previous two phases and how best to prepare for a reemergence of the pandemic and how to respond to it it is rather early to guess about that but it is particularly important to analyze the current phase for lessons in dealing with reemergence spikes as social distancing and the wearing of facemasks become increasingly challenged there will no doubt be heavy research focus on public health implications especially as virus impacts spike up understanding the impact of social distancing on crime will also be critical for ensuring the safety of police and government capacity to deal with the lingering crisis and provide insights into whether people are complying with public health measures usher et al 2020of course we speculate what is to come on the hopeful assumption that the public will proceed with some collective consciousness of public risk and comply with various constraints on re-opening measures there is ample evidence that many segments of the population largely ignore virus risks and seemingly have little concern about risk to others and ongoing protests over police misconduct upcoming political rallies church re-openings and similar congregant events may prompt unpredictable spikes with some states or cities moving forward with re-opening while others may have to backtrack over time virus crime coughing or spitting and social ordinance violation and justice enforcement of ordinances will become of increasing concern apart from traditional crime during the virus per seit is inevitable that the virus will expose inequalities vulnerabilities and related service gaps attention to the justice systems performance during the pandemic can be extended to more systematic and serious discussions for broader justice policies because of contagion issues the virus warrants reconsideration of the nations current mass incarceration rates that are more than quadruple those that prevailed for at least fifty years blumstein and cohen 1973 when correctional policies were decided by the functionaries within the criminal justice system rather than todays political messaging to the nave public that more incarceration inherently lowers crime rates a presumption contradicted by the failure of the drug war that revealed a labor surplus of willing replacement drug dealers blumstein  beck 1999 and those current rates of about 430 prisoners per 100000 population are still about the highest in the world and declining at a rate of only 15 per yearwe need rigorous research to identify evidence-based approaches and inform challenging policy and practice decisions specific to covid-19 and virus overlap with the opioid mental health and now racism epidemics related this special issue of the american journal of criminal justice addresses a range of leading crime and justice issues presented by the covid-19 pandemic contributions from several leading discipline authorities as well as notable rising scholars will hopefully instigate additional discourse and help frame inquiry strategies as we begin to attempt to understand virus crime and criminal justice response and identify appropriate and effective system behaviorthe corona virus disease 2019 covid-19 outbreak started in china in december 2019 and by march 2020 had spread across the globe while the development of a vaccine continues public health strategies to contain the spread of the disease have been put in place in nearly every country world health organization 2020 these include quarantine self-isolation of people potentially exposed to the virus and social distancing more accurately termed physical distancing of the general population world health organization 2020 while physical distancing may be the most effective way of preventing the spread of the virus center for disease control et al 2003 this measure may be associated with a range of adverse psychological effects including fear anxiety and worry brooks et al 2020 gardner and moallef 2015 in addition to the physical effects of decreased motor activity changes to diet and exposure to sunlight lippi et al 2020 such impacts are likely to differ across pandemics and populations for example wang et al 2011 reported no immediate negative psychological effect of quarantine in their sample of university students in china during the h1n1 flu outbreak the incidence of depression and anxiety in populations where physical distancing is enforced may be impacted brooks et al 2020 and there has been media speculation around this issue with some governments actively recognising and funding mental health services to respond to this potential surge in mental ill-health zhou et al 2020 the implications for wellbeing are likely to be complex however potential positives arising from the situation have also been speculated on for example a renewed sense of shared social purpose fransen et al 2015 such as everyone is in this together and we must all act to protect the vulnerable and the healthcare system there may also be short term benefits for individuals who experience social anxiety with the expectation to stay at home reducing typical stresses they experience from having to attend school or work for examplepsychosis is one mental health condition that requires specific attention for one the association between influenza infection and psychosis has been reported since the spanish flu pandemic in the eighteenth century and subsequent acute psychoses of influenza have been documented during multiple pandemics kpiska et al 2020 a further point is that this population may be particularly at risk from the stress associated with physical distancing measures while the use of mobile phones and technology continues to increase for people with psychosis rates are still lower than in the general population firth et al 2015 this may mean that physical distancing and reduction in social connectedness has a substantial effect on this group of individuals as they do not compensate as much with other methods of communicationanother impact the covid-19 pandemic may have is on the nature and content of the psychotic pathology of people with psychosis or at risk of psychosis clinicians working in mental health services have given anecdotal reports of increased paranoia content around contamination from being in close contact with other people the association between psychosis and a range of psychosocial factors including stressful life events has been extensively explored suggesting it is an important risk factor for both the onset and exacerbation of symptoms fusar-poli et al 2017the medium- and long-term social effects of covid-19 may disproportionately impact people with psychosis or at risk of psychotic disorder for example social isolation unemployment homelessness relationship breakdown divorceseparation domestic violence and worsening physical health may all particularly effect people with psychosis given their vulnerability to social determinants of health anglin et al 2020 again the direction of this impact is not known as there is the potential for pandemics to strengthen social inequities and thus impact associated risk factors there is also the potential for an increase in the number of people with psychosis who suicide or attempt suicide with some evidence of an increase in the number of suicides occurring after previous pandemics chan et al 2006 what may complicate the interaction between psychosis and covid-19 further is that the treatment of covid-19 may involve the use of high doses of steroids to modulate the inflammatory response russell et al 2020 steroids have been known to trigger psychotic symptoms wada et al 2001how the specific psychosocial factors associated with an epi- or pandemic affect people with psychosis including their use of health services is unlikely to be well understood by policymakers or clinicians who have not previously lived and worked through such an outbreak there may be valuable lessons about the impact an epi- or pandemic can have on psychosis that can be learned from other virus outbreaks including the recent sars severe acute respiratory syndrome mers middle east respiratory syndrome and ebola epidemicssocial distancing and other public health interventions to combat the spread of covid-19 may have immediate and longer-term effects on people with or who are at risk of psychosis statutory health and social care and non-government services that support and treat people with psychosis need guidance on how covid-19 may impact on their services and the people that use them and how they may respond accordingly the world health organization tricco et al 2017 advocates that rapid reviews are essential in providing informative summaries of these issues in such circumstances we therefore aimed to undertake a rapid review of research on the impact of epidemics and pandemics on people with psychosis and the mental health services they use our review aimed to address the following questions related to living in a community exposed to an epidemic or pandemic1is there a change in the incident cases of psychosisbeing identified as ultra-high-risk yung et al 2004 of psychosis2are changes reported in the form and content of psychotic symptoms ie do people incorporate beliefs about the virus into their symptoms3is there a change in demand for inpatient and community-based crisis services by people with psychosis4is there a deterioration in the physical health of people with psychosis5does the number of people with psychosis suiciding or attempting suicide change6is there an increase in the number of people with psychosis who experience social issues such as homelessness unemployment domestic violence and loneliness7how do people with psychosis experience the preventative measures put in place in pandemics eg social distancing increased handwashing
while we did not produce a detailed protocol for this rapid review the study was registered with the open science framework on the 23rd march 2020 httpsosfio29pm4we included studies that reported primary research included participants that had a psychotic disorder eg first-episode psychosis schizophrenia bipolar disorder or were considered to be at high risk of psychosis and had been exposed to an epidemic or pandemic eg sars mers we excluded studies that tested the association between maternal influenza and adult schizophrenia in part because this has been extensively reviewed previously kpiska et al 2020we searched medline psycinfo and web of science on 23 march 2020 no date limits were applied we limited our search to papers written in english and published in a peer-review journal our search strategy for medline was1psychoss or psychotic or schizophreni or delusion or hallucination or paranoi or schizoaffectivetiab2pandemic or epidemic or sars or mers or influenza or hiv or malaria or tuberculosis or leprosy or smallpox or swine flu or ebola or covid-19 or coronavirustiab3psychiatric inpatient or psychiatric service or mental health service or crisis caretiab41 and 252 and 364 or 5
in addition a search of google scholar was conducted to identify any additional relevant publications the results of our search were uploaded into covidence a web-based systematic review management package title and abstract and full-text screening were completed by two members of the research team eb rg any discrepancies were resolved by a third slmthe following data were extracted from included studies country design participants epidemicpandemic measuresoutcomes ie incident cases use of psychiatric services physical healthwellbeing behaviours towards preventative measures put in place or functional outcomes one researcher rg undertook data extraction this was justified because of the rapid nature of the review and the desire to complete promptlyquality of included studies was assessed using the effective public health practice project quality assessment tool ephpp tool thomas et al 2004 this tool facilitates the rating of the quality of each paper across six domains selection bias study design confounders blinding data collection method and withdrawals and dropouts these component ratings are then used to make a global rating with strong equating to no weak ratings moderate to one weak rating and a global rating of weak if there are two or more weak ratingsfollowing our initial search we made the following amendments to our study protocol we excluded papers that related to the hivaids pandemic for two main reasons the mode of transmission is different ie it is not an airborne transmission and psychosis related to hivaids is comparatively well understood and unlikely to be relevant to the covid-19 pandemic gray et al 2002 we also restricted our search to articles published after 2000 just before the sars outbreak post hoc we also decided to check the reference lists and citations of included papersone observational study hu et al 2020 and a single case report zulkifli et al 2020 examined incident cases of psychosis in people living in a geographical area where covid-19 was prevalent hu reported a 25 increase - compared to previous years - in incident cases of schizophrenia in january 2020 which the authors attributed to the psychosocial stress and physical distancing measures associated with the covid-19 outbreak hu et al 2020 the authors extracted data from 13783 outpatients of which 1210 presented for the first time attending the xuzhou oriental peoples psychiatric hospital in january 2020 the start of the covid-19 outbreak the authors adjusted for a limited number of potential covariates - age gender and place of residence - in their analysis the absolute number of new cases of schizophrenia is comparatively small and may be explained by simple random variation no data are reported in terms of the difference in presentation - other than that patients were seemingly older with median age increased from 39 to 50 at the time of writing these data were published on a chinese open science platform rather than a peer-reviewed journal additionally of concern is the use of the diagnosis schizophrenia when typically symptoms are required to be present for six months before this diagnosis to be reachedwe identified a single case report from malaysia of an acute episode of psychosis seemingly precipitated by fear and distress associated with covid-19 zulkifli et al 2020 the 31-year-old male patient had no previous history of mental disorder and did not use illicit substances he responded well to a low dose antipsychotic however causality cannot be implied as there are usually several aetiological factors that lead to the development of a psychotic disorder and the anxiety that precipitated the episode may have just been the most proximal factorboth hu and zulkifili postulate that frequent media reporting of covid-19 particularly potentially sensationalist news found on social media platforms may amplify psychosocial stress in novel and potentially more damaging waysin total we identified seven papers addressing incident cases of psychosis linked to a virus this included four observational studies kim et al 2018 lee et al 2004 mak et al 2009 sheng et al 2005 of which three were associated with exposure to sars lee et al 2004 mak et al 2009 sheng et al 2005 and one mers kim et al 2018 additionally we identified two case reports of patients with the h1n1 chang et al 2015 and sars cheng et al 2004 and one study examined coronavirus immunoreactivity in people with recent-onset psychosis severance et al 2011 all of the studies included in the review indicated a link between exposure to the virus and psychosisin the first observational study sheng et al 2005 surveyed 308 sars patients discharged from hospital and identified psychiatric symptoms using the neuropsychiatric symptoms checklist npsc developed by the authors for this study auditory hallucinations visual hallucinations and persecutory ideas were reported by 39 2 and 39 of patients respectively although it is unclear from the data presented if these are unique participants or if single participants were reporting multiple symptoms and declined at follow-up the severity of sars symptoms and higher doses of corticosteroid were significantly associated with an increased risk of experiencing psychosis symptomsin the second observational study following the sars outbreak mak et al 2009 administered the scid structured clinical interview for dsm-iv validity 2004 to 90 sars survivors 30 months after the outbreak four 44 participants were identified as experiencing post-sars psychotic symptoms with three other participants reporting transient auditory and visual hallucinations during admission for sars treatment but did not meet diagnostic criteria the authors report no details about the treatment and response lee et al 2004 undertook a retrospective chart review of sars survivors in hong kong to test the hypothesis that post-sars psychosis was associated with treatment with steroids an incident rate of 09 n  15 was reported in the 1744 sars patients reviewed for the study they subsequently matched these to 30 control patients who had sars but did not experience psychosis all participants in the study were treated with steroids patients in the psychosis group received significantly higher doses of steroids while inpatient than controls median dose in hydrocortisone equivalent 10975 mg v 6780 mg the authors also suggest that a family history of mental illness and psychosocial stressor may have been associated with an increased risk of psychosis in their samplein the final observational study we identified kim et al 2018 completed a retrospective chart analysis of all patients admitted to an acute mers inpatient unit in seoul south korea of the 24 mers survivors 17 708 exhibited psychiatric symptoms of which 2 118 experienced auditory hallucinationsin the two case reports where psychosis followed virus infection one reported two patients infected with the h1n1 chang et al 2015 and the other three patients who had the sars virus cheng et al 2004 in both reports authors observed that psychotic symptoms seemed to be attributable to a combination of virus symptom severity the isolation during treatment and administration of steroids of the three patients in the chang case series it was noted that hallucinations seemingly worsened in two patients when steroid treatment was stepped down at the end of acute treatment both of the patients in the chang h1n1 case series were young girl 14 and boy 13 years old and were treated with an antiviral agent oseltamivir but not steroids both patients responded well to treatment with low dose antipsychotic medication aripiprazole 5 mgday the authors concluded that exposure to antiviral treatment induced the psychosis chang et al 2015in a cross-sectional survey the association between four coronaviruses 229e hku1 nl63 and oc43 and psychosis was examined in a study involving 106 people with recent-onset psychosis and 196 non-psychiatric controls severance et al 2011 all four coronaviruses were more common in people with psychosis compared to controls after adjusting for confounding variables age gender socioeconomic status and smoking status the odds of the hku1 and nl63 coronavirus were associated with a 32 and 142 increase in the odds of psychosis suggesting that coronavirus may be important risk factors for psychosisthree included studies considered psychotic patient adherence with protective measures cheng et al 2004 maguire et al 2018 pang 2004 there was a consistent conclusion that adherence was markedly more problematic in people with psychosis although included studies had important methodological limitationsa single cross-sectional study examined willingness and perceived barriers to adopting protective measures in 71 adults with and 238 without schizophrenia attending primary care maguire et al 2018 people with schizophrenia were less willing to receive a vaccination and were more concerned about vaccination side effects people with schizophrenia were also less willing to be isolated compared to those without schizophrenia there was no difference in willingness to hand wash or perceptions of the effectiveness of handwashing between people with and without schizophrenia
pang 2004 reports a service evaluation of the impact of sars on psychiatric services however the author does not provide any empirical data within the publication they reported that while psychiatric inpatients were taught self-hygiene measures and provided with face masks their adherence to these measures was inadequate in the cheng et al 2004 case series it was noted that psychotic symptoms were linked to poor adherence with infection control measures clinicians working on the sars unit were concerned about mental health clinicians visiting the ward unless necessary which they reported complicated access to treatmenttwo papers were identified that examined perception of the risk of infection in people with psychosis iancu et al 2005 maguire et al 2019 one study examined if the sars epidemic caused anxiety and worry in 30 inpatients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia compared to a control group of 30 staff members in israel where the virus was not endemic iancu et al 2005 most patients were aware of the sars epidemic compared to the control group patients reported they were more protected from sars in hospital perceived that staff did all they could to protect them and believed that there would be no sars cases in israel patients were also more likely to accept psychotic explanations for the sars virus such as it is a punishment a sign the world is coming to an end and a sign for humankindin a second paper maguire et al 2019  derived from the maguire et al 2018 survey - the authors reported that in participants with schizophrenia affect seems to play a role in risk perception of swine flu infection and willingness to adhere with protective measures for example they reported that higher levels of reported anxiety in those with schizophrenia were associated with a reduced likelihood of perceiving they were at substantive risk from swine flu maguire also reported a trend in perception towards people with schizophrenia - compared to controls - being less likely to get swine flu maguire et al 2019two studies examined the impact of an outbreak of a virus on psychiatric services kamara et al 2017 pang 2004 in both studies services were impacted pang 2004 reported a significant reduction in demand for psychiatric services in hong kong following the sars outbreak there was a 6 reduction in the number of acute admissions from the emergency department a 14 reduction in the length of hospitalisation and a 5 drop in outpatient attendance community visits reduced by 50 seemingly because home visits to patients were suspended clinicians compensated by making telephone contact the long-term implications of the scaling back of community services were not reported and it is unclear if this was done to protect clinicians or patients
kamara et al 2017 described the outcomes of 143 patients of whom 30 had psychosis attending nurse-led mental health services during the ebola outbreak in sierra leone the epidemic had a substantial impact on the provision of already fragile health services in the country while the authors noted an increase in numbers of people attending mental health services during the outbreak no primary evidence is reported to support this claim accessing medication was one of the major challenges reported in this paperwe found no evidence of changes in the form and content of psychotic symptoms impact on the physical health of people with psychosis rates of suicide or attempted suicide nor incidence of homelessness unemployment and domestic violencethe results of the quality assessment of included studies are presented in table 2
 eight included papers received the rating of weak and two of strong it was not possible to undertake quality assessment for the three case reports and the one service evaluation included in the paperthere was evidence that people with psychosis may be less motivated to comply with infection controlphysical distancing measures that are likely to raise some practical and ethical issues particularly for clinicians running inpatient psychiatric units iancu et al 2005 in hong kong during the sars epidemic - a notably less contagious virus - patients who did not comply with required infection control practices were placed in enforced quarantine pang et al 2004 in some countries such practices may be considered unethical and potentially incompatible with mental health laws helping people with psychosis maintain physical distancing and infection control requirements may be challenging particularly while they are inpatients for clinicians working in mental health services where personal protective equipment ppe may be limited this may cause concern in the longer term tailored patient education about the importance of complying with infection control measures was recommended by pang et al 2004 in the absence of any high-quality evidence about how to ensure compliance with infection control behaviours clinicians may need to consider applying other psychoeducation techniques xia et al 2011 particularly for individuals with prominent disorganisation symptomsbehavioural issues have been reported as challenging and timely recognition and initiation of treatment may be helpful notably reports are emerging of new incident cases of psychosis - seemingly in an older group of people - associated with exposure to the psychosocial stress of covid-19 hu et al 2020 zulkifli et al 2020 while extreme caution should be applied in inferring an association given the limited amount of available data increased awareness and vigilance may be justifiedthe increased risk of psychosis in people exposed to a virus during an epi- or pandemic is more compelling between 09 and 4 of people exposed develop psychosis or psychotic symptoms hallucinations andor delusions this is in contrast to a median incident rate of 152 in 100000 mcgrath et al 2004 in some cases the psychosis seemed to be associated with treatment with steroids used to treat the infection eg mak et al 2009 treatment with low doses of antipsychotic medication - notably aripiprazole - seems to have been effective in patients with an emerging infectious disease and those associated with psychosocial stress associated with an emerging infectious diseaseduring the sars outbreak in hong kong community services were suspended pang et al 2004 policymakers and service managers may consider that the protection of their staff is paramount and it should be possible to provide some form of community support using telehealth technology people with psychosis do - at least in advanced economies - have access to online and mobile-based technologies that seem to be acceptable and feasible in this population alvarez-jimenez et al 2014 firth et al 2015 the safety effectiveness and acceptability of telephoneinternet-based delivery of community-based mental health services for people with psychosis need to be carefully monitored as will their potential use of other medical services for example emergency departmentswe found no studies or case series of people with existing psychosis that had been infected by a virus during an epi- or pandemic presumably this is because infection is a comparatively rare occurrence in this group of patients in pandemics to date given that we identified that people with psychosis are seemingly less adherent with protective measures it seems reasonable to hypothesise that during the covid-19 outbreak  where a large number of people can expect to be infected  mental health clinicians will likely be in a position where they need to encourage patients to physically distance and self-isolate there was little evidence to guide how best to address this issue clinicallyinevitably patients with psychosis and covid-19 will require admission to medical wards studies of patients with coronavirus induced psychosis have reported that this is a complex and extremely challenging group of people to treat it may be reasonable to suggest that consideration will need to be given at a hospital and government level about how best to support these individuals accessing medical facilitiesthere was limited evidence from emerging economies with only one study kamara et al 2017 reporting on the impact the ebola epidemic had on mental health service delivery in contrast to the relatively contained outbreaks of sars mers and ebola covid-19 is spreading across the globe mental health care in these economies tend to already be neglected services and governments and hospitals may have to be creative in their treatment delivery perhaps expediting a move away from hospital-based care that can still dominate in these economies another novel shift in service provision could be making use of a peer-based workforce stastny 2012 to reinforce infection control measuresthere are some important limitations to this rapid review that should be considered when appraising our findings amendments were made to our registration entry after we had undertaken our initial search this could be interpreted as a post hoc effort to amend the aims of the study after we had started to read the available studies our search strategy was not externally peer-reviewed while it would have been helpful to have our search further scrutinized it was felt that this would have delayed the review process and we decided to omit this step only three databases were searched we did not search key databases such as cinahl that indexes research not covered by the databases we used the decision to restrict the databases we searched was based on our experience of the likely relevance of studies indexed in cinahl primarily focused on nursing and other candidate databases that said there may be relevant studies that we omitted as a consequence finally data extraction was undertaken by a single researcher although this was done carefully there is a possibility that errors may have occurred because this was a rapid review that we aimed to complete in a timely way to inform policymakers we judged that the time saved by only having a single researcher undertake data extraction was warrantedthe main finding from our rapid review is that there is moderate if low quality evidence to suggest a small but important number of patients will develop coronavirus related psychosis that is likely associated with steroid or viral exposure pre-existing vulnerability and psychosocial stress psychosis in patients with coronavirus may present a major challenge and potential infection control risk to clinical teams there was limited evidence to suggest that patients that developed psychosis responded well to low dose antipsychotics such as aripiprazole in addition to steroid-induced psychosis there was some limited and poor-quality evidence which suggested that extreme psychosocial stress-triggered incident cases in people previously unaffected of importance to current mental health service provision patients with existing psychosis may be less likely to comply with physical distancing and personal hygiene requirements required during an outbreak of an infectious disease representing a potential risk to the community and mental health clinicians the current covid-19 pandemic offers a global opportunity to explore the findings of this rapid review in greater depth and qualitythere is much to speculate upon regarding the consequences of the covid-19 pandemic on individuals with psychosis our review highlights that within the current literature at least minimal consideration has been given to this disadvantaged population and proactive research is requiredeb and rg conceived the study completed the screening and completed the first draft slm completed the search and screening at bn bod pm sf

global threat in addition to the obvious impact on population health pandemics also represent an important threat to the global economy these important economic costs can potentially result in a comparable impact on population health as all economic factors have a proven positive correlation with key health status outcomes 1 therefore effective public health policy must always respect the impact of economic factors on population health as health and economic stability remain as variables in a reinforcing feedback loopin the absence of proven treatment or vaccination social physical distancing is the most proven and effective means of combating communicable infectious diseases for covid-19 impacted regions worldwide this remains one of the few options to slow the spread of the infection while preserving fragile health delivery institutions social distancing policy usually includes school and business closures and home-based work recommendations while enforced curfews and quarantine orders have also been enacted although studies acknowledge the economic consequences of forced closures of business and restrictions on private businesses most researchers agree that social distancing measures are effective relative to cost as part of pandemic preparedness 2 further the burden of disease is well-noted to impact the economy without social distancing policy with many economists arguing that preserving lives has a shorter term economic impact however not all studies agree on the appropriate iteration of social distancing as clear policy depends on unique features of the virus as well as geographical features and risk groups for severe disease and mortality in a simulation study of a community of 10000 residents targeted social distancing focusing on children and teenagers was found effective for the influenza pandemic occurring in the 1950s through school closures and home-based education simulations similar to the spanish influenza epidemic identified that more aggressive targeting was suitable involving children through young adult populations these findings indicate that community size as well as viral population risk groups should be considered in forming effective targeted social distance policy 3 because resource utilization remains a concern for policy makers in the event of a pandemic social distancing measures as a method for reducing the demand for a limited stockpile of antivirals was not found effective over a long period of time but delaying the occurrence of infections in order to support vaccine development was found to be effective policy 4the implications of the literature applicable to the current outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 leave many questions because covid-19 is caused by a novel corona virus many of the disease features researchers anticipated are vastly different and not well-understood among these features are differing presentations of disease and severity within populations while early data suggest that older populations were at an increased risk for severe disease the identification of infections in different populations has revealed the presence of severe disease in much younger populations also no proven medication protocol currently exists which has resulted in clinical trials all over the world being conducted to create new therapies develop a vaccine and evaluate existing medications developed for the treatment of other viral illnesses with the latter representing the most immediate benefit with some data also understood and an existing supply and distribution chain in place several of these therapies have been tested in both laboratory and clinical settings with mixed results with remdesivir showing the most promising results so far of existing antivirals the us food and drug administration has recently issued emergency authorization for the experimental use in treatment of severe covid-19 5 this will create a practical challenge as the demand for the drug will undoubtedly exceed the existing supply and the continued interruption of global supply chains will delay immediate production and distribution to care centers and patients in need despite this the promise of remdesivir is encouraging following the disappointing results from hydroxychloroquine studies which found unacceptable side-effects with no significant effect on disease outcome 6 7 still shortages of hydroxychloroquine were immediate due to widespread experimental use for both covid-19 patients as well as prophylaxis for at risk healthcare workers these shortages had important consequences for patients who receive the medication for the management of chronic autoimmune disorders who were unable to access their regular treatment further prolonged mechanical ventilation as the only validated treatment option in severe covid19 may likewise present scarcity challenges as has occurred in italy and spain furthermore the reinfection rate seems to be low which has important implications for the evolving immunity of the herd in the future existing social distancing policy in many states has minimized the interaction of american communities states and regions that is likely to support variations in peaks between communities according to the institute for health metrics and evaluation ihme several states with a high volume of cases are expected to have a prolonged epidemic peak for multiple weeks from early may to june with the exception of new york which attained peak infections early-mid april this projection has been calculated based on the current social distancing measures and the varying degrees of population density which will result in outbreaks in different communities occurring at different times this has important implications for the fragile healthcare delivery system as shifting resources to the areas in the most need of equipment medical staff and other important resources will only be possible if epidemic peaks do not occur in unisonthe return to normalcy will only occur through a complex assortment of policy interventions that transform the american economy continue targeted social distancing and use medical science as a tool to personalize social distancing to facilitate gradual personal interactions of low risk individualsamong the many differences in the covid-19 pandemic with previous influenza pandemics one of the most notable is the ability to facilitate operations through technology many industries operating in professional services and functional departments within companies like management and administration have already adopted conferencing technology that facilitate in person interactions similar implementations of technology have not been achieved in manufacturing and distribution as low level employment has driven these functions that are now considered essential further the impact of the global economy most specifically from the burden of disease in china has placed entire supply chains at risk for critical medical supplies the us should use this crisis as an opportunity in invest in the automation of the manufacturing sector shrink supply chains and create higher level jobs as a benefit to the economy included in this policy should be workforce training available to those who have been replaced through automationsocial distancing policies should continue as each region state and city locality make decisions regarding the reopening of businesses based on their unique disease curve this has already happened as a result of unclear federal policy but the practice of each community should be standardized workplaces should be adapted to this policy and facilitate standardization of physical distancingmedical science will support the gradual reconstitution of the in person work force this step will depend on many factors such as the development of treatment protocol vaccine development and currently available antibody testing that identifies individuals with covid-19 immunity who can re-enter these industries without posing the risk of infection or infecting others for those previously infected with covid-19 infection severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov2 immunity develops with an immunoglobulin response measurable by increasing igm and igg levels that have been shown to eliminate viral load and promote recovery 8 although antibody testing is available now the adoption of rapid igg testing would be best suitable for widespread population level screening as part of a comprehensive plan for incrementally rebuilding the in person work forcethe human cost of this pandemic is without question significant however the transitioning of the economy to better utilize technology along with reconstructing the work force could improve the standard of living for many americans as well as better prepare the us for future pandemics we could also create a better response annually to seasonal influenza as its annual cost to the us in terms of morbidity mortality and loss in quality adjusted life years is significant finally the political support for prioritizing public health preparedness as a matter of national and economic security will likely be stronger and will result in better surveillance that identifies and prevents future pandemics and streamlines strong national and coordinated responses that will mitigate the potential damage to the economic and health infrastructure and support a more timely recoveryall datasets generated for this study are included in the articlesupplementary materialmm and ma were

reviewed recently by lonescu et al 1 for example fractional-derivative equation fde models have been applied to capture complex dynamics in biological tissues 2 tumor growth 3 dna sequencing 4 drug

study tests whether the fdes can be applied to model the dynamics and mitigation scenarios of coronavirus an emerging and critical research area that has not been focused by the fractional calculus community beforethe novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 outbreak a respiratory illness that started first detected in late december 2019 is a pandemic infecting 336000 people in more than 140 countries with the average fatality rate of 44 globally data up to 3222020 13 the covid-19 pandemic is infiltrating almost every aspect of life damaging global economy and altering both man-made and natural environments urgent actions have been taken but further effective and efficient strategies are promptly needed to confront this global challenge to address this challenge and promptly guide the next efforts it is critical to model the covid-19 outbreak mathematical models are among the necessary tools to quantify the covid-19 and therefore testing the applicability of such fde models under this new global pandemic is the primary objective motivating this studythis study aims to model the covid-19 evolution dynamics ie transmission infection recovery and death evolution for representative countries with apparent coronavirus cases including china the united states us italy japan and south korea using mathematical models most specifically the fde models described previously it should be noted that the covid-19 spread in these countries experienced different starting initiation and detection times an important fact to consider when applying these models for example china had passed the peak of the coronavirus outbreak finally reaching a milestone with no new local infections on 3192020 79 days from the onset 12312019 in wuhan china while the us coronavirus cases soared past 10000 on the same day this study will apply the core characteristics of the covid-19 outbreak obtained in china to estimate the covd-19 spread in the us as well as other countries where the number of affected people has not yet reached its number of peak casesin addition this new pandemic may last for a relatively longer time than expected 14 no vaccine against sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is currently available 15 indeed a vaccine for prevention and infection control may not be ready before march 2021 for the covid-19 considering a minimum of 45 weeks for trials and at least 1 year for safety evaluation and final deployment efficient strategies are therefore needed to mitigate the covid-19 outbreak possible non-pharmaceutical scenarios such as isolation of cases and contact tracing can be evaluated using mathematical models 16 in order to identify the most efficient mitigation strategies going forward this is another major motivation and the secondary task of this study using the fde modelsto address the questions mentioned above this study is organized as follows section 2 proposes an updated seir model with an fde-based component for covid-19 where s e i and r stand for susceptible exposed infectious and recovered people respectively 17 this model is then applied to fit and predict the covid-19 spread in various provinces and major cities in china resulting in abundant datasets to derive the core characteristics of the covid-19 dynamics in evolution section 3 predicts the spread of covid-19 in the other countries using the knowledge that is gained from the china case study section 4 proposes a fully lagrangian approach with the time fde to model the spatiotemporal evolution of covid-19 and then applies it to evaluate non-pharmaceutical scenarios to mitigate the virus spread section 5 reports the main conclusions specifically the feasibility of fdes for capturing covid-19 evolution in the appendix the impacts of the non-singular kernel and fractional derivative type on model results are further discussed for readers particularly interested in these fractional calculus techniques the main contributions of this work therefore include 1 the first application of fdes in modeling the evolution of the covid-19 death toll 2 an updated seir model with a transient recovery rate to better capture the dynamics of covid-19 pandemic within china and for other countries and 3 a particle-tracking approach based on stochastic bimolecular reaction theory to evaluate the mitigation of the spread of the covid-19 outbreakthe classical seir model containing four populations s e i and r takes the form 291adsdtrpisn

2 is the rate for the healthy susceptible person to be transferred to an infected one from exposed persons note that covid-19 patients in the incubation period might be contagious too and r
2 is the number of healthy susceptible people that are contacted by exposed people daily now the infection rates can change with time and the infected persons are removed from the risk of infection via a time-dependent rate term of t if the recovered individuals can return to a susceptible status due to for example a loss of immunity then the partial differential equation pde 2d for the time rate of change of r requires one more sink term r where  is the rate of the recovered individuals returning to a susceptible statuswe replace the integer-order derivatives in the classical seir 1 by the fractional-order derivatives in 2 to capture the possible nonlocal impact such as the memory impact or any apparent delay in the covid-19 outbreak herein we use the death evolution 2e as an example hence the fde 2e containing the death probability of  while the other patients are cured is modified asdddt110tdtd which is the caputo fractional derivative 30 31 with order  0     1 note that all the other indexes

3 and 
4 in model 2 are in the same range of 0 1 the caputo fractional derivate was selected here because the initial condition for caputo derivative takes the same form as that for the integer-order pde particularly the caputo derivative allows the utilization of initial values of the integer order with known physical interpretations when the order 1 model 2e reduces to the classical integer-order pde for the death evolution the fractional pde 2e is used here for two reasons first the evolution of deaths and cures may be characterized by a random process due to the fact that the exact time for the recovered person to be initially infected is unknown ie the patient that died or was cured today may have been diagnosed yesterday or last week second some patients may not be treated in time after being infected making the death toll evolve with a time memory therefore we extend the classical mass-balance equation of death cases using the fde to characterize the random property and memory impact embedded in the temporal evolution of mortality the fractional pde 2e and its classical version will be compared below using real observed dataother complex seir models were also applied to model covid-19 spread such as the one proposed by tang et al 32 which has 12 ratesprobabilities and 8 groups of people in seir numerical results show that compared with the seir model 2 the complex model proposed by tang et al 32 with solutions shown by the dotted lines in fig 1
a accurately fits the observed data at the early stage but then overpredicts the spread of covid-19 observed after 2122020 the dynamics of transmission for covid-19 especially the recovery rate therefore changed over time in china likely due to the time-dependent conditions ie improvementsadjustments in medical care as mentioned above a dynamic time-local seir model therefore may be preferred for modeling covid-19 spread in chinain addition compared to the fde 2e the best-fit solution using the classical pde dddti for death evolution see the black dotted line in fig 1
a slightly overestimates the late-time growth of mortality the actual death toll in hubei province grew slower than that estimated by a constant rate model indicating that the memory impact may affect the late-time dynamics of death and can be better captured by the fde 2ethe best-fit solutions using model 2 fit the evolution of the infected and recovered populations well for the data recorded from hubei province and three large cities closely related such as in transportation or economic cooperation to wuhan china fig 1 the model was also shown to predict well the observed time series of covid-19 spread from 382020 to 3222020 for most places except for shanghai city fig 1
d this is likely due to the number of overseas covid-19 cases imported into shanghai whereby the number of cases were observed to increase rapidly after 332020 causing inconsistency in the affected population and failure of the model shanghai pudong international airport one of the two airports located in shanghai city is the eighth-busiest airport in the world and the busiest international gateway of mainland china when excluding the coronavirus cases imported from overseas model 2 predicts the covid-19 spread evolution data in shanghai fig 2
 therefore model 2 works well for various places in china that may not be experience a significant influx of imported cases as external sources can easily break the internal evolution especially the asymptotic status of covid-19 in chinathe resultant time-dependent recovery rate t is depicted in fig 3
 where the rate fitted by the latest observation data point within the fitting period ie 372020 remains stable in the following prediction period the best-fit recovery rate is the highest for shanghai except for the impulse of t for wenzhou as discussed below which is expected since shanghai has the best public health system of all of these cities contrarily hubei shows the lowest recovery rate likely due to its delayed response and the relatively limited public health capability at the beginning of the outbreak compared with shanghaiwenzhou exhibits an impulse in the infection and recovery dynamics of coronavirus fig 1
b different from that observed for the other places studied herein on february 27 2020 the number of wenzhous infected people suddenly declined combined with the sudden increase of the number of people cured this abrupt change can be effectively captured by the seir model 2 with an impulse in the recovery rate t this recovery impulse is most likely due to a new hospital the no 2 affiliated hospital of wenzhou medical university recently built in this city in early february which significantly improved the public health system the first discharged cases of coronavirus from this hospital appeared in late february 2020 resulting in the sudden increase in the total recovery rate in addition a relatively large number of people working in wuhan returned to wenzhou in late january and it appears that the improved efficient screening process successfully identified the number of infected cases the new cases were 29000 from 1242020 to 1312020 in wenzhou with an average of 3600 new patients per day who were then immediately centralized for treatment it appears that this fast response helped to alleviate the spread of coronavirus in wenzhouthe best-fit parameters of model 2 are listed in table 1
 and the initial values for each group of people are listed in table 2
 we reveal three behaviors in model parameters first the best-fit s-shaped recovery rate t fig 3 can be described by the sigmoid function ta1ebtc where a b and c are factors showing that the recovery rate increases exponentially before reaching a stable condition this increase is likely due to the fact that healthcare facility capabilities improved with time with an accelerating rate before reaching their asymptote or maximum capacitysecond the rates and probabilities r r

2 affecting the covid-19 transmissioninfection evolution slightly change in space and remain stable for a given site table 1 the small spatial fluctuation of these rates may be due to the similar strategies implemented by local governments for intervening and mitigating covid-19 spread ie full lockdowns across the country the time-invariant transmissioninfection rates for a given site indicate that the spreading rate of covid-19 may not significantly change over a short period of time for a given area with consistent intervening policies enactedthird the model predictions show that it may take 47 14 25 and 11 days from 3142020 for the current infected population to drop below 1 of the cumulative infected population for hubei province and the cities of wenzhou shenzhen and shanghai respectively notably since the best-fit t increases in time the prediction using a constant  may overestimate the long-term future infection cases and underestimate the future recovery trend for covid-19we also introduce an index c to quantify the infection severity of covid-19 at different places3cnimax where imax is the maximum number of cumulative infected people at the given site a smaller c represents a greater infection severity of coronavirus there is a power-law relationship between the regional population n and the maximum cumulated number of infected people imax fig 4
 this empirical formula may be used to approximate the largest cumulative number of infections which will be applied in the subsequent section for predicting the covid-19 evolution outside of china where the coronavirus infection has not yet reached its peak number of casesto decrease the acceleration of covid-19 spread the uss main propagated mode up to 3222020 has been the use of social distancing actions the predicted covid-19 spread in the us is plotted in fig 5
 there is a high uncertainty in the prediction of covid-19 evolution within the us considering the recent dramatic fluctuations in the number of infected people and the delayed screening during the beginning stages of the outbreak thus we must make assumptions and can only estimate the future coronavirus evolution in the us under specific scenarios based on the index of infection severity c in the representative areas of china we predict the us covid-19 evolution dynamics under two scenarios as shown in fig 5
fig 5
a shows the possible spread of covid-19 in california us assuming that the coronavirus dynamics including the infectionrecovery rates and the infection severity are similar to those observed in hubei china the solid lines representing an optimistic scenario or can change quite differently the dashed lines representing a longer-term severe scenario the estimated total population of infection in california varies from 50000 to 200000 with the peak number of cases occurring around 20 to 50 days from 3222020
fig 5
b shows the possible spread of covid-19 in the us solid lines represent model solutions assuming that covid-19 spreads similarly to that as observed in hubei china while the dashed lines are model solutions that assume covid-19 spreads differently the results show that the estimated total infected population varies from 700000 to 3000000 with the peak number of cases occurring 2050 days and the covid-19 outbreak lasting for 50 days from 3222020 respectivelyto decrease the acceleration of covid-19 spread italys mode is now similar to china lockdown of the full population the predicted covid-19 spread in italy is plotted in fig 6
a although italy has followed chinas mode of national isolation the number of infected people increased rapidly from 3142020 to 3192020 495 new cases per day to account for the delayed national quarantine compared with china we decrease the c index while also increasing the upper limit of the cumulative infection the covid-19 evolution prediction results show that there may be a turning point in the next two weeks when the current infected cases begin to decline we also separate the death toll from the number of recovered casessouth koreas mode of combating the spread of covid-19 is through fast detection and tracking of the disease south korea is using efficient mobile diagnoses tests and accurate tracing of infected cases to maintain a low death rate even with a large infected population the mobile method can test 20000 people per day the maximum capability on 3122020 and apps for cell phones andor credit cards can accurately track the routes of infected people with the help of local government without an invasion of privacy so that warnings can be immediately delivered to the general population to obviate the places with high risk the current infected population may have passed its peak number of cases around 3202020 and the prediction shows that the covid-19 outbreak may be well controlled in 35 days from 3222020 fig 6
bjapans mode of combating the spread of covid-19 is compatible with that of the us in addition to other changes such as enhanced educationoutreach and rapid treatment of the infected cases specific policies include social distancing which might be a key barrier to the spread of the novel coronavirus personal hygiene and quarantine of the infected cases the current data and modeling results fig 6
c show that japan has an efficient way so far to limit the maximum population infected and slow the spread of covid-19 while this outbreak may last for a whilethe random walk based stochastic model for covid-19 spread is analogous to a mixing-limited bimolecular reaction-based mechanismcondition 35 when a reactant a particle representing a susceptible individual a meets a reactant b particle representing an infectious person b a chemical reaction may occur if the collision energy is large enough to break the chemical bond meaning that the susceptible person a may be infected if satisfying additional criteria such as a and b are close enough and b touches hisher face after receiving coronavirus from a therefore the condition of a being infected is not deterministic but rather a random probability-controlled process this probability is related to various factors such as the duration that a and b are in contact the infectivity rate and the distance between the two people which may be characterized parsimoniously by the interaction radius r that controls the number of reactant pairs susceptible  infectious in a potential reaction infection 35 hence the core of the random walk stochastic model to simulate covid-19 spread is to define the interaction radius rthe analogous development and similarities between bimolecular reactions and the sir model can also be seen from their governing equations the time-dependent sir model takes the form 364adstdttstitn

scenario 1 no special constraints assuming a city with 10000 people and 4 initial coronavirus cases this scenario does not put any constraints for any population we assume that the population distributes in the city randomly at the beginning and then moves randomly the spread of covid-19 is then simulated using the stochastic model proposed in section 41
scenario 2 social distancing this scenario assumes that all people in the city maintain a social distance significantly decreasing the probability of infection
scenario 3 attempted quarantine this scenario creates a forced quarantine for infected individuals before the outbreak which is expected to be the most efficient way of quarantinein the stochastic model we assume that 10 days after being infected the person will be removed because of being cured or expired dead this is because the median disease incubation period has been estimated to be 51 days 39 for simplicity purposes the interaction radius r 6 remains constant since the constant interaction radius was found to be able to efficiently capture the temporal variation of effective reaction rates in mixing controlled reaction experiments or simulations 35 37 the initial number of a and b particles is 10000 and 4 respectively the lagrangian solutions of the covid-19 outbreak for the three scenarios are depicted in fig 7
modeling results for scenarios 1 2 and 3 show a peak in the curve of newly infected people at time t28 65 and 32 respectively demonstrating that the virus spreads the fastest for the scenario without mitigation constraints ie scenario 1 where the number of the total infected people or cases increases by one order of magnitude every 10 days in the rising limb as expected however the value for this peak scenario 1 198 people is lower than that for scenario 3 267 people although the total number of the infected people for scenario 1 9336 is slightly larger than scenario 3 9322 this may be due to a greater separation of infection cases for the higher number of initial coronavirus carriers in scenario 1 which causes a lower and relatively flatter covid-19 evolution peak compared to that of scenario 3 scenario 2 has the lowest peak value 121 people and the most-delayed peak in the curve for new cases and the total infection time is almost doubled compared to the other two scenarios indicating that people living with strict social distancing may also suffer from a much longer period of covid-19 threat it is also noteworthy that the overall trend of the solution simulation of scenario 1 initial surge without special constraints fig 7
a is similar to that for italy which had a delayed response to the covid-19 outbreak initially fig 6
a and scenario 3 solution a lower peak value and a longer duration due to social distancing fig 7
b is similar to that observed in japan where social distancing actions have been implemented fig 6
cthe simulated particle plumes plotted in fig 8
reveal the subtle discrepancy between the three mitigation scenarios scenario 1 assumes that four initial cases were initially located on the right side of the city while the whole population 10000 susceptible persons was distributed randomly in the 1  1 domain fig 8
a the trajectory of each person is assumed to follow two-dimensional brownian motion with retention described by eq 7 to capture the random vector for each displacement and the random waiting time between two consecutive motions described by the time fractional derivative term in eq 7 the virus moved quickly from east to west figs 8
b and 8
c spreading over the entire city before all the infected people were cured or expired dead at time t69 fig 8
d a total of 664 susceptible people 66 of the total population distributed randomly around the city were never infected
scenario 2 assumes that social distancing can reduce the infection probability which can be characterized by a smaller reaction rate or a smaller interaction radius in our lagrangian approach the virus was spreading at a much lower rate from west to east than that in scenario 1 figs 8
e8g reaching a stable condition ie  of cases neither increasing or decreasing at a later time t125 and leaving more susceptible people unaffected 2734 total which is 273 of the population therefore social distancing is effective in limiting the spread of coronavirus among people note however this scenario assumes that every person in this city strictly maintains social distancing otherwise a surge of infections may occur the same way as that shown in scenario 1
scenario 3 assumes self-quarantine notably not all of the infected people can be effectively quarantined due to the following 1 people can be infected without coronavirus symptoms 2 people in the incubation period can transmit the infection and 3 limited health care facilities and capabilities for the large influx of patients for example according to imai et al 40 many infected people could not be appropriately screened initially in wuhan city china under this condition we assume that 50 of people infected and diagnosed are immediately quarantined while the remaining infected people fig 8
i can still cause the spread of coronavirus figs 8
j8l self-quarantine therefore may not be as effective as maintained social distancingfractional calculus provides a useful tool to modeling complex dynamics in biology and this study extended the fde for modeling the coronavirus outbreak the covid-19 is a pandemic radically impacting our lives by altering our daily patterns and interactions in an unprecedented way and rate a time-dependent seir model with built-in fde components motivated by the coronavirus milestone of recording zero new local infections in china on 3192020 was applied to capture the covid-19 evolution observed over the last three months in china a stochastic model built upon the time fde for random resting times of people was also proposed to evaluate non-pharmaceutical mitigation options three main conclusions are presented by this studyfirst different properties in the covid-19 spreading in china data up to 3222020 exhibited different kinetics and the death evolution can be captured by the time fde model fitting showed that the recovery rate of covid-19 increases with time due to various human factors the fast-increasing recovery rate caused the rapid decline of the current infected population curve removing the possible memory impact and any delayed processes which does not require a time-nonlocal model such as the time fde contrarily the evolution of deaths in china italy south korea and japan can be captured well by the time fde likely due to the time memory in the death toll it is also noteworthy that the time fde version of the seir model might be needed if the late-time recovery rate declines due to the change of coronavirus properties affected by the change of climate public policy andor possible evolution of the virus itself and the contiguous mannerratesecond the updated seir model provided predictions although with high uncertainty for covid-19 evolution within china and for other countries for example the improved seir model showed that if the infection and recovery rates remain stable the number of cumulative infections is likely to decline to 1 of the total infected population within one month from 3222020 in china the overseas imported cases however may break the internal asymptotic status and significantly postpone the ending time of covid-19 in china predictions using the validated seir model also showed different evolution dynamics of covid-19 within populations of the united states italy japan and south korea for example it may take at least 23 months for the current infected population to drop below 1 of the cumulative infected population in the us requiring more efficient mitigation strategies while south korea may control the covid-19 spread in a relatively shorter period however these predictions contain high uncertainty due to uncertainty in the maximum infected population and changes of transmissioninfection and recovery rates among different countriesthird a stochastic model based on the lagrangian scheme for the time fdes analogous to a mixing-limited reaction mechanism model showed that self-quarantine may not be as effective as strict social distancing since not all the infected people can be diagnosed and immediately quarantined while strict social distancing can apparently slow covid-19 spread the pandemic may last longer this is another case that fractional calculus may be used to explore covid-19 outbreak therefore one of the main contributions of this study is to extend the application of fdes to model dynamics and mitigation scenarios of the coronavirus spreadyong zhang conceptualization methodology software writing-original draft preparation writing-reviewing and editing management and coordination responsibility for the research activity planning and execution xiangnan yu software methodology data curation visualization sun hongguang supervision geoffrey r tick formal analysis data curation wei wei resources bin jin supervision funding acquisitionthe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paperthe coronavirus-2019 covid-19 represents the cause of the pandemic that is currently affecting worldwide since the first reports of cases from wuhan a city in the hubei province of china at the end of 2019 the disease has spread rapidly across the world1 covid-19 similarly to the virus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is a beta-coronavirus that can be spread to humans through intermediate hosts such as bats2 the coronavirus covid-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge we have faced since world war ii actually more than 3800000 confirmed cases of covid-19 with 265000 new deaths have been reported3
the mortality rate declared by who is around 2 unfortunately older age was associated with increased mortality with a case fatality rate of 815 among those aged 70 to 79 years and 80 years or older respectively4

5 covid-19 is much more than a health crisis it has the potential to create devastating social economic and political crises that will leave deep scarsto date in italy a total of 215000 positive cases of coronavirus and 30000 people dead have been recorded with an evident increasing trend3

italy is therefore the third most affected country in the world for the number of infected and dramatically the second for the number of deaths after the united states among the first containment measures implemented by our government 11 municipalities in the north of italy were quarantined despite this the spread continued aggressively and on 11th march the restriction and social distancing measures were extended to the whole nationthese measures aimed to ensure the social distance between people avoiding the people aggregation most of the services and commercial activities have been closed and in open services the social distance between individuals of at least 1 meter must be guaranteed with protective masks7

8 however although these procedures serve to decrease the spread of the virus people are experiencing suddenly a change in their daily routine limiting many personal and work activitiesit is understandable that during this time people may experience increased anxiety and stress levels as they limit social interactions and spend long periods at home9 previous research has shown a significant psychosocial impact on people during times of global epidemic10
anxiety and fear over personal health or the health of loved ones are typical reactions to a global pandemic other feelings can include anger frustration and boredom over the uncertainty of when life will return to normal in high-stress situations and loneliness some people may experience symptoms of depression or post-traumatic stress disorder11
sexual function is influenced by multiple factors that impact the emotional or hormonal aspect12 furthermore in several studies parity level of education lifestyle and work are some of the characteristics who could influence sexual life currently in the literature there are no data regarding the change in sexual function during the social restriction period however the stressful period has been linked to female reproduction by contrast much less research attention has been focused on the relationship between stress and sexual functioningboth psychological and physiological components can potentially be involved in the relationship between stress and sexual function13 the evidence of the negative effects of stress on sexual function is consistent and the mechanisms involved in this relationship are not well defined14 several studies document the hormonal mechanisms involved in the suppression of reproductive function by both acute and chronic stressors psychologically stress can interfere with sexual activity through both emotional and cognitive changes that distract the individual from focusing on sexual cues this distraction from sexual stimuli would result in lower levels of arousal because the women experiencing higher levels of stress may not be attending to the sexual stimuli at the same level of participants with lower levels of stress distraction from sexual cues has been shown to have deleterious effects on both genital and subjective arousal in women15 probably the fear of contagion the stressful situation and the change in daily life may hurt the sexual activity of the women examined16 this study aims to evaluate the modification of sexual function in an italian reproductive-age women group during covid-19 pandemic periodis an observation analysis of reproductive age women referred to the department of gynecological and obstetric of sandro pertini hospital of rome to physiopathology of reproduction and andrology unit sandro pertini hospital of rome and to pelvic floor surgery and proctology department of campus biomedico university of rome between february 2018 and february 2020 who had completed specific questionnaires to assess sexuality and quality of life during their first visit4 weeks after the introduction of the social distancing measures due to the covid-19 outbreak they were invited to respond to the questionnaires again all data were evaluated from a gynecological and urogynecological internal database the research was conducted according to good clinical practice guidelines strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology strobe guidelines the institutional review board approved the studythe women enrolled in the study were visited for the first time at the aforementioned departments for several reasons gynecological check-up urogynaecological diseases contraception required infertility and pelvic control ultrasound all women had completed the specific sexual function and quality of live questionnaires female sexual function index fsfi and the female sexual distress scale fsds questionnaires for the sexual function evaluation and the 36-item short form survey sf-36 for the quality of life assessment at the time of the visit as we usually propose17 18 19
during the covid-19 epidemic period at least 4 weeks after the introduction of the restrictive measures given the impossibility of returning to the specific outpatient these women were invited to answer the same questionnaire to re-evaluate sexual function and quality of life questions were sent by e-mail to avoid the telephone interview that could influence the answers of the women interviewed a time limit of 3 days was offered to respond to the questionnaires the inclusion criteria were as follows women in reproductive age 1845 years old sexually active women who live with them not infected with covid-19 virus a compilation of fsfi fsds and sf-36 previously at least 4 weeks before the covid-19 epidemic period and the introduction of the restrictive measures signature of informed consent and consent to the processing of health data for research purposesthe exclusion criteria were as follows no sexually active women under the age of 18 or over 45 covid-19 positivity sexual partner with covid-19 infection superficial and profound dyspareunia women with chronic pelvic pain deep endometriosis or interstitial cystitisbladder pain syndrome neurogenic bladder gynecological cancer or urological cancer history of pelvic radiotherapy pelvic organ prolapse  grade 3 according to pop-q classification pregnancy menopause premature ovarian failure pof all the gynecological urological and oncological diseases diagnosed in the period between the first and the second compilation of the questionnaires which may have influenced sexual life and quality of life no signature of informed consent the definition of sexual activity was as follows sexual intercourse between women and the partner defined as penile penetration of the vagina we have not rated solitary sex or nonpenetrative sex unfortunately the data related to autoeroticism and nonpenetrative sex were missing in the pre-covid period and therefore were not collected for analysis nonsexually active women mean the absence of sexual intercourse during the analyzed period all the e-mails containing the questionnaires were received by a single author mcs who systematically entered the data in a shared database anonymously for the patients respecting the current privacy rulesdemographic and individual characteristics age work educational level contraception parity smoking were analyzed to assess the possible correlation with the change in sexual function during the epidemic period all the women analyzed live in the same house with their partnerthe selection of women characteristics who can influence sexual function has been extrapolated from the available data in the databasethe primary endpoint was the assessment of change in womens sexual function during the government-imposed social restriction period due to the covid-19 virus epidemic by analyzing the frequency of sexual intercourse fsfi and fsds questionnaires the secondary endpoint was the evaluation of the impact of these social restriction rules on the quality of life calculated with the sf-36 questionnaire women who did not respond to all parts of the questionnaires were excluded from the analysisthe incidence of events was analyzed for statistical significance by using the fisher exact test odds ratio or and 95 confidence intervals cis were calculated for each comparison the t-test and mann-whitney u test were used to compare continuous parametric and nonparametric variables when the data do not fit into the normal distribution respectively correlations between numerical parameters were computed using the spearman rank correlation coefficient paired t-test was applied to determine the change in questionnaires fsfi fsds and sf-36 values univariable and multivariable analysis through a logistic regression anova was used to assess the predictive value and relative risk of specific variables all analyses were conducted using the statistical package for the social sciences spss 220 for mac ssps chicago il significance was set at a p-value of 05254 patients were enrolled in the study 101 were excluded from the analysis because they did not meet the proposed inclusion criteria 11 refused to participate and 53 were lost to follow-up figure 1
 therefore 89 patients were considered for the final analysis the median age was 39 2850 years the other baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in table 1
 overall the mean number of sexual intercoursesmonth decreased significantly from 63  19 to 23  18 39  12 p  0001 and 8 9 women did not have sexual intercourse during the month of social restriction the number of women who practiced 4 sexual intercoursesmonth 4 weeks after the introduction of the social distancing measures due to the covid-19 outbreak decreased from 89 100 to 52 584 p  023 and the women who had 8 sexual intercoursesmonth decreased from 31 348 vs 8 9 p  0007 median fsfi was 285 before the covid-19 period while during the containment measures it was 197the total fsfi score decreased significantly 292  42 vs 192  33 97  26 p  0001 the change of specific items desire arousal lubrication orgasm satisfaction and pain is shown in table 2

 after adjusting all those variables in multivariable analysis working outside the home and combination of working outside the home  university educational level  parity 1 were the independent factors of a lower fsfi after 4 weeks from the beginning of the covid-19 periodthe study showed a decrease in sexual function and quality of life in reproductive-age women during the social restriction period due to the covid-19 epidemic despite the longer cohabitation time women who live with their partners have reduced significantly the sexual activity specifically women who practiced 4 sexual intercourse a month before government measures decreased from 89 100 to 52 584 social distancing measures imposed must be respected to try to decrease the infections and deaths smart-working is raised interpersonal relationships have decreased but people had to adapt and understand that it is extremely useful for the whole populationnevertheless in this atmosphere of generalized alarm the way of life is inevitably changed this social restriction and the uncertainty about the future have an impact on peoples quality of life and sexual function20 the main psychological impact to date is caused by high rates of stress and depression anxiety and dissatisfaction9

21
in times of high stress sexual activity can be reduced more in women who do not have a partner at home because the distancing measures prohibit going out12 however as demonstrated in our results women who live with their partners also suffer from negative influences from the external environment and showed a significantly lower fsfi and sf-36 scores during the covid-19 epidemic also the increase in sexual distress negatively affects womens quality of life this worsening probably is due to the emotional impact caused by the emergency on the women psychology9
during the initial phase of the covid-19 outbreak in china female gender student status and specific physical symptoms were associated with a greater psychological impact and higher levels of stress anxiety and depression22 the psychological trauma is felt by the health workers surprisingly in the non-frontline chinese nurses and the general public severity was significantly higher than the frontline nurses who are in close contact with covid-19 patients therefore people confined to home far from a real perception of the epidemiological situation also experience generalized fear21 certainly as already proposed in china during the forced quarantine the introduction of specific health information and some precautionary measures including psychological support has been linked to a lower level of stress anxiety and depression and a better psychological outcome11 unfortunately in the present study there are no data on the association between psychometric alteration and sexual activity in fact the analyzed women had not completed psychological teststhe decrease in the average number of sexual intercourses during an extreme stress period depends on several variables23

24 peoples priorities have certainly changed and sexual arousal and relationship status are influenced by the surrounding environment inevitably women tend to decrease sexual activity during this period sometimes with a significant impact on marital life above all if the stressful period is prolonged25

26
therefore the panic of contagion fear of having contact with the partner working outside the home 30 of our population reported partner working outside the home during the epidemic period anxiety and depression compromise daily life furthermore less body care during the quarantine may have affected the reduction of desire the sexual dysfunction measured by fsfi was found in 67 of the sample associated with a sedentary lifestyle27 in the present study women working outside the home during the covid-19 outbreak period showed a greater reduction in sexual function and fsfi and sf-36 scores than in women working in the home these results could be explained by the greater exposure of these women to the external environment and therefore to the possibility of infecting the sexual partner indeed the desire is significantly reduced in this group of women14
a significant difference was also observed between university educational level vs nonuniversity educational level women women who had a higher level of education showed a greater decline in terms of sexual activity and quality of life perhaps the greater propensity for critical reading of pandemic information strict compliance with the rules and a higher percentage of women working outside the home into the group could affect sexual desire and quality of life21

28 parity 1 was another factor influencing negatively fsfi due to the constant and demanding presence of children at home which could reduce sexual desire we excluded pregnant women because it has already been widely demonstrated that pregnancy significantly diminishes sexual function in women29 probably facing a stressful period reduces sexual desire and quality of life the activation of psychological and sexual assistance programs can be useful in women who will not be able to solve the problem after the end of quarantine but the end of social restrictions and the return to normal daily life will be essential to restore womens psychological balancethe acute stress caused by the governments social restriction measures to contain covid-19 infections has worsened sexual function and quality of life in women living with their partners probably due to the inability to adapt quickly to a significant change in daily life this deterioration may be due to the emotional impact caused by the emergency although sexual activity is not the main concern during the covid-19 emergency period it is a key aspect of womens lives23

30 to our knowledge this is the first study in the literature that analyzes the change in sexual function in women of reproductive age during the covid-19 pandemicsurely it would be very interesting to evaluate the correlation between restriction measures and the relational aspect with the partner but the present study is essentially aimed at assessing sexual function and frequency of sexual intercourse therefore the main limitations of the study were the low number of participants analyzed psychological tests were not included and data on masturbation self-heroism solitary and nonpenetrative sex were not collected also the emotional relationship and affectivity within the couple were not evaluated further prospective studies on a larger number of women are needed to confirm these results and any possible change in the national birth rate due to a reduction in sexual activity

the covid19 coronavirus pandemic has presented unique problems and opportunities for international business and entrepreneurship as parnell et al 2020 p 1 states the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 lays bare the society we have created centuries of global processes and the cultivated networked society and its interdependent infrastructural architecture no region of the world has not been impacted by the virus and there does not seem to be any distinction between developed and developing countries in terms of the effects of the virus world health organization 2020 while there has been other health pandemics that have affected the global economy the uncertainty caused by covid19 has resulted in new ways of looking at entrepreneurship liguori and winkler 2020 other health pandemics such as the middle east respiratory syndrome and ebola have affected specific geographic regions while coronavirus has had global consequences this means a new way of understanding how entrepreneurship results in times of heightened uncertainty is needed in addition the quick progression of coronavirus has resulted in significant cultural social and business change from a cultural perspective it has altered societal practices most notably in the form of social distancing due to the highly contagious nature of the disease individuals were told to practice social distancing which meant maintaining a physical space when in the presence of others this has led to a reliance more on online rather than physical communication while there are many disadvantages associated with physical distancing such as the inability to read nonverbal cues it has created advantages in the new form of communication made possible from digital technologies this has emphasized more the use of digital devices and communication methods to exchange ideas it can also be easier to communicate online rather than in a physical form due to geographic reasons this has led to increased usages of streaming facilities that has further intensified societies need for digitalization qian 2018 from a social perspective there has been a dramatic reduction in group activities this has been an unprecedented event due to the way it has changed communities there is now more emphasis on individual rather than group activity this is not to say group activities do not exist as they do but in a new formatsince coronavirus first emerged in january 2020 it has quickly spread to become a health issue of global importance unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome sars which was largely concentrated in asia coronavirus has had a huge effect on europe and north america this resulted in businesses shutting down and individuals confined to their homes the new normal now refers to a lifestyle that encompasses social distancing and more emphasis on personal hygiene from a business perspective largescale events have been cancelled this has dramatically impacted the tourism and hospitality industries moreover most countries have instituted bans on group activities and this has led to largescale events being cancelled as entertainment sport and music events have become part of individuals lives this change has substantially affected the events industry in addition the flow on effect to activities such as tourism and food purchases has stopped as this happened quickly for most event organizers there was no chance to instigate alternative events at home events such as live streaming of music in the musicians home are becoming popular thus entrepreneurship and entrepreneurs are needed to develop new types of events based on the environmental context the coronavirus pandemic is predicted to have worse economic effects than the 2008 global financial crisis the objective of this article is to discuss the implications for international business and entrepreneurship derived from the coronavirus pandemic the key research question for this article is how do international entrepreneurs navigate the coronavirus pandemic to answer this question the next section will further discuss the role of crisis management in influencing entrepreneurial behavior based on responses to the coronavirusprevious research on crisis management has tended to focus on natural disasters or financial events grewal  tansuhaj 2001 this has limited the current literature to crises that occur as a result of economic or weather related factors while there is some research about health crises the research tends to take a more narrow view of issues that in a way progress in a slow manner entrepreneurship literature has discussed crises management but more from an economic rather than a behavioral perspective as the current crises is still ongoing there needs to be more attention paid to how entrepreneurs attitudes and behaviors are changing based on creativity innovation and futuristic decisionmaking this will help to understand how resilient entrepreneurs are as they cope with the global uncertaintya crisis can be described as a phenomenon that does not occur often has a high level of uncertainty and impacts society a crisis generates a sense of urgency in how to respond to the situation crises can differ in length type and magnitude depending on its impact on society in order to respond to crises there needs to be coordination among stakeholders natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes and bushfires tend to be a oneoff event that occur based on specific environmental circumstances this means that while they continually occur they are typically sporadic and can be controlled with the use of interventions other types of crises such as technological disasters such as computer bugs have serious effects on business but the origin is known and easier to deal with firms from a management perspective governmentlevel crises such as political deadlocks or changes in leadership can have a large effect on the stability of a country health crises are harder to understand as they are typically infrequent and unpredictable thus health crises can be characterized as a black swan in that they are unexpected but have severe consequences bogle  sullivan 2009 black swan events are characterized as being surprising of great significance and having a major economic effect kuckertz et al 2020 recent health crises have included the ebola crisis which affected the centralwestern african region in terms of income level manufacturing and food processing cortez and johnston 2020 in addition the sars epidemic had a negative effect on production and sourcing of supplies however the coronavirus is a more aggressive pandemic that has affected most regions of the world in addition the consequences of the pandemic have resulted in changing workplace and societal practices that have previously not occurred before the global nature of the pandemic has meant a concurrent effect on most health systems thus the focus has been on treating patients based on available information while at the same time trying to safeguard current citizens the sudden effect of the pandemic represents an opportunity for entrepreneurs to develop quickly necessary products and servicesthe coronavirus crisis has threatened the ability of a business to conduct is activities due to social policies being introduced such as working from home and social distancing this combination has made it difficult for many businesses particularly those in the service economy to survive in addition the cash flow of many businesses has substantially changed in a short time frame some businesses most notably supermarkets and technology companies have flourished but also faced difficulties in terms of high customer demands and supply chain difficultiescrises also result in market turbulence due to changes in routines and structures williams gruber sutcliffe shepherd  zhao 2017 businesses that have established specific capabilities based on the continuance of current market circumstances have had to dramatically reevaluate their decisions few businesses would have been prepared for the current health crises despite having risk management and resilience strategies in place the concept of resilience has been studied in the entrepreneurship literature in terms of understanding how business adapt or resist change doern williams  vorley 2019 resilience incorporates a sense of innovativeness in terms of being able to change business activity in addition innovative businesses tend to be able to anticipate and then adjust to change in an appropriate way this enables them to pivot or change direction depending on market need crises have had a profound effect on businesses particularly small businesses that rely on weekly projections in order to maintain their market share the unpredictability resulting from crisis means an increased need for government assistance and supportthe ecosystems metaphor was first used by moore 1993 to describe the competitive marketplace in terms of predators and prey this language was a way of understanding the strengths and weaknesses of firms in the economic environment as there are firms that are acquired by others this terminology is a useful way of describing the process it took some time for the concept of entrepreneurial ecosystems to gain popularity in the marketplace due to the emphasis on other ways to describe innovative activities occurring in a place the concept of an entrepreneurial ecosystem is an important way of understanding the effects at the present time and in the future as a result of the coronavirusaudretsch et al 2019 p 314 states the metaphor ecosystem reflects the tendency in academia to describe the old phenomena of agglomeration effects of regions urban regional national ecosystem and industries agriculture chemical manufacturing media finance ecosystems that is clusters either of firms business entrepreneurial ecosystems or activities service innovation digital ecosystems traditionally there has been a tendency to focus on an individual entrepreneur or organization rather than considering their contextual environment this has changed with an increased awareness of how the environment affects entrepreneurship particularly as a result of crisis such as the coronavirus an ecosystem is broadly defined as a purposeful collaborating network of dynamic interacting systems that have an everchanging set of dependencies within a given context sussan  acs 2017 p 57 this means that in an ecosystem a variety of entities are required in order for it to function in a proper manner this requires interaction among entities that encourages collaboration and information sharing with regard to current events including critical incidents such as the coronavirus within an ecosystem there are different types and levels of information flow depending on the entrepreneurial cycleecosystems have a dynamic nature as they change based on environmental conditions this means to truly understand how an entrepreneurial ecosystem evolves requires a great deal of time and effort this is due to the way the interactions in an ecosystem determine the effect of a crisis natural ecosystems are defined as a community of living organisms in conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment where the eco part of the word is assumed to be related to the environment and system implies the function as a collection of related parts that function as a unit smith  smith 2015 p 19 this definition highlights the interaction between science and business from the coronavirus entrepreneurial ecosystems are based on the selforganization of members around entrepreneurial pursuits and in times of crisis are important ways to cope with change this means that as more members become involved in entrepreneurship the ecosystem acts in a sustainable way this enables more entrepreneurial action to take place based on the embedded interactions between stakeholders affected by the coronavirus in order to grow an entrepreneurial ecosystem there needs to be strategies put in place in order for more entities to succeed in entrepreneurial pursuitsacs et al 2014 p 479 define an entrepreneurial ecosystem as a dynamic institutionally embedded interaction between entrepreneurial attitudes abilities and aspirations by individuals which drives the allocation of resources through the creation and operation of new ventures this definition is particularly relevant for how to deal with the crisis derived from the coronavirus the main components of an entrepreneurial ecosystem include a community culture sustaining networks and infrastructure thus there is no single formula for an entrepreneurial ecosystem rather it relies on environmental forces for its development this means some entrepreneurial ecosystems will be more efficient in offering ways to deal with the coronavirus due to the expansion of entrepreneurial activities therefore the trajectory of a region is dependent on the existence of entrepreneurial ecosystems that encourage new venture creation most conceptualizations of ecosystems are based on the assumption that they contain similar entities this is not always true as entrepreneurs have different access to resources depending on socioeconomic factors and impact of crises this means the participation and involvement in an ecosystem will be based on opportunity as well as necessityplatform ecosystems are based on companies generating a set of tools that can be built upon by others this can include integrated technologies that reduce the need for research and development by sharing knowledge about the coronavirus infrastructure refers to the portfolio of public goods that facilitates entrepreneurship infrastructure includes highways ports and telecommunications that are normally managed by government entities other forms of infrastructure include education institutions and research facilities that are funded by the government in an ecosystem these forms of infrastructure are utilized as a form of concurrent activities that occur based on environmental changes from the coronavirus over time these activities either align or diverge depending on the involvement of ecosystem membersan ecosystem approach to entrepreneurship has been embraced due to the way it captures the evolving and dynamic nature of entrepreneurship there are many different forces that influence entrepreneurship that are constantly changing based on environmental conditions this means more policy makers and business leaders are trying to handle the coronavirus based on an entrepreneurial ecosystem philosophy a vibrant ecosystem is the result of many activities that support innovation and new venture creation in order to support high levels of entrepreneurial activity in a region there needs to be a number of activities occurring on a constant basis that focus on problem solving for the coronavirus this includes learning and information sharing that helps foster innovative behavior the main attributes of a vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem includes deep reservoirs of early stage investments entrepreneurshipspecific human capital cutting edge research institutions lead users of innovations dense social networks among entrepreneurs and cultural orientations that are supportive of entrepreneurial activities roundy 2019 p 4 early stage investment is needed in a region in order to foster innovative projects regarding the coronavirus this helps designate money to causes that are likely to have a positive flow on effect in the economy due to the uncertainty of some innovations regarding the coronavirus it helps to have a foothold in a number of early stage projects this reduces the risk associated with just one project by sharing the costs and time involved among multiple projects this risk reduction strategy enables investors to have a more diverse investment portfolio in terms of potential cures or vaccines for coronavirus thereby sharing both the financial and nonfinancial gains or losseshuman capital is required in entrepreneurial ventures that require proactive individuals to take initiative in developing business ventures the type of human capital needed differs from scientific knowledge in the case of medical technologies to more generalist business knowledge associated with startups as human capital involves specific skills it is important that regions encourage individuals with these skill sets to reside there this can build capacity in certain topic areas and facilitate further entrepreneurial activity some regions are known for the industries that are located there which provides a motivation for individuals interested in those regions to move there other regions establish themselves based on specific skill sets of people residing in the area that are suited to specific occupations this includes areas that have a high level of engineers or scientists thus entrepreneurshipspecific human capital needs to be considered based on the regional and industry context depending on the severity of the coronavirus cutting edge research institutions encourage entrepreneurship through breakthrough innovations in order to bring about societal change there needs to be major innovations that change the status quo this helps drive competitiveness by introducing improved products services or processesresearch institutions enable science and education to transform current ways of thinking they also provide ways for individuals to learn about new practices that has flow on effects to other sectors of the economy this means it is important to foster the knowledgepractice association that is made possible by research institutions the investment that governments place on research institutions also has positive flow on effects in other areas of society this includes new inventions being made that have commercial potential due to the increased emphasis on the knowledge economy it is important that research institutions are given priority in government funding coronavirus schemes in addition more research institutions are becoming selffunded due to a need to diversity their income sources this enables less reliance on government funding and more emphasis on business partnershipslead users of innovations are entities that are among the first to try new products services or processes these first adopters help to test an innovation by providing necessary feedback this helps encourage related innovations to take place that enables a platform system to emerge being a firstmover in an industry is important and provides a way for entities to gain a reputation for being innovative dense social networks among entrepreneurs enable ideas to be circulated more easily this fosters information acquisition that is important in a knowledge economy obtaining access to relevant information in a timely basis is useful for competitive reasons therefore entrepreneurs who continually engage in networking activities can help encourage further entrepreneurship this means it is important to have events that enable entrepreneurs to interact with each other by providing relevant social forums it can speed up the innovation process as innovation can be the result of both planned and unplanned activities it helps to have continual networking activity this will foster by chance occurrences to happen among entrepreneurs thereby paving the way for more focus on proactive activities that involve innovation cultural orientations refer to the way entities want to learn about historical events or societal conditions this is useful in promoting a sense of inquisitiveness among individuals in a communityin an ecosystem there needs to be a diverse range of entities coexisting in order for it to work properly this includes a variety of industries that may or may not be complementary in most successful ecosystems there tends to be one dominant industry that has influenced its development normally the technology industry is referred to as being the originator of entrepreneurship but other industries such as manufacturing can also induce entrepreneurship needed to cope with the coronavirus for this reason ecosystems should also have industries at different development stages in order to create a more entrepreneurial environment this includes historically necessary industries such as banking and finance as well as new funding sources such as crowdsourcing this will enable older businesses to coexist with newer forms of business as it may take some time for new businesses to gain momentum in the market it helps to be patient with their development regarding coronavirus although there is a stereotype of entrepreneurial ventures launching quickly in reality it can take time for them to grow this is due to the businesses having different objectives in terms of growth strategy while most entrepreneurs are motivated by financial reasons there can also be social or environmental reasonsecosystems can be measured in terms of their connectivity density diversity and fluidity nambisan  baron 2013 connectivity means how well linked are different entities in an ecosystem some entities might communicate on a frequent basis but this needs to also be analyzed in terms of performance results if the connection results in a good outcome then it is likely to be referred to in a good way this means the quality versus the quantity of the communication should be assessed density refers to how many entities are part of the ecosystem environment in a highly dense ecosystem there are many different entities that are constantly engaged in entrepreneurship this results in an economy of scale and can produce more entrepreneurial business ventures diversity refers to the different types of entities in an ecosystem diversity can be measured in terms of size such as micro small medium and large businesses or alternatively different industry structures such as technology or retail other ways to define diversity include ethnicity or country of origin more diverse entities in an ecosystem are likely to be considered as necessary for entrepreneurship this is due to different views and ways of conducting entrepreneurship becoming apparent fluidity refers to the flow of entrepreneurship in an ecosystem in wellfunctioning ecosystems there is a continual flow of information and knowledge this helps to create a productive environment for entrepreneurshipcoronavirus has significantly affected international business particularly in terms of free movement across countries so taking an entrepreneurial ecosystem approach is useful regional trading blocs including the european union which were based on the idea of free movement between countries has changed due to individual countries closing their borders most notably countries like spain have banned travel between their neighboring countries while at the same time maintaining european union membership due to increased levels of internationalization because of both work family and lifestyle reasons the impact of these closed borders has been significant global society has become used to frequent international travel and interaction so border closures have been a surprising development as a result international institutions have had to deal with the pandemic at a country regional and international manner as international business and travel have been assumed to continue regardless of social change the health pandemic has surprised many people social interaction in a physical format is important for building a more cohesive international society thus the limitations placed on travel as a result of the virus have led to a deinternationalization strategy for many countries in addition to the large decrease in international travel has been the associated economic and political effects blame is being placed on governments for how they have dealt with the crises which is further fuelling international tensions due to the infectious nature of the disease there has been a ban in many countries on mass gatherings as global society is largely networked there has been further effects on business activity the sport industry is one of the most effected by the restrictions put in place because of the virus almost all professional sport events including the olympics were cancelled due to the virusthe efforts to make travel effortless across geographic borders have been put at risk due to the virus in a time when there has been unprecedented international travel the travel restrictions have profoundly affected individuals particularly for international students this has been an area of concern as they have faced economic and social hardships for many individuals their economic and social life has been brought to a standstill because of the restrictions from the virus some countries have stayathome orders in place which have severely restricted movement in addition there are expected to be high economic psychological and social costs associated with the physical distancing restrictions in order to soften the impact of the virus governments have provided cash payments and income protection plans to those in need however many areas of the economy such as the informal sector are not eligible for government support this has increased the income inequality and associated economic effects for certain segments of societyentrepreneurs are agents of change and provide a source of hope for many in order to spur economic activity entrepreneurs are needed as they come up with solutions to market problems there are indirect effects from the crisis including export and import delays which is affecting global trade coronavirus has resulted in more stress and tensions in the international business environment the stress has come from the changes needed to stay competitive while at the same time protecting individual health businesses have had to change their models to an online format in order to access customers for many businesses based on traditional face to face interaction this has required a change in current business practices some more entrepreneurial businesses have been able to transform more quickly than others as a result of environmental changes the reason for this is the desire of the business leaders to stay in the marketplace while respecting required regulations this has caused much tension among businesses due to the need to change quickly entrepreneurs by definition thrive from uncertainty however the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a large amount of uncertainty from a variety of sources this means there is still uncertainty about whether future changes are required or if the changes made are adequate in the past most entrepreneurship was based on market uncertainty but the current pandemic includes market health and social uncertainty this combination requires strong leadership about the changes needed by businesscoronavirus is a zoonotic disease which means it originated in animals then spread to humans there is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the origins of the disease that is causing increased tension in the world the lack of knowledge about how to potentially find a cure or vaccine is leading to further stress as people are spending greater amounts of time online it has changed the way businesses market their services social media and in particularly online communities are a way that businesses are connecting with their customers people now have more time to spend on artistic or creative ventures so they are establishing social media pages the large amount of people previously in socially interactive positions such as baristas tourism operators and musicians now need to find another social outlet online communities and forums have flourished as a safe way of interacting with other individuals in addition new types of products such as facemasks are being made to cater for changing societal needsinitially the effects of the virus were dismissed by global political leaders due to mistaken belief in its impact gosling scott  hall 2020 the lockdown measures in wuhan china were expected to be sufficient to health the spread of the virus this did not occur due to global travel carrying the virus to other parts of the world in addition mass public gatherings including sport and music events further spread the virus due to the role of community transmission played in the increased number of individuals with the virus social distancing policies were put in place due to the lack of medical technology to treat the virus other interventions including home isolation and quarantine began the severity of these restrictions differed depending on the geographic location of an individual countries like australia closed its borders to nonresidents and instigated a mandatory twoweek hotel stay for all new arrivals in the country in addition state borders in australia were closed in order to further restrict travel and contain the virus these closures were unprecedented as never before have the borders between states in australia been shut this resulted in simultaneous state and federal government policies regarding the viruswith many countries imposing travel bans economic activity weakened due to the uncertainty in the business environment the virus closed most tourism and hospitality places including hotels restaurants and pubs this is in contrast to previous media attention on overtourism and saturation of the tourism market within a couple of months from when the virus first originated there has been an unprecedented shut down of many sectors of the economy the flow on effects particularly to the informal economy has also been profound this has meant the food industry instead of offering on site services have had to switch to offering take away services this affected their supply chain in terms of the types of products and services they providedan alternative possibility is that overall entrepreneurial activity in the global economy may not be adversely affected by coronavirus this is likely not to be true due to the profound way coronavirus has changed societal structures although the nature of entrepreneurship as a result of coronavirus may undergo a fundamental change with more entrepreneurial thinking required to meet society needs for this reason it is important that entrepreneurs design their ventures with safety and security in mind this will enable a number of ventures to be started that address consumers concerns about the health crisis part of this change requires asking if the entrepreneurship is actually different to precoronavirus forms or is the same this will enable a better understanding about how pandemics affect entrepreneurship and the ability of entrepreneurs to cope with multiple pressures unlike other crises the coronavirus crisis has resulted in entrepreneurs being able to respond quickly to multiple needs thus an important issue for entrepreneurs is whether consumers concerns about the pandemic will lead to more entrepreneurship based on safety and security thereby creating a need for further innovative activitythe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and its associated coronavirus disease covid-19 emerged from probable zoonotic origin from chinas hubei province in early december 2019 the virus and disease are collectively referred to as covid-19 in this paper covid-19 rapidly spread around the world and was declared a pandemic by the world health organization who on 11 march 2020 httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019events-as-they-happen as of 29 april 2020 the john hopkins university coronavirus dashboard httpscoronavirusjhuedumaphtml reports more than 31 million confirmed infections and more than 217200 fatalities globallythis paper uses quantitative and qualitative measures to assess the likelihood of natural hazards coinciding with and influencing epidemiological characteristics of the covid-19 pandemic natural hazard curves for seasonal eg tropical cyclone floods heat waves monsoons tornadoes hazards are plotted against covid-19 time-series forecasts fig 1 stochastic eg earthquakes volcanic eruptions hazards are also considered in a general sense but not specifically analysed the effects of these natural hazards on human life depends on the severity of the hazard the exposure of humans and infrastructure to it the vulnerability of exposed elements and the ability to respond and recover covid-19 has the potential to significantly impact the exposure vulnerability and response elements associated with natural disasters and vice-versa thereby requiring a systems approach to analyse risk and resilience eg simonovic 2011 harrison and william 2016approaches to mitigating covid-19 risks share some commonalities with natural disaster mitigation for example enacting social distancing protocols to reduce covid-19 exposure could be considered analogous to land-use planning to reduce exposure to natural hazards eg floods earthquakes quigley et al 2020 covid-19 health and service policies aimed to preference vulnerable groups including the elderly those with ill health and comorbidities the homeless or underhoused and people from vulnerable socioeconomic groups that might be vulnerable to financial psychosocial andor physical challenges lancet 2020 are crudely analogous to defining and enforcing seismic building codes and strengthening earthquake-vulnerable buildings to reduce life safety risks eg stucchi et al 2011 hosseini et al 2009epidemiological forecasts of covid-19 infections and fatalities fig 1 exhibit large spatial and temporal variations due to differences in modelling approaches mitigation scenarios eg supress and lift strategy used in hong kong and singapore see normile 2020 health system capacity epidemiological parameters and demographic parameters httpscovid19-scenariosorg changes induced by external eg the concurrency of other emergent phenomena such as natural disasters and internal factors eg relaxation of social distancing measures return-to-work decisions can impact on many of these parameters significantly and thus create more uncertainty in infection and fatality predictions fig 1 it is therefore challenging to define what a worse-case covid-19 fatality scenario is given the susceptibility of forecasts to major perturbations induced by phenomena with uncertain spatial and temporal propertiesgiven this context resolving policy priorities in response to the covid-19 pandemic and associated compounding effects of natural hazards involves a complex higher-level decision-making process that must inevitably be guided by scientific insight colwell and machlis 2019 filippelli 2020 in view of this our study seeks to provide a qualitative analysis of the combined effect of covid-19 epidemic and external perturbations specifically natural disasters to propose thaticovid-19 epidemiological models may be highly sensitive to disasters originating from natural hazards and thus inclusion of seasonal and  or stochastic events might better enable worst-case scenarios to be considerediicontemporary covid-19 related policies such as relaxations of mitigative measures may increase the probability that diverse multi-hazards will interact with the covid-19 crisis and stimulate concurrent and cascading crises andiiidisaster preparedness strategies and resourcing should carefully consider the impact of covid-19 on future response operations including adaptation of implementation modalities to account for the disruption of critical supply chains the potential localisation of response efforts due to limited mobility of humanitarian actors availability of evacuation centres with capacity for social distancing the capacity of humanitarian workersvolunteers and medical staff to respond to natural disasters in covid-affected regions and the availability of personal protective equipment and medical equipment eg respirators to incorporate large spikes in needin this paper we forthwith use the term natural disaster to refer to an adverse event or series of events that originate from the interaction of hazardous events of natural origin with humans andor their physical andor socioeconomic systems and infrastructure droughts floods meteorological and earthquakes geophysical are the most common natural disasters in the world affecting millions of people every year kouadio et al 2012 natural disaster fatalities since 1900 reveal decreases in average annual deaths from major drought and flood events and increases in fatalities associated with earthquakes including tsunamis and extreme weather eg tornadoes tropical cyclones and temperature events eg heat waves fig 2 fatality estimates from extreme temperature events are considered a minimum value because heat and cold temperature extremes may exacerbate pre-existing medical conditions and contribute to mortality rates without formal attribution medina-ramon et al 2006a concurrent hazard is defined herein as hazardous events of natural physical eg earthquake volcanic eruption flood tropical cyclone or biologic origin eg an infectious disease such as covid-19 that overlap in time and space the occurrence of two or more hazardous events eg an earthquake during covid-19 is referred to here as a multi-hazard scenario aka compound events although this term has a broader definition than used here eg zscheischler et al 2018 hazards that are sourced from triggered by andor influenced by preceding hazards are referred to as cascading hazards for context we provide brief examples belowon january 12 2010 a catastrophic 70 magnitude earthquake struck haiti causing more than 200000 fatalities displacing more than 15 million people and affecting 3 million people overall doocy et al 2013 see also fig 2 the earthquake severely damaged the public sanitation system and created ideal conditions for outbreaks of major infectious diseases nine months later a cholera outbreak originating from human transmission orata et al 2014 began to spread across the country eventuating in more than 9000 deaths and 650000 infections httpswwwcdcgovcholerahaitiindexhtml prior to 2010 there was no reported history of cholera in haiti long-term impacts and hazards originating from the earthquake crisis socioeconomic impacts infrastructure impacts hazards such as aftershocks spatially and temporally overlapped interacted with and amplified the cholera impacts these could be considered as a protracted multi-hazard scenario with cascading elements and disastrous impactsother cascading multi-hazard examples includeiincreased long-term flood hazard in christchurch new zealand caused by and concurrent with the 20102011 canterbury earthquake sequence quigley and

cascading effects of hurricanes irma and maria compounded societal vulnerability through infrastructure damage and power outages that left millions without electricity water and cell phone service for 24 weeksiiithe 2015 magnitude 78 nepal earthquake along with its magnitude 73 aftershock triggered snow avalanches largest  23 km2 and thousands of landslides the latter of which caused flooding due to river blockages and landslide dam breaches martha et al 2017 blocked and damaged road infrastructure directly impacted earthquake response efforts including search and rescue activities the timely provision of emergency aid the ability to conduct rapid needs assessments and the provision of essential services khazai et al 2015 the complex spatial distribution of landslides highlights the need for considering additional dimensions including seasonality in a multi-hazard scenario roback et al 2018ivextreme events eg floods of 1987 1998 and 2007 tropical cyclone in 1991 in bangladesh that offer a perspective of the interaction between extreme natural hazards and socioeconomic vulnerabilities and how that could be amplified by covid-19 siddique et al 1991 khalil 1993 mushtaque et al

shaking damage triggered a tsunami with disastrous impacts including a major malfunction at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant that exposed people to severe radiation hazards locally and significant hazards globally ten hoeve and jacobson 2012it is also pertinent to consider hazard cascades with epidemic components for instance previous cases of acute respiratory infections aris following natural disasters can shed light on disaster response needed to counter the spread of covid-19 aris were a major concern following natural disasters such as the south asian tsunami world

surmieda et al 1992 and hurricanes campanella 1999 outbreaks of other communicable diseases eg water borne diseases in communities affected by natural disasters are commonly attributed to crowding of displaced people in camps weekly morbidity and mortality report pakistan vol 23dews 20062017 marin et al 2006 watson et al 2007 kouadio et al 2012several natural disasters have now occurred during the covid-19 crisis we consider some of these in sects 3 and 4 many countries around the world including those with increasing covid-19 infection and fatality rates are highly susceptible to seasonal natural disasters some decision-makers have reduced or are considering reduction of covid-19 mitigation measures based on epidemiologic data andor priority valuation of other inputs eg economic political the likelihood of future natural disasters and potential impacts on covid-19 exposure and vulnerability is scarcely mentioned in these narratives figure 1 presents epidemiological forecast models for covid-19 fatalities and infections for the usa australia bangladesh and china developed using httpscovid19-scenariosorg software curves were generated by iteratively bootstrapping the covid reproduction number ro simulation onset date and  mitigation variables to maximize goodness-of-fit between confirmed cumulative fatalities and modelled deaths through the same time period several alternative scenarios were considered by adjusting the  mitigation variable onlythe average ro ranges from 19 australia to 39 china bangladesh is 38 and the united states is 32 these estimates are consistent with the range of reported ro values from scientific literature httpswwwnaturecomarticlesd41586-020-01003-6 noting that the ro values used here are intended to be an average value since covid-19 onset rather than a value representing the current situation that are modified by adjusting the  mitigation parameter at various time-slices mitigation dates for each country were derived from internet media reports by searching country name and covid-19 mitigation actions in google and google news search engines the mitigation  effectiveness parameter was estimated from our analysis of the mitigation protocols taken as represented by the media consulted for mitigation dates a preference was given to peer-reviewed literature andor government-issued information sources for example in australia we assigned a mitigation estimate of 75 range 50 to 90 effectiveness commencing on 23 march 2020 when many places of social gathering were closed and a variety of mitigation strategies aimed to reduce social contact were progressively enacted based on a government source summary document httpswwwhealthgovaunewshealth-alertsnovel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alerthow-to-protect-yourself-and-others-from-coronavirus-covid-19limits-on-public-gatherings-for-coronavirus-covid-19 some countries have highly incremented and highly regionalized mitigation processes httpswwwcdcgovmmwrvolumes69wrmm6915e2htmscidmm6915e2x for which a single ro metric grossly simplifies the reality for example the us where 20 march 2 april 12 april in these cases we acknowledge this complexity but consider our estimates to best represent available information at the time of writing ro values mitigation dates and  effectiveness estimates and projected fatalities are included in the supplementary information item 2 accompanying this manuscriptinfection and cumulative fatality scenarios vary widely and are highly sensitive to small changes in  mitigation scenarios eg fig 1d chn398567 vs chn398567 particularly for countries with higher ro values both estimates are intended for the main purpose of demonstrating how reducing mitigation measures can dramatically influence these projectionsin the case of the us where a lifting of restrictions and re-opening of businesses is being considered reduction in mitigation measures is likely to sustain higher infection and fatality rates see usa32307080 curve concurrent with peak tornado hazard season in the southeast and central us blue curve overlapping with increasing and peak wildfire and heatwave hazards and potentially overlapping with increasing flood hurricane and tropical cyclone hazards other covid-19 related restrictions are likely to compound natural disaster and covid-19 risks for example the us forest service has cancelled its planned seasonal burns due to covid-19 restrictions and travel restrictions may reduce the likelihood of provision of international support for firefighting this is explored in more detail in sect 6in the case of australia where strong and increasing social distancing measures were enacted nationally beginning on 23 march daily confirmed infections are reducing significantly and the cumulative fatality curve has mostly plateaued as of 16 april 2020 infection and fatality rates began to increase in australia after the cessation of the severe 20192020 bushfire season black summer fires in which thousands of australians were forced to evacuate into communal environments had covid-19 emerged only 12 months earlier in australia community transmission risks would have been significantly higher all of the major seasonal hazards are reducing or at low levels it seems less likely that natural multi-hazard scenarios will concur with covid-19 although the protracted nature of the latter and possibility of stochastic hazards eg earthquakes and out-of-peak season floods means this is still possiblein the case of bangladesh infection and cumulative fatality rates are currently steeply increasing some mitigation measures have been in effect however the effectiveness of these is currently unclear cumulative fatality projections vary widely our results suggest sustained 70 average effectiveness in the absence of other concurrent disasters or major changes in internal variables could keep fatalities below 10000 but weaker mitigation strategies forecast  500000 deaths regardless of the mitigation scenarios considered here sharp increases in infections and deaths are predicted to overlap with the forthcoming tropical cyclone and heatwave peak hazard seasons and may overlap with peaks in monsoonal flood hazard these aspects are further considered in sect 6in the case of china renewed secondary spikes in infections in late march and early april enhance uncertainty in epidemiologic projections if the average post-peak infection and fatality rate reductions have plateaued our model suggests  4500 deaths chn3985 however if mitigative restrictions are relaxed and if infection resurgences are sustained and stimulate cascading infections it is conceivable albeit unlikely that cumulative fatalities could exceed 70000 or more eg chn398567 in the latter scenario infection and fatality rates could increase concurrently with increasing flood heatwave and hurricane and tropical cyclone hazards which cause more than 1000 fatalities per year in china on average han et al 2016 china also contains regions with high earthquake hazard to reduce risks of concurrent and cascading multi-hazards our analysis indicates that strong and sustained mitigation to reduce covid-19 infection rates are requiredthe covid-19 pandemic is active and continuously evolving the time interval over which our forecast models are valid is shorter than the expected duration of this crisis for example capturing rapid movement of hot spots through china italy spain turkey and the united states due to continuously evolving population dynamics and government measures adds an additional layer of complexity reducing the predictive power of forecasts over longer time periods in the absence of a vaccine it is conceivable that the covid-19 pandemic might last for multiple months or years and its resurgence may occur in waves as in any other previous major pandemic eg cohn 2008 adapting resurgence histories of previous covid-19 like pandemics eg human corona virus hcov-oc43 for modelling transmission dynamics kissler et al 2020 suggest that the current pandemic or its waves may last through 2024 this effectively translates into an increase in compound risks associated with covid-19 pandemic and therefore while our preliminary analysis of concurrent compound hazards is useful for the time interval considered it does not preclude the possibility for future multi-hazard scenarios concurrent with covid-19 to occur beyond the temporal extent of our analysison 19 march 2020 at midnight the croatian government introduced strict measures to counter the spread of covid-19 virus as the number of confirmed cases rose to 105 dong et al 2020 these included closing of borders shutting down all non-essential activities such as public events and gatherings and service facilities and requiring employers to facilitate working-from-home arrangements httpsbalkansaljazeeranetvijestiu-hrvatskoj-na-snagu-stupile-stroge-mjere-zabranjen-prelazak-granica these strict measures were enforced to promote social-distancing to reduce covid-19 communal infection risksconcurrent with the countrywide partial lockdown a moment magnitude mw 53 earthquake occurred in the northern suburbs of zagreb the capital of croatia with a population of over 800000 prior to this earthquake zagreb has been devastated by several moderate earthquakes the latest of which occurred in 1880 with a magnitude of 63 kozk and ermk 2010 that caused damage to about 500 buildings within a  25 km radius from the epicentre past experiences have shaped earthquake preparedness in zagreb and approximately 80 of buildings are built to standards consistent with the earthquake building design codes however the mw 53 event and its aftershocks in march 2020 caused significant damage and disruption in the city there was one fatality and at least 27 people suffered injuries electricity water and heating were lost in some parts of the city and about 250 houses sustained significant damage an estimated 59 people required temporary shelters due to loss of dwellings httpsabcnewsgocomhealthwirestoryaftershocks-rattle-croatian-capital-day-strong-quake-69744525the croatian earthquake is not an extreme natural disaster scenario however it provides a useful perspective of compound risks for example in the immediate aftermath of a natural disaster measures imposed to ensure social-distancing may collapse temporarily due to the moderate size of the event and relatively localized damage zone the croatian government managed to clamp down on partial lockdown measures within about a day by issuing new directives whereby the natural human behaviour of congregating in numbers and comforting each other in the aftermath of such an event was disrupted nonetheless it is evident that the risk of covid-19 transmission increased in a short-time window immediately following the zagreb earthquakethe daily new infectee rate fig 3 shows an apparent increase following the zagreb earthquake on 22 march 2020 within the covid-19 incubation time range further analysis is needed to ascertain the exact cause of this apparent signal although it is not unreasonable to presume that temporary disruption of social-distancing measures not only in zagreb but also in other parts of the country in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake might have played a role therefore the importance of acting rapidly and decisively by governing bodies in the immediate aftermath of a natural disaster is highlighted by the zagreb earthquake identifying probable natural disasters and advance preparation might enable enforcing such actions more efficiently and systematically reducing risks posed by the covid-19 virustch originated as a severe meteorologic event in the pacific ocean and made landfall in solomon islands vanuatu fiji and tonga

communities it first hit the solomon islands as a category 2 event and rapidly transitioned into a category 5 event by the time it reached vanuatu sustaining high winds of 200 kmh moving further southeast it traversed fiji and tonga as a category 4 tropical cycloneinitial assessments indicate that 59000 people were affected in solomon islands and 27 people are missing at sea to date in vanuatu the northern province sanma sustained severe damage where 90 of the population lost their homes and about 50 schools and 25 health centres were damaged initial aerial investigations conducted by the national disaster management office of vanuatu indicate that 159474 people have been affected with possible 3 deaths httpsndmogovvutropical-cyclone-harold the damage to houses evacuation centres gardens water systems health facilities and schools vary between 50 and 90 across seven different provinces httpsndmogovvutropical-cyclone-haroldcategory100-01-ndmo-situation-reports in fiji more than 1500 people have been moved to evacuation centres the coastal flooding early warning system recently installed under the coastal inundation forecasting demonstration project in fiji recorded storm surge heights between 65 m and 85 m during the passage of tch which suggests that damage to life and property might be higher than known at present damage in tonga is less documented but expected to be widespread with damage to homes water supply and food crops tch provides an example of how disaster response and recovery may impact covid-19 measures for example vanuatu has reduced in-country travel restrictions to facilitate humanitarian and relief operations however reduced capacity of communication services disruptions infrastructure lifelines and supply chains and limited resources are likely to compromise relief efforts and may increase societal vulnerability to covid-19 fortunately these islands have recorded a very low number of covid-19 confirmed cases to date and it is yet to be seen if tch has perturbed this trendanak krakatoa garnered much attention after its southwestern flank collapsed in an eruption in december 2018 and generated a tsunami that killed 437 and injured thousands along western java and southern sumatra ye et al 2020 the volcano started a new eruption cycle on 10 april 2020 concurrent with the covid-19 pandemic this has remained an active situation to date with constant alerts being disseminated to the public httpsmagmaesdmgoidv1vonapage1 with a volcano observatory notice for aviation vona alert level assigned as orange 34 volcano is exhibiting heightened unrest with increased likelihood of eruption with column height below 6000 m above sea level to our knowledge no damage has been reported from this latest eruption cycle a flank collapse analogous with the december 2018 is very unlikely as the volcano has greatly reduced in aerial extent as a result of that event however this highlights in general the high volcanic hazard throughout indonesia and the risk of volcanic activity to cause fatalities and population displacements that could impact on current covid-19 mitigation strategies indonesia is still in early stage of the pandemic with only 4839 confirmed cases and 459 deaths however the mortality rate of 95 is higher than global average of 64 on 14 april 2020on 12 and 13 april cold fronts crossed the southeast of the united states bringing widespread rainfall and embedded mesoscale convective systems mcss with associated strong winds and tornadoes the mcss within the larger weather system crossed several states but mississippi georgia and south carolina were the worst impacted the severe weather killed at least 30 people httpswwwnytimescom20200413ustornado-storm-southhtml across four states and destroyed many more peoples homesthe typical immediate emergency response during a tornado outbreak is centred around finding shelter and this is practised by the community in the central and southeast us which has been well drilled in this process through past experience of severe weather there is obvious potential for social distancing to be compromised where large tornado shelters are used but accurate weather forecasts allowed for planning so that individual families within shelters were instructed to stand apart concerns about managing disaster response during the covid-19 pandemic prompted the american meteorological society to draw up a list of guidelines for sheltering from tornadoes during the covid-19 pandemic httpswwwametsocorgindexcfmamsabout-amsams-statementsstatements-of-the-ams-in-forcetornado-sheltering-guidelines-during-the-covid-19-pandemic much of the advice is consistent with standard procedures for severe weather but additionally people should be sure ahead of time that specific tornado shelters are openthe us was in the midst of a steep rise in covid-19 cases and fatalities at the time of this tornado outbreak it is presently unclear whether this severe weather has compounded the effects of the covid-19 pandemic in the southeast usto qualitatively understand the effect of an external perturbation such as a natural hazard on the daily covid-19 infectee rate we created a simple epidemic model assuming that the cumulative growth of infectees over time follows a logistic differential function eq 1 for a holistic analysis this simple model is appropriate as the distribution of confirmed cumulative covid-19 cases in countries that have implemented strict counter measures eg china south korea and australia can be approximately explained by this model the exponential growth of covid-19 cases observed in other countries is an indication of early stage exposure to the disease and that patient distribution is not sustainable over a longer time horizon due to the finiteness of populations and counter measures taken by governments therefore the cumulative distribution of covid-19 cases can be expected to converge to a model similar to that described by some variation of eq 11documentclass12ptminimal

where n is the cumulative number of infectees at any given time t is time nmax is the expected maximum number of infectees and g is the fractional growth of cumulative infectees figure 4 compares data from china and the model based on eq 1 with g  03 nmax  83213 and a time horizon of 83 days where an approximate value for g is selected based on visual inspection of the fit between data and the model note that the first patient in china was potentially discovered on 10 december 2019 and data for the period from that day to 22 january 2020 start date given in the figure is not reliably recorded httpswwwwsjcomarticleshow-it-all-started-chinas-early-coronavirus-missteps-11583508932rather than analysing cumulative infectee numbers we focus on the effect on the flattened daily new infectee rate following an external perturbation eg a natural disaster as it is the behaviour of this curve that is being used to design covid-19 counter measures curve flattening shown in fig 4 bottom panel we make several assumptions to construct our simple modelsin the immediate aftermath of an extreme natural disaster it is reasonable to assume that measures taken to contain the spread of covid-19 collapse in the area directly affected by the event and the control over spreading rate is lost resulting a spike in infectees in this case we assume that the spreading rate increases to the background value that existed prior to imposing curve flattening measuresgovernments re-establish social-distancing measures fully over a finite time horizon pdays following the external perturbation which means that the flattened spreading rate that existed prior to the external perturbation will take effect beyond pdays in the interim period ie within pdays it is highly likely that governments will take partial measures that will reduce the spreading rate as was seen for the earthquake in croatia also compliance of citizens to these partial measures can be expected although it may depend on the severity of the event and the socio-political profiles of countries thus we model this effect by linearly reducing the spreading rate from the background value to the flattened value in the interim period we test several reasonable time horizons to understand their effect on the flattened daily new infectee rate curve depending on the nature of the external perturbation different scenarios may play out for instance in the event of a flood a population may get displaced and scattered from days to months sastry 2009 or it may be that populations get displaced but not scattered as in the case of an earthquake akbari et al 2004 asokan and vanitha 2017 these different scenarios will have an effect on the spreading rate describing the spreading rate quantitatively for different scenarios is not the focus of our modelling instead we model the general behaviour of the flattened curve in the event of an external perturbation subjected to above 1the covid-19 incubation time period the time between exposure to the virus and emergence of symptoms is five days consistent with the median incubation time published by who httpswwwwhointnews-roomq-a-detailq-a-coronaviruses this means that no new cases will be found within the first five days following an event this simplifies the ground truth somewhat as according to who incubation time range varies between one and fourteen daysin our models we set nmax  10000 a background spreading rate gb of 02 a flattened spreading rate gf of 01 and a time horizon of 150 days we test the perturbation to the flattened curve with pdays  1 7 14 21 and 28 daysfigure 5 shows the results of modelling the flattened daily new infectee rate after introducing a concurrent event with pdays  1 7 14 21 and 28 days for each pdays we tested two scenarios where we introduce external perturbations at 72 left panels and 112 days right panels from the start date of the flatten curve these two time points are located symmetrically on either side of the peak of the flattened curve day 92 and thus provide qualitative insights into demands on the health services depending on the event occurrence relative to the peakour results provide two main insights 1 a concurrent event occurring prior to reaching the peak of the flattened curve increases the new infectee rate more in the aftermath of a concurrent event than if it were to occur at a post-peak time this translates into increased demand on health services in the pre-peak period than in the post-peak period in some instances pre-peak concurrent events increase curve-flattened peak infection rates to levels approaching unmitigated peaks 2 the number of days a government takes to re-establish covid-19 spreading control measures pdays is a critical factor that determines the level of demand placed on health services that is the longer it takes for a government to re-establish control measures the higher the demand on the health services particularly in the pre-peak periodthese results based on our simple model emphasize two main policy recommendations that governments could consider first measures must be enforced as early as possible to flatten the daily new infectee rate curve to minimize risks of temporally-overlapping covid-19 infection rate increases with concurrent disasters this reduction of risk of a natural disaster occurring in the pre-peak period could reduce demand on health services second contingency plans must be devised with a focus on re-establishing covid-19 counter measures as fast as possible in the wake of an event this would involve identifying possible natural disasters their magnitude timing for example seasonal events and regional dependenciesfollowing our example more sophisticated models can be built to incorporate infectious disease dynamics in the wake of a concurrent event for example we have only considered the infected component in this instance whereas a standard epidemiological compartmental model will incorporate susceptible and recovered components in addition to the infected component kermack and mckendrick 1927 enabling the mapping of dynamic interactions between different population groups prediction capabilities can be further improved with even more complex models where the underlying assumption of a well-mixed population is relaxed and structured populations are used to reflect variable dynamics among different groups of population eg inaba and nishiura 2008 for real time applications however more work will be needed to reduce uncertainties in parameters that capture the spatiotemporal characteristics of spreading of a disease eg r0 ridenhour et al 2014in australia summer 201920 saw substantial natural hazards including major heatwaves that brought record high temperatures to populated areas including canberra and western sydney severe bushfires that swept through an unprecedented area of the continent boer et al 2020 and continuing drought that has devastated farming areas diminished water supplies and primed the australian forests for bushfire king et al 2020 australias black summer also saw millions of people experience very poor air quality for several days at a time as smoke from the fires blanketed sydney canberra and melbourne on several occasions the bushfires which resulted in 33 fatalities led to mass evacuations from vulnerable areas and people sheltering on crowded beaches in mallacoota victoria amongst other placesthe black summer came only months before the covid-19 pandemic began and as australia approaches winter the risks of severe weather related to heatwaves bushfires tropical cyclones and hailstorms is reduced while there are still natural hazard risks in australian winter notably related to floods and extratropical cyclones the overall rate of meteorological hazards is lower than in summer in that sense australia is fortunate to have not experienced major natural hazards coincident with the covid-9 pandemic and it is less likely to do so than northern hemisphere countries over the coming months note that there are non-natural hazards that could also occur during winter that could exacerbate the effects of covid-19 in australia such as seasonal fluin the us we have already highlighted the tornado outbreak of 12 and 13 april as occurring during the covid-19 pandemic the us experiences its seasonal peak in tornado probability in may so there are likely to be further severe storms around this time during boreal summer the us often experiences other natural hazards including heatwaves and hurricanes while these extremes both have devastating impacts their interaction with the ongoing covid-19 pandemic will likely differ heatwaves tend to exacerbate pre-existing health conditions this would place an additional burden on a healthcare system that may also be stretched due to covid-19 in contrast hurricanes tend to damage infrastructure and like tornadoes people evacuate and shelter often travelling interstate or sheltering with many other people in large buildings such a response to a hurricane in summer 2020 would not abide by social distancing protocols and could aid the spread of the virus alternate plans should be considered both heatwaves and hurricanes affect larger areas than tornadoes and have the potential to strain emergency response systems already managing the covid-19 pandemicsouth asian countries with some of the highest population densities httpsneoscigsfcnasagovviewphpdatasetidsedacpop are exposed to compound risks from covid-19 pandemic and extreme weather events such as severe floods as the region enters the wet season from may to october for instance 1110 people died and nearly 14 million were affected in the floods of june 2007 in bangladesh dewan 2015 in addition northern pakistan and india nepal and bhutan are located along the himalayan main frontal thrust capable of producing large mw  70 earthquakes lav et al 2005 the devastation caused by the 2015 mw 78 gorkha earthquake that occurred in nepal exemplifies the exposure of this region to extreme geologic hazards this particular event killed 8790 people injured 22304 and affected another 8 million people and damaged 755549 buildings gautam 2017 it is evident from these statistics that solitary extreme natural hazards in this region have the potential to affect large numbers of people and displace them in particular displacement in large numbers during severe natural events is mainly attributable to the poor quality of dwellings and infrastructure this in turn is detrimental to measures enforced to counter the spread of covid-19 foremost of which is social distancing in the event of natural hazards these measures are highly likely to disintegrate completely substantially increasing the risk of covid-19 infectionswhile we have qualitatively aggregated these hazards on an domestic scale the countries considered herein and many other countries with high natural disaster risk including japan the philippines iran turkey and many central america and pacific island nations have strong regional variations in hazard exposure and vulnerability that are superimposed on spatiotemporal variabilities in covid-19 risks it is well beyond the scope of this article to consider these regional variations however we provide one example from the us state of texas fig 6 currently texas has implemented two of four potential social distancing measures but has a climbing rate of covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths that are collectively increasing demand on resources fig 6 projected peaks in fatality rate and hospital demand overlap with the seasonal peak in tornado hazard long et al 2018 upper bounds 95 confidence on projected icu resource capacity currently approach icu bed availability if tornadoes increase icu demand by increasing critical care injuries associated with the tornado andor covid-19 infectees or reduce capacity by power outages and infrastructure damage then it is conceivable that resource limits could be approachedin 2020 it is estimated that 167 million people across 55 countries will require humanitarian assistance ocha 2019 with ongoing global economic uncertainty imf 2020 it is unclear what impact the covid-19 pandemic will have on humanitarian financing and resource mobilization in the event that a crisis exceeds the coping capacity of a host country a funding or resourcing gap resulting from covid-19 would severely impair the governments ability to deliver critical humanitarian aid and to scale-up response efforts to meet the needs of the affected populationfor many countries a hazard response beyond the coping capacity of the government will trigger a level 3 l3 inter-agency standing committee iasc humanitarian system-wide scale-up iasc 2018 involving one or more clusterssectors ie water sanitation and hygiene wash health protection logistics shelter to coordinate response efforts responding to a l3 multi-hazard situation during covid-19 will require additional resources and rely more heavily on integrated programming and inter-sectorial coordination incorporating competing priorities from different clusterssectorswhere countries have an existing humanitarian response plan hrp or contingency planning simulations have been carried out such as the 2019 bangladesh contingency plan for earthquake response in major urban centres hctt 2019 response plans will need to be revised to account for the increased risk of disease transmission and additional limitations and access considerations imposed by covid-19 during response and recovery operationswhere an iasc system-wide l3 emergency response is triggered such as a major earthquake on a similar scale to the 2015 gorkha earthquake global humanitarian response mechanisms may be limited in their ability to rapidly mobilize international surge capacity including humanitarian staff and volunteers and resources typically relied on for large-scale humanitarian response international military deployments may also be limited due to an increasing focus on domestic priorities as a result response efforts will likely need to become much more localized with a focus on improving remote coordination and support for local responders movement restrictions will make it increasingly difficult for remote and isolated populations to seek medical services and assistance ocha 2020 and specialized services such as psychosocial support will increasingly need to be delivered through remote systems as already observed during the recent croatia earthquake response ifrc 2020 multi-hazard risk profiles in these circumstances will need to include an array of often compounding vulnerabilities such as the risk to elderly populations and the elevated risk of sexual and gender-based violencelogistics supply chains have already been severely compromised by covid-19 with a disruption of critical supply chains due to border closures importexport restrictions and access restrictions ocha 2020 this will influence the way humanitarian programming can be implemented stimulation of local markets where they still exist through cash and voucher assistance cva programming improved engagement with the private sector and utilization of local industry and resources and will likely play an increasing role in strategies for recoverya multi-hazard situation in an already compounded and protracted or complex emergency is of particular concern these include densely populated camp-like situations with a high risk of natural hazard such as the bangladesh rohingya refugee response as of december 2019 some 810000 rohingya refugees live in 34 congested camps at high risk of flooding landslides and seasonal cyclones and are reliant on humanitarian aid to meet basic needs ocha 2019 the added complication of covid-19 containment measures into this already protracted crisis will put populations at significant risk of loss of life and will cause unprecedented complexity for humanitarian response efforts in the event of a natural hazard dense settlements with a high population density will need to carefully consider social and physical distancing measures in humanitarian programming this will limit the types of assistance emergency centres camps emergency shelter cash distributions rental assistance etc that can be delivered and the implementation modalities that can be used without increasing risk of transmission and thereby compromising efforts to contain covid-19it is essential that humanitarian response remains proportionate appropriate and relevant to the emergency while still being timely and effective sphere 2020 humanitarian response should avoid exposing populations to further harm and it is critical that preparedness plans pre-emptively assess and evaluate the compounding risks posed by covid-19 in multi-hazard situations a tiered resilience approach that concurrently integrates resilience indices visualization tools and modelling methods from multiple agencies organizations and researchers could assist in reconciling analytical complexity with stakeholder humanitarian organizations and beneficiaries needs and resources available for creating actionable recommendations to enhance resilience linkov et al 2018the compounding effect of seasonal natural hazards eg floods cyclones on the covid-19 pandemic is largely a foreseeable problem and plans developed ahead of time could prevent some of the worst potential impacts from occurring these plans can be based on modelling similar to that shown in this paper and we encourage emergency management agencies to consider use of these hybrid models to build response plans covid-19 epidemiological models may be highly sensitive to natural disasters and thus inclusion of seasonal and  or stochastic events might better enable worst-case scenarios to be considered this may be particularly important considering a the effect on infectee rate of the timing of a concurrent event relative to the peak of the infectee rate curve as demonstrated in this study fig 5 b the uncertainty in intensity and duration with which covid-19 counter measures must be implemented for them to be effectivewhere possible use of prediction models may help agencies ramp up emergency planning procedures days and weeks before meteorological extremes occur for example seasonal prediction allows advance planning for the possibility of specific weather extremes and this should be undertaken to prevent some of the worst impacts of such events there is already an indication that the 2020 atlantic hurricane season will be unusually active eg httpsengrsourcecolostateeducsu-researchers-predicting-active-2020-atlantic-hurricane-season so planning for major land-falling hurricanes in the us over heavily populated cities during the covid-19 pandemic could be beneficial in particular developing alternate response plans and communicating these well in advance should prepare people for the most suitable actions to take that keep them safe from the hazard while also adhering to social distancing could help in preventing a major disaster even on the timescale of numerical weather prediction the response to the 1213 april tornado outbreak demonstrates that several days may be enough to prepare for well-forecast small-scale extreme weather eventsit is likely that hazard mitigation measures for worst-case scenarios of expected natural disasters seasonal or stochastic are already in place for many countries and regions eg hurricanes in the us floods in bangladesh earthquakes in nepal however these plans do not account for the existing covid-19 crisis that requires social-distancing as the primary counter measure thus incorporating effects of natural hazards in epidemiological models can guide modifications required in existing natural hazard mitigation plans the compound risks associated with stochastic natural disasters eg earthquake volcanic eruptions can potentially be mitigated by modifying existing hazard mitigation plans specific suggestions include establishing strategies for decongestion of densely populated spontaneous camps and settlements introducing clear physical distancing protocols for distribution of essential assistance increasing space allocations for vulnerable populations in shelters to reduce the risk of covid-19 transmission and the use of more emergency shelter locations with fewer people so that some semblance of social distancing may be achieved even in the aftermath of a hurricane or earthquake large-scale availability of personal protective equipment ppe to emergency responders would also help prevent the spread of infectiongiven the disproportionate impacts of many prior pandemic and natural hazards on the developing world plans to equip developing countries and ngos in preparing for and responding to natural hazards during the covid-19 pandemic would help limit the impacts of such disastersas our simple epidemiology models show spikes in daily new infectee rates are a likely scenario in the wake of a natural disaster the magnitude and duration of these spikes could in principle be controlled by policy decisions described above thus disaster planning strategies and resourcing such as the introduction of remote coordination platforms the localisation of response efforts and resources availability of evacuation centres with capacity for social distancing potential mobility of humanitarian actors volunteers and medical staff that could respond to natural disasters in covid-affected regions and the availability of personal protective equipment and medical equipment eg respirators must be designed in combination with above ii countering challenging conditions associated with natural hazards limited road access lack of communication etc must be considered in upholding covid-19 social-distancing measureswe offer these recommendations in the hope that they may be used to prevent some of the worst-impact scenarios of coincident natural hazard occurrences with the ongoing covid-19 outbreak these recommendations support the independently-derived strategic disaster risk reduction recommendations proposed by djalante et al 2020 i strengthen knowledge and science provision in understanding disaster and health-related emergency risks ii mobilize existing disaster risk governance structure to manage disaster risk and potential health-emergencies iii utilize existing disaster coordination mechanisms at regional level to inform epidemic response iv understand covid-19 economic implications and resilience v prepare inclusive early recovery plans and vi strengthen community-level preparedness and response urgent sharing of scientific information models methods particularly with developing countries is important because many of these countries may lack capacity to generate knowledge rapidly to improve resilience against foreseeable compound risksour recommendations are framed around the ideas of building resilience to natural hazard risks such that their impacts are reduced in the era of covid-19 we note that the concept of increasing resilience to mitigate impacts of extreme events is not novel bostik et al 2018 linkov et al 2018 however we hope that our suggested actions will build on those provided previously and will be used to reduce risks from natural hazards during the covid-19 outbreak our use of plausible scenarios could stimulate production of resilience analyses that incorporate uncertainty and complex dynamics of physical and humansocial factors across multiple spatial and temporal scales eg bostik et al 2018in todays scenario the human race is panicked due to an alarming situation of the recent pandemic of covid-19 covid-19 is also depicted as 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov or the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the initial epicentre of the present pandemic was wuhan the capital of hubei province china in december 2019 3 but now worldwide humanity is affected by 2019-ncov due to lack of possible cure of this novel virus the initial transmission mode of this newly discovered 2019-ncov was considered to be cough or sneeze the world health organization who announced that this virus can enter into the body when a person comes in contact with droplets produced through cough sneezing or when the person touches some infected any physical area then touches their eyes mouth or nose 1 but recently who published that this covid-19 virus is airborne and can spread through breathing or even just talking 7 the initial symptoms of covid-19 virus infection were found to be cough sore throat fatigue which could lead to fever diarrhea and malaise among others further due to human-to-human transmission the exponential increment in the number of infectious cases was observed 1 3 27according to who till 14042020 from china to the rest of the world in 206 countries areas or territories around 1844863 cases of coronavirus infections and 117021 deaths have been reported 6 in indian scenario the observed trends of virus transmission till 24032020 expected the local or initial stage of covid-19 epidemic most of the cases were found to be migrants overseas visitors and some others who were in contact with these infected persons to tackle this initial transmission the countrywide lockdown was called by the indian government the situation seemed to be under control due to lockdown till 24032020 since the total number of confirmed and death cases found to be 511 and 10 respectively as presented in table 1 but now till 14042020 india has reported 11488 cases and further trends are discussed in table 1 8 11 the frightening trends were reported from 04042020 when the number of confirmed cases increased drastically and shoot up to 2650 from 909 as reported on 28032020 and presented in table 1 the sudden horrifying increment in cases was occurred due to the religious gathering in new delhi and its spread throughout the country which lead to human-to-human transmission of covid-19 in india initially most of the people who came in contact with such infected persons were unaware of the virus symptoms in their bodies the prime cause of the virus spread was supposed to be fear and the non-expressive way of infected persons about their health to the health workersauthorities for initial screening although preventive measures such as social distancing quarantine and isolation methods were taken worldwide these preventive measures were proved effective when the appropriate pharmacological techniques and experiments did not cure so much 1 27there is a large part of the worlds population which could require more care and timely medical assistance for their livelihood and this age group of elderly people with age 50 years and greater could have more chances of infection due to covid-19 and became the major part of total death cases of worldwide infected cases 13 25 in india till 14042020 the total death cases increased to 392 in which most of the death cases pointed to specific age-group of elderly people 8 according to census-2011 1592 of the total population belongs to the age group of 50 years and greater and the effect of the present covid-19 outbreak needs to be studied concerning this age group 4 17 the work in this paper presents the forecast of the total infection cases and possible death cases in this age group of elderly people in india several dynamic models were applied concerning the population of india to predict the number of infected elderly people and death cases of elderly people in the coming 21 days up to 05052020 further the investigation was also deeply studied for some of the statesregions of indiathe real-time updated data of the cumulative number of cases of confirmed death and cured in india and rest of the world was taken from covid-19 tracker india 8 dong et al 11 and ritchie 22 the database source recorded the daily update of the regionstateut based number of confirmedreported death and cured cases up to 14042020 the cumulative projections could be considered for estimating the predictions for the next 21 days since the database might contain some irregularities and some reporting delayswang et al 26 analyzed the outbreak of the canada 2009 h1n1 outbreak gta 2003 sars outbreak singapore 2005 dengue outbreak and the taiwan 2003 sars outbreak using a constrained richards model pell et al 20 implemented a generalized richards model to forecast the impact of epidemics such as ebola 2015 on the human population and predicted the final epidemic size chowell et al 5 analyzed the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in singapore plague in madagascar and also ebola in the democratic republic of congo drc pan et al 19 analyzed the time duration of lung changes on chest ct during recovery from covid-19 epidemic diao et al 10 suggested that the cure rate could be used to analyze the treatment effectiveness in various medical techniques and could be significant for epidemic decision-making perc et al 21 used the mathematical model to analyze the behavior of covid-19 over various countries worldwide and also estimated the growth rate of covid-19 for 21 days for different countries such as the usa slovenia iran and germany singh et al 23 analyzed the impact of social distancing on the transmission of covid-19 and predicted the duration of the lockdown period for india based on available data till 25032020 but after 25032020 there was a dramatic increase in infectious covid-19 cases due to a religious gathering and transmission trends were terribly changed in the present work the autoregressive mathematical model was used to forecast the impact of covid-19 for the next 21 days till 05052020 in india and also the impact of the current outbreak on the most sensitive age group of 50 and greater in india further the investigation was also performed for some of the statesregions of

in this section the global and indian trends for infectious death and recovered cases are presented in figs 1 and 2 respectivelyin this section the impact of the covid-19 outbreak was considered over the population of india to consider the impact over the population of india the population considerations were done according to census-2011 4 and the projected population for 2019 24 according to the census-2011 the total population of india was 1210854977 which was projected to be 1353890423 in 2019 as per available resources the projected impact over the population according to census-2011 and projected 2019 is presented in figs 3 and 4the horrifying trends of the covid-19 pandemic predicted more than 115000 deaths in just 101 days in the worldwide scenario the worldwide actual and predicted number of infected and death cases till 14042020 and for the coming 21 days till 05052020 are presented in fig 1 it was observed from the results that if the outbreak of this infectious virus could not be controlled timely then the estimated 3500000 of infected cases would be found around the globe as presented in fig 1a and the graph of the death cases would also rise to the peak and the approximate number of deaths become 250000 as presented in fig 1bindia is the second-ranked country in terms of population and also not much affected by covid-19 outbreak yet with the decision of early lockdown this outbreak was supposed to be controlled but it could become mandatory to estimate the transmission of this dangerous virus in coming days thus the statistical predictions for india are presented in fig 2 and it was predicted for next 21 days till 05052020 that more than 35000 persons would be affected with this deadly virus in pre-implemented controlled conditions such as lockdown social distancing etc throughout the whole country as presented in fig 2a it was also observed from fig 2b that the death cases would also be raised to more than 1400 in the coming 21 days the human immunity plays a vital role in fighting covid-19 infection and in the light this fact till now around 1000 infected persons were recovered and this number will become more than 7000 in the coming 21 days as presented in fig 2cthe present pandemic outbreak could affect the large portion of the population of india and this impact is presented in figs 3 and 4 since the last census was done in 2011 and actual data was available regarding population then it was observed from fig 3a that 0003130 of the population could be infected by covid-19 virus and 0000116 portion of the population could be dead in next 21 days prediction as presented in fig 3b a similar prediction could be done over the increased and projected population of 2019 in india and observations from fig 4a b could be depicted that population percentage of 0002789 could become infectious and death cases could become 0000104 of the projected population-2019 respectively the recovery rate seemed to be much less than the infection rate but curedrecovered cases could become the important factor to lower down the horrifying fear of outbreak and 0000535 and 0000478 of the total population of india as per census-2011 and projected 2019 could be recovered from this deadly virus infection till 05052020 as presented in figs 3 and 4 respectivelythe nation wise covid-19 virus impact was considered in case i but it could be important to study the virus transmission through stateregion wise scenario this section presented the trends and prediction of virus impact over various states and regions of the republic of india the comparison of stateregion wise impact according to census-2011 and projected-2019 population is presented in fig 5 further the stateregion wise projected infectious death and cured cases are presented in fig 6it was observed from the results presented in figs 5 and 6 that impact of the current virus outbreak could be crucial and the predicted high-risk stateregions could be delhi maharashtra tamilnadu kerala gujrat rajasthan telangana andhra pradesh madhya pradesh goa and punjab the prediction peaks for infection cases for the next 21 days for both census-2011 and projected-2019 population were very high in the highlighted states as presented in fig 5 the most infectious statesregions such as maharashtra infectious cases  2650 delhi infectious cases  1550 tamilnadu approximately 1200 infectious cases etc had put the population at high risk in some regions the rate of virus infection became double or more in a few days such as punjab it was also observed from fig 6 that the predictions for death cases could also be high in the coming 21 days the major portion of the stateregion could be infectious in the next 21 days if the virus outbreak continues as per its current transmission rate the precautionary measures need to be imposed in the high infected areas and spreading hotspot areas should also be identified in all statesregions as soon as possible the stateregion wise projected trends for infection cases in the next 21 days from data recorded date 14042020 are presented in fig 6the analysis in case i and case ii presented the population-wise impact of present outbreak india and various statesregions in india but the impact of the current pandemic and its transmission should also be considered age-wise and it was predicted that the elderly group of the population could be at high risk the death rate trends and prediction as per the indian scenario are presented in fig 7since the elderly age group could be at a very high risk of infection due to covid-19 and then it could become mandatory to discuss the total high-risk population of india as per publication by the ministry of statistics and programme implementation of india regarding elderly in india 12 86 population 104133528 people belonged to elderly people were present in census-2011 and this was projected to be around 10 135389042 people in the projected population of 2019 2 the large portion of the population could be more prone to covid-19 virus infection and death the state-wise  of the elderly population and the predicted high-risk population are presented in table 2 if the contribution of this age group in economic section of the country is considered then it was found that 416 of this age-group people are responsible for strengthening the economic ground of india and as per census-2011 the total population became 503715670 persons which is at high risk in current pandemic if the same economic percentage could be applied to the projected population of india in 2019 then the population number could be increased to 563218416 persons if the social distancing and lockdown could not be followed then this population portion could be at very high risk as per published icmr study that the r0 value for the current coronavirus infection was considered to be 25 and if the social exposure reduced by 75 then one sick person can only infect 25 persons in 1 month 14 but in case the social distancing and proper lockdown conditions are not properly followed by the citizens of india then the scenario will be different and terriblethe present study will be in favor of proper lockdown for the next 21 days and further extension if needed and also the strict norms of social distancing should be followed in the presence of limited resources proper health care of high-risk age-group should be taken to stop the spread of covid-19 and also to control the causality to high-risk age groupthe frightening effects of the current outbreak of covid-19 can be observed all over the globe and several medicalsocial efforts are in progress to stopcontrol the transmission of the 2019-ncov virus it was necessary to study the impact of current pandemic over the different age-group population in various countries with satisfactory or limited health resources since the virus outbreak affected almost all countries in the world irrespective of development in the medical sector the work in the present study analyzed the trends of noble coronavirus outbreak globally and also deep analysis was performed over the population of the republic of india the analysis and predictions were performed for the next 21 days till 05052020 and observed that the number of infectious and death cases could rise to the maximum number in the coming 21 days the study also identified various high-risk indian statesregions which could become spreading hotspots in the country further the impact of the outbreak was considered age-wise and it was found that the large percentage of the population belong to the age group of elderly people with age 50 years and greater could be at a very high fatality risk and virus infection the proper care must be taken and all necessary medical facilities should be provided to this age-group of elderly people so that the social distancing could be sacrificedthe government of the republic of india had already taken very bold steps to control virus transmission such as a countrywide lockdown the study is in favor of extending lockdown up to the next 21 days or more if needed to slow down the virus spread throughout the country and the norms of social distancing should be strictly implemented to avoid any region or person becoming super spreader and to stop community transmission random and mass testing will be proved effective to control or locate virus transmission further larger areas should be divided into smaller zones and colony-wise and the mass level initial screening should be performed zones to identify the patients with initial symptoms after the end of lockdown when the normal routine would be resumed still then the proper sanitization and centralized initial screening mechanism with high-quality equipments should be implemented throughout the country to track the infected patients at various gathering areas such as restaurantshotels grocery stores interstate transfer terminals railway stations toll checkpoints airports border entryexit terminals educational sectors industries sectors etcevery continent is affected by the covid-19 pandemic as of 27 april 2020 global confirmed cases of covid-19 stood at 2 858 635 and 196 295 deaths across 213 countries in the world10 in africa the confirmed cases of covid-19 were 20 316 and 839 deaths10 while scientists search for a vaccine cure for the covid-19 infections non-pharmaceutical interventions can be appliedsocial distancing regular handwashing limiting unnecessary movement and social gatherings or events are crucial for the management of covid-1911 evidence from fighting previous epidemics has proved that social distancing is effective in reducing person-to-person transmission thereby decreasing morbidity and mortality12-14from a public health perspective the upward trajectory of covid-19 in african countries with weaker health systems is worrying although in principle many african countries have expressed their readiness to manage covid-19 which is commendable however practical and proactive measures regarding the availability of the rapid testing equipment masks and protective wear for health workers is desirable furthermore the respective countries health departments need to recruit more health workers to treat and manage patients in hospitalshealth is very critical to the prosperity of any society the absence of health affects the overall well-being of an individual and limit movements in the work place poor health slows down individual performance levels firm or organization productivity and ultimately income this is what covid-19 has caused and is causing this disease has locked down economies and created wide-ranging socio-economic disruptions in different countries across the world for instance banks have lowered their repayment rates on housing loans and there is temporary cancellation of value-added tax vat receipts associated with small businesses and company taxies amongst other protecting and saving the economy measures the unavoidable impact of all these measures is that government revenues have dwindled artisans and petty traders have been left without recourse whilst some small-scale businesses and even some big ones have collapsed especially where there is total lockdown schools are closed resulting in months of lost education the impact is felt across all sectors as the most effective mitigating strategies according to experts and who still remain hand washing social distancing and lockdowns10from a public health perspective health epidemics of the middle east respiratory syndrome mers outbreak in the asian nation of south korea the ebola virus in west africa and the current novel covid-19 have international health impacts and drastic socioeconomic disequilibrium of life in the society1516 the unfolding of the corona virus has aggravated an international shortage of medical equipment like medical masks ventilators and other personal protection equipment ppes businesses are now trying to be innovative and meet these gaps in supply and demand whilst respecting the regulations put in placeapart from the morbidity and mortality rates of covid-19 the huge consequence of impaired productivity because of individual sickness their social unit or their community are glaring17 impacts could involve psychological academic or skills losses on individual households the high death rate witnessed in west africa during the ebola viral haemorrhagic fever outbreak triggered various impacts such impacts included dilated socio-economic impacts declined growth rates wage lost because of peoples inability to work or their contagion concerns exaggerated economic condition and food insecurity loss of education and lost jobs18 a similar trend is emerging with covid-19 the global infection rate is high and increasing exponentially and only the early preventative measures imposed by governments on populations could possibly slow down the death rates however some of the preventative measures directly or indirectly affect the economy negativelygiven the already weak economy of some countries and the resultant draw back risks precipitated by the covid-19 pandemic the near-term challenges would warrant reinforcing some policy actions to contain the untold challenges of covid-19 there is a need to strengthen health care systems boost investor confidence and demand and limit adverse economic effects there is need for multilateral policy dialogue to curtail and foster agreements on acceptable containment policy measures are needed to cushion the economic impact of the coronavirus regarding inflation of essential commodities and servicesas countries grapple with mitigation and containment the socio-economic impact is affecting the containment measures which when relaxed may have dire health consequences this has called for a delicate balance between health and economic considerations there are no easy choices each country will have to carefully navigate this dilemma within its context but based on what the prevailing figures and available scientific evidence from experts revealsbroadly however governments need two policy instruments to deal with the pandemic a mitigating policy and a post covid-19 recovery and rejuvenation policy the mitigation policy will be a health policy-a proactive health policy framework and management approach this will involve containment measures protection of health providers provision of personal protection equipment ppes and incentives testing centres and kits isolation centres with relevant facilities etcetera in addition to aggressive education and health literacyhealth education and literacy is important to mitigate the impact of covid-19 on crises-affected populations some countries may have to create massive information and surveillance people would need to provide a transparent image of travel history health records movement and different relevant data so as to assist identification of potential infected persons therefore governments and agencies can implement evidence-based approaches recommended by the world health organisation who for combating covid-19 hand washing hygiene could be an extremely effective public health intervention amidst other preventative measures such as regular use of facial masks safe coughing and social distancing19the post covid-19 recovery and rejuvenation policy or economic policy should include palliatives to encourage citizens to endure lockdowns and observe social distancing to cushion adverse effects of the coronavirus on vulnerable social teams short-time operating schemes could be implemented to boost the pliability of operating hours such schemes would protect jobs and pay but they may not be pliable enough to defend temporary or migrant staff from lay-offs20governments can adapt several economic palliative measures to mitigate the impact of covid-19 on households these could include providing money transfers or state insurance especially for staff placed on unpaid leave and guarantees for lower medical costs for all additionally governments can reduce policy interest rates and possibly provide economic stimulus packages to boost business confidence such measures would assist with the recovery of demand once the spread of the virus eases and travel restrictions are lifted however such measures could be less effective in coping with the immediate supply-side disruptions that result from imposed shutdowns and travel restrictionsugm conceived and wrote the first draftdtg read and edited the manuscript and is responsible and accountable of the studyall authors contributed to the writing of the manuscript read and approved the final version of the manuscriptthe outbreak of covid19 which was initially conceived as a chinesecentric shock has now been understood to be a global crisis with the number of cases increasing rapidly the world health organization who on march 12 declared covid19 as a global pandemic the unprecedented outbreak of the virus has brought considerable human sufferings to every sphere of human lives in addition to the public health emergency the crisis has unpredictably hit the world economy the operations of the world economy have substantially come to a halt the economically challenging measures adopted across the countries such as bans on traveling imposing restrictions on labor mobility shutting down manufacturing companies and sharp cutbacks in service sector activities to contain the disease have produced enormous adverse effects on the economy however an accurate empirical assessment about the size and persistence of the pandemic and its likely impact on the world economy is yet unknowable the earlier pandemics sars avian flu mers had affected particularly those countries that were economically less dominant moreover the magnitude of the previous pandemics was much smaller than covid19 the effect of this virus is however economically different the number of infections is frequently changing on an hourly basis the top most affected economies out of the outbreak are united states italy china spain france united kingdom and germany these economies accidentally happen to be the worlds largest economies as well g7 economies have witnessed exponential growth in the number of confirmed cases these economies account 60 of the worlds demand and supply 65 of the worlds manufacturing and around 40 of manufacturing exports baldwin  di mauro 2020 therefore there is a saying going around that while these large economies sneeze the rest of the world will get the cold unctad projects that the slowdown in the world economy as a result of the outbreak of covid19 will cost around 1 trillion dollars according to the united nations the sudden decline in oil prices has been the major contributing factor to the global economic slowdown figure 1 highlights the loss in gdp growth worldwidealthough the pandemic is likely to affect the advanced economies most emerging economies like india cannot stand unaffected governments in many countries have expressed their concern and imposed lockdown to mitigate the rapid spread since india has imposed 21day lockdown nationwide with anticipation of extending it later the economic activities in the country have reached to a near halt by suspending the production process the states are incurring huge economic cost gollier and gossner 2020 the current situation of covid19 clubbed with plummeting economic growth has pushed the developing countries like india into a volatile market condition among all south asian countries india has recorded the maximum number of active coronavirus cases as of april 13 there has been total 9241 number of covid19 cases in india with 331 deaths figure 2 explains the total number of confirmed cases in india before the outbreak of covid19 indian economy had already been experiencing economic slowdown over the past few quarters the economy was already reeling under rising unemployment low consumption and weakening industrial output and prices precovid19 the economy was witnessing sluggish economic growth compounding the existing problems of rural distress malnutrition and widespread inequalityfurthermore indias vast informal sector is particularly vulnerable in 20172018 out of nations 465 million workers around 91 422 million workers were associated with the informal sector these economic constraints along with the current supply side shock have put the economy on an adverse situation it will be challenging to predict the scale and speed of the effect of covid19 on any economies however there is no doubt that the impact will be much pronounced than the demonetization in 2016 and 2017 gst rollout it appears to be apparent now that these two events that caused shocks to the economy and yet not recovered fully there is another shock ahead for the economy to face the similarity with the 2016s demonetization and 2017s gst does not end at their economic impact the indian economy was going through 6year low growth rate at 47 in the third quarter of the current fiscal year in the events of declining domestic investment and mean consumption rate several monetary and fiscal policy measures were taken to recover the growth rate at the end of the last quarter rbi in its biannual monetary policy report has emphasized that the outbreak of covid19 pandemic has drastically altered the outlook of the indian economy and it has been the high time for the policymakers to formulate some monetary and fiscal measures to curb the economic slowdown in india1 as the situation has not turned normal and the number of cases is increasing worldwide as well as at national level it has been anticipated that the occurrence of the virus will further deteriorate the recovery process in the near to medium term the outbreak has put a new set of challenges before the country by spreading its dangerous effect on both demand and supply sidefrom a public health perspective the ability to contain the outbreak in india will primarily depend upon the strength of the public health system in india as the number of confirmed cases in india is on the rise the capacity of the public health system in combating the pandemic is being questioned by the experts indias expenditure on health as a percentage of gdp is lower than the poorest countries in the world according to the national health profile in 2019 india spends only 128 of its gdp as public health expenditure2 world health organization ranks india 145 among 195 countries in terms of health care access and quality india ranks much below than china 48 sri lanka 71 bangladesh 133 and bhutan 134 in south asia the human resources and physical infrastructures of the public health system in india stand at an inferior stage while the private health care system is flourishing in india more than 65 population does not have health insurance putting massive pressure on the public hospitals in order to ensure the public health first the government of india on march 24 had announced 21 days effective nationwide lockdown the main objective of the lockdown was to maintain social distancing and suspend all forms of travel so that it can prevent the spread of infection from the infected at the community level india has very less number of hospitals and testing centers in india there is only one hospital per 47000 population states like himachal pradesh and arunachal pradesh have 12 and 16 hospitals respectively for per lakh population maharashtra which has witnessed the maximum number of coronavirus cases in india has only one hospital for every 16 lakh population statistics also reveal that on average there is only one doctor for 10700 people in india given this poor medical condition in india a genuine question arises how well prepared is indias public health system to deal with this crisis3 while testing needs to be an essential part to fight the crisis and contain the spread india does not have enough kits to test most of its population for the new coronavirus as of april 9 india has conducted a total of 144920 tests recording lowest test rates per capita in the world some states in india have reported no tests so far4
given the background this article attempts to answer a very crucial question that what is the economic effect of covid19 on the indian economy in general and its impact on different sectors in particular however before we discuss the economic repercussion of the pandemic we first and foremost consider this outbreak as a human tragedy there are no parameters that can account the human sufferings which the pandemic has brought as the outbreak of covid19 is spreading like wildfire some of the current economic explanations may stand redundant as the crisis evolves this article potentially reflects our perspective of covid19 on the indian economy as of april 13 through this article we address the following three aspects of covid19 pandemic in the context of the indian economy first we examine the effect of covid19 on different sectors of the economy such as the agricultural sector manufacturing sector and the service sector second we will highlight how the bilateral trade relation between india and china has been affected due to the outbreak third we present the impact of 21day nationwide lockdown on social consumption in india finally we conclude the article by highlighting the growth projections about india and recommending some policy implicationsboone 2020 identifies three relevant channels through which the pandemic can affect economic activities across the countries our study will be based on these three crucial channels
supply channel the first important channel is the supply channel with the disruptions in the production unit closures of factories irrespective of sizes cutbacks in the service sector especially the financial sector can result in a significant disruption in the global supply chain
demand channel as a consequence of the outbreak there will be a fall in demand in the travel and tourism sector the decline in the education services decline in trade contraction in demand for entertainment and leisure services
confidence channel the third crucial channel is the confidence channel amidst the global uncertainty there is a fall in the confidence pattern of consumers as there is less consumption of goods and services to contain the spread several containment measures have been adopted by several countries which are likely to affect the consumer and financial market confidence spillover effects are being transmitted through finance and confidence channel to financial markets
the pandemic has disrupted the agriculture activities and supply chains the monetary loss occurred to the agricultural sector in india amidst the outbreak of covid19 has been tremendous the nationwide lockdown has put the future prospectus of the agriculture sector at stake amidst the uncertainty the sector has been encountering several challenges as the labor mobility and movements of goods have been affected nonavailability of migrant labors is causing problems in harvesting activities the north and west region encountered significant problems as wheat and pulses are not being harvested on time there have been disruptions occurred in supply chains also because of the 21day lockdown in the country and subsequent bans on transportations and other activities it is being predicted that the sector is likely to get a double hit due to the recent uneven monsoon and economic contagion that the sector is facing as ravi harvest season is approaching farmers across the states are worried about their crops lying unharvested in the field the cultivation of wheat pulses and mustard has already witnessed a decline in its productions owing to untimely and heavy rainfall with the cases farmers and agricultural laborer are fleeing to their homes in the wake of this coronavirus lockdown farmers income is going to be affected severely following are the points through which we will highlight the negative effect of covid19 on indian agricultural sector first the supply chain of agricultural products will be heavily affected due to the coronavirus lockdown in india the 21day lockdown nationwide has created hindrance in the interstate movements of trucks carrying the essential agricultural commodities owners of warehouse and cold storage have complained over the lack of available labor supply in the agricultural sector second the outbreak can also affect agriculture and allied activities through its effect on the poultry sector the fastest growing sector in the indian agriculture ecosystem apparently india ranks third in terms of egg production and fifth in terms of the producers of broilers however due to the misinformation spread on social media and linking meat consumption to the coronavirus disease the sector is facing huge losses on a daily basis there has been a sudden fall in demand for poultry products and farmers are facing lower prices for their poultry products third as the restaurants and hotels are shut down the demand for agricultural products are plummeting in india as a result there has been a fall in the prices of farm products by 1520 in the time of this uncertainty in exports5
the pandemic has hit the manufacturing sectors across the globe in different ways since the outbreak initially emerged in the manufacturing heartland of the world east asia it is likely to disrupt the global supply chain in the industrial giants with the further spread of the virus the manufacturing sector across the world will experience a similar hit the supply chain contagion will create a direct supply shock to the manufacturing sectors in the less affected nations the less affected nations would find it harder to import the raw and possessed materials from the hardhit economies as a result of the pandemic subsequently there will be a demand disruption in both less affected and hardhit economies owing to the macroeconomic drops in aggregate consumption demand baldwin  di mauro 2020the indian economy was already struggling hard to recover from the economic slowdown prior to the outbreak however the continuing outbreak of covid19 in india has made the possibility of revival difficult as several sectors in the economy are witnessing an adverse effect of covid19 even the finance minister has assured that the government will take some stringent measures to help the manufacturing industries mainly the msmes to reduce the effect of covid19 on the sector on the manufacturing front the impact of the coronavirus will depend upon to the extent the sector is connected to china the pharmaceuticals and automobile industries are already facing the effect as the pharmaceutical industry is strongly linked to china the supply chain of raw materials of drugs has been affected immensely though india is considered to be the top exporters of drugs in the world it depends heavily on the import of bulk drugs in the financial year 20182019 india had imported around 24900 crores of bulk drugs and the import constitutes approximately 40 of the domestic consumption6 indias dependence on china for the import of many critical antibiotics and antipyretics accounts close to 100 the largest production unit of pharmaceutical in himachal pradesh is undergoing the lockdown incurring huge manufacturing loss in india on the other hand with the disruptions in the supply chain the automobile industry in india has also seen a severe impact the coronavirus outbreak not only has affected the automobile industry but also hit the automotive components and forging industries china accounts for 27 of exports of auto components in india and considers to be the leading supplier in india as the manufacturing industries in china were shut down in the wake of the coronavirus crisis many indian automobile companies have suffered the losses several automobiles companies including mahindra and mahindra mm tata motors and mg motors in india have announced that they are facings constraints in the supply of auto components from the virushit china7
as far as the chemical industries are considered the local dyestuff companies in india relies on china and imports several raw materials such as chemicals and intermediates from china due to the ongoing crisis the delayed shipments and the rising prices of raw materials are affecting the dyes and dyestuff industry particularly in gujarat the production of these items has been impacted by 20 due to the disruptions caused in the supply of inputs from china the spread of covid19 can also affect the electronic industries located in india china being the largest supplier of both final and raw material of electronic products the electronics industry in india fears supply disruptionseconomists are often criticized for producing bad records in predictions acknowledging the fact beck 2020 has recommended several ideas to interpret the effect of covid19 on the financial markets to him the effect of the coronavirus on financial markets will depend upon three significant conditions first to what extent the virus will further spread and its effect on economic activities worldwide second the effective implementations of fiscal and monetary policy to the crisis third the centrals banks and regulators reactions to the possible bank fragility applying these three conditions we examine the impact of covid19 on the indian financial system the effect of the coronavirus and the lockdown it triggered is visible on the financial markets in india the banking sector in india was already going through a crucial time even before the emergence of the crisis the collapse of yes bank created some hue and cry in the banking sector amidst the anomalies in the economic activities and deteriorations in the quality of the assets the rating agency moody has revised the prospectus of the indian banking system to negative from stable8 the outbreak of the virus will affect the profitability of banks adversely as there has been an increase in loanloss provisions and a decline in revenues the deterioration in the assets quality across micro small and medium enterprises msmes corporate and retail segments will induce a huge pressure on banks capitalization capital infusions to the public sector banks psbs as done by the governments over the past few years can mitigate the pressures on bank capitalization given the current situation where the private sector banks are facing default the growing risk aversion faced by the old private sector banks will put funding and liquidity pressures on small private sector banks the outbreak has also hit investor confidence in the financial market investor sentiment has been so low that despite relatively lower cases reported in india the indian stock market has fared worst among global peers indian stock market has lost 26 in dollar terms between february 1 and april 9 compared with a decline of 20 and 14 in european and united states markets9
in this strongly connected world the effect of covid19 on international trade is inevitable the outbreak of covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted the bilateral trade relation between india and china china has been the major importers of indian products that include jewelry seafood and pharmaceuticals as far as the total exports of diamond and pharmaceuticals are considered india exports 36 of diamond and 34 of pharmaceuticals to china as the outbreak has primarily disrupted the manufacturing activities in china and other parts of the world united states and europe it is hitting the indian exports significantly due to the restrictions imposed on exports to china it is expected that there could be a fall in the price of petrochemical products in india reports released by chinese official reveal that between january and late february trade between both the countries fell by 124 year on year when the outbreak was spreading in china it had affected the exports and imports in both countries chinas exports to india stood at 671 billion yuan dropped by 126 on year on year basis whereas the imports from india was declined by 116 to 18 billion yuan10 according to unctad estimates the loss occurs to indias trade as a result of covid19 pandemic would stand around us348 million india is among those 15 countries that have been affected severely as the outbreak disrupted manufacturing industries in china and destroyed world trade in case of india the effect of covid19 on trade is estimated to be worst for the chemical sectors with a loss of 129 million dollars whereas the damage has been estimated to be 64 million dollars for textiles and apparel apart from this several other trading companies such as automotive electrical machinery leather products wood and furniture products are likely to be affected by this coronavirus crisis the pandemic is also expected to have affected the domestic fisheries sector as the sector has incurred huge losses with its fall in exports to china the bilateral trade between india and china is also tied by the agricultural products as the agricultural products have been witnessing a negative trend in india it is also hitting the agricultural markets across indopacific region including chinathe main objective of the initial announcement of 21day lockdown followed by its further extension till may 3 has been to ensure social distancing social distancing interventions can be effective against fighting the pandemic but are potentially detrimental to the economy koren  pet 2020 business and corporate companies that depend heavily on the face to face communications or close physical proximity while producing a product or service are particularly vulnerable the idea of social distancing has been proven effective to contain the rapid spread of the epidemics hatchett mecher  lipsitch 2007 markel et al 2007 wildersmith  freedman 2020 many countries across the world have implemented the practice of social distancing by closing down schools prohibiting large community gatherings restricting nonessential stores and transportation in an effort to contain the spread anderson heesterbeek klinkenberg  hollingsworth 2020 thompson serkez  kelley 2020 in this regard questions arise that what are the economic effects of such social distancing previous research has established the efficacy of the implementations of social distancing on reducing the spread of epidemics 1918 spanish flu in the united states bootsma  ferguson 2007 hatchett et al 2007 markel et al 2007 and seasonal viral infections in france adda 2016 are the notable examplesit does not require a trained economist to assess the impact of the complete social and economic lockdown of india on the supply side of the indian economy this lockdown will bring massive disruptions in the production and distributions of goods and services except for the essential commodities in an effort to contain the rapidly spreading coronavirus a fall in social consumption can severely affect the gdp of an economy as people are getting aware about the community transmission of the disease they are maintaining social distancing and cutting back social consumption loss in social consumption is partly considered as a permanent loss however reductions in social consumption may not necessarily amplify all scenarios by the same degree and magnitude this is due to the reason that demand and supply in the market are complementary to each other if closing down the educational institutions and banning public events result in people taking more off from their works then it will create supply shocks in such a situation demand shock will have less scope to do damageasian development bank adb has projected that the outbreak of covid19 might incur economic in indian from 387 million to 299 billion in terms of personal consumption losses in order to assess the economic effect of the outbreak on developing economies in asia adb has categorized four possible scenarios these scenarios are the bestcase scenario moderate case scenario worsecase scenario and hypothetical worstcase scenario under the bestcase scenario it has projected the loss to be 387 million for india if the spread is contained by travel suspension and taking some precautionary measures after 2 months from late january in the occurrence of a moderate scenario the loss is likely to be hit by 640 billion imposing some restrictive policies in place and with the continuation of some precautionary measures for the next 6 months under the worstcase scenario the personal consumption expenditure in india will fall by 12 billionoecd as against the growth predictions made in 2019 now amidst the global uncertainty oecd has revisited the growth forecast in the case of india considering the grave economic situation it has revised the growth by lowering down by 110 basis points to 51 for the financial year 20202021 and subsequently by 80 bps to 56 in 20212022 when it comes to global economic growth oecd has revised down it by 50 bps against the prior projections made in november 2019due to the intensification of the spread and its possible economic consequences on manufacturing and service sector activities fitch has reduced its growth projection from 51 to 49 in 20192020 according to fitch this lower economic growth is driven by domestically weak demand for many consumable items and disruptions in supply chainsafter examining the effect of covid19 on the indian economy and its different sectors this study recommends some policy actions both for the shortrun and long run effective implementation of easy monetary policy by considering a repo cut of 50 basis points and extending the period from 90 to 180 days in recognizing the nonperforming assets npas can provide stimulus to the financial sector corporate social responsibility csr can also play a significant role in mitigating the effect of covid19 spending on pandemic mitigation measures should be a part of csr initiatives to minimize the effect the government should induce more capital to the public sector banks in india micro small and medium enterprises msmes should be given easy and cheap credit as these companies are worst affected by this pandemic the msmes industry provides more than 100 million employment opportunities and contributes 166 to indias gdp post the crisis the employees associated with the sector will experience a decline in their incomes government should provide some incentives to the employees to compensate for the loss that they are facing owing to the lockdown farmers and agriculture migrant workers should be included in the several assistance packages announced by the government and any social protection programs addressing the crisis should include the migrant labors unemployed informal workers should be provided cash income support through jan dhan financial inclusion programgiven the status of indias poor health care system government expenditure on public health care should be substantial to ensure all the required medical facilities to the people india has reported a very low number of coronavirus tests the government should ensure the supply of masks gloves and medical kits to the health workers to contain the virus since the agricultural and allied activities are heavily affected and there has been a fall in aggregate consumption in the country except for the essentials direct benefit transfers to the farmers can improve the demand for agricultural products post the pandemic due importance should be given to research and innovation so that scientist and researchers can find an effective way to address the crisis in addition to public health the government should also help vulnerable households by providing them with temporary direct benefit transfers such actions of the government would support the households to compensate for the loss of their incomes arising out of work shutdowns and layoffs international cooperation and development aid from the developed countries to less developed countries can be proven effective during this crisisin looking at the way in which the covid-19 pandemic is likely to shape the incidence prevalence and impact of ipv it is important to note that scholars have explored how past natural disasters and epidemics have shaped trends in rates of violence impacted the health and well-being of ipv victims but also exacerbated the factors associated with violent behaviors and victimization this includes work in the united states and abroad on the impact of hurricanes earthquakes and other natural and man-made disasters parkinson 2019 campbell  jones 2016 chan  zhang 2011 buttell  carne 2009 there is strong evidence to suggest that womens physical and mental health and the risk of ipv is connected to the consequences of natural disasters and pandemics including social isolation economic instability and increasing relationship and family conflict given the likely impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the risk for a number of consequential health impacts galea merchant  lurie 2020 point to the need for investments in efforts to ensure historically marginalized groups and those likely to be isolated during the pandemic receive outreach services this includes older adults women with historic victimization experiences and those with mental illness and chronic health conditionsdrawing on police calls for service and arrest data from the new orleans police department both before and after hurricane katrina buttell and carney 2009 found a significant increase in calls for service along with increased rates of arrests for domestic violence related offenses they also found an increase in the severity of ipv in the post-hurricane data most importantly buttell and carney 2009 note that the new orleans police department actively responded to ipv calls for service following hurricane katrina and that there was not an agenda to prioritize other demands on police time during and after the crisisbell and folkerth 2016 have shown that survivors of natural disasters have significant health sequelae and that ptsd and depression are commonly seen in women who have lived through a natural disaster their work also draws on data post-hurricane katrina and showed that rates of violence against women rose from 46 cases per 100000 per day to well over 16 cases per 100000 per day among displaced populations following the hurricane they found that one year after hurricane katrina those victims housed in fema trailer parks reported higher levels of negative mental health as compared to non-victimsin contrast work by bell  folkerth 2016 note evidence suggesting that for some couples natural disasters may enhance intimate relationships particularly among those individuals and couples with a strong sense of community and social cohesion along with those with a strong integration into the workforce these unprecedented events may provide increased time for couples to share coping mechanisms to manage the stress of these disasters and may also provide motivation and incentives to draw on social support systems that enhance their intimate relationship and relationships with otherswork by jenkins and phillips 2008 notes that while domestic-violence victims and survivors experienced heightened levels of violence during hurricane katrina and its aftermath even in that difficult context some women made the choice to call the police report the violence and leave their abusive situations this suggests that the stress and impact of natural disasters and pandemics may impact the decision-making of ipv victims they also noted that victim advocates responded in new ways to help these women meet their unique needs as both victims of ipv and post-katrina survivors as with these natural disasters and perhaps the covid-19 pandemic there may be an impetus for some women with long histories of ipv to report to the police and seek assistance from diverse medical and social service entities it may be that the pandemic will serve at the final crisis situation in their violent relationship these natural disasters may therefore serve as a cathartic event for victims of ipv leading to a turning point in attempts to bring an end to a violent relationship for some victims the pandemic may create the context in which they will proceed through what burke gielen mcdonnell ocampo  maman 2001 note as the key behavioral changes needed for ending and fleeing a violent relationship this includes assessing the options for and preparing for leaving selection of actions and the use of safety strategies to remain free from violence and abuseit will be challenging to fully document the early impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the incidence and impact of ipv due to the hidden nature of violence at the hands of an intimate partner the low rates of police reporting and the challenges for scholars to quickly deploy a research plan that would be able to draw on diverse methodologies to measure victimization experiences among a representative sample of the population will impact the ability to assess the connection between covid-19 and ipv this is a consequence of the under-reporting of these crimes to law enforcement agencies the under-utilization of victim and social service agencies by victims and the challenge of collecting self-report victimization data during the pandemic most importantly researchers do not yet have access to the types of data that would most readily allow for an examination of the relationship between covid-19 and ipva recent article by the world health organization 2020 notes that many of the survey research methodologies drawn on traditionally in the violence against women literature will not be practical during the pandemic and others research strategies may place women at risk of violence yet there is some early data from the united states and abroad that suggests there have been increased reports of ipv during the pandemic particularly increases in officially reported ipv to police agencies emergency rooms domestic violence hotlines and social service agencies it is important to note that police reported crimes and victimization are not clearly correlated to actual levels of criminal and violent behavior increased reporting to the police and victim service agencies may be and is likely to be a function of an increased number of victimization experiences of those victims who are most apt to call the police to report their experiences these are more likely to be victims with the economic resources to be able to navigate ending a violent relationship and have the social support systems to assist changes in official reporting rates may also be a function of a change in the experiences and decision-making of those who were victims of ipv prior to the pandemic the pandemic may serve as the catalyst for victims to report their experiencesimportantly the early data on the relationship between covid-19 and ipv come from news agencies who report data from police agencies domestic violence shelters andor emergency rooms from individual or small groups of cities for example taubs 2020 new york times article notes evidence for the relationship between covid-19 and increased rates of ipv citing significant increased calls to domestic violence emergency support lines in china italy and spain yet the source nature and quality of the data for these reports is not clear bradbury-jones and isham 2020 similarly note that the leading ipv organization in the united kingdom reported that calls to its domestic violence hotline increased by 25 within the first week of the tighter social distancing and stay-at-home measures similarly azpirir 2020 also notes that a vancouver-based domestic violence crisis line had experienced a 300 increase in calls amid the covid-19 pandemic victims have also increased their utilization of internet based resources this includes increased internet browsing traffic to a united kingdom-based website which has seen a 150 surge in traffic after the government lockdowns bradbury-jones  isham 2020 campbell 2020 has suggested that the growing global trend of increasing reports of domestic violence cases is likely to continue throughout the pandemic and may only represent a tip of the iceberg as many victims still find themselves trapped with the perpetrator and unable to report the abuse the increasing sale of guns and ammunition during the pandemic also give rise to added concern for womens safety given the link between firearm access and the risk of lethal ipv an additional concern is the increased risk of childrens exposure to ipv given stay-at-home orders and school cancellationthese are alarming increases in documented reporting via law enforcement agencies and victim service providers with consequential health and mental health impacts importantly they do not have the ability to tell us about the experiences of victims that do not seek assistance or are unable to make such calls due to shared quarantining with their abuser what will be needed as we proceed through the pandemic is the triangulation of diverse data sources from both criminal justice and social service agencies and self-report victimization data to explore the relationship between covid-19 and ipv to fully understand the extent of ipv as function of the stressors associated with covid-19 stay-at-home orders and social isolation researchers will need to identify the characteristics of the women and children that arewere most at risk during the pandemicresearch by piquero riddell bishopp narvey reid and piquero 2020 published in this special issue provides an initial exploration of the way in which the stay-at-home measures associated with the covid-19 pandemic may be correlated with domestic violence calls for service using domestic violence incident reports for dallas texas and an intervention time-series methodology they compared domestic violence crimes for an 83-day period before the mandated stay-at-home orders to a 35-day period thereafter they conclude that there is some evidence pointing to a short-term increase in the two weeks immediately following the stay-at-home orders in dallas but also note a decrease after the initial rise in officially reported ipv incidents the authors are cautious to attribute the increase to covid-19 orders as the cause of this increase as they note appeared to have been part of an increasing trend in officially reported ipv prior to the stay-at-home orders they also note that the short-term upward trend in domestic violence incidents may have been associated with citizens voluntarily following cdc recommendations to social distance and quarantine piquero et al 2020 also note that work looking to examine the association between covid-19 lockdown orders and changes and trends in domestic violence need to recognize the importance of exploring the factors associated with the economic implications of the pandemic that are associated with the risk of ipv including the social isolation associated with remote work and the financial stress of layoffs and furloughsthe longstanding body of research on the reporting and under-reporting of ipv to the police will be important in the context of the work that will be needed to explore the connection between covid-19 and ipv the extensive scholarship on police reporting and ipv highlights the fact that the domestic violence crimes brought to the attention of the criminal justice system are not representative of all incidents of ipv or ipv victims and that the majority of these crimes remain unrecorded by official statistics police calls for service are therefore not a good measure of true incidence of ipv and this may be particularly true during covid-19there are a number of factors that are likely to shape increases stability or declines in ipv calls for service to the police and the incidence of actual violent behavior and victimization is just one of those these are discussed below if we rely on data on social service utilization during covid-19 we are also likely to see a decline in this type of help-seeking and reporting because of social distancing measures that will prevent victims from accessing services we will therefore need to expand our data collection efforts beyond police reported incidents emergency room admissions shelter data and data from diverse social service providers in examining womens risk for intimate partner violence during covid-19 self-report victimization surveys offer an advantage over official law enforcement estimates the use of large-scale representative victimization data will help avoid some of the problems associated with law enforcement and clinical sample bias providing researchers with a larger estimate of the extent and dynamic nature of ipv yet a different form of selectivity will bias these estimates particularly during covid-19 self-report data typically under-represent the most severe and violent forms of intimate partner violence and abuse particularly among women with chronic health conditions and disabilities the samples from self-report data may therefore not include all women who are the victims of the most severe types of ipv or those who are victims of covid-19 disease this points to the need for careful joint analyses of self-report survey data estimates from law enforcement agencies and clinical data during and after covid-19 to tap diverse types of intimate partner abuse and also explore the way in which covid-19 disease progression may place women at further risk for physical violence emotional and financial abuse and coercive control this may be particularly true for older victims of ipv and would be exacerbated by covid-19 disease and symptoms this points to the need for leadership at the state and national level to organize and coordinate data collection for research and policy decision-making we likely will not have a good self-report measure of ipv during the pandemic perhaps some researchers will be able to measure in smaller regions with national science foundation rapid grants and other funding mechanisms but a national level data collection seems unlikely if this were to happen the leadership for the national crime victimization survey would need to move very quickly to develop measures that could tap changes in ipv both during and immediately after the pandemic but also measure the factors that might correlate with both ipv and covid-19 including the social isolation and stressors associated with social distancing and quarantine and the economic impacts of the pandemic on familiesthere are a number of predictions that could be made with regard to the impact of covid-19 and police reports of ipv it is likely that we will see an increase in domestic violence calls for service to the police because of an actual increase and change in the level of violent behavior by some batterers and abusers this is likely to be the case among the same set of women who were victims of ipv prior to covid-19 and who might also during covid-19 experience a greater number of individual incidents of violence by their previously abusive partner and perhaps more severe types of abuse this increase in the incidence and severity of violence by historic abusers may lead to new reporting behaviors by these victims andor someone else in their household or neighborhood might increase their reporting to the police it is also likely that we will see a new set of victims experience violence due to the consequences of social distancing measures and stay-at-home orders these measures have placed those most vulnerable to violence and abuse in close proximity to their potential abuser and this may lead to an increase in the risk factors associated with ipv the cause of this increase is likely to be shaped by a variety of factors that are associated with ipv more generally but that will be more prevalent during the covid-19 pandemic this includes social isolation and increased attempts by abusers to exert power and coercive control unemployment economic distress marital conflict and substance use and abuse these are discussed further below the covid-19 epidemic may also serve at a turning point for some victims of ipv creating the crisis and catharsis that leads to attempts to flee and end the violent relationshipalternatively the rates of police reporting victim calls for service during covid-19 could stay relatively flat we might actually see those who have been victims of ipv prior to the pandemic to now be less apt to call the police during covid-19 so while actual behaviors by offenders may stay the same or incidents of violence may go up during the pandemic some victims during covid-19 may be less likely to call the police or seek help this could be for a number of reasons including the lack of access to a secure place to call the police and reach out for help andor the inability to find a safe place to research options for leaving including safety planning organizing paperwork and packing due to quarantine and stay-at-home orders the lack of economic resources to leave the abuser during the pandemic and fear of reprisal by the offender leading to greater violence will also impact victim decision-makingrates of police reporting may also decline there may be some women who will be less likely to call the police during the pandemic because they want to reserve these essential services for those in immediate need  specifically covid-19 patients it may be that during covid-19 that in some jurisdictions rates of police reporting could go down and rates of police reporting among some types of ipv victims decline actual violent behaviors may stay the same or go up or incidents of violence experienced by women who have been experiencing ipv prior to the pandemic may stay the same or go up but now women are even less likely during covid-19 to call the police to seek help for fear of reprisal and inability to find a safe place to call due to social distancing illness associated with covid-19 disease may also impact a victims ability to reach out for assistance with ipv calls for service would therefore decline during this timeduring covid-19 social distancing and stay-at-home orders may expand a current perpetrators coercive control and power over their victim with victims and perpetrators in close proximity batterers will be able to increase their ability to be in control of decision-making determine day-to-day outcomes and monitor and socially isolate their victim from family and friends bradbury-jones and isham 2020 note that the home is often a sphere where the dynamics of power are distorted and subverted by perpetrators during covid-19 this is made worse due to the lack of outside scrutiny from family and friends for many victims this will lead to increased physical violence emotional and financial abuse and coercive control alternatively for those victims who have learned to adapt to their batterers control techniques and read the cues for their use of violence and abuse the use of ipv by some batters may decline given stay-at-home orders the batterer will be better able to exert day-to-day control over household decision-making and there may be less perceived need by the abuser to use physical violence since the batterer is able to exert control and manipulate their victim during stay-at-home orders abusers may be better able to know where their victims are and control their victims access to their family and friends  preventing access via the phone computer andor other technologies for these batterers their ability to gain control and manipulate their victim may lead them to not need to use physical methods to gain coercive controlthere are a number of elements of the covid-19 pandemic that may also serve as mechanisms of control by abusers for example batterers use a variety of methods to exert control over their victims and keep their victims in a constant state of fear these may be expanded during the pandemic covid-19 may be used by offenders both those currently with their victim and those who are separated or divorced as a way to control the victim via threats to expose them and their shared children to the novel coronavirus victims may also fear their abuser taking their children outside of the home during the outbreak and not be able to control who their children are exposed to or whether proper hygiene and social distancing measures are practiced other violent partners and ex-partners may use a victims risk for covid-19 sucha as those who are healthcare providers grocery store workers working in transportation etc as a way to seek custody of their shared children during the pandemic and this custody may continue after the pandemic healthcare providers may be particularly vulnerable to this type of abusive behavior since children may be social distancing with the abusive partner while the victim is forced to quarantine in another area of their home or outside of the home due to their ongoing risk for covid-19the risk factors for ipv victimization and the factors that limit womens ability to leave violent relationships include economic dependence on male partners ie lack of education income and employment and the responsibility for children both before and after divorce a history of violent victimization also places women at risk demographic factors also shape risk including age younger raceethnicity and marital status cohabitation and dating finally male partners with drug and alcohol problems chronic unemployment and prior intimate partner violence are at greater risk for perpetration and these factors may be particularly prevalent during the covid-19 pandemic it is difficult to know whether during the pandemic we might see violence by new offenders men who were not previously violent to their partner or an increase in violence by previously violent men due to increased proximity and exposure between victims and offenders and the exacerbation of these risk factors for ipv the question researchers will need to explore both during the early stages of the pandemic and long-term is whether there has been or will be an increase in ipv among men who were not previously violent due to factors that enhance the risk for ipv that also correlate with the covid-19 pandemic see below alternatively will we may be most likely to see an increased incidence and severity of violence by perpetrators who were previously violent but now covid-19 has exacerbated the role of those risk factorsstress frustration perspectives posit that any form of negative affect or distress is likely to increase the likelihood of violence and aggression stressful life events produce aggression and violence because they create negative affect stress-frustration theories holtzworth-munroe bates smutzler  sandin 1997 suggest that diminished economic resources within the family lead to stress frustration and conflict in intimate relationships that heightens the risk of male-perpetrated violence against women this suggests that during covid-19 women with unemployed partners would be at the greatest risk for ipv and abuse the economic uncertainty during the pandemic and record levels of unemployment are likely to add to the stress experienced by both men and women heightening the risk of marital conflict and violenceeconomic and marital dependency of female partners on their husbands will place many women at risk for new or continued ipv during covid-19 and also create financial challenges to women navigating ending a violent relationship womens lack of employment and financial resources during the pandemic and their disproportionate responsibility for children will limit their ability to end violent relationships andor identify mechanisms for leaving their abuser some feminist research kaukinen 2004 anderson 1997 also suggests that economic variables are often symbolic in nature and that men who do not have access to marital power via employment and economic resources will use violence in an attempt to re-establish their power at home given their lack of access to economic resources to establish a traditional masculinity the financial stress of the covid-19 pandemic will be unprecedented we have already seen the highest rates of unemployment in the last 50 years for those couples in which the female partner may be able to continue working remotely or otherwise while the male partner is unemployed will experience a shift in economic and symbolic power particularly among couples in which the male partner previously held that breadwinner rolein exploring the role of covid-19 and the risk of ipv social distancing and stay-at-home orders will likely lead to increased conflict disagreements and arguments due to increased daily proximity of couples this in turn could lead to an increased prevalence of common couple violence among both couples with and without previous ipv johnson 1995 notes that this type of intimate partner violence does not include severe acts of violence is likely to be mutual between partners gender symmetric and does not exhibit a general pattern of coercive control by the male partner a recent new york times article by taub 2020 on china noted that some victims stated that during the epidemic we were unable to go outside and our conflicts just grew bigger and bigger and more and more frequent everything was exposed for some couples particularly those experiencing financial and family stressors during the pandemic they will likely have an increase in the number of arguments and conflicts during sustained social isolation and physical proximity increases in common couple violence is a likely consequence of the pandemic particularly among young and newly formed intimate relationshipsthe risk and impact of ipv during the covid-19 pandemic may also be shaped by rates of drug and alcohol use and abuse there is research brooks webster smith woodland wessely greenberg  rubin 2020 to suggest that quarantine and other social isolating conditions are associated with alcohol abuse depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms while researchers fals-stewart 2003 leonard  quigley 1999 have pointed to a strong correlation between drinking and in particular heavy alcohol consumption and the risk of intimate partner violence the exact mechanism is less clear some scholars have suggested that problematic drinking and the risk of ipv perpetration may share a common etiology a need to achieve personal power and control my own research has shown that women with male partners who engage in heavy episodic drinking are also more likely to engage in both physical violence and coercive control the exact relationship between alcohol and drug use and abuse and the risk of ipv is complicated substance abuse along with the economic stressors associated with covid-10 will provide perpetrators with an excuse and justification for their violent and abusive battering behaviors and an explanation for victims to excuse their abuser alcohol allows perpetrators to justify their violent behavior and for victims to explain it and excuse it it is therefore best to view substance use as a risk marker for ipv while not a direct cause at the same time drinking may increase the frequency or severity of male perpetrated violence against women clay and parker 2020 note the importance of public health approaches that explore the public health effects of long-term social isolation related to covid-19 on alcohol use and misuse noting the need to protect the most vulnerable individuals from excessive alcohol consumption during the pandemic in addressing the connection between substance use and the stressors associated with covid-19 da im  schiano 2020 note the need to put in place awareness and telehealth strategies to curb what is likely to become a serious consequence of the coronavirus pandemicmany ipv victims will be reluctant to seek help from healthcare providers or engage in social service utilization during the pandemic for some victims they may be reluctant to seek healthcare or other emergency care for their ipv-related injuries due to the fear of contracting covid-19 due to enhanced exposure in healthcare settings other victims might believe they should reserve those healthcare services for the people most in need those suffering from covid-19 disease many ipv victims will have reduced access to victim services during the pandemic since many of these services are limited by social distancing and stay-at-home orders and are only operating remotely remote type therapies and services are likely to place many victims at risk for further violence by their abuser or may lack access to phones and internet during covid-19 due to financial hardships or coercive control by their abuser access to housing and other advocacy services will continue to be limited during the early days of stay-at-home orders due to social distancing and quarantine requirements with many of these services temporarily shut down including courthouses for example a fall outbreak of the pandemic will make worse womens experiences with ipv and further limit their options for leaving a violent partnerthere will be the need for strong federal and state leadership to expand victims access to support services and economic resources during the pandemic we will need to be creative in our thinking on how to outreach to victims and provide awareness messaging to bystanders we will need to create ways in which ipv victims will be able to safely access both in-person and telehealth options in discrete ways without alerting their perpetrator bradbury-jones and isham 2020 also point to the importance of protecting the advocates who work in a voluntary manner to support victims and the need for personal protective equipment to be provided boserup mckenney  elkbul 2020 note the importance of making ipv screening tools and assessments more readily available in diverse clinical settings and among telehealth providers during the pandemic social workers advocates and others who work with victims will need to identify ways to safely work with victims on safety planning and self-care but also plans for victims to leave their violent partner there will need to be collaboration and creative thinking on how to expand the availability of services and diversify the nature of transitional housing particularly for victims who may have contracted or been exposed to covid-19 for those victims who report to the police there will be a need for more intensive police and social service follow-up both during and after the covid-19 pandemic this will be particularly true for women who remain in their home with the abuser finally we will need to change the way in which awareness campaigns have provided information to ipv victims and bystanders reliance on public spaces for this information is no longer the most effective way to outreach to victims boserup mckenney  elkbul 2020 therefore suggest that diverse social media outlets should seek to identify ways to reach a wider audience during city lockdowns and stay-at-home ordersthe emergence of the novel coronavirus covid-19 as a global pandemic has triggered the necessity of environment-health-economic nexus hence the outbreak of covid-19 pandemic is a public health concern with dire health environmental and economic consequences wang et al 2020 the first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus which then appeared like pneumonia with unknown aetiology was officially reported to the world health organization who on december 31 2020 who 2020b the outbreak which initially occurred in a seafood market in wuhan china spread across countries through human-to-human transmission and community spread within a short period sarkodie and owusu 2020 who 2020c on march 11 2020 who declared covid-19 as a global pandemic after the infectious disease spread

2020 such containment measures include quarantine travel ban and restrictions social distance enforcement and lockdownclosure of public places and cancellation of public events these containment measures put in place to reduce health outcomes of the global pandemic have affected environmental sustainability and economic development while some studies have reported the environmental impact of covid-19 gautam and trivedi 2020 no study has yet reported the health and economic implications of the global pandemic given this we present the pros and cons of environmental health and economic impacts of covid-19 across countries we contribute to the existing studies on covid-19 pandemic by examining the impact of covid-19 on health outcomes and provide recent policies to improve health quality across the globe second we present the several fiscal measures monetary policies and private sector economic burden-sharing across countries due to the impact of the social distancing measures on economic sectors this is essential to understand the global picture of the covid-19 pandemic from socio-economic and environmental dimensionssocial distancing policies instituted across countries are reported to have yielded environment sustainability total lockdown in many countries saw a halt in carbon and energy-intensive economic sectors such as manufacturing and transportation the interruption of road transportation and airlines saw overwhelming decongestion in urban centres and traffic level leading to a decline in anthropogenic emissions verisk 2020 it is reported that the social distancing measures led to a decline of energy demand and industrial output hence affecting environmental quality coal-fired power generation is reported to have declined by 50 in china whereas oil consumption declined by 2030 carbon brief 2020 the reduction in coal and oil consumption led to a decline in carbon dioxide emissions by 25 100mtco2 corresponding to a 6 reduction in global emissions carbon brief 2020 nasa satellite images showed a reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions by 70 due to a reduction in the consumption of fossil fuels during the lockdown period ucar 2020

with underlying conditions such as cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases are more susceptible to covid-19 meaning that the reduction in air pollution waterpipe and tobacco use reduces the risk of covid-19 who 2020dthere are reports of medical and municipal waste generation linked to the covid-19 pandemic acrplus 2020 as much as six times of medical waste 240 metric tonnes were generated daily in hospitals in china calma 2020 hence china had to construct new medical waste disposal centres and mobile waste facilities to increase the waste disposal treatment from 50 tonnes to 263 tonnes daily mandy 2020 zhong 2020social distancing and shutdown of the tourism industry are likely to improve biodiversity and enhance the regenerative capacity of the marine habitat fishing ground and forest reserve the reduction in road and railway transportation and shutdown of commercial power plants and manufacturing activities are likely to reduce ambient noise levels zambrano-monserrate et al 2020we note that a temporary reduction in atmospheric emissions and environmental degradation in the time of global pandemic does not translate into total environmental sustainability but a transitory period that will experience a rebound effect during post-covid-19 the premise of the argument is centred on the grave economic damage caused by the observation of social distancing measures to mitigate the spread of covid-19 the introduction of welfare cost health system policies fiscal monetary and exchange rate measures are gradually leading many economies into recession hence many economies especially developing countries will utilize the scale effect approach  where resource depletion carbon and energy-intensive economic structure are given priority over environmental sustainability sarkodie and strezov 2018 however it is too early to conclude on the impact of the aftermath of covid-19 on environmental pollutionthe strategic objectives of who to combat the global pandemic include

reported that the choice of a government to undertake strong fiscal stimulus depends mainly on sovereign credit ratings and economic stringency to salvage the deteriorating economic effect of social distancing policies to reduce the spread of covid-19 balajee et al 2020the critical assessment presented in this study reveals a trade-off between environment health and economic development though the study is limited in terms of data due to the progressive nature of the covid-19 pandemic however the global pandemic has demonstrated the need to empirically assess the trilemma of environment-health-economic nexus while environmental pollution is reported to have declined due to shutdown in vital economic sectors such as transportation aviation and industries the health systems have been improved significantly to save lives at the expense of economic deterioration nevertheless a rebound effect is projected to occur across countries via rebooting of primary economic sectors to salvage economic loss based on both qualitative and quantitative assessment the post-covid-19 is expected to rekindle and intensify environmental degradation while improving and sustaining the health system to recover and sustain economic productivity on the contrary the aftermath of the covid-19 pandemic will have a long-lasting societal effect on workplaces public places and social events which will directly affect the economic transition thus governmental effort across countries is required to strike a balance between environmental sustainability health outcomes and sustained economic development due to the potential trade-off effectsthe covid19 pandemic is currently spreading across the world in an unprecedented way as of march 24 20203 among 169 countries in the world the total accumulative confirmed cases are 387382 and the total number of death is 16767 johns hopkins university 2020 this pandemic has been compared to the second world war or the great depression in terms of its wide scope and broad impactone unique impact stands out among its various types of impacts on public heath economic political education and many others sectors of the modern society that is the covid19 pandemic forces humans to social isolations in order to control the extremely infectious coronavirus currently different countries have been using different methods of social isolations these methods include voluntary selfisolation mandatory quarantine travel restrictions stayathome order shutdowns of restaurants theaters churches sports venues museums and other social organizations closures of schools and universities working at home limits or closures of transportations such as airplanes trains buses and ships closures of country borders declaration of state of emergency and lockdowns of entire cities entire regions and entire countries nowadays social distancing has become the latest buzzword in the headlines of media covering the covid19 pandemic one recent example is that the worldrenowned opera singer plcido domingo has tested positive for the coronavirus on march 22 2020 and he is in selfisolation at home chen  lee 2020 another heartbreaking example is that a holocaust survivor arie even passed away on march 21 2020 as the first coronavirus death case in israel but his family was unable to be with him during his final days to avoid getting the virus estrin 2020while it appears to be as novel as it is now social distancing actually is traditional public health measures used for decades during major influenza virus outbreaks wildersmith  freedman 2020 these public health measures typically include isolating ill persons contact tracing quarantining exposed persons school closures workplace closures and avoiding crowding technically the basic idea of social distancing is to reduce risks of persontoperson transmission by delaying the epidemic peak reducing the size of the epidemic peak and spreading cases over a longer time to relieve pressure on the healthcare system fong et al 2020 p 1the widely implemented social distancing measures to control the covid19 pandemic have generated one unprecedented shift that is various types of human social interactions eg shopping banking learning meeting and entertaining are shifted from dominantly offline to dominantly online in other words the enforced social isolations in the physical world significantly increase humans social interactions in the cyber world this becomes a new normal in our daily lifefor example in the education sector thousands of universities including stanford harvard princeton yale and mit have moved regular facetoface teaching to online teaching this worldwide movement might be the largest online education practice in the human history the article published by dr wei bao in this issue documents such a case in the business sector online shopping has almost become the mainstream shopping behavior for people to buy foods groceries medicines and many other products from online stores such as httpamozoncom or online services of regular stores such as walmart in the entertainment sector many theaters eg metropolitan opera and museums eg various national museums in china have been offering a series of live stream online performances or virtual exhibitions in the public health sector specific mobile apps have been developed successfully for testing tracing analyzing and social distancing in china singapore korea uk and other countries in the world this week dr ashley mason at ucsf is running an experimental study with over 2000 san francisco emergency medical workers by asking them to wear the oura rings a wearable device to monitors body temperature breathing heart rate and other physical indicators in order to track their body temperature in the real time and identify the early onset of covid19 gafni 2020with the unprecedented shift to the cyber world we are observing an accelerated diffusion of emerging digital technologies among ordinary people diffusion is the key concept of american sociologist everett rogers wellknown theory of diffusion of innovations rogers 2010 roger defined diffusion as a process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of certain social systems based on this theory different innovations may have different sshaped diffusion curves different community members can be categorized into five types innovators early adopter early majority later majority and laggardsin the battle against the covid19 pandemic various emerging digital technologies may show much steeper diffusion sshaped curves and much more ordinary people might become early adopters and early majority rather than later majority and laggards eg more and more teachers are able to teach online via zoom effectively in contrary we are also observing various cases that reduce or limit diffusion of emerging digital technologies for example cybersecurity and privacy concerns have been increasing more than ever while countries began tracking those possibly exposed to the coronavirus individuals and organizations are suffering more from misinformation that has been spreading widely and quickly through online videos social media or personal emailsthe covid19 pandemic also provides an unprecedented opportunity for our research community of studying technologyrelated behavior to join the worldwide efforts to fight against and eventually win the current pandemic our research community can a explore and exercise how emerging technologies can be best used to help human beings directly fight against the current pandemic at this moment b observe study and understand various kinds of protective and risky human behavior under the current pandemic and c describe explain and predict human behavior with emerging technologies in the context of an extreme event like the current pandemic for future prevention and interventionthe currently published research has been predominately focusing on medical and public health issues regarding diagnosis management and treatment of covid19 while researchers started to publish studies on using emerging technologies to tackle the pandemic eg pandey gautam bhagat  sethi 2020 wang ng  brook 2020 much more timely efforts should be made to conduct behavioral studies on how technologies can be used to guide peoples behavior one excellent example of behavioral research is a recent research report titled using behavioural science to help fight the coronavirus lunn et al 2020 in this report released on march 12 2020 pete lunn and his collaborators in ireland spent 1 week and reviewed the existing behavioral science literature on seven topics hand washing face touching entering and coping with isolation encouraging collective action avoiding undesirable behavior crisis communication and risk perception their review clearly indicates that while a wide variety of medical and public health strategies eg developing new vaccines or tracing contacts and movements can be used to fight against covid19 behavioral sciences and behavioral interventions can be used to change humans knowledge judgment decisionmaking and actual behavior eg improving handwashing and knowing how to selfisolateto seize this opportunity in 20212020 our journal will enthusiastically welcome behavior studies of using emerging technologies to deal with covid19 and various extreme events the possible manuscripts could concern case studies eg bao this issue literature review eg gaspar yan  domingos 2019 empirical studies eg pandey et al 2020 theoretical see human behavior and emerging technologiess hbet call for papers on a special issue on theoretical studies and methodological see hbets call for papers on a special issue on methodological studies we need to study what kinds of people eg elder and young patients have used emerging technologies to fight against the pandemic what specific emerging technologies eg social video games and zoom have been used how new humantechnology interactions eg binge screen viewing and largescale distance learning have been taking place and why various positive and negative behavioral impacts eg the cabin fever effect and the digital vision syndrome has been generated these efforts will help us understand human behavior with technologies in both extreme events and ordinary events and take us one step closer to answer the basic question of how humans behave with emerging technologiesthe coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic began when clusters of pneumonia of unknown etiology were identified in december 201915 by may 2020 there were over 3 million confirmed cases globally one-third of these confirmed cases occurred in the united states us with over 60000 recorded deaths to date67in the absence of vaccines or treatments8 the primary defense has been to reduce the risk of sars-cov-2 exposure through non-pharmaceutical interventions npis such as school closures social distancing isolation and quarantine and use of personal masks913 npis were shown to be effective during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov outbreak14 and quickly became the cornerstone of mitigation and intervention strategies for covid-19 globally1517 however the extent and level of enforcement of these measures vary widely9on march 19 2020 california was the first us state to enact a statewide shelter-in-place order18 following an announcement on march 16 2020 of shelter-in-place orders for seven san francisco bay area counties effective on 1201 am on march 17 202019 in the following weeks 42 states and the district of columbia passed shelter-in-place orders20 potential subsequent sars-cov-2 wintertime outbreaks may necessitate repeated intermittent social distancing orders into 202217 given the unprecedented nature of these orders in the us it is critical that we understand the impact of shelter-in-place orders on the publics behaviors and perceptionsfor the present study we employed convenience sampling to rapidly ascertain and summarize how levels of social distancing difficulty related to daily activities such as obtaining food essential medications and childcare and levels of concern regarding the covid-19 crisis changed after the march 16 2020 shelter-in-place announcement among respondents living in the seven affected california counties compared with respondents living elsewhere in the uswe conducted a cross-sectional online survey with convenience sampling through three social media platforms nextdoor twitter and facebook starting on march 14 2020 through april 1 2020 twitter and facebook posts were shareable to facilitate snowball sampling we included all respondents who completed at least 80 of the survey and excluded those missing both zip code and geoip location and those outside of the usthe 21-item survey collected information regarding shelter-in-place behaviors experienced difficulty with daily activities level of concern demographic characteristics and location demographic information included gender female male other raceethnicity white asian pacific islander hispaniclatino black or other year of birth was used to create age categories 25 years or less 26  45 46  65 older than 65 years education less than high school high school or ged some college bachelors degree and health insurance yes no dont know respondents reported the number of children 18 years and adults over age 65 years in their household participants were informed of the purpose risks and benefits of the studywe focused the analysis on the implications of shelter-in-place orders announced for six san francisco bay area counties san francisco santa clara san mateo marin contra costa and alameda and separately for santa cruz county made mid-day on march 16 2020 hereafter referred to collectively as seven bay area counties we classified survey responses collected before march 16 2020 as having occurred before the shelter-in-place announcement we did so in order to more precisely identify responses that occurred before the announcement as we anticipated that some respondents were aware of or suspected the shelter-in-place announcement several hours before it occurred we differentiated survey respondents living in the seven affected bay area counties from those residing elsewhere in the us using self-reported zip codes for invalid or missing zip codes we assigned participants locations based on latitude and longitude ie geoip location an estimation of the respondents location based on their ip addresswe considered three outcomes social distancing behaviors all of the time most of the time some of the time none of the time experienced difficulties with daily activities access to healthcare childcare transportation job loss or difficulty obtaining essential items including food medications and hand sanitizer and level of concern regarding the covid-19 crisis extremely concerned very concerned moderately concerned somewhat concerned not at all concernedwe used linear probability models to assess changes in levels of social distancing the proportion of respondents experiencing difficulty with daily activities and level of concern regarding the covid-19 crisis after versus before the shelter-in-place announcement separately for respondents in the seven bay area counties and for respondents elsewhere in the us beta coefficients were transformed to reflect percent changes in each response level after the announcement was madewe used a difference-in-differences did approach with linear probability models to estimate the impact of the shelter-in-place announcement2122 the did estimator compared the change in responses after versus before march 16 2020 among respondents in the bay area versus elsewhere in the us the did approach assumes that any changes that occurred outside of the bay area reflect background or secular trends under the assumption that these trends would have been parallel among respondents in the bay area and elsewhere had the shelter-in-place announcement not occurred the resulting did estimates correspond to the change in each outcome attributable to the announcement itself in the bay area we calculated did estimates in the study population overall and within subgroups defined by gender age and household composition at least one child at home at least one adult  65 yearswe considered three alternative approaches for the did analysis first we compared responses from the entire state of california to those of respondents elsewhere in the us because the announcement was highly publicized on mainstream news media channels and social media platforms survey respondents living in california outside of the seven bay area counties may have modified their behaviors we therefore repeated the main analysis comparing respondents in california to respondents in other us states second a similar announcement also occurred in washington state on march 16 2020 therefore we repeated the main analysis with respondents from washington state combined with bay area respondents finally we repeated the main analysis excluding responses after march 19 2020  when california announced a state-wide shelter-in-place orderwe conducted all statistical analyses using r version 323 r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria this study was approved by the institutional review board at stanford universityin table 2 we present the change in level of social distancing difficulties experienced and level of concern following the march 16 2020 shelter-in-place announcement for respondents from the bay area and respondents living elsewhere in general we observed similar trends in the two groups we found an increase in the proportion of respondents practicing social distancing all of the time after the shelter-in-place announcement in the bay area 92 95 ci 66 119 and elsewhere 34 95 ci 20 50 we also observed increases in the proportion sheltering in place most of the time among survey respondents from the bay area 57 95 ci 23 90 and elsewhere 85 95 ci 68 103 the proportion of respondents sheltering in place some of the time and none of the time decreased both among respondents from the bay area and elsewhererespondents also reported more difficulty associated with activities such as obtaining food hand sanitizer and medications after the march 16 2020 shelter-in-place announcement versus before the increase in difficulty was largest for obtaining food for both respondents from the bay area 133 95 ci 104 163 and elsewhere 82 95 ci 66 97 similarly both groups reported greater difficulty obtaining hand sanitizer greater difficulty with wages was reported more frequently by respondents from the bay area following the shelter-in-place announcement 47 95 ci 26 68 and even more so by respondents living elsewhere 64 95 ci 52 76 respondents in both groups were also more likely to report difficulty related to job loss following the announcement bay area 12 95 ci 05 18 elsewhere 16 95 ci 11 20we observed only small changes in level of concern regarding the covid-19 crisis after the march 16 2020 shelter-in-place announcement among respondents in the bay area among respondents living elsewhere we observed a decrease in the proportion of respondents reporting they were extremely concerned after the announcement  41 95 ci  57  24in table 3 we present did estimates for the change in the proportion of respondents who were social distancing all of the time after the shelter-in-place announcement in the bay area versus elsewhere overall the proportion of respondents social distancing all of the time increased after the announcement in the bay area versus elsewhere 58 95 ci 28 88 relative increases were greatest among men 93 95 ci 32 154 adults between the ages of 46 and 65 years 67 95 ci 18 117 and respondents from households with childrenwe calculated did estimates for experienced difficulties in the bay area versus elsewhere following the shelter-in-place announcement we noted the strongest differences for difficulty obtaining food 52 95 ci 18 85 followed by difficulty with transportation 22 95 ci  15 59 figure 1 table a2 we observed limited evidence of increased difficulty with healthcare obtaining hand sanitizer or obtaining medicationsin table 4 we present did estimates for the change in the proportion of respondents who were extremely concerned following the shelter-in-place announcement in the bay area versus elsewhere overall the proportion of respondents who reported extreme worry did not increase after the announcement for most groups with the exception of those aged 4665 years 803 95 ci 203 140 and respondents living with at least one child 620 95 ci 062 118 the proportion reporting extreme worry decreased in some groups including men those under age 25 and those living outside the bay areathe overall pattern of results in all three sensitivity analyses was consistent with our main analysis effect estimates were slightly attenuated when we compared california respondents to respondents elsewhere in the us or when we combined washington state respondents with bay area respondents supplemental tables a3 a4 a5 and slightly accentuated when we excluded survey responses after march 19 2020we examined changes in attitudes and behaviors as a result of the covid-19 crisis in a cross-sectional convenience sample of 17543 respondents recruited through three social media platforms differences in ey demographic characteristics level of insurance educational attainment raceethnicity preclude generalization of our findings to the bay area or to the us more broadly nevertheless the study data capture how social distancing behaviors difficulties with daily activities and levels of concern regarding how covid-19 may have changed in the days that immediately preceded and immediately followed the announcement of the nations first shelter-in-place order for seven bay area counties this announcement occurred at a point where the seriousness of the covid-19 pandemic for the us was increasingly recognized but the eventual impact on cities such as new york new orleans and detroit was yet to be realized2326 as such the results of this study offer some insight into our collective disposition towards the pandemic at a unique point in history as the very first shelter in place policy decisions were madeoverall we found that participants behaviors and attitudes regarding the covid-19 pandemic evolved even within our brief survey period after the shelter-in-place orders were announced for the bay area social distancing increased increases in level of social distancing were more pronounced among respondents in the bay area versus those living elsewhere in the us adults older than 46 years and those living with children or an adult over age 65 years this pattern may be explained by early suspicions that older adults were most vulnerable to covid-1927consistent with media reports of food shortages28 respondents were most likely to report difficulty obtaining food with increases in difficulty obtaining food more pronounced in the bay area following the shelter-in-place announcement increases in difficulty with access to healthcare hand sanitizer and transportation were similar among respondents in the bay area versus those living elsewhere we detected the early impacts on job loss and wages which were followed by a national surge in unemployment after the study period2930 we anticipate that our findings may further underestimate the impacts of shelter-in-place on job loss and wages given the high levels of educational attainment in our study population as may respondents may have been able to transition more easily to remote work31finally we found that approximately one-third of respondents were extremely concerned about the covid-19 crisis although we found little evidence to support the idea that levels of concern increased  among respondents in the bay area or elsewhere  following the announcement of shelter-in-place orders this raises the interesting question as to whether announcements regarding covid-19 lead to increased or decreased levels of concern and anxiety that should be considered further in more representative study populations and as the pandemic continues to evolvedespite the large number of survey respondents older adults black respondents and men were underrepresented in this convenience sample similarly household structure of respondents suggests that a large number of respondents did not have children or elderly family members that may have required extra care recruitment was convenience sampling via three social media websites snowball sampling through re-posts on facebook and twitter may have further propagated participation among a more homogenous group of respondents our results therefore likely underrepresent the true extent of challenges associated with the pandemic across the us and precludes meaningful examination of the early impacts of shelter-in-place orders on economically marginalized and vulnerable population subgroups3233the cross-sectional nature of this study represents an additional limitation because we did not observe changes in social distancing experienced difficulties and levels of concern in individuals over time it is possible that our findings are explained at least in part by compositional effects ie systematic differences in respondents who completed the survey before and after march 16th reassuringly we found limited evidence of systematic differences in measured characteristics before and after the march 16th cutoff with the exception of the gender breakdown among respondents who resided outside of the bay areafinally the announcement of shelter-in-place orders for the seven bay area counties was covered extensively in the national media which makes spillover effects of the announcement to survey respondents living outside of the bay area  particularly elsewhere in california likely the assumptions of did are therefore unlikely to be met and our estimates are more appropriately interpreted as summary measures of the change in the bay area relative to the change elsewhere in the us rather than causal estimates of the impact of the announcement however in sensitivity analyses to examine spillover in washington state and california we found similar pattern of findings across subgroups of interestwe found evidence of increased social distancing and difficulty with daily activities such as food and transportation in the wake of the announcement of the nations first shelter-in-place orders particularly among respondents in the bay area levels of concern remained fairly consistent throughout the study period among respondents in the bay area and elsewhere given that our study population was highly educated concentrated in one of the more affluent areas in the us and queried relatively early in the covid-19 pandemic we anticipate that our findings underestimate substantially the impact of county- and statewide shelter-in-place orders as such our study represents a first step towards understanding the social attitudes and consequences of this crisis further research that specifically examines social economic and health impacts of covid-19 especially among vulnerable populations is neededthe novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 epidemic caused by sars-cov-2 began in wuhan city china in december 2019 and quickly spread globally with 2063161 cases reported in 185 countriesregions as of april 16 2020 1 a total of 82692 cases of covid-19 including 4632 deaths have been reported in mainland china including 50333 cases in wuhan city and 628 cases in shanghai city 2 the epidemic in wuhan and in the rest of china subsided after implementation of strict containment measures and movement restrictions with recent cases originating from travel 3 however key questions remain about the age profile of susceptibility to infection how social distancing alters age-specific contact patterns and how these factors interact to affect transmission these questions are relevant to the choice of control policies for governments and policy makers around the world in this study we evaluate changes in mixing patterns linked to social distancing by collecting contact data in the midst of the epidemic in wuhan and shanghai we also estimate age differences in susceptibility to infection based on contact tracing data gathered by the hunan provincial center for disease control and prevention cdc china based on these empirical data we develop a mathematical disease transmission model to disentangle how transmission is affected by age differences in the biology of covid-19 infection and altered mixing patterns due to social distancing additionally we project the impact of social distancing and school closure on covid-19 transmissionto estimate changes in age-mixing patterns associated with covid-19 interventions we performed contact surveys in two cities wuhan the epicenter of the outbreak and shanghai one of the largest and most densely populated cities in southeast china shanghai experienced extensive importation of covid-19 cases from wuhan as well as local transmission 4 the surveys were conducted from february 1 2020 to february 10 2020 as transmission of covid-19 peaked across china and stringent interventions were put in place participants in wuhan were asked to complete a questionnaire describing their contact behavior 5 6 on two different days i a regular weekday between december 24 2019 and december 30 2019 before the covid-19 outbreak was officially recognized by the wuhan municipal health commission used as baseline and ii the day before the interview outbreak period participants in shanghai were asked to complete the same questionnaire used for wuhan but only reported contacts for the outbreak period for the baseline period in shanghai we relied on a survey conducted in 2017-2018 following the same design 7 in these surveys a contact was defined as either a two-way conversation involving three or more words in the physical presence of another person or a direct physical contact eg a handshake details are given in the supplementary materials sections 1 and 2we analyzed a total of 1245 contacts reported by 636 study participants in wuhan and 1296 contacts reported by 557 participants in shanghai in wuhan the average daily number of contacts per participant was significantly reduced from 146 for the baseline period weighted mean contacts by age structure 140 to 20 for the outbreak period weighted mean contacts by age structure 19 p0001 the reduction in contacts was significant for all stratifications by sex age group type of profession and household size table 1 a larger reduction was observed in shanghai where the average daily number of contacts declined from 188 weighted mean contacts by age structure 198 to 23 weighted mean contacts by age structure 21 although an average individual in shanghai reported more contacts than one in wuhan on a regular weekday this difference essentially disappeared during the covid-19 outbreak period a similar decrease in the number of contacts was found in the uk during the covid-19 lockdown period 8the typical features of age-mixing patterns 6 7 emerge in wuhan and shanghai when we consider the baseline period fig 1 a and d these features can be illustrated in the form of age-stratified contact matrices provided as ready-to-use tables in the supplementary materials section 36 where each cell represents the average number of contacts that an individual has with other individuals stratified by age groups the bottom left corner of the matrix corresponding to contacts between school-age children is where the largest number of contacts is recorded the contribution of contacts in the workplace is visible in the central part of the matrix while the three diagonals from bottom left to top right represent contacts between household members in contrast for the outbreak period where strict social distancing policies were in place much of the above-mentioned features disappears essentially leaving the sole contribution of household mixing fig 1 b and e in particular assortative contacts between school-age individuals are fully removed as illustrated by differencing baseline and outbreak matrices fig 1 c and f overall contacts during the outbreak mostly occurred at home with household members 941 in wuhan and 785 in shanghai thus the outbreak contact matrix nearly coincides with the within-household contact matrix in both study sites and the pattern of assortativity by age observed for regular days almost entirely disappears see supplementary materials section 36 these findings are consistent with trends in within-city mobility data which indicate an 869 drop in wuhan and 745 in shanghai between early january and early february see supplementary materials section 4 such a large decrease in internal mobility is consistent with most of contacts occurring in the household during the outbreak period of note the strict social distancing measures implemented in wuhan and shanghai did not entirely zero out contacts in the workplace as essential workers continued to perform their activities as observed in our data see supplementary materials section 35the estimated mixing patterns are based on self-reported contacts that can thus be affected by various biases in particular reported contacts for the baseline period in wuhan may be prone to recall bias since contacts were assessed retrospectively further due to retrospective nature of the baseline survey in wuhan we were unable to account for the lower number of contacts during weekends the more complete data from shanghai did not suffer recall bias and allowed us to weight contacts for weekdays and weekends  sensitivity analyses suggest that this has little impact on results supplementary materials section 83 another possible bias is that survey participants may have felt pressure to minimize reported contacts occurring during the outbreak given that social distancing was in place and strictly enforced by the government even if the anonymity and confidentiality of the survey were emphasized however results are robust to inflating reported contacts outside of the home several fold suggesting that these compliance and social acceptability biases linked to the outbreak period do not affect our main findings supplementary materials section 82 another caveat is that in parallel to population-level social distancing measures case-based interventions were implemented and could have affect contacts including rapid isolation of confirmed and suspected cases and quarantine of close contacts for 14 days only a small portion of the population in the two study sites was affected by contact tracing and quarantine however thus having little to no effect on average contact patterns in the general populationnext to understand the interplay between social distancing interventions changes in human mixing patterns and outbreak dynamics we need to consider potential age differences in susceptibility to infection this is currently a topic of debate as little information on the age profile of asymptomatic cases is available 9 10 to this aim we analyzed covid-19 contact tracing information gleaned from detailed epidemiological field investigations conducted by the hunan cdc supplementary materials section 5 briefly all close contacts of covid-19 cases reported in hunan province were placed under medical observation for 14 days and were tested using real-time rt-pcr those who tested positive were considered as sars-cov-2 infections we estimated the odd ratios or for a contact of a certain age group to be infected relative to a reference age group we performed generalized linear mixed model regression to account for clustering and potential correlation structure of contacts exposed to the same index case eg in the household we included age group and gender of a contact type of contact and whether the contact traveled to hubeiwuhan as regression covariates see supplementary materials section 5 we found that susceptibility to sars-cov2 infection increased with age young individuals aged 0-14 years had a lower risk of infection than individual aged 15-64 years or034 95ci 024-049 p-value00001 in contrast older individuals aged 65 years and over had a higher risk of infection than adults 15-64 years or147 95ci 112-192 p-value0005 these findings are in contrast with a previous study in shenzhen where susceptibility to infection did not change with age 9next we explore how our data can inform control strategies for covid-19 a key parameter regulating the dynamics of an epidemic is the basic reproduction number r0 which corresponds to the average number of secondary cases generated by an index case in a fully susceptible population we estimated the impact of interventions on r0 relying on our age-specific estimates of susceptibility to infection and contact patterns before and during interventions we used the next generation matrix approach to quantify changes in r0 11 supplementary materials section 6 additionally to illustrate the impact of age-mixing patterns on the dynamics of the epidemic we developed a simple sir model of sars-cov-2 transmission supplementary materials section 6 in the model the population is divided into three epidemiological categories susceptible infectious and removed either recovered or deceased individuals stratified by 14 age groups susceptible individuals can become infectious after contact with an infectious individual according to the estimated age-specific susceptibility to infection the rate at which contacts occur is determined by the estimated mixing patterns of each age group the mean time interval between two consecutive generations of cases was taken to be 51 days assuming it aligns with the mean of the serial interval reported by zhang et al 3in the early phases of covid-19 spread in wuhan before interventions were put in place r0 values were estimated to range between 20 and 35 1218 in this analysis we extended this range from 1 to 4 for the baseline period ie before interventions we find that the considerable changes of mixing patterns observed in wuhan and shanghai during the social distancing period led to a drastic decrease in r0 fig 2 when we consider contact matrices representing the outbreak period keeping the same baseline disease transmissibility as in the pre-intervention period the reproductive number drops well below the epidemic threshold in wuhan fig 2a and shanghai fig 2b this finding is robust to relaxing assumptions about age differences in susceptibility to infection the epidemic is still well controlled if sars-cov-2 infection is assumed to be equally likely in all age groups fig 2 a and b we also performed sensitivity analyses regarding possible recall and compliance biases of self-reported contacts as well as the definition of contact ie considering only contacts lasting more than 5 min the results are consistent with those reported here see supplementary materials section 8in an uncontrolled epidemic without intervention measures travel restrictions or spontaneous behavioral responses of the population and for r0 in the range 2-3 we estimate the mean infection attack rate to be in the range 53-92 after a year of sars-cov-2 circulation with slight variation between wuhan fig 2c and shanghai fig 2d these estimates should be considered as an upper bound of the infection attack rate as they are based on a compartmental model that does not account for high clustering of contacts eg repeated contacts among household members if we consider a scenario where social distancing measures are implemented early on as the new virus emerges the estimated r0 remains under the epidemic threshold and thus the epidemic cannot take off in either location furthermore we estimate that the magnitude of interventions implemented in wuhan and shanghai would have been enough to block transmission for an r0 before the interventions up to 6 in wuhan and 78 in shanghainext we use the model to estimate the impact of preemptive mass school closure we considered two different contact pattern scenarios based on data from shanghai contacts estimated during vacations period 7 and contacts estimated during regular weekdays after all contacts occurring in school settings have been removed 7 both scenarios represent a simplification of a school closure strategy in fact school closures in response to the covid-19 pandemic in china have entailed interruption of all educational on-site services however mixing patterns measured during school vacations indicate that a fraction of children still attend additional educational activities as typical in chinese cities on the other hand when removing all contacts in the school setting we do not consider potential trickle down effects on the mixing patterns of other age groups for instance parents may need to leave work to take care of school-age children our modeling approach indicates that limiting contact patterns to those observed during vacations would interrupt transmission for baseline r0 up to 15 fig 3 a and c removing all school contacts would do the same for baseline r0 up to 12 if we apply these interventions to a covid-19 scenario assuming a baseline r0 of 2 - 35 we can achieve a noticeable decrease in infection attack rate and peak incidence and a delay in the epidemic but transmission is not interrupted fig 3 b and d for instance for baseline r025 and assuming a vacation mixing pattern the mean peak daily incidence is reduced by about 64 in the corresponding scenario where school contacts are removed we estimate a reduction of about 42 overall school-based closure policies are not sufficient to entirely prevent a covid-19 outbreak but they can impact disease dynamics and hence hospital surge capacity it is important to stress that individuals aged 5-19 years in shanghai represent 95 of the population 19 markedly lower than the mean in china 168 19 and other countries including western countries eg 197 in the us 20the results of this study should be considered in the light of the following limitations in our simulation model we estimated the effect of social distancing alone combining social distancing with other interventions would have a synergistic effect to even further reduce transmission it is likely that population wide social distancing case-based strategies and decontamination efforts all contributed to achieve control in wuhan and shanghai and their effect is difficult to separate out in retrospective observational studies our estimates of age differences in susceptibility to infection are based on active testing of 7375 contacts of 136 confirmed index cases these data suffer from the usual difficulties inherent to the reconstruction of epidemiological links and detection of index cases contact data are useful but seroepidemiology studies will be essential to fully resolve population susceptibility profiles to sars-cov-2 infection and disease while the age patterns of contacts were similar in the two study locations during the covid-19 outbreak period these patterns may not be fully representative of other locations in china and abroad where social distancing measures may differ as reliable estimates of the contribution of asymptomatic sars-cov-2 infections to transmission are still lacking we did not explicitly model differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals we considered a serial interval of 51 days 3 based on a prior estimate from china at a time when case-based and contact tracing interventions measures were in place which tends to shorten the interval between successive cases however this choice does not affect the estimated changes in reproduction number between the baseline and outbreak periods modeling results may underestimate the effect of social distancing interventions as our results concentrate on number of contacts and ignore the type of social interactions eg increased distance between individuals while in contact or use of face mask which may have changed due increased awareness of the population 21 22 finally it is worth noting that our school closure simulations are not meant to formulate a full intervention strategy which would require identification of epidemic triggers to initiate closures and evaluation of different durations of intervention 6 nonetheless our modeling exercise provides an indication of the possible impact of a nation-wide preemptive strategy on the infection attack rate and peak incidence to generalize these findings to other contexts location-specific age-mixing patterns and population structures should be considered most importantly perhaps strict lockdown strategies of the kind implemented in wuhan shanghai and in other regions of the world are extremely disruptive economically and mentally and more targeted approaches to block transmission are preferable in the long run we do not necessarily endorse blunt lockdown policies here merely we describe their impact on covid-19 transmission based on the chinese experienceour study provides evidence that the interventions put in place in wuhan and shanghai and the resulting changes in human behavior drastically decreased daily contacts essentially reducing them to household interactions this leads to a dramatic reduction of sars-cov-2 transmission as lockdown measures are put in place in other locations human mixing patterns in the outbreak period could be captured by data on within-household contacts which are available for several countries around the world 57 2325 moving forward it will be particularly important to design targeted strategies for long-term control of covid-19 including school- and work-based control strategies along with large scale testing and contact tracing 2628 research should concentrate on refining age-specific estimates of susceptibility to infection disease and infectiousness which are instrumental to evaluating the impact of these strategiesthe new corona virus or covid-19 has become a pandemic with accelerating incidence since this disease has been confirmed to have interhuman transmission the chinese government actively adopted lockdown measures to cut off the channels of infection for virus prevention and control the crisis governance measures include ensuring resident registration before people leave their houses as well as the closing down of the roads railways and public transports consequently lockdown measures have been adopted by several countries and regions 12 in late february the italian government took lockdown measures to cope with the spread of the virus in some north italian areas 3to date the measures exhibited their effect on infection prevention and control showing an obvious decrease in coronavirus cases in mainland china however as a crisis governance measure the widespread lockdown inevitably imposed psychological effects on social emotions 4 particularly anxiety in fact existing studies have demonstrated the increase in social anxiety in pandemic areas 567 which might lead to riots violence 8910 so do these crisis governance measures really have an impact on social emotions in pandemic regions what are the mechanisms underlying this processwithin the theory of the stimulus-organism-response sor the present study addressed the psychological effect of lockdown measures in a pandemic area from the perspective of psychological distancing the lockdown measures restricted traffic and outdoor activities by that the individuals perceived spatial distancing toward the disease increased viewing the disease as a high-level construal 11 conversely measures such as movement restriction prolonged home-stay which subsequently leaded to anxiety and depression 12 not only the psychological effect of lockdown measures regarding responses toward covid-19 remains unclear but also there is no current study investigating the mechanisms underlying certain processes therefore this study will add empirical evidence regarding the psychological effect of the lockdown measures from the governmental level to the individual-level importantly crisis governance measures could be an approach to buffer the effect of a pandemic on social emotions also although numerous studies have confirmed the detrimental effects of pandemic diseases on anxiety there is no study that revealed the mechanisms underlying this process based on the sor theory this study will propose a conceptual model to explain how citizens evaluate a pandemic from the perspective of psychological distancing and why lockdown buffers the social anxiety caused by covid-19threats such as the rapidly spreading virus often lead people to feel discomfort and tension 1516 in fact pandemic diseases were found to be associated with high-level anxiety for example the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars caused anxiety and social problems in several countries 567 similarly the influenza h1n1 also known as swine flu resulted in considerable public anxiety in 2009 especially after who declared it as a pandemic 17 a singapore study also demonstrated the detrimental effect of swine flu on public anxiety in which people reported high level of anxiety 18 in line with that another uk study confirmed that people who read or received the governments swine flu leaflet reported high levels of anxiety 6 these studies provide evidence on public anxiety caused by pandemics in fact the feelings of anxiety are highly associated with individuals perceived severity 19 subsequently people may perceive high levels of infection risk when there is an increasing number of covid-19 new cases nearby thus resulting in increased social anxiety therefore we hypothesize thatalthough numerous studies tested social anxiety caused by pandemics the mechanisms underlying certain processes is still unclear previous studies suggested that the perceived distance toward the disease had an impact on subjects emotions 1120 psychological distancing is the subjective perception between self and others such as people future events or possibility therefore the individuals perceived psychological distanceing between the disease and themselves affect their psychological outcomes such as anxiety this is in line with the construal level theory 2122 which claims that people develop different psychological representations of a disease based on their perceived mental distance towards it 11 in terms of the far psychological distance people tend to view objects as in ways of high-level construal conversely for the close psychological distancing a low-level construal is employed as the concept with concrete specific and contextualized features 2021 therefore when people perceive a high infectious risk toward a disease their psychological distance decreases which in turn leads to a low-level construalthe existing research found that distance between people and the affected place could predict the levels of anxiety caused by an infectious virus 723 in particular medical students at the affected hospital reported higher anxiety than non-medical students of the same university 7 comparably students at another university situated 20 km away from the affected hospital reported the lowest level of anxietywhen people perceived the virus at a remote distance they tend to construe the virus at a high level with less emotional responses thus exhibiting lower levels of anxiety conversely when people perceived the virus at a nearby distance they tend to be irrational with more emotional responses which in turn exhibit higher levels of anxiety given the different numbers of new covid-19 cases across provinces in china people might become more anxious if their province reports a comparatively larger number of new covid-19 cases than other provinces the reason might be that individuals perceive a larger number of new cases in nearby provinces as a higher possibility of being infected by covid-19 therefore we propose thatlockdown measures have been adopted to contain infectious diseases in previous outbreaks in 2015 the sierra leone government ordered its citizens to remain indoors for three days for virus prevention and control these measures were thought to have played an important role in the ebola elimination 24252627 in china there are two main aspects of lockdown measures in the prevention and control of covid-19 traffic control and household quarantine advice since the local governments in china held different policies the extent of lockdown measures also differed among provinces although the lockdown showed its impact on covid-19 control 192829 its psychological effect is still unclear the literature is very sparse in terms of the relationship between lockdown measures and social anxiety in fact people are intrinsically motivated to flee when they face threats which also results in anxiety 30 one research has demonstrated that prolonged homestays contribute to anxiety and depression 12 therefore people might have perceived an anxious feeling due to the movement restriction after lockdown consequently people in provinces with a high level of lockdown measures may report higher levels of anxiety than people under low levels of lockdown measures in this perspective lockdown may increase the anxiety level of people in provinces under a serious covid-19 situation thus we hypothesize thaton the other hand people may feel less anxious when lockdown cuts off virus transmission and reduces the possibility of infection the research found that traffic control is an effective way to cut off the virus transmission limiting the spread of infection 3132 studies also demonstrated that household quarantine significantly limits the spread of infectious disease 333435 after lockdown measures the possibility of covid-19 infection will be reduced due to the decreased interpersonal interaction therefore lockdown measures may buffer the detrimental effect of the pandemic severity resulting in the reduction of social anxiety thus we propose that todorov et al 2007 proposed that infection probability also changes the individuals psychological distance therefore when the infection possibility is perceived as low people might show an increase in subjective perception toward spatial distancing regarding covid-19 in other words the far distance would lower the anxiety 2035 thus since lockdown measures cut off the interpersonal contact people in provinces with high-level lockdown measures may perceive covid-19 as a remote disease which may protect them from anxiety thus we propose thatthere were 1847 participants enrolled in the present study their age ranged from 1866 years the mean age is 3064  919 years seven hundred sixty-seven of them were males their demographic information is represented in table 1 the research protocol was approved by the ethics committee of fuzhou university all participants were recruited by a widely used social platform ie wechat by online fliers which direct them to the online survey website each of them was first informed about the research online and they submitted the informed consent before starting the research all participants completed the survey within 10 min on 7 february 2020the psychological distancing was assessed by two items with statements please indicate how far do you feel a sense of distance between you and the coronavirus and please indicate how far do you feel a sense of distance between you and the confirmed people 20 each item was responded to using a five-point scale 1extremely near 9extremely remote the cronbachs alpha was 090anxiety was measured by a short version of the state anxiety scale which has been widely used in previous research 36 the scale included six items such as calm tense upset relaxed content and worry each item was responded to using a seven-point scale ranging from 1never to 7always the cronbachs alpha was 073the severity of the pandemic was measured by the number of newly confirmed covid-19 cases the data were collected by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china the present study used the data on the day the survey was taken the extent of lockdown measures was measured using the traffic control index collected from the baidu migration big data databaseqianxibaiducom we collected big data of migration for 14 days from chunjie chinese lunar new year to the day before the survey was taken for both 2019 and 2020 the extent of the lockdown measures was evaluated by comparing the averaged migration index difference between 20192020 a high difference value indicated that the local government adopted comparably strict lockdown measures within the provincetable 1 shows statistics regarding demographics pandemic severity lockdown psychological distancing and anxiety according to the correlations the severity of the pandemic had a negative correlation with psychological distancing r  014 p  0001 and a positive correlation with anxiety r  007 p  0004 lockdown had a negative correlation with anxiety r  010 p  0001 and was positively associated to psychological distancing r  010 p  0001 psychological distancing had a negative correlation with anxiety r  017 p  0001this study conducted a hierarchical linear model in which regions as a cluster psychological distancing and anxiety were taken as within-level variables and pandemic severity as the between-level variable this study employed model 1 with anxiety as the dependent variable and demographic variables as control variables next the pandemic severity was added in model 2 subsequently psychological distancing was included with either a fixed effect model 3 and random effect model 4 respectively last a mediation model was developed to estimate the mediating effect of psychological distance between pandemic severity and anxiety in model 5as shown in table 2 the results of model 1 showed that females reported higher levels of anxiety compared to males b  024 se  005 p  0001 similarly highly educated people reported higher anxiety than low-educated people b  007 se  003 p  003 however neither age nor monthly income significantly predicted anxiety in the presented sample furthermore in model 2 pandemic severity positively predicted anxiety b  007 se  001 p  0001 r2  004 indicating that people in the provinces with a larger number of new cases perceived a higher level of anxiety which is consistent with h1 in model 3 we found that psychological distancing negatively predicted anxiety b  017 se  002 p  0001 r2  003 by a fixed-effect approach after conducting a random effect model psychological distancing consistently predicted anxiety b  017 se  003 p  0001 r2  003 in model 4 lastly in model 5a and 5b we found that psychological distancing served as a mediator explaining the route from pandemic severity at the province-level to anxiety at the individual-level random effect size  002 se  0004 p  0001 as h2 hypothesized the results suggested that the pandemic severity impacted anxiety through psychological distancing in order to test the moderation effect of the lockdown we first conducted model 6 with lockdown as the predictor next the interaction item of the lockdown and pandemic severity was included in model 7 subsequently we developed model 8 with psychological distance as the dependent variable and lockdown and pandemic severity as independent variables further an interaction item of lockdown and pandemic severity was included in model 9 last a cross-level moderated mediation effect of lockdown was conducted model 10 as shown in table 3 pandemic severity consistently predicted anxiety b  004 se  001 p  0003 in model 6 moreover lockdown also negatively predicted anxiety b  008 se  004 p  0056 indicating that lockdown reduced social anxiety in pandemic regions therefore our results support h4 instead of h3in model 7 lockdown interacted with pandemic severity to predict anxiety b  011 se  005 p  0025 r2  0001 subsequently the results of a simple slope analysis showed that pandemic severity positively predicted anxiety in provinces with low levels of lockdown b  008 se  039 p  0036 than that in provinces with high levels of lockdown b  023 se  014 p  009 figure 2a in addition lockdown consistently predicted psychological distancing in model 8 b  008 se  004 p  0037 subsequently the result also demonstrated the mediation effect of psychological distancing on the relationship between lockdown and anxiety random effect size  0013 se  0007 p  0024 furthermore the interaction of lockdown and pandemic severity positively predicted psychological distancing b  010 se  004 p  0027 the results of a simple slope analysis showed the negative prediction of the pandemic severity on psychological distancing in provinces with low levels of lockdown b  008 se  004 p  0038 compared to provinces with high levels of lockdown b  005 se  009 p  0555 figure 2blastly the results of the cross-level moderated mediation model showed that lockdown buffered the detrimental effect of pandemic severity on anxiety through psychological distancing regulations specifically the mediation effect of psychological distancing on the relationship between pandemic severity and anxiety was not significant b  001 se  002 p  0557 in provinces with high-level lockdown but was significant in provinces with low-level lockdown b  002 se  001 p  0047although the existing research demonstrated the detrimental effect of the pandemic on individuals mental health the mechanism underlying this process was still unclear given the theory of the sor model environmental factors could affect individuals reactions eg anxiety through the organismic variable eg psychological distance 1314 our results provide evidence that both pandemic severity and lockdown serve as environmental factors at the regional level which changed the perception of psychological distancing at a personal level thus increasing the individuals anxiety this supported and extended the sor model in a pandemic study in which environmental variables come from the regional level and organismic and response variables come from individual levelsin addition environmental factors could also interact to affect individuals psychological variables the pandemic has been regarded as a detrimental factor that reduces the psychological distance toward covid-19 thus negatively predicting anxiety however as discussed before lockdown reduced psychological distancing which in turn relieved anxiety 112036 importantly our findings suggested that the crisis governance measures eg lockdown serves as an environmental factor that can buffer the effect of other environmental factors eg pandemic thus affecting on the individuals psychological variables therefore crisis governance measures could play an important role in both pandemic control and the publics mental health this study confirmed the association between regional pandemic intensity and individuals anxiety in china which is consistent with other results regarding pandemic and anxiety 19 moreover psychological distancing was proven to serve as a mediator in the relationship between pandemic severity and social anxiety it is consistent with previous studies which reported that peoples psychological distance toward disease impacts their responses related to the disease 711 not only that but it also explains the mechanism of how the pandemic affects social emotionsit is noteworthy that the present sample provided empirical evidence of the psychological effect of lockdown measures using a national sample the result showed that lockdown not only negatively predicted individuals anxiety but also buffered social anxieties against the detrimental impacts of the pandemic given the differential governance across provinces in china we found that lockdown in intensive pandemic regions reduced individuals anxiety levels more importantly our findings suggested the buffer effect of lockdown in pandemic regions in china people residing in lockdown regions were required to stay at home which increased social distancing and reduced the possibility of infection as mentioned before when the possibility decreased psychological distancing increased 20 consistent with that we confirmed that lockdown predicted low levels of anxiety in ways of increasing psychological distancing this suggested that the crisis governance measures could affect peoples cognition and consequently their emotions therefore the lockdown measure served as a critical function for protecting people against the biological and psychological virus hence the measures tended to increase psychological distancing towards covid-19 which helped people cope with the threat altogether our findings on lockdown and psychological distancing not only provided direct evidence about whether lockdown has psychological effects in pandemic regions or not but it also carried important implications for understanding why lockdown buffered social anxiety caused by covid-19social psychology plays an important role in epidemic governance from the social psychology perspective the direct causation of behavior is the primary function of emotion 3738 people in a strong state of psychological stress will make a variety of irrational behavior and even coupled with the impact of events to cause secondary disasters the present study built a conceptual model based on the sor model in which lockdown interacted with pandemic severity to predict psychological distancing and thereby result in social anxiety in addition the psychological effects of the lockdown play an important role in crisis governance our results revealed that pandemic severity negatively predicted anxiety in provinces with low levels of lockdown compared to the provinces with high levels of lockdown therefore when we take the lockdown measures region-specific situations and environmental risks should be considered in the society under risk the crisis governance measures could also induce other potential risks namely the risk of operation failure regardless of whether the society is risk or safety-oriented specifically the governments crisis governance ie institutionalization of risk also could become a new risk to the society ie institutionalized risk 39 consequently there might be other psychological effects that could hurt social stability especially in other countries therefore when we take action to contain the pandemic risk social psychology should be taken seriously to avoid the risk of human judgmental errorsin response to major public health events a positive social mentality helps work together to overcome the epidemic the breeding and spreading of negative emotion conversely posed severe challenges to social governance in public emergencies our research discovered the interaction between lockdown and pandemic severity on social anxiety through psychological distancing this result offers several practical implications for both governors and citizens the lockdown could be an effective measure to slow down the virus spread however peoples lives are greatly affected by this measure so governors should realize that it could also be an extreme measure that could trigger social anxiety where the emotional changes of individuals and groups should not be neglected as it may lead to successive economic and social problems considering the psychological mechanism governors should take measures to reduce psychological distancing collecting and publishing accurate information about pandemic severity enhancing personal prevention and control measures and looking into cognitive and emotional changes of individuals and groups at each node based on the main laws regarding the evolution of emergencies furthermore for crisis governance emergency living and medical supplies should not be neglected before lockdown the citizens need to stay calm learn about the infectious disease obey the government guidelines and take self-protection procedures at homethe current research has several limitations first this study employed a cross-sectional design although the sample size for this research is relatively large it is impossible to determine the causal inference as well as whether people under lockdown measures in the long-term show similar results moreover the participants finished their online survey and were compensated after the study this may lead to sampling bias due to internet access issues besides their internal motivation and emotion may be affected by the compensation of this study further longitudinal studies should be conducted as a replication of this research to address this issuesecond the present study evaluated psychological variables relying solely on self-reported measurements although these inventories are widely used in previous studies self-reported measurements may run the risk of responses being influenced by participants moods third even though lockdown is a complicated procedure this research only considered two main aspects of lockdowntraffic control and household quarantine advicein china in fact the lockdown measures include several aspects which were also conducted differently across countries in particular lockdown measures are the compulsory policy in most countries but not in all countries for example daegu the fourth largest city of korea has been declared as a special management zone due to the outbreak of corona virus however the korean government did not lockdown the city or citizens except for the facilities that were related to the outbreak 40 there should be a difference between the two policies in terms of their psychological effects therefore other aspects of the lockdown procedure need to be examined and fulfilled in future operationsforth since china is a collectivistic society the cultural aspect might have played a factor that impacted the relationship between lockdown and anxiety as well as the moderating effect of lockdown this may restrict the generalization of the findings in this paper therefore future studies should consider cultural aspects of the psychological effects during the lockdown procedure and repeat our research in other countries with different cultural backgroundsin conclusion this study provided evidence that the lockdown measures buffered anxiety against the detrimental effect of covid-19 more importantly psychological distancing explained why a pandemic impacts peoples anxiety and how lockdown moderates the relationship between pandemic severity and anxiety in addition considering that some countries are starting to adopt similar measures this study suggests to consider the psychological effects of crisis governance measures in pandemic regions given that anxiety is often caused by uncertainty an objective description of the pandemic by the public government may minimize the negative psychological effects of the lockdown policyas the coronavirus disease ravages the world families have cancelled weddings countries have closed their borders and the number of individuals applying for unemployment benefits have skyrocketed 13 though there is much unknown about the virus one public health measure that is being recommended by the centers for disease control is containment through social distancing 4 5 though the centers for disease control is recommending this for large groups and gatherings there is a larger mass media discussion regarding the ethics of staying home 1 3 many are arguing that it ones duty to protect the immunocompromised and the elderly during this crisis and social distancing may be the only way to save lives in the face of a great unknown however this should also open the door to a thoughtful discussion about those who could reap the unintended consequences of social distancing after the virus has been slowed or mitigated if the moral message passed on during this time continues to be that one should be willing to engage in social distancing as benevolent behavior racially marginalized communities could be unmotivated to participate or have to reconcile with the consequences of forced participation due to the stigma that will follow them well after the pandemic has been addressedsuppose there are a black employee and a white employee working at a largely populated company both have the same level of education salary and work experience both parties are also caring for elderly parents and have been given the option to socially distance themselves the white employee chooses to socially distance themselves and work from home because their priority is to not harm the loved ones in their proximity the black employee has more to think about they are concerned about the elderly but they are also concerned about their broader community the black employee could socially distance themselves to protect their parent as a caretaker but they are also concerned about their lack of visibility in the workplace contributing to negative stereotypes about black individuals such as stereotypes about laziness and sloth or having diminished productivity being attributed to their character 69 this employee also knows that if they continue to go to work it will put a loved ones life in danger but they are also concerned that if an evaluation of their performance occurs within even six months after this crisis the same benefit of the doubt that is given to another employee may not be afforded to them 10 they could also be concerned that if their workplace reopens and they choose to stay home that they could also incur harmful stereotypes about their work ethic both parties are concerned about their fellow man however the difference is that the perception of who is the most vulnerable is altered both parties races create a special type of freedom and bondagethe white employee can engage with their sense of national pride and benevolence freeing them from the concern of the consequences of that choice while the black employee is in bondage to that burden because of the potential consequences in the futurenext suppose there are two students who attend the same prestigious university both of the students are from unstable home environments and are required to return home to comply with social distancing policies they return home to engage in remote classes while also balancing the challenges of their home lives both students have a hard time retaining the information they learned in the remote classes both students are also given the opportunity to opt into a passfail system for their courses during this semesterleaving them with clean slates they are able to return to school in the fall and start the next step of their programs however both start to struggle in classes because their deficiencies from the previous semester are on full display the white studentrightfully understanding that they were victim to extenuating circumstancesgoes to their professor expresses that the coronavirus threw them into an unstable environment and that is why they are not performing well in class the black student however feels ashamed and is concerned about the new stereotype threat that has crept into their educational experience 6 9 10 they are aware that the professor could hold them to a different standard in spite of the virus but they also know that they have no chance at improvement if they do not speak up at all both are reaping very different consequences and burdens after it has passedwhat we actually see here are many short-sighted and worrisome assumptionsthe assumption of shared ethics based on income similar long-term goals and a shared sense of community benevolence for the white employee they could socially isolate themselves and bear the consequences of limited social interactions while aiding their country or choose to not socially isolate themselves and incur some broader societal shaming for the white economically disadvantaged student they have the opportunity to freely call back to the coronavirus as a time of hardship for their academics with minimal fear of stereotype threat and almost assured benefit of the doubt however for the black employee and student they may actually be in a lose-lose situation they could socially isolate themselves but could incur unforeseen consequences on themselves their families or a future black employee or student the employee could choose to not socially isolate themselves and incur the risk of being perceived as callous to the needs of the present vulnerable people in their liveswhile also carrying the aforementioned consequences for the student they could be perceived as unproductive if they ask for help if they call back to the coronavirus they could be viewed as insensitive for calling back to a national crisis as their academic undoing but if they say nothing they will not get the help that they need and where does that leave their choiceoften it is easy to forget that the american relationship with race and prejudice has long-term consequences that most did not expect when the usa codified the unequal treatment of black americans profiled the group as lacking in moral character and systemically disenfranchised them one could not have thought that there would be an instance where we need the entire nation to be motivated to socially isolate themselves as a way to protect the greater good however a consequence of the unethical treatment of black americans is the creation of two greater goods there is the greater good of benevolence to a more mainstream majority society and a greater good for a society that understands that when this has all ended they still will have to live under unfair conditions in this case whiteness has created and provided the freedom to worry about the immediate circumstances at hand however blackness has been subjugated into a duality of priorities they are not just worried about protecting the elderly the immunocompromised and themselves they are worried about protecting their own elderly immunocompromised children families and broader communitiesnot only from the coronavirus but also from life afterwardswe have to free everyone to participate in the best health practices for this crisis without saddling them with the consequences of stereotyping and unconscious bias this starts with understanding how deeply racially marginalized groups understand and move in the face of oppression it is not enough to just absorb that the united states has a racist past this is also not just about combating coronavirus disease this is an extension of the general stresses of being a black individual in the united states this cognitive calculus that black americans do on a regular basis just happen to intertwine with new social expectations of how we protect ourselves and those vulnerable to illness we need to be willing to examine our biases well before this crisis is over will we have selective memories about the impact of coronavirus disease when it is time to evaluate workplace promotions or educational progress or will we actually commit to affording everyone a global passfor some the option to socially isolate may seem like the most moral and responsible choice but this choice is nuanced and may require a larger sacrifice from racially marginalized populations what is interesting is that some forums have referred to fighting the coronavirus disease as analogous to needing a wartime-like willingness to cooperate what we also know is that even when black americans have engaged in a wartime-like willingness to cooperategladly and willingly entering literal wars on the behalf of the united states they were shunned when the crisis was over 11 history has consistently shown that compliance does not always bear fruit for racially marginalized groups this is not advocating for lack of sacrificesocial distancing requires sacrifice to protect those who are at risk for contracting coronavirus disease however this is a call to remember that sacrifice has come at a larger expense for some more than others and when this inevitably ends and business as usual resumes that should be rememberedcoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a new communicable disease caused by the new strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 1 the first outbreak reported was in december 2019 in wuhan china as pneumonia of unknown etiology linked to a seafood market exposure 2 on january 30 the world health organization who declared the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern pheic and a pandemic on march 11 3the first case reported in saudi arabia was on march 7 at that time increasing numbers were seen all over the world with the majority of confirmed cases currently in the united states brazil and russia 4 after reporting the first case in saudi arabia the government response was swift and immediate started by launching a social media campaign encouraging people to stay at home and to follow the ministry of health instructions 5 on march 23 a lockdown was imposed on mecca medina and riyadh with travel restrictions all over the country and within the next ten days the curfew was extended to 24-hour 6the fast climbing of cases of covid-19 all over the world and the rapid changes in people daily living have left people alarmed and frightened historically there have been multiple outbreaks over the years such as the sars epidemic when moderate to severe post-traumatic-stress symptoms were reported in the highly affected areas 7 during the swine flu influenza a h1n1 outbreak a study showed that 96 and 329 of the general population were either very or moderately worried about the possibility of being infected respectively 8 ebola mers and sars epidemics all showed an impact on mental health that includes depression and even substance abuse has been reported 9 during the mers outbreak in jeddah western saudi arabia a survey reported a significant association between the level of anxiety and avoiding behaviors 10 in the current pandemic a recent study carried out in china concerning covid-19 psychological impact revealed that 538 of respondents are showing moderate to severe psychological impact 165 and 288 reported moderate to high depressive or anxiety symptoms respectfully and 81 moderate to high levels of stress were reported 11 anxiety and depression symptoms showed no decline four weeks after the covid-19 pandemic 12to the best of our knowledge there are no published studies assessing the general population response to the emerging coronavirus infections in saudi arabia therefore this study aims to measure the degree of psychological responses resulted from the covid-19 pandemic on saudi arabias general populationthis study followed a cross-sectional design to assess the general populations psychological impact on the covid19 pandemic at the time of curfew and lockdown in the kingdom of saudi arabia we used an online-based questionnaire distributed through social media apps like whatsapp and twitter participants were encouraged to distribute the survey physical distribution was not feasible due to the lockdown in the kingdom participants have received the survey request through whatsapps groups of colleagues family or friends in another platform twitter they received tweets or messages via different accounts in saudi arabia these messages showed the study purpose link and asked for participation the survey was titled psychological impact in saudi arabia after clicking on the link of the survey a cover page showing the studys title purpose and needed time for completion showed up if they agreed to participate they were asked to click start the survey and then they start answering the survey questionsas mentioned earlier the survey was distributed during a period of curfew and practices of socialphysicaldistancing were promoted by the saudi ministry of health therefore we followed an online data collection technique the survey was done online by using a common platform google survey google llc mountain view california usa the study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of qassim university no1908-01 all participants were informed about study purposes and provided informed consent data were kept confidential and were not disclosed unless for study purposes data collected was conducted over four days april 25 april 2020 after cases in saudi arabia reached one thousand and while curfew and social distancing measures were implemented by health authorities the sample size was calculated using epi info 7 centers for disease control and prevention cdc atlanta georgia usa the calculated sample size was 1149 based on the assumption of anticipated  frequency p of 538 of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe in previous studies5 margin of error confidence interval of 95 and a design effect of 3 as we followed non-probability sampling 11the survey developed based on a recent study conducted in 194 cities in china 11 the adopted questionnaire covers several aspects of participant sociodemographic knowledge concerns psychological impact and mental health status sociodemographic variables of participants included gender age education residential place in the preceding 14 days marital status employment status if they work in the medical field or one of their relatives monthly household income in saudi riyal parental status household size and type moreover participants were asked about physical symptoms they experienced in the preceding 14 days including fever chills headache myalgia dry cough difficulty in breathing dizziness nasal congestion sore throat diarrhea and others furthermore they were required to rate their physical health status 1 to 5 where 1 indicates poor health status and self-report any history of chronic medical or psychiatric illnesses if they existed the survey included parts on health service utilization in the preceding 14 days included consultation with a doctor in the clinic admission to the hospital being quarantined or isolated by health authorities and being tested for covid-19 contact history variables included close contact with an individual with confirmed covid-19 indirect contact with an individual with confirmed covid-19 and contact with an individual with suspected covid-19 case infected substance or surfacesthe second part of the survey covered the participants knowledge and concerns about covid-19 and it included aspects related to the routes of transmission of sars-cov-2 level of confidence in covid-19 diagnostic tests level of satisfaction of health information about covid-19 if following up the trending news of cases and death in the country and potential treatment for covid-19 infection participants were asked to identify their source of information based on the provided list the actual number of confirmed cases of covid-19 and deaths in the country on the day of data collection concern about covid-19 included self and other relatives contracted sars-cov-2 perceived susceptibility to infection and survival if infectedthe third part covers precautionary measures against sars-cov-2 including avoidance of sharing of utensils during meals and handshaking cough etiquette covering mouth when coughing and sneezing hand hygiene wearing a mask regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms and if applying social distancing measures no handshaking and keeping a distance of one meter to assess their compliance with social distancing instruction they were asked the average number of hours staying at home per day to minimize the risk of contracting the infection during the last 14 days they were given certain statements and asked to rate their opinions on whether they felt too much unnecessary worry had been made about the covid-19 pandemicthe last part of the survey assessed the psychological impact of covid-19 using the impact of event scale-revised ies-r and depression anxiety and stress scale dass-21 both scales used previously in assessing psychological impact related to sars and covid-19 1113 the ies-r is an easily self-administered questionnaire that has been translated and validated in arabic speakers to assess the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd after traumatic event

provided when necessary in order to proceed and minimize missed data descriptive analyses were conducted for sociodemographic characteristics health statusservice utilization variables symptom profile contact history knowledge and concerns and precautionary measures the results of these analyses were presented using frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and means and standard deviations for continuous variables using the total sample n  1160 as the base the psychological burden of the covid-19 pandemic was measured using scores on the ies-r and the three subscales of the dass results presented in means and standard deviation univariate analyses to determine the presence and strength of associations between individual variables and scores on each of the four scales ies-r dass-stress dass-anxiety and dass-depression were carried out using linear regressions all tests of associations were carried out at a level of significance of 005 and 95 confidence intervalwith

 the majority of them believe that transmission of the disease is through exposure to air droplets released by an infected person via sneezing and coughing and direct contact 966 similarly the majority of them were very 306 or extremely 444 confident about the effectiveness of the methods used in diagnosing the disease and a total of 787 were veryextremely satisfied with the amount of information available on the diseaseon probing further to understand the sources of information for the participants the majority sourced their information from the saudi ministry of health 872 the world health organization 409 and non-official social media applications and platforms such as whatsapp twitter youtube etc 403 across all the information sources participants who sourced their information from the world health organization were significantly more likely to have worse scores across both the ies-r b  260 95 ci 078 to 443 and dass stress b  306 95 ci 177 to 435 anxiety b  137 95 ci 040 to 233 and depression b  238 95 ci 115 to 362 subscales relying on local news was significantly associated with lower scores on the dass-anxiety b  106 95 ci -210 to 002 all other information sources had no significant associations with the scores on either the ies-r or dassonly 15 of the total population have had a relative diagnosed with covid-19 when asked about their perceivability of contracting sars-cov-2 during the current outbreak the majority believed they had lower chances of being infected with 416 saying it was not likely and another 239 believed it was only slightly likely however if infected the majority believed their chances of recovering was very likely 331 or extremely likely 434 having relatives who have tested positive for covid-19 or being diagnosed with the disease had no significant impact on the scores on the ies-r and dass participants who believed they have a slight chance of recovering if they should contract covid-19 were significantly more likely to have higher scores across all the scales - ies-r and dass stress anxiety and depression similarly those who believed they were very likely to have the disease were more likely to have higher scores across all the scales ies-r b  981 95 ci 580 to 1383 dass-stress b  941 95 ci 660 to 1222 dass-anxiety b  690 95 ci 480 to 900 and dass-depression b  954 95 ci 685 to 1222 also participants were asked what they thought about the statement i feel that there is much unnecessary worrying regarding covid-19 the majority of them disagreed that there is much unnecessary worrying regarding the disease 715 however those who strongly disagreed were significantly more likely to have higher scores on the stress subscale of the dass b  267 95 ci 017516some of the participants had had indirect contact with someone diagnosed with covid-19 05 or direct contact with someone diagnosed with the disease 02 having direct or indirect contact with a diagnosed case of covid-19 had no significant association with ies-r and dass scores table 5
 about 17 of the participants had had direct contact with someone suspected to have covid-19 and this group appeared to have significantly high scores on the anxiety b  439 95 ci 074 to 805 and depression b  627 95 ci 158 to 1096 subscales of the dass the majority of the participants did not have any contact history suggestive of contact with the infectious agent of covid-19 814 and this set

the coronavirus outbreak 564 table 5 another 381 were indoors for more than 12 h per day however the amount of time spent indoors intensity of self-isolation had no significant impact on scores on the ies-r and dass probing into how participants had protected themselves from covid-19 over the previous 14 days the majority of them had been washing and disinfecting their hands regularly 897 other measures adopted include avoiding handshakes 670 distancing themselves physically from others for at least one meter 589 avoiding the sharing of utensils during meals 234 and using face masks even when without any symptoms 169 also 72 of the respondents said they had not done anything specific to protect themselveswith regards to the psychological impact of these precautionary measures those who washed and disinfected their hands frequently were significantly associated with lower scores on the depression subscale of the dass b  243 95 ci -444 to 042 those who maintained at least one

assess the psychological impact of covid-19 pandemic on the general population of saudi arabia our results suggest that concerning the early psychological impact of the general public236 of respondents reported moderate or severe psychological impact of the outbreak and severe symptoms of stress were experienced by 137 which is similar to the 139 who experienced severe symptoms of anxiety and 164 who experienced severe symptoms of depression our findings are in line with previous findings of a study conducted during the pandemic in iran where it reported the level of severe anxiety to be 191 and another study in spain where it reported the level depression stress anxiety to be 99 78 116 respectively 18 19 contrary to the findings of our study a recently published study in china where 538 reported their psychological impact of the outbreak moderate or severe 165 and 28 reported depressive and anxiety symptoms ranged from moderate to severe while 81 reported moderate to severe stress levels 11 the lower prevalence in our study could be attributed to that in the early days of the outbreak only a few cases have been reported in saudi arabia with the majority of cases are imported from abroad and the lower perceived likelihood of being infected during the current outbreak as we found in this studyamong participants 117 worked in a medical field and 279 had a family member working in a medical field those participants had a higher score in the stress and anxiety and depression subscale and this is in agreement with previous studies published recently and during mers outbreak in saudi arabia and studies conducted during the current covid-19 pandemic in singapore and india 20 21 22 23in addition to that we found that females and students had higher scores across all dass subscales as was consistent with a previous study done in china 11 this could be attributed to the uncertainty of used methods in continuing the educational process after closing up the campuses and schools furthermore earning less than 5000 sar was significantly associated with higher scores on the ies-r the depression subscale the economic impact of the pandemic cannot be overlooked which had left families with lower-income fearing of losing their jobs and homes to mitigate this damage the saudi government has released several initiatives including offering free health care for everybody and financial incentives for the private sector 24respondents with poor self-rated health status found to have a greater psychological impact and poorer mental health compared to the majority of the respondents 866 who view their health status to be good or very good moreover the most reported physical symptom were headaches sore throat muscle pain symptomatic respondents had poorer psychological status when compared to non-symptomatic similarly this was seen in the study carried out in mainland china during the covid-19 pandemic 11 this may be explained by the fact that the novel coronavirus found to be more aggressive on people with comorbidities and below-optimal health status which may result in more psychological burden and excessive worry 25 people with mental disorders are also more susceptible to stress compared to the general public and such outbreaks can provoke relapses or even worsen the already existing psychological disorder 26 in our study participants with reported mental disorders 105 showed high scores on all dass and ier-s scales our finding is in alignment with a recent study comparing people with and without psychiatric illnesses during the current covid 19 pandemic where people with psychiatric illnesses were more likely to exhibit higher levels of ptsd depression anxiety and stress 27 this finding stresses the need to support this particular population especially during the lockdown where access to psychiatric services is difficult through expanding the telepsychiatry services and home delivery of medications besides that173 of the participants reported having a chronic disease which was associated with lower scores on the stress subscale which is inconsistent with the study conducted in the mainland china 11 within the two weeks preceding data collection 168 had visited hospitals for different reasons and they score high on anxiety subscale respondents who have been quarantined and tested for covid-19 show no significant association with any of the subscales and this might be explained by the assurance they received from the negative results of the screening and showing no symptoms during the quarantine periodoverall the majority of the respondents 95 showed an excellent level of knowledge on the mode of transmission of the coronavirus contact droplet which indicates a satisfactory level 85 of information about the disease being delivered to the general population those levels showed better rates compared to the study conducted in mainland china 11 the overwhelming majority of respondents indicated some level of confidence in available testing options however those with lesser degrees of confidence low moderate were likely to be associated with a higher level of depression anxiety stress and psychological impact as reported by wang et al 11 the current study shows the general population confidence in local health authorities as shown to be the dominant source of information on covid-19 related matters 88 followed by who and non-official news circulating social media platforms like whatsapp and twitter it worth noticing that our samples population was approached using those platform however the non-official sources were not the primary source of information this shows the importance of delivering timely evidence-based information by the official health authorities through all platforms respondents demonstrated high levels of application of evidence-based preventive measures ie hand hygiene and social distancing which indicate a sufficient level of information as discussed earliermoreover respondents display a high level of optimism in recovery in case they have the infection which is consistent with their age group and the fact that 80 of the infected population will have mild disease 3 similar to the finding of alnajjar et al an increase in perceived susceptibility to the infection was associated with higher psychological impact 28 besides that only 5 reported very high susceptibility of contracting the disease compared to 13 amid mers infection in jeddah sa 28hand hygiene and other precautionary measures were found to have protective psychological effects which is consistent with the finding reported in china during the earlier stages of the pandemic 11 on the contrary those who avoided sharing utensils showed a high ies-r score this could be attributed to the direct relation of utensils to the primary mode of transmission also using a protective mask regardless of the presence of the symptoms was associated with worse ies-r score in contrary to findings by a recent study where they found that mask-wearing was associated with lower levels of anxiety and depression 12when comparing our results to a previous study during the outbreak of influenza a h1n1 in saudi arabia about 61 of the population reported that they did not take mild or minimal precautions to prevent infection 29 there is an increase in using precautionary measures right now which can be attributed to social media campaigns that are focused on boosting public awareness and emphasizing the importance of wearing masks to prevent spreading of the virus in the community 30 moreover the saudi government adopted new regulations mandating masks wearing in public places 31the findings of this study emphasize the need for governments to adopt new strategies to improve psychological services for community and individuals level by focusing on delivering accurate evidence-based information to minimize the effect of fake news and to identify and support high-risk groups especially those with preexisting mental illness by expanding telepsychiatry services promoting mental wellness and psychological interventions nationwidelimitations of the study include the time of data collection where the outbreak in saudi arabia was at its early stage with reported cases less than two thousand which may have underestimated the psychological impact of the outbreak for the time-sensitivity of the outbreak and with a curfew in place we adopted a snowballing sampling strategy which is a non-probability sampling technique however we assumed a study design effect of 3 in the sample calculation to compensate for the used sampling technique oversampling of particular regions eg qassim region where we approached the initial sampled group and the limitations to reach less educated people and non-social media users led to less generalizable results also as a limitation of the study design the survey provides only a snapshot of psychological responses at a particular point in time and a longitudinal study is required to provide information on whether the observed impact will last for longer periods the self-reported psychological impact anxiety depression and stress may not adequately represent the mental health status assessed in an interview thus for the outcome to be determined prospective studies are necessary to provide more accurate data to support the need for focused public mental health strategies lastly the number of respondents who have been quarantined tested for covid-19 and had a contact history with infected persons was minimal and our result could not be generalized on them despite all the above limitations our study provides information about the immediate psychological responses of saudi arabias general population on the covid-19 pandemic it covers many factors that can influence mental health and provides a broader vision of the issue for future researches our results give an idea about the magnitude of the psychological burden on the community during such outbreaks and offer ways to minimize the impactthroughout the early stage covid-19 pandemic in saudi arabia the results showed that one-fourth of the general population experienced moderate to severe psychological impact working in the medical field females students and having a mental disorder are all associated with high scores in stress anxiety and depression subscales following specific precautionary measures appeared to have a protective effect on the individuals mental health our findings can be used to construct a psychological intervention directed toward the general and vulnerable population and to implement public mental health strategies in

did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectorsthe authors declare no conflict of interestthe novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic poses unprecedented challenges for communities and policy makers sars-cov-2 the virus that causes covid-19 is spread mainly through respiratory droplets and following contact with contaminated surfaces but limited knowledge of transmission dynamics make effective control of the disease tailored to specific communities challenging in the absence of an effective vaccine or treatment non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing measures which require one to maintain a 6-foot physical distance from non-household members are the only means of reducing the spread of covid-19 examples include closures of schools ceasing recreational activities cancellation of large public gatherings and shelter-in-place policies when these measures are implemented and followed daily counts of new covid-19 cases decrease flattening the curve1 the negative economic and societal consequences of social distancing warrant a dialing back of such policies when it is safe to do so however the effect of easing social distancing on the transmission of sars-cov-2 is unclear a set of indicators have been proposed by the current administration to guide communities on when they might consider easing rigorous mandated social distancing2 however these lagging indicators such as hospitals having the capacity to treat patients without crisis care are not ideal because once the number of new infections increases re-implementation of social distancing is not as effective as a mitigation option due to exponential growth in the case of transmissible infectious diseases such as covid-192 the ability to predict the effect of easing of social distancing is important to provide leading indicators for the right time to do this for a particular communityusing the best information available mathematical modeling of sars-cov-2 transmission dynamics allow scientists to forecast the effect of social distancing on the covid-19 pandemic in particular agent-based models provide a flexible and simulation-based method to better represent transmission dynamics in a complex system while other models are available including those providing predictions for every state in the us these models have several limitations that severely limit their generalizability37 for example they assume a closed population and ignore imported infections into the region do not consider imperfect adherence levels to the dynamic social distancing measures accurately and most do not incorporate the effect of limited testing capacity into the number of confirmed cases36we present an agent-based model that represents the social network and interactions among the people in a region considering local population demographics population density daily number of contacts in the absence of social distancing measures and adherence to social distancing measures our model referred to as covid-19 agent-based simulation model covam allows transmission from asymptomatic patients allows both community spread and transmission in the hospitals accounts for the imported cases at the early days of the pandemic and considers the possibility that some patients with mild to moderate symptoms never receive confirmatory testing for covid-19 this study demonstrates how covam can inform decision-making in three unique urban communities as to how social distancing measures might be adjusted to control the spread of sars-cov-2 and prevent a return to exponential growth in the number of covid-19 casesto maximize model generalizability we derived input parameter estimates from relevant results in peer-reviewed literature and used data from dane county wisconsin to calibrate several parameters table 1 covam has two different sets of parameters governing the transmissibility of sars-cov-2
number of close contacts per day without any intervention which represents the social network effect and is independent of the respiratory agent that is transmitted this parameter depends on population density and is estimated using literature and calibration as explained belowprobability that contagious exposed patients transmit sars-cov-2 to a susceptible individual when a close contact occursthe theoretical basic reproduction number r0 corresponding to these parameter estimates is 334 for dane county without any social distancing measures which was within the range of r0 values reported in the literature 15 to 651314 in particular a recent study based on the covid-19 epidemic in italy reported an r0 value of 347 for the early days of the epidemic15 similarly a recent study estimated the median r0 value for the wuhan region as 5716 therefore we concluded that our transmission parameters were within acceptable rangesthe effectiveness of social distancing measures depends on how closely a population follows such measures and the type of measures that are implemented at different times for example in the state of new york mass gathering restrictions started on march 12 2020 initial business closures were recommended on march 16 2020 educational facilities were closed on march 18 2020 and finally non-essential services closed along with a statewide stay-at-home order on march 22 20205 covam represents the adherence to social distancing explicitly by adjusting the number of contacts per person using cell-phone mobility data published by several sources1719 for instance the average number of daily close contacts per person in new york city nyc is estimated as 20 therefore a 70 adherence level reduces the number of such contacts to 6 per day per person leading to the slowing of transmission note that adherence to social distancing measures in covam is a proxy for several behaviors that reduce the transmissibility of sars-cov-2 including less frequent traveling keeping at least 6-feet distancing during person-to-person interactions as well as frequent hand washing and wearing masksseveral model input parameters involve a high level of certainty including disease transmission rates probability of testing for covid-19 and adherence to social distancing measures we used a simple calibration procedure using earlier surveillance data from dane county to fine-tune these parameters table 1 we used the reported data for covid-19 from dane county until may 15 2020 to test whether our initial parameter estimates replicated the number of cases accurately we did not change any of the parameters except the adherence to social distancing input after may 15 2020 we stopped adjusting adherence input as of may 15 2020 for nyc and may 26 2020 for dane county and milwaukee compared the models projections to actual number of cases after this dateinput parameters that are used for the computational experiments for dane county are presented in table 2 briefly we incorporated the population demographics in terms of age groups number of individuals who are imported into dane county from outside of dane county and adherence to social distancing measures the model has the ability to add different numbers of imported cases on a daily basis however we kept the number of initial imported cases the same to prevent overfitting we considered that adherence to social distancing measures in dane county dropped on may 14 2020 since wisconsin supreme court struck down the stay-at-home order of the governor in the state of wisconsin on this date20 we assumed that adherence to social distancing remains the same after may 21 2020we adapted covam to milwaukee to cross-validate our model and test its predictive accuracy our objective was to modify as few parameters as possible to prevent overfitting we used the same simulation settings as those in dane county except four changes table 2 1 epidemic was initiated with three exposed patients instead of one exposed patient 2 six imported cases were added to account for the larger population 3 population demographics using milwaukee population was adjusted and 4 adherence to social distancing measures was adjusted proportionate to cell phone mobility data which indicated lower adherence in milwaukee as compared to dane county1719 we assumed that adherence to social distancing remains the same after may 26 2020new york city ny nyc was among the first epicenters for the covid-19 pandemic in the us thus the relative maturity of the epidemic in nyc made it a good test case to evaluate covams predictive accuracy for later stages of the pandemic as before to maximize generalizability and avoid overfitting we used the same simulation settings as those in dane county except four changes table 2 1 160 imported cases were added between march 5 2020 and april 4 2020 and 80 imported cases were added after april 4 2020 to account for the greater number of visitors to nyc 2 population demographics using the nyc population information was adjusted 3 adherence to social distancing measures was adjusted as mobile phone data showed that adherence was higher in nyc as compared to dane county171921 and 4 number of contacts per person in each day was set to 20 due to significantly higher population density 438square mile in dane county vs 27755square mile in nyc as social network analysis literature reports that population density increases the number of close contacts2223 these parameters correspond to a theoretical r0 value of 668we compared the case that social distancing is not implemented schools are openclosed to the case that social distancing is implemented at the beginning of the simulation and adherence to social distancing is consistently at a level of 25507590we tested the scenario that social distancing is implemented 1 week earlier and 14 weeks later than the actual implementation date we assumed that social distancing measures in nyc end on june 1 and adherence thereafter does not become zero but drops 20 percentage points due to heightened awareness of the community in nyc a drop of 20 percentage points in adherence to social distancing reduces the adherence level from 90 to 70 after easing social distancing measures for dane county and milwaukee we did not change adherence to social distancing after may 21 2020 and may 26 2020 respectivelywe tested the scenario that social distancing measures are eased on june 1 june 15 and july 1 we assumed that after social distancing measures are eased due to the heightened awareness of the community adherence to social distancing drops by 10 and 20 percentage points compared to the adherence levels before easing social distancing measures in each region for example in nyc a drop of 10 percentage points in adherence to social distancing reduces the adherence level from 90 to 80 after social distancing measures are eased this is consistent with the adherence levels observed in dane county and milwaukee after wisconsin supreme court struck down the stay-at-home order of the governor in the state on may 13 202020 we conducted these experiments only for nycwe conducted a sensitivity analysis for nyc region on two parameters probability of testing given a patient experiences mild to moderate symptoms and transmission rates testing has been severely limited especially in the early days of epidemic in the us therefore it is likely that our initial calibration may not have estimated the input parameters correctly for example recent data from nyc suggest that one of every five residents tested positive for antibodies for covid-1924 for this purpose we replaced our base estimate of 75 for the probability of testing with 25 and 50 and recalibrated model parameters and reevaluated all of the scenarios described above similarly we reduced the transmission rate by 50 from a base estimate of 00418 to 00209 for the probability of transmission from a patient experiencing mild to moderate symptoms to a susceptible patient when a close contact occurs recalibrated model parameters and reevaluated all of the scenarios we ran 100 replications for each experiment and report only mean values since the standard errors were very lowcovam replicated the observed number of covid-19 cases and thus sars-cov-2 transmission dynamics over time in the short term accurately figure 2 our first set of experiments showed that adherence to social distancing has a significant effect on the cumulative number of cases figure 3 and appendix table 1 for example compared to social distancing at a 50 adherence level no social distancing while closing schools increases the total number of cases from 55592 to 480630 in nyc in just 26 days by march 31figure 4 presents how various outcomes associated with covid-19 would change when social distancing measures are implemented earlier or later than the actual implementation date we found that even a 1-week delay in implementing social distancing interventions would have had a significant impact on the total number of confirmed infections over time in each of the three urban communities figure 4 for example implementing social distancing measures one week earlier in nyc would have reduced the number of cases by 77 from 191984 to 43968 by may 30 whereas a 1-week delay in initiating such measures could have increased the number of confirmed cases by more than six-fold to 1299420 figure 4 and appendix table 2 the impact of implementing social distancing measures depends highly on the region as each region has different levels of adherence to social distancing and are experiencing different levels of transmission appendix table 2 for example implementing the measures on march 19 instead of march 12 in dane county increases the number of cases by 240 as of may 15 498 to 1693 while the same scenario in nyc increases the number of cases by 576 191984 to 1299420 these results demonstrate the differential impact of implementing social distancing measures in urban communities a delay in implementation has a differential effect on the number of cases in the milwaukee as compared to dane county indicating that the impact of a delay in implementing social distancing measures varies significantly even within the same statetable 2 shows that earlier easing of the social distancing measures would have major detrimental effects on the total numbers of covid-19 cases in nyc premature easing of social distancing measures on june 1 instead of june 15 would increase the total number of confirmed cases from 275587 to 379858 as of july 31 table 2 also shows that in nyc after easing social distancing measures on june 15 increasing the adherence level by just 10 percentage points would reduce the number of cases from 711792 to 275587 as of july 31 demonstrating the importance of practicing personal behaviors that prevent the transmission of sars-cov-2 after the social distancing measures are easedthe sensitivity analysis on the probability of testing and transmission rates showed that even if a lower probability of testing or a lower rate of transmission were to be used the overall trends in base-case runs would still hold appendix figures 16 and appendix tables 311in this simulation study we estimated the impact of the timing of implementing and easing of and adherence to social distancing measures in three unique urban communities using agent-based simulation modeling we found that the timing of implementing social distancing and adherence to social distancing significantly affected the number of cases the impact of the timing of implementation of social distancing measures varied widely by region in nyc the impact was large compared to dane county and milwaukee this finding illustrates the importance of considering implementing and reopening policies at the regional level as the results in dane county and milwaukee differed considerably despite being in the same state we further found keeping a high level of adherence after easing social distancing measures has a major impact on the number of cases implying that cities and regions should strongly encourage the community to maintain behaviors that reduce the transmissibility of sars-cov-2 such as wearing masks the accuracy of covam for predicting the current outbreak and its ability to estimate the impact of easing social distancing measures at the regional level demonstrates its unique value for informing current and future policies our findings clearly show that one-size-fits-all strategies are suboptimal and that context- and region-specific policies are needed when considering implementing and easing social distancing measuressome opponents of stay-at-home policies are motivated by the prospects of achieving herd immunity as a reason for easing current social distancing measures that are in place25 however herd immunity is only possible if infection with sars-cov-2 results in solid immunity which is unknown at this time moreover the correlates of protective immunity to sars-cov-2 have yet to be identified25 in the absence of this understanding social distancing is the most effective tool to prevent further spread of sars-cov-2 to date social distancing measures and adherence to those measures have resulted in halting exponential growth in the daily case counts of covid-19 however sars-cov-2 continues to spread and major cities and urban communities in the us have yet to return to pre-exponential growth levels of transmission covam demonstrates that premature easing of social distancing measures and adherence to these measures will result in rapid return to exponential growth of covid-19 cases and negate progress made to date in slowing the spread of sars-cov-2 in communities managing the healthcare capacities of health systems and preventing larger numbers of deathsour study has limitations most of which are due to limited available data and uncertainty regarding sars-cov-2 we make simplifying assumptions such as asymptomatic patients transmit the disease at the same rate as symptomatic patients and weather does not affect sars-cov-2 transmissibility whereas several studies suggest otherwise2627 furthermore covam uses adherence to social distancing as a proxy for several factors contributing to the disease transmission including fewer close contacts due to limited travel and precautions that prevent transmission during a close contact such as wearing masks therefore covam may not be accurately estimating the impact of personal precautions on transmission to overcome this limitation we assumed a high level of adherence after the easing of social distancing measures to provide a conservative estimate on the effect of easing social distancing measuresthere are also several limitations related to the modeling approach our calibration procedure used a simple trial-error approach as opposed to a full-scale calibration in which all possible combinations of the input parameter values within a plausible range are tested28 due to the computational intensity of a more formal and detailed calibration procedure our calibration process may have not identified the best parameter combinations to represent the pandemic additionally we used mean parameter estimates instead of probability distributions for input parameters to reduce computational time although we do not expect this simplification to substantively change our resultsin conclusion our model demonstrates that the delayed implementation lower adherence to and premature easing of social distancing generally result in increased cases of covid-19 in urban areas of the us the magnitude of impact however varies significantly by region these findings highlight the importance of region-specific considerations and ideally modeling as inputs to making policy decisions for a given regioncovid-19 refers to the infectious disease that results from a novel coronavirus that was not identified until an outbreak in wuhan china in december of 2019 pathogens in the coronavirus family may cause acute respiratory infections and difficulty breathing the illness resulting from the novel coronavirus covid-19 is marked by respiratory symptoms congestion cough difficulty breathing as well as hyperthermia and exhaustion covid-19 effects seem to be exacerbated by underlying conditions such as hypertension diabetes and cardiopathy at the time of writing covid-19 has infected over 6 million people including 17 million in the united states who 2020 covid-19 has spread quickly as interpersonal transmission can occur through respiratory droplets and contaminated surfaces as a result many jurisdictions have enacted stay-at-home orders limited work to essential functions and created social distancing directives these decisions have seemingly slowed the spread of covid-19 still over 350000 have died due to complications connected to the illness including over 100000 americans who 2020 these figures are projected to double by the end of july 2020the 2020 covid-19 pandemic impact on policing strategies and mental health in criminal justice settings is matched in magnitude by only a limited number of events in the past century as research on covid-19 and the interrelated public policy and health ramifications of both the disease and the coordinated response is still in its infancy reference to earlier crises that significantly altered law enforcement practices namely the start of the hiv epidemic in the 1980s and the attacks of september 11 2001 provide reference context these previous large-scale distressing events affected perceptions of safety job stress and standard practices of law enforcement officers including the need to address traumatized members of the public the covid-19 pandemic is likely to also affect these domains but the form of those effects may be distinct per the unknown nature and already comparatively longer duration of the pandemic than some prior national traumatic eventsone of the closest analogies to the current law enforcement climate is the spread of hiv in the 1980s while hiv is manageable today uncertainty reigned three decades ago law enforcement officers were tasked with enforcing policies in an environment of misunderstood risk flavin 1998 describes a pervasive fear of hiv among officers who generally overestimated their occupational risk a perceived inability to manage hiv risk intensified fear jermier gaines  mcintosh 1989 officers of that era had limited and evolving information about transmission leinen 1993 much like those policing during the height of covid-19 perhaps law enforcement officers today are not dissuaded from assisting injured citizens proximate to the prior fear of contracting hiv but encounters with the public no doubt generate similar stress as reports already describe officers dying after contracting covid-19 thompson and marquarts 1998 study indicated that hiv risk was a significant stressor among law enforcement officers although training diminished these concerns while robinson sigman and wilson 1997 suggest it may have contributed to ptsd among officers assuming policing prior to heightened understanding of hiv serves as a valid analogy for law enforcement stress during covid-19 it is clear that an exploration of how covid-19 has affected officer stress and behavior is warranted similarly officers may benefit from increased resources directed towards assisting them and their family with stress management during this time of crisisthe terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 also may serve as reference for how broader world issues impact officer stress throughout the country following the attack on the world trade center and the pentagon numerous police and other first responders risked their safety and rushed into unknown danger to assist the public similar results from samples of these heroes indicate mental health concerns resulted from this service one-third of the officers responding from the arlington county police department reported significantly heightened post-traumatic stress disorder ptsd symptoms years after responding to the pentagon robbers  jenkins 2005 over 20 of new york responders reported ptsd symptoms with 54 reaching diagnostic thresholds over four years after the attack 40 of these officers reported needing mental healthcare pietrzak et al 2012 suicidal ideation among officers also increased violanti castellano orourke  paton 2006 however that days event affected stress levels of officers beyond these locations studies demonstrate increases in police stress in other cities in the year following the incident as well as a shifting of perceived major sources of stress whereas data collected prior to 911 reported that harming a civilian and the safety of fellow officers were prime concernsstresses data from similar respondents collected a year after 911 indicated that police felt dealing with terrorist or hate groups and being prepared for riots were foremost among their concerns stevens 2004 further the attacks prompted numerous organizational changes within police forces which exacerbated stress marks  sun 2007terrorist threats may not on the surface appear an apt comparison for a viral pathogen like covid-19 but the psychological connection is clear both are invisible dangers officers can no more see the intention of citizens than they can sars-cov-2 which causes covid-19 in each case threats can come from anywhere  the person with the bulging backpack standing in front of the museum could be carrying a bomb or the person clearing their throat could be showing the initial signs of a covid-19 infection each concern requires hypervigilance as one exposure or one missed threat can be deadly for a large number of citizens in each situation there has been distrust for organizations providing data police viewed limited information from federal sources as a source of stress following the 911 attacks stevens 2004 and the integrity of the centers for disease control and prevention and the world health organization have been challenged during the covid-19 pandemic this analogy also provides context to expect that the covid-19 pandemic may disproportionately affect stress levels of women in law enforcement as large gender differences in police stress resulted from 911 bowler et al 2010 it also suggests that strong social integration may minimize occupational stress and mental health issues resulting from covid-19 as officers that were better connected to others were less affected by terrorist threats and showed greater resiliency schwarzer bowler  cone 2014reactions of the law enforcement community to covid-19 thus far have been near ubiquitous efforts were made to procure and utilize protective personal equipment ppe and officers have encouraged and enforced social distancing depending on the size of the agency and the available resources police departments have marked off briefing rooms with spots for officers to sit six feet away from each other or even held briefings outside  where the virus is thought to be less likely to spread discretion when dealing with the public is at a premium as is avoiding physical proximity in situations where a response or arrest can be avoided for example many urban agencies have instructed officers to conduct fewer traffic stops and avoid unnecessary interpersonal interactions mohler et al 2020 overall calls for service may have slightly decreased during the height of the covid-19 pandemic campedelli aziani  favarin 2020 mohler et al 2020 but certain offenses have been increasingly reported including vandalism and domestic violence mohler et al 2020 as well as theft of medical equipment hulett 2020 though service calls may have decreased per shelter-in-place guidelines the burden on individual officers ostensibly increases as indicated by over 1000 virus cases within the nypd - 15 of the workforce reporting being sick and unavailable to serve abc 2020in addition to carrying the burden for stricken colleagues covid-19 presented officers with novel and exacerbated stressors first they were expected to implement new policies to ensure social distancing while stay-at-home directives were challenged on political economic and legal grounds as the agents of new and unpopular restrictions officers may have experienced additional anxiety and disapproval from the citizenry served shirzad abbasi farajzadeh hosseini zijoud  farnoosh 2020 second they were required to adapt existing practices to virus reality community and offender programs service call responses and patrol practices had to be adapted to limit exposure and ensure enough officers remained healthy to maintain public safety these adaptations oft centered on limiting interpersonal contact potentially created cognitive dissonance in instances where officers avoided serving the public or making a minor arrest to limit their own exposure third agencies clearly suffered from shortages in ppe panic following covid-19s spread cleared masks gloves sanitizer and other needed supplies from inventory officers likely experienced stress through the limited availability of ppe or by using items they understood to be needed by the general public the lack of these resources per the extension of the logic of a general resource shortfall is more problematic in disadvantaged rural areas fourth the covid-19 pandemic itself was a traumatic event presenting consistent risk of bodily harm and requiring officers to be increasingly hypervigilant of their own environment the daily exposure to stress safety protocols and social distancing policies may have limited their capacity to engage in positive coping strategiesthe threat of covid-19 and the challenges of social distancing policies presents a particular problem for small rural law enforcement agencies these groups have fewer resources and are less likely to employ individuals that specialize in health policy mental health management and information distribution to guide both the workforce and population it serves through the pandemic large urban agencies have partnered together to share information during the coronavirus pandemic through the police executive research forums perf daily covid-19 reports httpswwwpoliceforumorgcoronavirusdaily and resources like the american society for evidence-based policings asebp covid portal for sharing response strategies and new policies httpswwwamericansebpcovidorg while rural agencies can also gain access to these resources their smaller size means they are less likely to have officers with connections to these organizationslaw enforcement training in rural agencies is also likely less dynamic and adaptive to developing needs larger workforces allow training that has smaller incremental costs and there is specialization of activities thus an emerging issue like the need to adapt to a global viral pandemic is likely to put a disproportionate strain on officers in rural jurisdictions with ritualistic agency culture their organizational size limits leverage for acquiring resources such as personal protective equipment and tools to enforce social distancing protocols further it may hinder the resiliency and the adaptation of existing programs to the evolving needs of citizens during windows of social upheaval the pandemic paired with limited training and resources to deal with its consequences are likely to have an extensive and long-term impact on rural law enforcement officer mental healthwhile rural jurisdictions may lack the resources and specialized work forces that can assist with reactivity to a threat like covid-19 urban areas are disproportionately the site of protests riots and social unrest during a period of extreme stress tension related to stay-at-home orders escalated throughout the early stages of the pandemic with many citizens becoming concerned about the financial repercussions of lockdowns large groups descended on state capitals and other large cities to protest for the opportunity to work and earn an income this created a demand for law enforcement to manage potentially violent groups without curtailing their first amendment rights ensuring safety during large scale protest is generally a stressful challenge but is enhanced during a viral pandemic law enforcement was responsible for both providing a presence to deter violent and unruly behavior but also to encourage social distancing and use of face masks and other protective wearan unprecedented dual responsibility further racial tension towards police escalated during the pandemic due to the deaths of breonna taylor and george floyd at the hands of officers in kentucky and minnesota respectively urban centers drew crowds protesting rioting and looting officers in large agencies became both the focus of acrimony and responsible for ensuring unruly crowds safety from a viral threatwhile not intended to describe the behavior of police slocums 2010 exploration of behavioral continuity in the context of strain theories provides a framework for how the covid-19 may influence officer stress mental health and performance long after any vaccine is introduced first slocum 2010 describes the negative impact of past and existing stressors on individuals ability to deal with new stressors and challenges a reasonable inference would be that officers dealing with stressors associated with covid-19 response are less ready to deal with new stressors while covid-19 policing stressors may impair officers functions from a psychological perspective the omnipresent stress of policing during an uncertain pandemic is likely to impact neurotransmitter and stress hormone levels resulting in increased susceptibility to stress and overreactions eg fishbein 2001 put simply dealing with evolving regulations ever-changing departmental policies enforcing unpopular shutdowns and the fear of contracting covid-19 likely diminish officers ability to deal with the numerous other stresses that characterize their professionsecond slocums 2010 stress proliferation arguments can be applied to covid-19 policing in both primary and secondary forms dealing with covid-related demands and uncertainty itself presents as a source of stress but also clearly exacerbates other job stressors that may impact mental health dealing with an unruly citizen becomes increasingly challenging due to social distancing expectations and protective gear another example of primary proliferation is covid-19 affecting shift schedules and work rotations in an atypical manner meant to minimize the chance of numerous officers being infected at once when inconsistent work schedules already serve as a significant source of officer stress and fatigue secondary stress proliferation also likely occurs in situations where covid-19 policing precautions affect family life officers exposed to the public may have chosen to avoid extended contact with family in case they contracted covid-19 and be limited in their options to cope with stress in the manner they did prior to covid-19 thus covid-19 policing potentially impacts officer stress in domains outside of the work intensifying the potential need for stress management and mental health assistancewhile covid-19s largest impact on policing has likely been on organizational protocols and officer mental health the stress endured during the pandemic has likely had a deleterious effect on officer productivity efficiency and ability to perform social outreach functions moon and jonson 2012 indicate that officer stress is inversely linked to job commitmentthose that experience more job-related stress are less committed to their position as a law enforcement officers wolfe rojek manjarrez and rojek 2018 similarly found that uncertainty over the future of policing was a significant factor in understanding officers job satisfaction an extended increase in stress as well as uncertainty surrounding the future of policing during the covid-19 pandemic likely impacted the dedication and resiliency of current officers further job stressors directly impact performance indicators shane 2010 suggesting that covid-19 may have impaired some officers ability to respond to calls for service it remains to be seen whether the pandemic will result in increased officer turnover but as extant research points to stressors facilitating burnout among officers russell cole  jones iii 2014 it is likely jurisdictions will employ a less experienced workforce in the upcoming yearsacknowledging the potential relationship between covid-related officer stress and productivity performance is further impacted by safety protocols that limit interaction or simply require officers attention each moment that officers spend stocking preparing donning and discarding personal protective equipment is a moment that is not spent completing essential functions equipment may impair field of vision breathing and grip on objects hindering officer functions the expectation that uniformed officers will encourage social distancing and enforce lockdown directives requires time that distracts from other obligations as such performance measures such as clearance rates may suffer during the covid-19 pandemicin addition to reduced police productivity we are likely to see more incidents of police misconduct by the nature of the occupation police officers must uphold high standards of ethical behavior but police misconduct is associated with increases in organizational stressors bishopp worrall  piquero 2016 these are likely to increase during the uncertainty and increased protocols during a pandemic furthering these challenges police officers are the face of the government on the street that is they are likely the only direct representative of the government and its laws that many people interact with as community tensions have increased and citizens voice greater resistance to stay-at-home mandates and business restrictions police officers are forced to deal with implementing unpopular rules that they did not createone of the more stressful roles assumed by law enforcement is crowd control in an unplanned and unrehearsed situation while a planned political function with detailed organization may not introduce large amounts of stress on officers a more chaotic event without clear boundaries drills and for which citizens have no awareness of normative procedures is likely to be seen as extremely stressful garbarino et al 2012 sporting celebrations unforeseen weather emergencies and riots each present challenges that accumulate stress on officers and may encourage or facilitate misconduct the stress-creating unknown and unrehearsed nature of these events was compounded by the lack of precedentprotests of social distancing and shutdown orders are unlike any other of the modern era groups assembling to vie for their right to interact with others were violating orders that regulated assembly and group size additionally due to the stated position of these protests most ignored best practices for reducing the spread of covid-19 by not leaving six feet of distance between themselves and police officers as well as not wearing a mask in one iconic photo a protestor at the state capitol in michigan leans in and screams in the face of two michigan state police officers it is easy to see how these officers would be stressed that in performing their duties they were potentially exposing themselves to the virus police were forced to adapt to protect protestors from their compatriots viral loadswhile large protests were common in larger cities they also appeared in other areas across the country in the form of challenges to governmental directives eg non-essential business remaining openreopening in opposition to state mandates further exacerbating officer stress was the aforementioned protests of racial injustice directly following those focused on governmental intrusion into business just as general strain theory predicts that individuals placed under severe strain will respond with maladaptive coping mechanisms such as crime officers facing continued stress through repeated protests and potential viral exposure coupled with serving in the low control environment that characterized by rioting may engage in maladaptive deviant behaviors in the form of police misconduct officers targeted as a result of other officers behavior or governmental lockdowns are likely to feel angry and act to protect themselvessome organizational strains can be reduced by administrators but increased community tension and the fear and uncertainty related to covid-19 creates additional stress and opportunities to engage in problematic coping behaviors and misconduct police misconduct has been the focus of researchers and policy makers prior to covid-19 and additional efforts to reduce stress and increase training to promote ethical conduct have already been implemented by a number of agenciesfor example there are some police training programs designed to combat ethical violations and promote officer wellbeing to address widespread corruption and misconduct the new orleans police department nopd created the ethical policing is courageous epic peer intervention program which encourages active bystandership with the goal of reducing negative behaviors and officer misconduct in the nopd aronie  lopez 2017 morgan murphy  horwitz 2017 staub 2019 the main focus of the training is to encourage active bystander peers to step in when officers first start down a path of deviance staub 2018 staub 2019 this intervention is intended to encourage officers to stop their fellow officer from engaging in misconduct that could potentially cost their job and erode public trust in the police department additionally the training also focuses on wellbeing to encourage prosocial coping mechanisms and active bystandership can help to reduce alcohol abuse and other unhealthy habits resulting in a positive impact on officers mental health although this training is promising and could help stem misconduct and increased stress caused by a pandemic it has yet to be evaluatedseveral initiatives have been undertaken to improve officer mental health which continues to be a funding priority for the national institute of justice among the promising avenues for improving mental health are programs that target organizational fairness officers routinely report treatment at the hands of command staff and immediate supervisors as a primary source of stress in policing brown  campbell 1990 collins  gibbs 2003 crank  caldero 1991 furthermore in the face of increasing uncertainty improved treatment at the hands of supervisors can improve police officers job satisfaction wolfe et al 2018 thus programs that improve leaderships ability to increase fairness in the workplace should have positive effects on officers mental health and job satisfactionother methods of improving officer mental health include programs that encourage officers to positively cope through activities such as yoga and meditation eg tactical yoga yoga for first responders and cop to yoga other programs have encouraged officers to talk to therapists regarding the mental strain of policing however these programs are often criticized as the hyper-masculine culture of policing discourages officers to seek external help accordingly programs that target positive scoping skills from within the department or through peer networks is often recommended as officers continue to deal with the stress of potential viral exposure of the coming months it will be important for departmental leadership to reduce stress as much as possible and for officers to identify positive coping strategiesresilience is the ability to withstand adapt to and recover from adversity and stress and return to a positive state of mental health and well-being through coping strategies us department of health  human services 2015 resiliency requires a holistic approach to wellness with a focus on the body mind and spirit goerling 2012 police officers are often exposed to a variety of life-threatening experiences including natural disasters accidents fires and violent crimes arnetz nevedal lumley backman  lublin 2009 these events can have a detrimental impact on first responders and result in mental health problems and ptsd hartley et al 2011 even more challenging if the traumatic circumstance isnt a singular event but daily reinforced occupational stress over time due to a prolonged crisis resiliency becomes a sustained process to try and maintain healthy prosocial behaviorsthere is evidence that police training has the potential to promote resilience and reduce stress for example in an experimental design police training prior to critical incident police work simulations found through biomarkers and self-report evaluations that officers who received prior training had significantly less negative mood less heart rate reactivity a larger increase in antithrombin and better performances than those without prior training arnetz et al 2009 although this training showed a physical reduction in stress and benefits in the short run long term benefits were not assessedcovid-19 will have long lasting impacts on society and police departments will likely have to permanently alter some policing protocols as a result as people start getting out in public more police departments will need to reestablish community relationships and develop strategies to deal with individuals who have been economically impacted and address increased mental health issues in the general population a strong focus on community policing and crisis intervention training will be essential in successful post-pandemic policinga global crisis like the covid-19 pandemic undoubtedly affected law enforcement practices and the mental health of law enforcement officers as such it is critical to quantify the scope of these impacts in order to justify and properly target the provision of resources that allow agencies and individuals to weather the storm further an understanding of covid-19 effects will enable a more informed response to future crises in order to retain law enforcement effectiveness and avoid detrimental effects on law enforcement mental health while covid-related precautions are being labeled the new normal it is imperative that steps be taken to ensure that pandemic worsened job stress levels not become the new normal for law enforcement officerswe offer a number of recommendations for researchers to help understand this phenomenon first the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on officer stress must be quantified as the events of 2020 were unforeseen it was impossible for researchers to have planned a longitudinal study of the pandemics effects beginning before its onset as such it is necessary to replicate data collected on law enforcement stress mental health and performance before the pandemic care must be taken to ensure a comparable sample or to draw data from the same sampling frame within such studies it is not only relevant to determine if an event increased law enforcement stress but also if it shifted the source of job-related stressors eg stevens 2004 additionally stress in other life domains as well as healthy and unhealthy coping should be quantified as major stressors as the covid-19 response may proliferate into other areas of officers lives slocum 2010second identification of officer characteristics and behaviors linked to successful coping following this traumatic event is key certain psychological traits or skills developed during trainings related to mental health may have empowered more positive responses to stressors the provision of similar training programs may assist other officers in dealing with future unforeseen pandemics while awareness of traits linked to successful stress responses may provide insight in hiring processes more importantly the identification of characteristics linked to less effective management of covid-related stress may assist departments in directing resources towards their officers in most need of mental health servicesthird studies should focus on agency responses to the covid-19 pandemic while numerous studies of this type are likely underway the general focus is likely on physical health issues and response to calls for service an understanding of how law enforcement groups looked to protect their own members mental health during a time of crisis is needed so that the actions of successful agencies can be replicated by others across the countryin addition to researching the impact of covid-19 on officer wellbeing this information should be utilized to adapt and develop future training protocols to help first responders and police officers in the wake of this unprecedented situation it is likely that many agencies were caught unprepared for the mental stress that their officers would experience however with scientists already discussing second waves and future outbreaks now is the time to prepare officers for these situations in our view this requires two primary paths forward for policing agencies 1 departments must focus on being logistically prepared for viral outbreaks through the stockpiling of ppe and the development of emergency plans for how to police during a pandemic and 2 departments must provide officers with training to improve skills for positive coping in the face of extreme stress as noted above uncertainty can be a major source of stress by ensuring that the department is logistically prepared for an outbreak with ppe and plans for altering policing strategies in future pandemics officers should experience less uncertainty and less stress furthermore while it is impossible to completely remove stress from these types of situations providing training on positive coping skills should help officers to deal with the stress they do face without the side effects of increased burnout poor mental health and unhealthy behaviors such as alcoholismcovid-19 rapidly developed into a pandemic and by 26 march 2020 the usa had the highest reported number of infected people in the world a general message from public health experts is that effective control of the spread of covid-19 requires widespread medical testing who 2020 the testing will serve to determine whether people are infected or not and ideally also if they have been infected and have reached immunity statusthree reasons motivate widespread testing first if a person learns that they are infected they can take appropriate measures to reduce the probability of infecting others such as the recommended 14-day self-isolation harvard medical school 2020 second the data provided by widespread testing will better inform the need for the current social distancing policies eg sheltering at home avoiding gatherings of 10 or more people keeping at least 6 feet away from other people and temporarily closing schools universities daycare centers major sports leagues cultural events and public spaces stock 2020 third testing provides data about the asymptomatic rate in the usa the share of infected people who show no or very mild symptoms and insight into how close americans are to developing herd immunity to covid-19 this information is useful in order to determine when and where it makes sense to relax these costly social distancing measureswhile the usa has increased its capacity to conduct more testing around 18 of the population had been tested by 30 april 2020 covid tracking project 2020 the effectiveness of testing in controlling covid-19 depends largely on how the tests are conducted the ideal scenario is to test everyone but that is infeasible a second-best scenario is random sample testing stock 2020 but for random testing to be effective all sampled people would either need to voluntarily agree to be tested which is unlikely as we explain or be forced to do so which is illegal in the usa the third-best and first-best feasible strategy is voluntary random testing this strategy however could lead to a systematic selection bias  we will only test those individuals who prefer to learn their health status regarding covid-19 a significant fraction of people might not want to know these individuals might find that their private costs outweigh any social benefits from not infecting others this implies that they might want to avoid testing if their private costs include above-average opportunity costs of social interactions then individuals who decline to be tested may also be disproportionately likely to become super-spreadersto understand why this might happen consider the ongoing literature on willful ignorance of health information also called strategic ignorance while standard economic theory suggests people never ignore information that enables them to adjust behavior stigler 1961 many new studies find that people willfully ignore medical diagnoses even when such knowledge would enable them to adjust behavior to better accommodate their health condition sharot  sunstein 2020 for example we see willful ignorance in many people at risk for breast cancer thompson et al 2002 alzheimers disease cutler  hodgson 2003 hiv hightow et al 2003 and huntingtons disease oster et al 2013 the study by ganguly and tasoff 2017 is particularly relevant they observe people will avoid a costless test for herpes  a disease for which there is currently no cure but for which information is useful in that it helps adjust behavior people have also been found to willfully ignore health risk information such as calories in food thunstrm et al 2016 woolley  risen 2018 sunstein 2019 thunstrm 2019 nordstrm et al 2020 willful ignorance of health outcomes is likely to arise when people are torn between what they think they should do and what they want to do thunstrm 2016 woolley  risen 2018 or when ignorance allows them to form optimal expectations downplay the probability of a bad health outcome oster et al 2013 nordstrm et al 2020 for instance a person may think she should eat healthy but want to indulge in ice-creamshe might then choose to avoid learning about the exact amount of calories in the ice-cream in order to avoid either her inner pressure to reduce the ice-cream consumption or the guilt from consuming it despite being aware of the calorie contentin this paper we explore self-selection in covid-19 testing in the usa we examine if people willfully avoid getting tested for covid-19 and if so what individual or household characteristics and circumstances are associated with testing avoidance given that random voluntary testing is not yet available in the usa there are no observational data to rely on for our analysis we therefore design a hypothetical randomized controlled trial rct we recruit a nationally representative sample of 1000 participants the study entails two treatments across which we vary information about the potential emotional cost of testing before asking if participants would agree or disagree to a financially costless covid-19 test in the baseline treatment we inform participants that if they are found to be infected they are urged to self-isolate at home for 14 days in the high-cost treatment we tell participants that those who test positive are strongly urged to self-isolate which may be in a self-quarantine site away from homewe assume the test itself is costless and that the only cost incurred from a covid-19 test is the recommended self-isolation for 14 days should the test come back positive if people are concerned only with their private benefits and costs from taking a covid-19 test those with large private benefits and low private costs from knowing that they are infected will be the most likely to get tested private benefits are significant for people at elevated risk for severe health consequences if they contract the virus or with family members at higher risk while private costs are low for those who generally live a solitary life professionally and in privatewe expect elderly and those who have  or have a family member that has  pre-existing conditions to be more willing to test furthermore we expect those at the lowest risk of losing out financially eg risk to labor income or health care costs or emotionally from self-isolating ie if they are introverts who attach a low value to social interactions to be the most willing to get tested for covid-19 in contrast if people are concerned only with social benefits and costs we would expect those most at risk of exposing others to be the most likely to get tested eg potential super-spreaders ie people with jobs that entail mixing with other people people living in urban areas young people and people who are extroverts and attach a high value to social interactionspeople with the potential to be super-spreaders might be torn about learning whether they are infected by covid-19 both private costs and social benefits from being urged to self-isolate for the next 14 days harvard medical school 2020 might be high for this group and so influence their testing decision in opposite directions for example consider the behavior of an extrovert who values social interactions highly if unsure of being infected the extrovert behaves just as if she is not infected eg as found for huntingtons disease by oster et al 2013 self-isolation means this person needs to give up highly valued social interactions  a factor that might deter them from a voluntary test for covid-19 at the same time their self-isolation provides particularly meaningful private and social health benefits from reduction in exposure to and spread of the disease these benefits to learning whether they are infected might encourage them to voluntarily test it is an open question if the benefits outweigh the costs causing the extrovert to take a costless covid-19 test similarly imagine a store clerk who risks losing income if self-isolating for 14 days the potential private loss of income would deter them from testing while the social benefits from reducing disease spread would encourage taking the test again the decision to test becomes an open question previous studies show that willful ignorance arises when prosocial behavior is privately costly dana et al 2007 conrads  irlenbusch 2013 onwezen  van der weele 2016 gigerenzer  garcia-retamero 2017 grossman  van der weele 2017in this study we find that around 70 of people want to take a costless covid-19 test as might be expected people who worry more about their health are particularly likely to want to take the test we also find that those most likely to want to take the test are those most likely to spread the virus if unaware of their infection including young people and extroverts with a preference for socializing extroverts might also be at the highest risk for being infected but even when we control for personal risks amount of social interactions and worry about own health we find they are more willing to test the ability to afford to self-isolate for 14 days does not seem to affect the willingness to test our results suggest that there is a significant amount of selflessness in the decision to test people appear to be highly concerned about the social benefits from testing for covid-19 and little concerned about private costsin addition we do not find the expected treatment effect of our experimental manipulation of the private cost to testing ie the location of self-isolation at home or in a facility away from home does not seem to matter to the testing decision our expectation was that willful ignorance would be higher if self-isolation might take place away from home since we assume self-isolation away from home is perceived as more costly one interpretation of the lack of expected treatment effect is that it lends further support to the idea that private costs play a negligible role in the decision to test for covid-19our results matter because they underscore the value of widespread covid-19 testing even if such testing cannot be done randomly our findings suggest that widely available and costless voluntary testing will target rather than scare off those most likely to be super-spreadersto test peoples willingness to take a financially costless covid-19 test we designed a hypothetical field experiment the experiment is a rct with a between-subjects design consisting of two treatments in the first treatment treatment baseline participants were told they would be urged to self-isolate at home if having tested positive in the second treatment treatment high cost they were told they might be urged to self-isolate at a special site away from homeparticipants n  1000 were recruited by the research firm qualtrics and the sample was required to be nationally representative along the dimensions of gender age education race income and residential region east west north or south while the recruitment costs from qualtrics are higher than when recruiting from amazon mechanical turk or turk prime qualtrics continuously quality checks participants which enabled us to avoid many issues that may otherwise contaminate online panels eg see chandler  paolacci 2017 sharpe wessling et al 2017 participants received standard qualtrics compensation to participate in a surveythe sequence of the experimental study was as follows
step 1 all participants were asked screening questions at the front end of the survey about their gender age education race income and region in order to ensure the sample met us national quotas for those characteristicsstep 2 participants were asked whether they had already been tested for the covid-19 if yes they were asked why they got tested the outcome of the test how many days prior to survey participation they had taken the test and if the test was costly if no they were randomized into one of the two treatments and asked about their willingness to take a testspecifically if in treatment baseline they received the following information
currently us authorities are working to test more people for the coronavirus legislators are urging people who test positive ie are found to be infected by the virus to self-isolate at home for 14 daysif in treatment high cost they were instead told
currently us authorities are working to test more people for the coronavirus legislators are urging people who test positive ie are found to be infected by the virus to self-isolate for 14 days some states have started building self-quarantine sites  sites where people who have the virus would be isolated for 14 days if people stay at those sites it is easier to ensure they comply with the guidelines to self-isolatethereafter participants in both treatments were asked
if you were given the opportunity to take a coronavirus test for free within the next 3 days would you take the testdefault alternatives to get or not get information have been shown to affect observed choices of ignorance grossman 2014 to avoid nudging participants toward any particular answer there was no default alternative participants needed to choose either yes i would take the test or no i would not take the teststep 3 all participants were asked about their current level of social distancing how many people outside their household they had been within 6 feet of in the last 3 days how many gatherings with more than 10 people they had participated in and self-assessed level of compliance with social distancing they were also asked whether they supported the public recommendations for social distancing in generalstep 4 participants were asked questions about factors that might affect the perceived cost of a positive covid-19 test implying social isolation for 14 days as well as the perceived benefits from being able to make behavioral adjustments they were asked about their job situation job security and possibility of the main income provider in the household taking sick leave risk factors for contracting the virus eg living in a urban area working in a health care facility working in a grocery store or pharmacy risk factors for self or any children for suffering severe health consequences if contracting the virus eg underlying health conditions that increases the risk such as cancer obesity diabetes etc level of extraversion francis et al 1992 and social lifestylestep 5 participants were asked about religious belonging religiosity political affiliation and social and fiscal conservatism everett 2013the full survey can be found in the online supplementary materialof our total sample 103 participants stated that they had already been tested while 897 stated that they had not already been tested we asked those who had been tested for the primary reason they had taken the covid-19 test table 1 shows their answers as expected given the current prevailing strategy in the usa of focusing the limited testing on people who are symptomatic most people got tested because they themselves showed symptoms almost 55 or because someone close to them either showed symptoms or was diagnosed with covid-19 around 35 summary statistics for the 103 participants who had been tested before participating in our study are shown in the online supplementary material
our analysis focuses on the 897 participants who stated that they had not been tested for covid-19 due to a coding error in the survey at the beginning of the data collection seven participants did not respond to the question on whether they were a business owner employed or unemployed we dropped these seven participants from our analysis and we were left with 890 observations table 2 presents the summary statistics for these participants unless otherwise stated all of the remaining analysis focuses on the results for this group of participants
table 2 shows that 53 of participants who had not yet been tested for covid-19 are female the variable age describes a participants age in years and the mean age in our sample is 47 years the variable high-risk age is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if a person is aged 65 years or older table 2 shows that 16 of our participants are aged 65 years or older the variable rural area takes a value 1 if participants stated that they live in a rural area and 0 if they live in an urban area table 2 shows that 35 of our participants live in a rural areathe variables emotional tolerance and financial tolerance are dummy variables that take the value 1 if the participant answered that the maximum time from the time of taking the survey heshe would be able to emotionally or financially sustain social distancing was 14 days or longer given the 14-day recommended time to self-isolate if you test positive for covid-19 these variables take the value 0 if their stated maximum time was 13 days or less table 2 shows that 84 of participants stated that they can afford to continue their current level of social distancing for 14 days or more while 87 stated that they can emotionally tolerate another 14 days or more of their current level of social distancingthe variable lifestyle impact  healthy is an index that measures the extent to which social distancing has changed participants behavior in a healthier direction participants were assigned a value 1 for each of the following if they stated that social distancing had a increased consumption of vegetables b decreased in-between-meals snacking excluding fruits and vegetables c increased time spent in green spaces d increased time spent doing strenuous or e moderate exercising and f reduced stress this variable could take a value between 0 and 6 where higher values represent healthier changes the variable lifestyle impact  unhealthy is an index that measures the extent to which social distancing has changed behavior in an unhealthy direction participants were assigned a value 1 for each of the following if they stated that social distancing had a decreased consumption of vegetables b increased in-between-meals snacking excluding fruits and vegetables c decreased time spent in green spaces d decreased time spent doing strenuous or e moderate exercising and f increased stress this variable could also take a value between 0 and 6 where higher values represent a higher number of unhealthy changes the summary statistics in table 2 suggest that social distancing has led to more unhealthy behavior than it has healthy behavior as implied by the lower mean value of lifestyle impact  healthy we note however that these variables are crude measures of the lifestyle impact from social distancing where each change is given equal weight although some changes might have a more important health effect than others1the variable business impact takes a value 1 if a participant is a business owner whose business has experienced negative impacts due to covid-19 such as their operation losing income going out of business or being at risk of going out of business the variable employer impact takes a value 1 if a participant is an employee and hisher employer has experienced a negative impact due to covid-19 such as their employer losing income or being at risk for going out of business if they had experienced pay cuts reduced working hours or were on unpaid leave as a result of the virus2
table 2 shows that of participants who are business owners or where until a month ago n  89 64 had experienced a negative impact on their business from covid-19 of participants who are employees or were until a month ago n  477 57 had experienced a negative impact on their job security payment or employer revenuesthe variable social distant compliant  6 feet measures how many people a participant has been close to in the last 3 days participants could state none 1 person 23 people 45 people 69 people 1015 people 1625 people 2650 people or more than 50 people we assigned participants the midpoint of the range they picked for those in the highest range 50 and more we assumed the same size interval as the second to highest interval ie we assumed an endpoint of the last interval equal to 75 people table 2 shows that the average number of people that participants had been close to during the last 3 days besides their household members was 576 although not reported in the table 2 the median was 25the variable social distant compliant  groups measures how many times during the last 3 days a participant has been in a room with 10 or more people participants could state a value anywhere between zero and 5 or more times the median of this variable is 0 table 2 shows that participants on average had been in a room with 10 or more people around 05 times during the last 3 daysthe variable self health risk measures the sum of 10 underlying health conditions that would put the participant at higher risk for developing severe health consequences if becoming infected with covid-19 these health conditions include chronic respiratory conditions heart disease neurological conditions diabetes and obesity cdc 2020 the variable child health risk measures the same sum of underlying health conditions for a child in the household the variable worry about own health is based on the stated extent to which participants worry about their own health due to covid-19 where the value 0 indicates not at all and the value 3 indicates a lotthe dummy variable insurance takes a value 1 if a participant states that heshe has private health insurance or is covered by medicare or medicaid and 0 if the participant stated not having any coverage table 2 shows that 69 of participants have insurance or medicare or medicaid coverage the dummy variables republican democrat and other political party take a value 1 if a participant identifies as republican democrat or neither and 0 otherwise about 34 of participants identify as republican 43 as democrat and 23 as otherthe variable extrovert is based on the extraversion scale developed by francis et al 1992 and includes participants answers to questions such as are you a talkative person and can you easily get some life into a rather dull party in addition to the extraversion scale we also asked participants to indicate their level of agreement with statements about their general social lifestyle such as my social life is very important to me and in my spare time my favorite thing to do is to spend time with friends if the participant answered yes to three or more of these questions they were assigned a 1 for the extrovert dummy variable the answers to these statements were however highly correlated with the extraversion scale so they were excluded from our analysis because they provided little or no additional informationwhen we pool participants from both treatments who had not been tested prior to participating in our study n  897 we find that 69 of participants would be willing to take a costless covid-19 test3 we find no difference in shares of participants willing to test across treatments pearson 2 1619 p  0203 suggesting that the location of self-isolation at home or in a facility away from home in the event the test comes back positive is not an important determinant of peoples willingness to test for covid-19 not only is the treatment effect small it is also of the unexpected sign  the share of people willing to test if self-isolation would happen at home is smaller 67 than the share of people willing to test if self-isolation might happen at a facility away from home 71 if anything people might be slightly more inclined to test if a positive result could lead to isolation away from home potentially due to this also signaling the greater severity of the covid-19 situation but the size of the effect is too small for us to detect with our sample size we have ruled out that this absence of identifiable average effect masks any potentially rational heterogeneity in the population ie we have explored whether there exists a treatment effect for subgroups of the population such as those with children higher-quality homes as measured by income or health anxiety as measured by underlying health conditions one interpretation of the absence of treatment effect is that people assign little weight to the personal cost associated with the location of self-isolating when they decide on whether to take a covid-19 testwe pool participants from both treatments and examine the determinants of willingness to test we estimate a probit model table 3 shows the resulting average marginal effects
concerns about own health are captured by the variable worry about own health the results in table 3 imply that the more a person worries about their health due to covid-19 the more likely they are to take a test the inclusion of this variable in our model also renders the coefficient for the variable that measures underlying health conditions ie self health risk small and statistically insignificant if worry about own health is excluded from the regression self health risk has the expected positive and statistically significant effect on willingness to test we do not find that people with children who have underlying health conditions are more likely to take the test perhaps due to the expectation that people of young age are less affected this result remains robust if we recode the variable child health risk into a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if any child in the household has one or more underlying health conditionsvariables that affect a persons financial situation do not seem to matter to the willingness to take a covid-19 test in particular we do not find an effect from business impact or employer impact we examine the robustness of these findings to alternative measures of business and employer impact first we instead include the multitude of variables underlying business impact and employer impact in the regression model see footnote 2 but we do not find an effect from any of those variables that is close to statistically significant at even the 10 level furthermore we do not find an effect on willingness to test from financial tolerance second we recode the variables such that they range from little impact to severe impact ranging from if a business owner or employee has experienced no adverse effects from covid-19 to one or multiple effects again we find no statistically significant effects from these variables on the willingness to test taken together these results suggest that people do not consider their own private costs from a positive test when deciding on taking a covid-19 test similarly we find no effect on the willingness to test from emotional tolerance implying that the private emotional cost from social isolation in the event of a positive test might not affect the decision to take a covid-19 testwe find that healthy younger people are more likely to take a test than healthy older people as implied by the negative parameter estimate for high-risk age this age effect is consistent with findings in other studies that observe older people avoid health-related information more than younger people thunstrm et al 2016 gigerenzer  garcia-retamero 2017 while this result could imply that older people are more likely to be willfully ignorant it is also in line with the idea that those with more social interactions younger people are more likely to get tested studies find that people below 60 years old have more social contacts and therefore are more likely to transmit infectious diseases mossong et al 2008 furthermore we find that those who have met more people during the last 3 days are more willing to take the test as suggested by the negative parameter estimate for social distance compliant  6 feet furthermore the potential super-spreaders  the extroverts  are more likely by 8 to take a test compared to the introverts taken together this suggests that social benefits weight heavily in peoples decisions to test those most at risk to spread covid-19 are the most willing to get testedwe find that republicans are 13 less likely than democrats to get tested we speculate that this might be due to different information sources and because the risks of covid-19 might be portrayed differently in liberal and conservative popular and social media we examined the robustness of this result by including a conservatism scale everett 2013 in the probit regression and the result remains the same people who are more conservative are less likely to want to take a covid-19 test the conservatism scale is however not included in the final model given its high correlation with the political dummy variablesfinally we find that people with health insurance or coverage from medicare or medicaid are around 8 more likely to take the test this result might suggest that people who lack health care coverage use willful ignorance as a means to reduce anxiety about how to deal with a diagnosis this would be in line with previous studies that suggest willful ignorance of health diagnoses may be motivated by the drive to reduce anxiety about the future eg oster et al 2013our results are robust to the inclusion of other explanatory variables such as race education income and profession with high exposure to infected people health care worker store clerk etc but these variables lack explanatory power or are highly correlated with other explanatory variables included in table 3the tests conducted prior to participating in our study were neither randomly offered to people so far testing for covid-19 in the usa has been primarily of individuals who showed symptoms nor costless 52 of those who had tested prior to participating in our study stated the tests were financially costly and 60 said testing was time consuming the value of data on observed testing is limited when it comes to helping us understand whether people might purposefully ignore such tests while acknowledging that we still compare our identified determinants of testing in table 3 to the determinants of having taken a test before participating in our study see online supplementary material while the levels of statistical significance vary all coefficients are of the same sign as those in table 3 except for four variables having taken a test before participating in our study seems to be positively affected by having spent more time in groups with 10 or more people ie social distance compliant  groups as well as by a child having underlying health conditions ie child health risk employer impact has a weakly statistically significant positive effect on testing prior to participating in our study while it is not statistically significant in table 3 insurance is not a statistically significant determinant of having been tested prior to participating in our study while it does have an effect in table 3widespread testing is one of the most important actions that us governments at any level can undertake to help slow down the spread of covid-19 given budget and testing supply constraints it is likely that random but voluntary testing will be the most effective policy we design a survey to examine the risks from self-selection into taking a covid-19 testoverall we observe that around 70 of people would agree to a costless covid-19 test we find that people who are more worried about their own health due to covid-19 are more likely to test as are young healthy people relative to older healthy people ability to afford self-isolation for 14 days does not seem to affect the decision to test furthermore people who worry more about their health and people with health insurance or health coverage through medicare or medicaid are more likely to take the test as are people identifying as democrats compared to republicanscontrary to our expectation we also find that potential super-spreaders are more likely than other individuals to agree to a costless covid-19 it could be that extroverts are more willing than expected to take a covid-19 test because their private cost of doing so is unusually low due to the broadly implemented social distancing at the time of data collection for this study if extroverts are already relatively isolated ie due to a stay-at-home order and mandated closures by the state governor of public spaces such as gyms restaurants and bars the personal cost of testing might be low furthermore extroverts might be more likely to get infected if they socialize more which could be a selfish motivation to get tested however we control for the current level of compliance with social distancing which should address both of these private motivations for increased probability of testing and we find that people who comply more are less motivated to take the test we also control for their worry about own health due to covid-19 even so the positive effect on willingness to test from being an extrovert persists we therefore conclude that the positive effect of being an extrovert on willingness to test for covid-19 is likely due to social health benefits weighing more heavily in their decision than their private costs from potential self-isolation for 14 days should the test come back positive the importance of the prosocial motive in determining covid-19 testing is consistent with the results of the study by jordan et al 2020 who find that prosocial messages are more effective than self-interested messages in promoting behavior that prevent the spread of covid-19 eg hand washing hand shaking huggingour results suggest that the risks of adverse selection in terms of failing to target the people most likely to spread the virus in testing for covid-19 might be fairly low this underscores the value of widespread testing even if it cannot be truly random and the importance of making such testing available nationwide in the usa as soon as possiblean important shortcoming of our analysis is that it builds on hypothetical survey data it is well documented that survey answers may be affected by a hypothetical bias meaning that people answer one way in a survey and behave in a different way when faced with real incentivized decisions this risk pertains to our study as well and the hypothetical bias might be particularly pronounced if the choice to test for covid-19 is regarded as prosocial several studies suggest that a hypothetical bias is particularly likely when measuring prosocial behavior  people often exaggerate the extent to which they engage in such behavior eg murphy et al 2005 vossler et al 2012 jacquemet et al 2013 furthermore it is possible that personal costs to the testing decision are less salient in a hypothetical context once testing is more widespread in the usa it will be important to examine who actually chooses to get tested and the extent to which they deviate from the general population that said hypothetical and incentivized behavior generally correlate such that an analysis like ours can provide important insights into the potential pitfalls of voluntary testing prior to the actual testing this is useful information to have on hand when designing an efficient and cost-effective testing strategythe novel coronavirus infectious disease caused by the coronavirus is commonly known as covid-19 it has become the greatest challenge the history has ever seen started from wuhan city of china earlier this year it spread to the rest of the world in a few months and was declared a pandemic by the un it has paralyzed life across the globe the main cause of the virus is yet to be discovered but it is presumed that it has emerged in one the biggest animal market in the chinese city of wuhan 1 2 3 so far it has engulfed more than 210 countries of the world and according to who statistics the virus has affected around 6 million people across the world and more than 300 thousand people have died so far 1 2 3 the recovery rate is higher than the mortality rate however the ratio varies from country to country and region to region usa is the most affected country which is the epicenter of the virus followed by europe 2 scientists are struggling to discover or invent a vaccine for the treatment but it is yet to be discovered the question how long it will last is on everyones lips although research is in a very early stage and with the passage of time things will unfold the scientists are trying to dig out the main symptoms and causes of transmission however according to the information available the main symptoms are high fever severe chest pain continuous dry coughing body aches headache and difficulty in the respiratory system the spread according to available information is droplets produced by an infected person during coughing and sneezing and physical contacts etc 4covid-19 pandemic has caused great damage not only to human lives and health it has multidimensional effects it not only exposed the weak health infrastructure even in the most advanced countries of the world but also badly affected the world economy almost the entire world is on lockdown and all the economic and business activities are halted it has shocked the largest economies of the world ie china and usa where the economic slowdown is observed since the outbreak of coronavirus the third world countries particularly pakistan are the prime targets of the economic devastation millions of people have lost their jobs in the past few months poor countries are unable to repay their debts they are even unable to support poor citizens who cannot earn their livelihood the social and political lives of the nations are affected badly people across the world have severed social relations they avoid meeting each other even in the gravest times governments of all the countries have diverted their attention and resources to cope with the challenge of this mysterious disease and thus no political activity is visiblelike other countries in the world covid-19 pandemic poses a huge threat to both humans health and economy in pakistan this infection is even more devastating in pakistan because the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions ie make social-distancing and community lockdowns are certainly very tough for a society like pakistan the government is unable to afford a strict nationwide lockdown the covid-19 first case was reported on 26 february 2020 in karachi which was a student come back from iran later only within three weeks the infection spread in all four provinces gilgit-baltistan azad jammu and kashmir and the federal territory of islamabad the total number of confirmed infected cases raised to 2291 across the nation and 252 new cases were reported on 1 april due to the rapid growth of infected people across the country the government of pakistan decided to put the whole nation under strict lockdown and later extended twice until 9 may due to a worse situation currently the situation in pakistan is worse and the number of confirmed cases crossed the cases reported in mainland china pakistan is placed 17th in the list of highly reported infected cases and deaths by countries territories or areas 5 6 with a total of more than 100000 confirmed covid-19 cases about 31000 patients are fully recovered and 1900 people lost their lives due to this deadly infection 7 8mathematical models are very useful in helping us to understand the transmission dynamics and control of emerging and re-emerging communicable diseases one of the main challenges that mankind is facing nowadays is predicting the severity and suggest suitable public health intervention strategies to curtail the covid-19 pandemic recently a number of mathematical models have been proposed to explore the transmission patterns of covid-19 pandemic in 9 the authors formulated a deterministic model to explore the impact of various public interventions on the dynamic and mitigation covid-19 in ontario canada in 10 a mathematical model based on nonlinear differential equations is presented to study the dynamics of covid-19 infection in highly affected countries that are china italy and france a fractional-order covid-19 model with the atangana-bleanu-caputo operator is proposed by khan and atangana 11 and implemented the model to analyze the infection in wuhan the role of lockdown in the absence of effective vaccines and treatment in order to mitigate the covid-19 pandemic is analyzed in 12 the author has used the novel fractional-fractal operators to formulate the proposed mathematical model 12 in 13 a transmission model is formulated to predict the cumulative covid-19 cases in italy uk and usa the transmission dynamics of covid-19 in mexico are studied using mathematical and computational models in 14 the influence of non-pharmaceutical controls including quarantine hospitalization or self-isolation contact-tracing and the use of a face mask on the dynamics of covid-19 pandemic in the population of new york state and the entire usa is studied in detail in 15the present study proposes a new transmission model to analyze the dynamics and impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the covid-19 in pakistan initially we develop the model without optimal control variables and provide a good fit to the reported cases and then estimate the model parameters using a nonlinear least square curve fitting approach further the model is reformulated by adding two times dependent control variables the rest of the manuscript is organized as the mathematical formulation of the covid-19 model is presented in section 2 basic mathematical analysis including stability results of disease-free equilibrium is explored in section 3 the model fitting to reported cases and estimation of parameters is done in section 4 the simulation results of without optimal control model are shown in section 5 the global sensitivity analysis and its graphical interpretation are depicted in section 6 the optimal control problem and its analysis of the covid-19 infection is presented in 7 finally a brief concluding remarks are given section in 8this section presents a brief description of the proposed model to study the dynamics and possible control of the covid-19 pandemic the model is developed by dividing the whole human population at any time t denoted by nt into eight mutually exclusive sub-groups depending on the disease status  these sub-groups are  susceptible   st  exposed or latent   et infected with the disease symptoms or symptomatically infectious it  asymptotically infectious   having    no clinical symptoms iat quarantined qt hospitalized iht critically infected or intensive care patients ict  and the recoveredremoved individuals   rt so that    ntstetitiatqtihtictrt the  infected individuals showing mild symptoms of the disease are also placed in the epidemiological class iat the quarantine and isolation should be either at home or the specific centers or hospitals designated by the government further the group  ih  stand for the patients admitted into hospital also contains those with clinical symptoms of the disease who are self-isolating at home  we further assume that hospitalized people may also transmit the infection after interacting with susceptible people the transmission dynamics of the covid-19 disease is expressed through the following system of the nonlinear differential equation1dsdtiiaihnssdedtiiaihnsedidte11idiadt1e2iadqdte1qdihdtiq22ihdicdtih33icdrdt1i2ia1q2ih3icr

the propose model 3 has a disease free equilibrium dfe given byw0s00000000000000
next we investigate the most important and crucial threshold quantity known as the basic reproduction number and generally denoted by r0 this parameter measures the average number of new covid-19 infected cases generated by a typical infected individual when introduced into a completely susceptible population the most common approach used to obtain r0 is the next-generation method presented in 16  the next generation  matrices obtained from the model 3 are  given as followsfiiaihsn00000vk1ek2iek3ia1ek4qek5ihiqk6icihthe corresponding jacobian matrices f and v evaluated at dfe is given as belowf000000000000000000000000000000000vk100000k2000010k300000k40000k500000k6
hence utilizing the definition r0fv1 where  represents the spectral radius we derived the following expression for the basic reproduction numberr0k4k3k51k2k5k2k3k1k2k3k4k5
in order to interpret the basic reproductive quantity we split the expression for r0 as followsr0r0ir0ar0hwhere7r0ik1k2r0a1k1k3r0hk4k2k1k2k4k5the first term r0i in 7 shows the average number of new  covid-19 infections generated by symptomatically-infectious individuals in the i class  this term  contains  the product of the infection rate in the i class the disease transmission rate  the fraction of exposed people  that completed the incubation period and move to the symptomatic stage k1 and  the average period spend  in the i compartment 1k2   the second constituent reproduction number r0a represents the number of new covid-19 infection cases generated by asymptomatically-infectious individuals in class ia  it is the product of infectious rate due to asymptomatic coivd-19 individuals    the fraction of latent people that completed the incubation period and move to the asymptomatic stage 1k1 and the average period spent in the asymptomatic class  1k3similarly the third constituent reproduction number r0h expresses the new covid-19 infection cases generated by hospitalizedisolated individuals  in particular the first term in  r0h represents the contribution into the hospitalized class by symptomatic infectious individuals in class i it is the product of infectious rate due to hospitalized individuals   the fraction of latent individuals that completed the incubation period and move to the asymptomatic stage 1k1 the portion of individuals that left the symptomatic class  i  and move to the hospitalized class ih k2 and the average duration in the hospitalized class 1k5 finally    the second term in   r0h expresses the contribution of quarantined individuals into the hospitalized classin this part we will prove the local and global stability of the model around the dfe the epidemiological implication of the stability result of dfe case is that a small influx of covid-19 infections cases will not generate a covid-19 outbreak if r01theorem 1

in order to present the main theme of the algorithm  firstly   the model 3  can be comprehensively expressed as10dydtftyyt0y0
the function f depends on time t the vectors of dependent or state  variables  y and unknown parameters  to be estimated the purpose of using the least square technique is to estimate  the best values  of model  parameter which is obtain   by minimizing the error between   the reported  data points ytl and the solution of the model ytl associated with the model parameters  the objective function used in the minimization  procedure   is given as11l1nytlytl2
where n denotes the  available actual data points to obtain the model parameters  we aimed to minimize the following objective function12minsubjecttoeq10for more detail about this technique please see 19 21 and reference thereinwe investigate the proposed model fit to the reported covid-19 infected cases in pakistan using the above approach the reported cases are shown in figure 1  the model is solved using ode45 rk4 technique package which is a solver for the initial value problem in matlab then we implemented the   lsqcurvefit package to fit the model to real data and to estimate the parameters the best fit to the reported data via our model is depicted in figure 2
  it can be seen that the model simulation is in good agreement with the real data the estimated and fitted parameters are given in table 1
   the approximate value of the reproduction number based on the estimated parameters is  r0187this section is devoted to  perform the simulation results of the covid-19 transmission model 3 the model is solved numerically using fd45 package in matlab which is base on the range-kutta fourth-order method the estimated parameter values given in table 1  are utilized in the simulation process in order to study the impact of various possible non-pharmaceutical interventions against the spread of covid-19   in pakistan      in the graphical results the various non-pharmaceutical control parameters are taken at their baseline values given in table 1  unless otherwise stated in captions   the effect of parameter   that represents the impact of effective contacts is shown in figure 3
 we have analyzed the impact of baseline social-distancing mild social-distancing 10 reduction in    moderate social-distancing  30 reduction in   and comparatively strict social-distancing  35 reduction in  on the disease transmission  it is observed from figure 3 that the enhancement in social-distancing significantly reduced the burden of cumulative new infected cases it is further observed that the implementation of a highly-effective social-distancing strategy ie at least 35 reduction in  dramatically reduces the cumulative new infected cases thus this graphical interpretation suggests that strict social-distancing measures that reduces the contacts between people including staying 2 meters apart or more preferably staying at home should be implemented by the government the impact of parameter  representing  the infectiousness rate due to asymptomatically-infected individuals is depicted in figure 4
 it can be seen that the reduction in    also significantly reduces the cumulative number of newly confirmed covid-19 infected cases this interpretation shows that the people who do not even know that they are infected ie those with mild or no symptoms are significantly contributing the disease burden  further the influence of parameter   the infectiousness rate due to covid-19 patient admitted in the hospital are depicted in figure 5
  it is observed that the reduction in this parameter has no reasonable impact on disease transmission   obviously the hospitalized covid-19 patients are isolated and no one is allowed to meet him the health care facilities are also supposed to follow strict standard operating procedure sop   during the treatment and look after of hospitalized patients therefore these infected individuals do not contribute greatly to the disease burdenwe further simulate the covid-19 model 3 by using the baseline parameter tabulated in table 1 and various of  by increasing with different level ie mild moderate and strict rates the resulting behavior is depicted in figure 6
showing that a strict quarantine or contact-tracing policy up to 70 enhancement to its baseline is needed to reduce the disease burden in pakistan  finally the impact of hospitalization or self-isolation of tested positive cases  is plotted in figure 7
  it is observed that this strategy is comparatively less effective than social-distancing and quarantine interventions these graphical  interpretations emphasize that  once a covid-19 infected case is diagnosed via testing that case must be rapidly isolated and hisher contacts quickly traced via effective contact-tracing and placed in quarantineglobal sensitivity analysis is one of the important aspects of mathematical modeling not only for epidemic models but in all sciences the global sensitivity analysis of the threshold quantity r0 is used to measure the effect of changes in the dominant factors of the model and to point out the most influential parameters of the model that greatly influence the prevalence of infection furthermore the sensitivity results provide a pathway to set effective and suitable control strategies to curtail the disease in a community more specifically this analysis is helpful to explore how the initial inputs to the model contribute to the system outputsa latin-hypercube sampling approach lhs coupled with the partial rank correlation coefficient prcc is commonly used for this purpose 22 this technique provides prcc and the corresponding p-values for each parameter the use of which can help estimate the level of uncertainty in an epidemic model the higher  prcc and smaller  p-value of a parameter indicating that it has a substantial effect on simulation behavior   the graphical prcc results of the covid-19 model associated parameters taken in this analysis are shown in   figure 8
  while the numerical values of prcc and corresponding p-values  are placed in table 2
  it is observed from table 2 and  figure 8 that  is considered to be the most sensitive parameter with high prcc value with a positive sign followed by    and   moreover   and

we present and discuss the graphical results of the covid-19 model 3 with constant quarantine and hospitalizationisolation control measures and the model 13 with time dependent control interventions and compared both results to perform the simulations both models are solved numerically using the rk4 technique the estimated and fitted parameters given in table 2 are used in the simulation results the time level is considered up to 150 units days the weight and balancing constants are chosen as a10001

a-d we have depicted the impact of hospitalization control only and keeping the quarantine or case tracing control inactive ie u10 and u
2  0 the control profile for this strategy is shown in 9 e it is observed that although the control u
2 is kept 100 for the first 70 days but still it has no significant impact on the different infected individuals as seen 9 a-d thus only the hospitalization or self-isolation intervention is not enough for the control of covid-19 pandemic in pakistanthe impact of only quarantine optimal control by keeping the hospitalization control zero ie u
1  0 and u20 is shown in 10
a-d the corresponding control profile for this case is depicted in 10 e it can be seen that by maintaining a strict quarantine control is very effective in minimizing the spread of the covid-19 infectionfinally the impact of both optimal controls on the dynamics of covid-19 burden is analyzed the graphical results are depicted in figure 10 a-d while the control profile is shown in 10 e it can be observed from 10 a-d that the number of exposed symptomatically-infected asymptomatically-infected and critically-infected individuals are decreasing very significant when the optimal quarantined and hospitalization controls are applied rather than the constant case the effectiveness can be viewed from the difference between the peaks of the two graphs from the control profile depicted in figure 10 e it can be seen that the control u
1 is kept initially at 100 for 140 days and gradually reduces towards the end of the intervention while the control u
2 is set to 55 and then immediately increases to 90 in the initial days and then gradually reduced during the rest of the interventionthe covid-19 pandemic has rapidly spread out to most of the regions of the world and has severe public health and socio-economic burden in developed and devolving countries including pakistan the number of reported cases in pakistan is increasing and more than 100000 confirmed cases have been reported till 05 june 2020 in the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or antiviral the whole humans community is being focused on the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions against the covid-19 pandemic in this study we formulated a mathematical model in order to study the dynamics of covid-19 pandemic in pakistan and used it to assess the community-wide impact of the various control and mitigation strategies initially we developed the model and presented some mathematical analysis including positivity and stability results of the disease-free equilibrium it is proven that the disease-free equilibrium is stable both locally and globally when r01 the model is parameterized from the covid-19 confirmed cases reported till may 28 2020 in pakistan while some parameters are estimated from literature the findings show that the model predicted infected curve is in good agreement to the real infected cases the estimated numerical value of the basic reproduction is obtained as r0187 showing the alarming situation of the pandemic in pakistan the control and mitigation strategies should be implemented to bring the threshold quantity r0 to a value less than unity after the estimation of model parameters we simulated the model to explore the effectiveness of various control strategies implemented in pakistan firstly we presented the impact of three effectiveness levels ie low or mild moderate and strict of social-distancing in curtailing the burden of covid-19 the simulation results revealed that although the implementation of mild social-distancing decreased the covid-19 burden significantly as measured in terms of shifting and lowering the peak of daily infected cases still a strict social-distancing measures should be implemented and maintained for an extended period of time to avoid a significant outbreak in pakistan further we simulated the model to assess the effect of various levels of quarantine and hospitalization or self-isolation interventions with a highly-effective quarantine intervention enhanced by 70 to its baseline value a dramatic reduction in the pandemic peak was observed on the other hand increase of hospitalization intervention of confirmed cases had no significant influence on the pandemic burden finally the proposed covid-19 model is reformulated by the inclusion of two time-dependent control variables in order to assess the impact of optimal control measures on disease dynamics we simulated the control model and compared the effect of constant and optimal time-dependent control measures on disease burden it is observed from the simulation results of the control covid-19 model that the infected individuals significantly decrease with the implementation of both time-dependent control measuresalthough it is impressive that pakistan ramps up daily diagnostic covid-19 testing and contact tracing to have a realistic measure of the burden of the nationwide pandemic and emphasize personal hygiene and hand washing physical-distancing wearing face masks in public still this study suggests that the implementation of basic non-pharmaceutical interventions particularly social-distancing quarantine or self-isolation or stay at home should be strictly observed in the future to avoid the worse scenario in pakistan it is also believed that the present study will be beneficial to the decision-making in combating the disease in the near future we will extend the present model by introducing the fractional operators with local and nonlocal kernel to gain more insights about the dynamics of covid-19 pandemic
saif ullah conceptualization methodology software data curation writing - original draft muhammad altaf khan visualization investigation supervision validation writing - review  editingno conflict of interest exists regarding the publications of this papersevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a highly transmissible coronavirus that has spread around the world causing an epidemic outbreak 1 sars-cov-2 is a virus which can be transmitted to humans in a similar way to other coronaviruses like sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov 2 human-to-human transmission occurs via respiratory droplets secreted by infected patients when they cough or sneeze some of these droplets can be directly be inhaled by individuals nearby others can contaminate neighbouring hard surfaces as a result a susceptible individual can contract the virus by touching a contaminated surface and then their face this indirect mechanism of transmission is important in the case of sars-cov-2 because stable sars-cov-2 can remain on some type of surfaces like plastic and stainless steel for a few days 3infected individuals with coronavirus disease covid-19 do not develop symptoms immediately upon contracting the virus indeed one of the main features of covid-19 is the relatively important period of incubation the median value for covid-19 incubation period was estimated at 51 days 4 however a recent study suggested pre-symptomatic transmission of covid-19 5 in other words infected individuals start transmitting the disease a few hours or days before the end of the incubation period this mode of silent transmission could be a driver of the disease spread sars-cov-2 causes moderate to severe clinical outcomes in 20  of infected patients 6in the absence of effective vaccines or therapeutics non-pharmaceutic interventions npis were adopted as a strategy to slow down the disease propagation some of these control measures aim to reduce the probability of infection transmission during direct contact for example by promoting hygiene practices and cough etiquette other measures like social distancing and the closing of schools and workplaces reduce the opportunities of human-to-human transmission the rest of the interventions like the disinfection of public areas aim to reduce the chances of indirect transmission while all of these measures slow down the propagation of the epidemic 7 the impact of each of these npis on the epidemic dynamics of covid-19 remains hard to quantifymathematical modelling can be used to gain a deeper understanding of the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases compartmental models provide a theoretical framework to study disease transmission in a population of individuals 8 these compartmental models can be implemented using a wide range of modelling methods the simplest form of compartmental models uses ordinary differential equations to describe population dynamics during an epidemic susceptible-infected-recovered sir models are one of the most commonly used compartmental models 9 they describe the evolution of the number of infected individuals in a closed population a recently published sir model was used to quantify the effect of quarantine on the spread of covid-19 10 another class of widely used models consider four population classes susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered seir models 11 these models are most suitable to describe the spread of diseases with a long incubation period which is the case of the covid-19 outbreak in this context an seir was recently developed and used to conduct a data-driven analysis of covid-19 spread 12 other recent studies used seir models to estimate the basic reproduction number of this pandemic 13 14 a more complex compartmental study was used to evaluate the capacity of the healthcare system in responding to covid-19 propagation 15 the impact of the control measures that were adopted to mitigate the covid-19 outbreak in china was evaluated using another compartmental model 16 while another study assessed the effect of unreported cases 17 on the outbreak dynamics compartmental models implemented using odes can be studied both analytically and numerically partial differential equations pdes can be used to implement compartmental models to study the spatio-temporal dynamics of an epidemic in this context systems of reaction-diffusion equations can be used with to describe the spatial densities of populations such that the diffusion term represents the motility of individuals in a computational domain 18 numerical simulations of these models show the propagation of the disease in the form of travelling wavesmulti-agent systems represent another framework which was extensively used to study the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases the advantage of this approach is the possibility to accurately capture the interactions between individuals in these models each individual is represented as an agent that can communicate with the neighbouring individuals and with the environment sometimes inter-agents communication is described using a dynamic network 19 20 other times the motion of agents is modelled and communications occur between neighbouring individuals in this case population movement and inter-agent communication can be described using cellular automata 21 22 social force models provide a more accurate description of pedestrian motion 23 in these models each agent aims to reach its desired velocity while keeping a certain distance from other agents the effect of neighbouring individuals on the agent is described using a socio-psychological force this approach can be used to describe the complex dynamics of crowds which involve several interacting individuals social force models can be applied to study the dynamics of infection spread in crowds and under realistic conditions for example a social force model was used to describe the infection propagation in airplanes 24 although more complex agent-based models can yield results which are in a good agreement with simpler odes models 25multi-scale modelling is a mechanism-based approach which aims to integrate the effects of regulatory mechanisms across multiple scales of space and time 26 hybrid discrete-continuous model benefits from the advantages of both the agent-based framework and the equation-based representation 27 these models were developed to describe biological systems 28 29 in multi-scale models infection dynamics are represented at the host and the population levels 30 the advantage of this approach is the possibility to integrate available data and knowledge across multiple scales of description in this context collected data was used to calibrate several multi-scale models of the foot-and-mouth epidemic 31 multi-scale models provide a rich description of the infection dynamics at the individual and environment levels than multi-agent models 32as of april 27 2020 sars-cov-2 is a newly discovered coronavirus the available data and knowledge about covid-19 epidemics remain insufficient as a result it is hard to quantify the effectiveness of each non-pharmaceutical intervention in slowing down the spread of the pandemic to gain a better understanding of the epidemic features of covid-19 we develop a hybrid multi-scale model that describes the transmission dynamics of this disease at both the individual and population levels we represent individuals as agents that move in a square computational domain their displacement is described using a social force model infective agents can transmit the virus through direct contact with susceptible individuals they can also contaminate the neighbouring surfaces by secreting droplets which contain the virus the concentration of stable sars-cov-2 on hard surfaces is described with a partial differential equation infected individuals do not develop symptoms until the end of the incubation period however they can start transmitting the virus before the onset of symptoms the chances of survival of patients depend on their age and health conditions we use the model to study the early transmission dynamics of covid-19 in italy where control measures were relaxed next we study the risk of virus transmission in crowds moving under panic then we investigate the impact of pre-symptomatic transmission on the spread of the disease after that we quantify the effect of the effect of sars-cov-2 persistence on hard surfaces on the epidemic curve finally we use the model to assess the potential of restricted population movement in slowing down the epidemic progressionwe study the dynamics of virus transmission in a population of agents that move in random directions each agent is represented by a circular particle of mass mi and radius ri as represented in figure 2

infective individuals secrete droplets which contain sars-cov-2 when they cough or sneeze these droplets transmit the virus if they get inhaled by other individuals directly they can also contaminate neighbouring surfaces which can lead to the subsequent infection of susceptible persons we consider both of these modes of transmission in our model to describe direct contact transmission we consider that each infective agent will probably transmit the virus to susceptible agents if the distance between them is less than one meter direct transmission depends on certain events such as sneezing coughing or handshaking thus we can assume that person-to-person transmission follows a bernoulli distribution we consider that the susceptible agent has a probability pd of being infected upon contact with the contagious one this probability can depend on the compliance with non-pharmaceutical measures such as the wearing of mask handwashing and cough etiquetteindirect transmission occurs when infective individuals contaminate the neighbouring hard surfaces these individual transmit the virus to the surrounding surfaces by touch or through secreted droplets if they cough or sneeze to simulate indirect contact we first describe the normalized concentration of stable sars-cov-2 on hard surfaces4ctwcwhere c is the normalized concentration of deposited sars-cov-2 on hard surfaces w is the averaged rate of sars-cov-2 secretion by contagious agents  is the decay rate of the virus the daily probability of contracting the virus by indirect trnasmission is estimated as5pincxiwhere  is a positive constant taken smaller than one note that for each agent indirect transmission can occur only once every day it is evaluated at a random moment of the day for each agentwe solve equation 4 on a computational grid of 250    250 nodes using the euler explicit scheme before solving this equation we spread the production rate of secreted virus by infective individuals w to the computational grid using a radial basis functiond141cosdd0ifdd00ifdd0where d is the distance between the node and the center of the agent d
0 is the characteristic distance which describes the extent to which secreted droplets can infect the neighbouring surfaces we take d02m to simulate indirect transmission we evaluate the local concentration of stable sars-cov-2 at the center of susceptible agents we compute this value using bilinear interpolation default values of transmission parameters are provided in table 2
infected individuals develop symptoms as soon as the period of incubation is elapsed however they become contagious and start spreading the disease a day before the end of this period 38 the incubation period falls within the range of 2-14 days with a mean of 51 days we use a log-normal distribution fitted using clinical data 4 to sample the values of the incubation period for each agent after the development of mild symptoms agents keep moving in the computational domain and transmitting the disease for a few days until the symptoms become more severe then they become isolated and go into quarantine at home or in a hospital we model this period of isolation by considering that the patient stops moving transmitting the virus and interacting with other agents the outcome of this period will be either the death or the survival of the patient if the agent survives then it becomes immunized to infection and starts moving again the considered covid-19 epidemiological characteristics in the model are provided in table 3
the mortality rate of each agent depends on the characteristics of the agent age risk factors as described below the median time from hospital admission to death is 13 days 39 the median time from hospital admission to discharge for surviving patients is approximately 202 days we have represented the clinical used course for infected patients in figure 3
in our model the mortality risk by covid-19 depends on the age and health conditions of each patient children are not considered in the present study because they rarely develop symptoms upon contracting covid-19 we assign an age to each individual agent for this purpose we use a distribution representing the age structure of a population of sampled agents the age of the agents determine the risk of covid-19-related mortality as shown in table 4
6 each agent can also have one or many of the following risk factors cardiovascular diseases blood pressure diabetes cancer and chronic respiratory diseases the prevalence of each of these risk factors and the corresponding death probability are given in table 5
7 one of the core assumptions of the model is that we consider the maximum among the probabilities of death caused by the age and the risk factors for example if a patient is aged 82 and has diabetes the death probability will be 148 which corresponds to the rate of mortality by old age and not because of diabetesthe code was written in c in the object-oriented programming oop style the gnu scientific library gsl was used for the sampling of random variables the average cpu time for numerical simulations of transmission dynamics in 90 days is around 35 hours on a computer with four cores and 6 gb of ram results were post-processed using the software paraview and python scripts the code is available and can be accessed at httpsgithubcommps7sim-covwe begin by considering the case of low-dense population 1pedm2 the socio-psychological force is not taken into account as we do not consider social distancing we begin by validating the model by considering a case where npis are relaxed to do this we reproduce data of covid-19 outbreak in calabria italy 40 by fitting the probabilities of direct and indirect transmission in the model pd and pin the values of transmission probabilities which give a good agreement are pd004 and 0002 the number of covid-19 tests in this region is estimated to be around 7500 tests figure 4
shows a comparison of the simulated number of cases and the reported ones in calabria after model calibration the model displays a similar growth factor as the reported one in data of active infected cases in calabria as well as the other regions of italyafter model calibration we study the dynamics of disease transmission under relaxed epidemic control measures we run a numerical simulation and we study the evolution of agent populations the mean age of the sampled population is 4505 and 53  of sampled individuals have at least one of the five risk factors considered in the model the simulation starts by introducing one infected agent to the computational domain the exponential growth of infected agents begins approximately 14 days after that in this phase the cumulative number of infected agents doubles in approximately every four days we have represented the evolution of the active and cumulative fraction of infected agents in figure 7
 athe peak of the outbreak is reached in day 31 at this time the fraction of simultaneously active infected agents reached 80  64  of them are symptomatic and 37  are quarantined figure 7 b the outbreak is resolved by day 67 at this time only one quarantined patient remains and 916  of agents are immunized as shown in figure 7 c the model predicts that in the absence of any control intervention the disease will infect 984  of the system population by the of the simulation time the model predicts that the case fatality rate cfr is 65  note that these values can slightly change from one simulation to another because of the stochastic noises caused by the relatively low number of agents snapshots of numerical simulations showing the different stages of the epidemic are provided in figure 6 the concentration of stable sars-cov-2 on hard surfaces reaches its maximal value during the peak of the outbreak this suggests that indirect tranmission become more frequent as the diseases propagatessocial distancing or physical distancing is a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions which aim to increase the minimal distance between people social-distancing is effective in slowing down the epidemic progress because it prevents contacts between individuals however it is hard to accurately estimate that minimal distance that should be kept between individuals to avoid contacts in crowds and especially in panic situations indeed keeping a distance from everyone becomes hard when an individual is moving inside a crowd of panicking people to assess the risk of infection spread in crowds we run numerical simulations of high-density crowds and we estimate the frequency of person-to-person contact first we study the effect of density on crowd dynamics in the absence of the socio-psychological force we define a contact as the situation where the distance between the two agents is smaller to the sum of their radius figure 7 a shows the exponential growth of the contact frequency as the agent density increases then we introduce the socio-pyschological force and we study the impact of its magnitude  on the contact frequency in the crowd the magnitude of the socio-psychological force quantifies the tendency of individuals to comply with social distancing measures figure 7 b illustrates the evolution of the contact frequency as a function of the magnitude of the socio-psychological force for two density values as expected the contact frequency decreases as the magnitude grows however this frequency can still be important for average magnitudes of the socio-psychological force in high-density crowdsin normal situations the amplitude of the desired velocity vd is sampled from a normal distribution with an average of 134ms1 and a standard deviation equal to 026ms1 usually agents keep the desired minimal distance between them if they walk at this speed in uncrowded areas on the other hand contact frequency increases significantly when agents are under panic vd3ms1 or if they move in a dense crowd 15pedm2 in this case the number of contacts can be minimized only if the magnitude of the socio-psychological force is very high figure 7 c shows the contact frequency as a function of both amplitudes of the desired velocity and the socio-psychological force in a crowd with a density equal to 15pedm2 these findings suggest that individuals will no longer keep the minimal distance between them as a safety measure when they are under panic this scenario was observed in train and metro stations for example in italy and in india when a large number of people attempted to travel a few days before the start of the curfew therefore it is important to think about other control measures such as the use of restricted access and obstacles to reduce the flow of peoplenext we consider a fixed value for the magnitude of the socio-psychological force taken equal to 2000kgms2 and we change the desired distance that agents aim to keep between them d
0 in figure 7 d we represent the contact frequency as a function of the amplitude of the desired speed and the distance that agents wish to keep between them d
0 as before we notice the contact frequency decreases when the desired distance is higher than 15 m this indicates that the measures which aim to maintain a distance of one metre between individuals may not be sufficient to prevent contacts in dense crowds under panicin the remainder of this paper we study the effect of transmission dynamics in uncrowded areas with a density equal to 1 pedm2 we do not consider the socio-psychological force as we no longer consider social distancing several studies have suggested the possibility of pre-symptomatic transmission in covid-19 5 41 42 however it is not clear if this pre-symptomatic transmission significantly affects the dynamics of the epidemic to investigate this hypothesis we suppose that infected individuals start transmitting the disease before the onset of symptoms we run three simulations reflecting different periods of pre-symptomatic transmission h no pre-symptomatic transmission 24 h and 48h simulations predict that adding twenty-four hours to the period of pre-symptomatic transmission accelerates the onset of the exponential growth by approximately five days decreasing the period of pre-symptomatic period also flattens the epidemic curve of covid-19 as shown in figure 8
 this suggests that the early diagnostic for covid-19 will flatten the epidemic curve the isolation of pre-symptomatic carriers should significantly slow down the spread of the diseasean important feature of sars-cov-2 is its ability to persist for a few hours to a few days on hard surfaces in fact sars-cov-2 is more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard 3 the half-life time of the virus varies from 2 hours to 10 hours depending on the surface type to evaluate the effect of sars-cov-2 persistence on its transmission dynamics we compare the output of three numerical simulations we run each simulation with the same parameter set except for the sars-cov-2 decay rate  which corresponds to three values of sars-cov-2 half-life times on hard surfaces 2 h 4 h and 8 h the results show that the epidemic dynamics remain the same except for the value of infected individuals reached during the peak of the outbreak figure 9
to further investigate this effect we count the number of direct and indirect transmissions in each simulation in the normal case where the half-life time is 4 h the percent of indirect transmissions was 23  most of these transmissions took place during the peak of the outbreak because the virus concentration is high at this moment increasing the persistence of the virus resulted in a higher proportion of indirect transmission to 281  while reducing the half-life time of the stable virus decreases the rate of indirect transmission to 198  disinfection of public areas reduces the concentration of stable sars-cov-2 on hard surfaces therefore we expect it to decrease the number of indirect transmissions and to reduce the reached number of infected individuals during the outbreak peaklockdown is an emergency control measure which aims to reduce the movement of the total or a part of the population it can be used to mitigate the spread of highly infections diseases such as covid-19 however a full lockdown is a costly solution as it causes the arrest of all economic activities we investigate the effect of partial lockdown on disease spread by considering that only a proportion of the population can move the model predicts that higher the number of motionless agents is the flatter the epidemic curve will be figure 10
 a in other words the slope of the exponential growth decreases as the number of immobile agents grows the cumulative fraction of infected patients is also reduced as shown in figure 10 b restricted population movement also decreases the proportion of infected agents figure 10 c and the number of infected individuals reached during the peak of the outbreak figure 10 d as a result partial lockdown measures reduce the number of deceased patients as shown in figure 10 ewe compare the model predictions with the reported data of the cumulative number of hospitalized patients in wuhan china 43 to achieve this we fit both the percent of immobile agents and other model parameters we notice that reducing the percent of mobile agents flattens the epidemic curve however it does not delay the onset of the exponential growth in a similar way to the reported epidemic curve for the case of wuhan china therefore we have reduced the probabilities of transmission by approximately four times to observe roughly the same epidemic curve figure 11
this paper is devoted to the study of covid-19 transmission dynamics using a specific multi-scale model we calibrated the model using available data on the cumulative number of reported cases in two situations one for relaxed control measures calabria italy and the other with strict non-pharmaceutical interventions wuhan china the proposed model has several features which makes it suitable for the quantification of the effects of control measures on both the individual and population levels first we have used a microscopic social force model to describe the motion of agents as a result we were able to properly study the effect of social distancing in crowded areas numerical simulations with this model revealed that these measures do not prevent the transmission of the disease in high-density areas especially when agents move under panic next we considered the mode of indirect disease transmission which depends on the virus concentration on contaminated surfaces this transmission mode is important in covid-19 as sars-cov-2 can remain viable on various surfaces for a few days 3another important feature of the model concerns the integration of measured characteristics of the clinical course of covid-19 the incubation period was sampled using a log-normal distribution which was fitted using clinical data 4 mean values for the periods from symptom onset to hospitalization discharge and death were taken the literature 39 finally the realistic distributions of demographic and clinical factors allows the accurate prediction of the population-specific cfr we can tune the model to predict the response of different countries with different age structures and risk factors prevalence to the spread of covid-19several conclusions can be drawn from the present study concerning the effect of epidemic control interventions first we have shown that panic situations could result in the spread of the disease despite the adherence of individuals to social distancing measures numerical simulations with the social force model suggests that social distancing is not fully respected in crowded areas especially when individuals move under panic situations such as panic-buying could result in the rapid spread of the virus therefore control strategies for covid-19 should aim to avoid the formation of dense crowds and should prevent the spread of panic furthermore we have demonstrated that keeping a minimal distance of one metre between individuals is not sufficient to prevent person-to-person contacts in crowded areas next the model have shown that pre-symptomatic transmission significantly shapes the outbreak dynamics therefore modelling works devoted to the study of covid-19 spread should take into consideration the effect of pre-symptomatic carriers besides increasing the number of tests for covid-19 is expected to significantly slow down the propagation of the epidemic as many pre-symptomatic carriers will get quarantined before they transmit the disease after that we speculate that the disinfection of public areas would result in a decrease in the number of patients reached during the peak of the outbreak this is because we observe the same thing when we increase the decay rate of sars-cov-2 on hard surfaces finally fitting the model to reproduce epidemiological data on the case of wuhan china suggests that measures that are stricter than social distancing and lockdown were adopted to control the epidemic spread we can speculate that the early wearing of masks the washing of hand and the following of cough etiquette not only flatten the epidemic curve but also delay the onset of the exponential growthnote that the model relies on a few key assumptions first the effect of unreported cases and asymptomatic transmission were not considered in the present work the role of these silent transmitters of infectious diseases was investigated in a previous work 44 we did not introduce them in the present work as there are no sufficient data on the infection dynamics of covid-19 in asymptomatic individuals we will study the effect of unreported cases using our model in a forthcoming work second the model considers a relatively low number of agents this is because of the high computational cost of the model we have used periodic boundary conditions to approximate systems with a higher number of individuals we expect the results to be similar for larger systems but with less stochastic noises finally the study is devoted to the transmission dynamics in closed systems the transport of people between the studied area and other locations could impact the epidemic dynamics in the future we will apply the model to investigate the transmission dynamics of covid-19 in crowds in urban areas with realistic configurationsthe authors declare that they do not have any financial or nonfinancial conflict of interestsin the course of four months since the first reports about a novel strain of coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 emerging in december 2019 1 2 countries around the world have introduced a range of community mitigation strategies with the aim to lower the trajectory of this pandemic by reducing transmission and avoid overwhelming health services community mitigation strategies refer to measures that people and communities can take to slow the spread of infection during a period when vaccines andor medical treatments that are not available 3 they include the use of personal protective measures for everyday use eg voluntary home isolation of ill persons respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene community measures aimed at increasing social distancing eg maintaining a physical distance of 1520 meters between people staying at home and postponing or cancelling gatherings and environmental measures eg routinely disinfecting surfaces in some settings these strategies are voluntary whereas in others they are now enforced such as via fines andor jail timegovernments are implementing strategies at large-scale that have previously been used in limited ways and for limited time periods ie during ebola avian influenza outbreaks and sars this means a large proportion of the population do not have prior experience undertaking these strategies peoples ability to comply with recommendations during emergency situations is influenced by a range of modifiable and nonmodifiable factors including 1 what people perceive their susceptibility to infection to be 4 2 whether they perceive the infection to be serious if acquired 3 whether they have the necessary capacity confidence and resources to comply with the strategies 5 and 4 their sociodemographic status 6 effective control of this pandemic requires an understanding of peoples perceptions about their willingness motivation and abilitycapacity to adopt strategies and how this relates to their perceived risk 7 perceived costs perceptions about the benefits of the behaviors and the perceived impact of an individuals behavior on anothers health will also influence engagement with these behaviors 8 9in australia the government has recommended specific behaviors that can be classed as hygiene-related and avoidance related to engage in these behaviors people will weigh up the perceived costs and benefits related to themselves and others it is therefore important to understand community perceptions and behaviors in order to develop effective messages accordingly we carried out a cross sectional online survey of a large demographically representative sample of the population of australia in march 2020we conducted an online survey of australian residents via a market research company quality online research qor between 18 and 24

a primary care provider n  553 39 amongst those who felt they could not manage self-isolation at home n  122 8 the main concerns were centered around carers responsibilities for children elderly parents and disabled family membersour results suggest that a large proportion of respondents have adopted one or more of either the hygiene-related andor avoidance-related behaviors that had been recommended by the australian government considering the intense media coverage and government information it is not surprising that there was a gravitation towards actual or willingness for adoption of hygiene strategies including hand washingsanitizing while anxiety levels were moderate concerns were raised about accessing food and medical supplies if placed into self-isolation given the limited community behavioral covid-19 studies published we have compared our findings to two ongoing community surveys firstly results from an online poll of 14000 respondents from 14 countries conducted at the same time point as our study reported that their respondents in 814 countries expressed a belief that social distancing measures such as travel bans and self-isolation would not prevent the spread of the virus including participants from australia 52 12 secondly a german survey conducted a week earlier then our study identified that respondents had high levels of knowledge but adoption of important protection behaviors was very low and risk perceptions were especially low among the elderly 13 lastly a survey from malaysia reported that a high proportion of respondents were already adopting precautions such as avoiding crowds 834 and practicing proper hand hygiene 878 at the time of their study in late march however the wearing of face masks was less common 512 14amongst our participants perceived susceptibility to covid-19 was at an intermediate level this aligns with results found in a similar study conducted in the uk which reported that just under half of their cohort n  2108 were likely to acquire covid-19 while 56 felt that it would have a moderate impact ie would require them to self-care and rest in bed 15 in addition a separate survey of australian residents also found that two thirds of respondents were at least moderately worried about a widespread covid-19 outbreak in australia in early march 16 risk perceptions were also found to be moderate median 5 out of 10 based on an online poll of us residents undertaken in early february 17 there may be several factors at play here that account for the perceived level of risk firstly people may be unaware of true risk since little reporting has focused on attack rates during the time of the study secondly people may be subject to optimism biasa phenomenon where people downplay their own risk of an outcome 18 thirdly it is likely that some people assess their risk as being low due to already factoring in a change towards anticipated or already accomplished protective behavior 19 during events that people deem familiar we often see unrealistic optimism because the risk is perceived to be under control as was the case in 2009 with the influenza pandemic when adoption of precautions was low and there was a sense of personal security 4 however covid-19 presents as an unfamiliar risk for the large majority of the population had not experienced outbreaks of sars or mers making the risk less tolerable for those who perceive the situation as uncontrollable 20 when it comes to perceptions of risk there are numerous studies documenting how they are associated with the uptake of preventive andor avoidant behaviors studies conducted duringafter the 2003 sars outbreak reported that higher levels of perceived risksusceptibility of sars was associated with the adoption of preventive behaviors and also avoidance behaviors 2124while understanding a persons perception of risk is important it is not the only condition needed for engagement higher risk perceptions may only predict protective behavior when people believe that effective protective actions are available response efficacy and when they are confident that they can engage in such protective actions self-efficacy 25 according to bandura social cognitive theory an individuals self-efficacy plays a crucial role on the individuals likelihood to engage in a desired behavior if an individual does not believe that heshe can carry out the behavior ie physically distance themselves there is little motivation to engage 26 three-quarters of the study respondents agreed that they could adopt the avoidance-related strategies with lower scores for working from home and self-isolation at home when asked whether they had adopted any of the hygiene related strategies washing or sanitizing hands were the most common responses these findings have also been replicated in an online survey of 5974 residents from the us and uk that found that 92 of the cohort would adopt hygiene related behaviors 27 these represent more readily adoptable strategies as people in the community understand how to engage in them believe that the strategy will protect them and usually have the resources to carry them out these easy to adopt actions have also been a focus of government mass media messageswhen it came to avoidance behaviors our respondents were less inclined to rate them as being effective or to have adopted them in comparison to the preventive behaviors listed above perceptions regarding the efficacy of the strategy as opposed to self-efficacy have also been found to impact on intentionslikelihood to adopt or actual uptake 23 28 it is not surprising that some strategies including social distancing scored low as people may not understand what the strategy entails the rationale for its use or what impact it may have on ones health it should also be noted that individuals may not have the capacity or resources to comply with physical distancing measures because they 1 have extended families living in their households 2 they have a responsibility to provide care for someone outside of their home 3 they may reside in share accommodation 4 may not have access to internetcomputer in the home setting or 5 because of the type of job they have they cannot simply shift to working from home in these settings providing mass media education is not going to suffice what is needed is pragmatic solutions that support people financially and socially to participate examples including increases in social support and charities to assist with delivery of groceries and meals home delivery from chemists telehealth consultations bulk billed drive through vaccine clinics etcit has been suggested that we start to prime people about what additional strategies may still need to be introduced 29 this would entail talking with them about why the strategy would be implemented the end-goal of implementing it what could be the potential impacts how members of the public engage and the criteria for its de-escalation in order to promote cooperation with social physical distancing strategies governments may need to use realistic portrayals community stories and role modelling by influential actors in social networks observing competent role models perform actions that result in success conveys information to observers about the sequence of actions to use to be successful 30 motivation may be helped by creating media campaigns that foster awareness of the recommended behaviors and encourage people to share their strategies for complying with self-isolation and working from homeamongst our respondents older age was associated with the adoption of precautionary behaviors which aligns with the findings from singapore and hong kong during the 2003 sars outbreak 7 23 and some studies during the 2009 h1n1a pandemic 31 32 however the pattern of age is not straight forward in contrast to the above studies others have reported higher levels of adoption of preventive behaviors amongst younger people 1824 years in the context of the 2009 influenza pandemic when it comes to gender we found that females were more likely to report uptake of both preventive and avoidance behaviors consistent with studies during sars and h1n1 pandemic influenza 4 7 23 33 earlier studies have indicated that women are more likely to perceive themselves to be susceptible and hence adopt the behaviors 21 34 when it comes to country of birth we found that people born outside of australia were less likely to adopt behaviors this finding may relate to the capacity to access information which at the time was being disseminated in english and largely through mainstream media conferences and health department websites rather than community and language groups further work is needed to explore the associations between country of birth and pandemic-related behaviorswhen asked what would motivate respondents to comply with a social distancing strategy they nominated i believe it is the right thing to do as the primary response while this answer did not have any significant relationship with the outcome measures reviewed it is still relevant when it comes to planning communication messages it suggests that respondents may be influenced by a desire for social approval from others an idea linked to the model of moral motivation the model developed by brekke et al 2003 assumes that individuals have preferences for achieving and maintaining a self-image as a socially responsible person 35 in brekke et als model self-image improves when the individuals actual behavior gets closer to herhis view of the morally ideal behavior ie the behavior that would maximize social welfare if chosen by every member of society however individuals participation can be conditional on whether they think others are also contributing 36 mass media campaigns that frame their messages around a social collective actionpower or the inclusion of the general public within a team to assist the community response may be effective the promotion of prosocial behaviors has been shown to be effective in vaccination uptake and could be adapted in promoting covid-19 mitigation behaviors such as how ones actions can contribute to protecting their grandparents 37 this idea has been picked up by celebrities and the wider community on twitter under the lockdownforlove with people nominating who they are social distancing for whether these strategies work needs to be further examinedearly results from a study conducted across the us uk and germany has suggested that inducing empathy for those most vulnerable to the virus promotes the motivation to adhere to physical distancing 38 the use of empathy in messaging is not a new concept and has been applied in a range of ways from the promotion of testingtreatment for stis through to increasing our acceptance of robots 39 40 empathy is a skill which enables understanding of another persons experience here people could be asked to imagine the perceptions needs and impact health financial social of pandemic covid-19 amongst our family membersfriendsour study includes a large representative cross-section of the adult australian population people who could not communicate in english were excluded from the sample which may have affected representation of ethnic minorities we also had under-representation of aboriginal australians and torres strait islanders and from those in remote settings secondly as participation in our study was on a voluntary basis this study has potential for self-selection bias by community members who are particularly concerned about this pandemic we relied on self-reports of behaviors which may have led to over-reported social desirability bias however this may have minimized as the survey was self-complete and anonymous lastly we did not collect information about income level and so unable to comment on variations in behaviors by incomebased on the available data it appears that older individuals aged 60 years and people with chronic underlying health conditions are particularly susceptible to severe disease this presents a challenging situation in the media there is reporting that covid-19 is causing mild illness in the majority but its in the best interest of the country to stay home in order to flatten the curve this will cause two responsesthose who continue with their normal practice not adopting or complying with the recommendations around social distancingmitigation strategies as identified in a proportion of our respondents motivating this group especially those less likely to be at risk or suffer the health impact of covid-19 to adopt behaviors that require marked change in their routines beyond those related to personal hygiene it may prove difficult unless people understand the required behavior the rationale for it are given clear and sufficient information about how to comply and they believe the strategy will have an impact and are motivated to act 9 23 41 they also need to have capacity and opportunity to comply with new behaviors for another 4 to 6 months in order to engage a community they need to feel like they are a valued part of a team and that their contributions are valued and key to the response lastly it is essential that governments ensure that resources legalization and support measures are in place in order to facilitate community participation in community mitigation strategiesthis paper is motivated by the sociocultural implications and reconfiguration of everyday life amidst and beyond the covid19 pandemic in the period of intense social media use the introduction of social media to the public in the mid2000s and its development in recent years have created new youth spatialities and sociospatial engagements that have significantly altered the way audiences consume information participate in the content creation and engage with the content circulated on the social media platforms with a social mediascape that is characterised by participatory and networked culture and usergenerated content jenkins et al 2013 the creation circulation and consumption of information and contents are increasingly contextualised and socioculturally and politically shaped the ontological nature of our communication culture the intense and expected users selfdisclosure and the current social media practices in the context of risk communication are not making it easier for relevant stakeholders especially public health practitioners to disseminate health risk information and to understand the communicative health practices and risk perception of the population social media can be effectively utilised to communicate information on the covid19 for public health awareness and interventions while at the same time poses risk due to the confusion and uncertainties among the public from the misinformation disinformation and malinformation apparent in the growing infodemic that accompanies a contemporary epidemic or a pandemic cinelli et al 2020 zarocostas 2020 for instance the upsurge of false information or myths circulated on social media related to covid19 commonly seen myth  eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus world health organisation who and relevant government agencies bruneis ministry of health included took action by posting on their official instagram to highlight and debunk false informationequally important in this risk communication is risk perception of the population risk perception cannot be generalised to the whole population as it is known to be based on a diverse array of information that individuals have processed on risk factors  and technologies as well as on their benefits and contexts who 2002 an individual assesses risk according to own knowledge experience and sociocultural environment hence the need to look into context and localities in this study unlike during the time of the sars outbreak in 2003 when social media was uncommon digital technology and new social media are now ubiquitously used by who and government bodies to spread awareness of the health risk to share latest information and to influence risk perception of the public on the severity of this pandemic the intense internet and social media penetration create digital landscapes where information is widely available from information data advice on the one hand to misinformation speculation and even conspiracy theories on the other to add to this the audience of a few of the recent social media sites such as instagram snap chat and tik tok are predominantly younger people ortizospina 2019 this makes it imperative to study young peoples responses to the pandemic in todays social media time in brunei young people are observed to be using social media in playing their part as community members in their own locality and as global citizens in the context of covid19 pandemic considering that there is still not much knowledge on how risk is communicated understood and acted upon smith 2006 including risk communication on social media platforms kasshout  alhinnawi 2013 this paper aims to reflect on how young people as active audience on social mediascapes are playing a key role in communicating risk to a fellow young audience and changing risk perception of a global pandemic covid19 via social media of equal importance here are the potential sociocultural transformations these young peoples social media engagements could create beyond this current crisis which are revealed in this paperin the following section a description of the qualitative content analysis qca of social distancing initiatives on social media is offered this followed by a section that demonstrates young peoples localised and contextualised creative responses to covid19 through the five social distancing narratives the narrative of fear the narrative of responsibility the narrative of annoyance the narrative of fun and the narrative of resistance one particular action worth highlighting is their effort in making social distancing contents accessible and readable by other users such as by translating official documents to everyday social media language the penultimate section reveals three key sociocultural implications and configurations new youth spatialities and social engagements youth leadership in development and consideration of social participation and reach in risk communication that have broader implications beyond covid19this paper draws from the researchers preliminary study for an ongoing research project social media risk perception and risk communication of covid19 in brunei darussalam a research collaboration between universiti brunei darussalam and health promotion centre ministry of health brunei darussalam as there is not much information known on audiences social media consumption in risk communication and their individualised as well as contextualised risk perception a preliminary research on how the audience deliver and circulate covid19 related content on social media was conducted leading to this preliminary finding on the active involvement of young people in highlighting the significance of social distancing in flattening the curve in the country according to kemp 2020 social media penetration in brunei was 94 per cent 410000 population by january 2020 the growth in the size of the digitally connected group consuming social media content in the nation justifies this interest in looking into social media use in risk communication in brunei darussalamgiven the intensive digital transaction through the social media this research examined the affective consumption and transaction of social media content on covid19 among public in brunei darussalam and the impact of their social media transaction on their risk perception of covid19 it seeks to investigate one the official social media content on covid19 circulated by health practitioners and health organisations two the social media content on covid19 consumed by the public in brunei three their risk perception and understanding of the covid19 based on the social media contents transacted and consumed four their own appropriation framing and circulation of covid19 on their social media platforms and five their health and behavioural practices as a response to their risk perception of covid19this research using qualitative content analysis qca on social media content between early march to the end of april 2020 is part of the fourth objective which is to investigate audience appropriation framing and circulation of social distancing initiatives using the multimodal features of the sites such as captions images videos and hashtags prior to finalising the research objectives the author conducted a pilot discussion with her undergraduate students to seek their views of covid19 at that time in point the students were not really concern about this crisis the general consensus was that this new coronavirus is only risky for those with underlying health conditions and older people one student said that if i get covid im going to recover while another student claimed that the crisis was sensationalised by the media interestingly a number of the students pointed out that the covid19 memes mostly humorous contents circulated on social media help in changing the perception of covid19 from high risk to low risk their views although not representative of the young people in the country point to this groups low risk perception it is safe to say that this could also be the reason for the lack of discussion among the social media users on covid19 in the country prior to the announcement of the first case on 9 march 2020 however the social media landscape changed drastically right after justifying the qca conducted on bruneians social media from march 2020 onwardsto achieve the objective set and taking the above findings and observation into consideration two data collection strategies were employed one the researcher followed covid19 latest cases and issues in the country via the daily press conferences hosted by the ministry of health since 9th march 2020 social distancing related cases highlighted by the minister of health and invited ministers the issues the public brought to front via media personnel through the question and answer session at the press conference and issues mentioned by the audience of the press conference via the instagram live comment section of the invited media personnel were used to guide the second data collection strategy this first strategy was employed to obtain the key concerns and issues that are considered important to bruneians in the context of covid19 and social distancing measures two qca was conducted on random and selected young people in the authors social media network who share social distancing contents on their social media young bruneians instagram and twitter contents based on the information obtained from the first data collection strategy this step by step approach in the data collection allowed the author to follow the issues and the young peoples individual social media sharing on social distancing issues in total over 30 individual profiles from instagram and twitter combined were observed for social distancing contents specific social distancing contents observed include social distancing initiatives conducted by individuals groups and companies key incidents happening in the country related to social distancing the discussion on covid19 statistics on number of infected recovered and death to obtain the publics thoughts on the effectiveness of social distancing initiatives in the country the growing social distancing creative contents on instagram for instance those that are accessible via artcovidbn hashtag and related viral cases in the country contents on other sites such as youtube and tik tok are checked when they appear on the young peoples instagram and twitter posts the crossplatform integration functionality of social media allows for the same media contents to be shared simultaneously bossetta 2018 and the spreadability of social media enables content on youtube to be retweeted on twitter via url sharingthe young people randomly and selectively chosen are between the ages of 18 and 36 a number of them are known in the country as proactive youth who are keen to support the countrys development they are also currently volunteering as front liners to support the ministry of health a few of these young people are not youth leaders and not directly involved in supporting the countrys effort in curbing the crisis there is a mixture of students employed and currently unemployed young people in the group these young peoples identity as bruneians were crosschecked with the details provided on their biography their mutual followers and their contents that are specific to brunei the findings point to the role of young people in pushing the idea and practice of social distancing apparent via the social distancing narratives narratives of fear social responsibility annoyance and fun affectively created reproduced and circulated online the findings did suggest that social distancing initiatives are supported more by the proactive youth the contents shared on the proactive youths social media include their volunteering activities as front liners there are only limited findings that point to the existence of resistance among the young people these young peoples active engagements on social media sites in the context of social distancing initiatives reveal two interrelated factors that not only could lead us to reconsider how risk are contextually spatially and individually perceived practised and communicated by the audience as both the producers and consumers of digital content equally significant and at a more macroscale level it reveals the issue of access and power to social media and digital contents in this era of connectivity and media spreadabilitywhen the first covid19 case was confirmed in the nation on 9 march 2020 brunei government was quick to take actions social distancing initiatives were disseminated to the public a few days after the first case was announced at the nations first covid19 press conference a school holiday that was previously set on 16 march 2020 started three days earlier within the two weeks since the first case restaurants and gyms were closed travel restrictions into and out of the country were imposed a few supermarkets started to implement physical gap at counters and limiting number of customers entering their premises places of worships are closed temporarily working from home wfh and digital learning were quickly introduced physical mobilities have not been restricted due to the relatively small number of infected cases 139 cases as of 6 may 2020 and low rate of infection in the country unlike our neighbouring countries with their lockdown measures singapores circuit breaker and malaysias movement control order while physical movements are allowed the public has been consistently advised to maintain social distancing including the physical distancing of at least 1 metredespite the nationwide social distancing initiatives confining the public to their home and to maintain social distancing were not easy tasks as experienced globally mass gathering were still seen in some parts of the country despite the governments effort in halting the virus transmission suggesting a low risk perception among the members of the public one critical incident that sparked the public outrage was the irresponsible act of a large group of locals visiting a night market in temburong district on the day of the opening of the temburong bridge which connects bruneimuara with temburong district after 130 years of physical separation the next day brunei government restricted the opening time of the bridge and closed the night market to prevent potential community transmission of covid19 social media sites were swiftly flooded by users reprimanding the public for going to the market in mass disregarding the governments social distancing initiatives apart from the governments circulation of social distancing reminders on their official channel mass and new media after this incident social distancing efforts were affectively circulated exchanged and reproduced by the public on social media from these localised and contextualised creatively and affectively produced and circulated content on covid19 a combination of five narratives of social distancing initiatives are apparent narrative of fear narrative of responsibility narrative of annoyance narrative of fun and narrative of resistancethe narrative of fear is visible in contents that stress danger and risk to older people and loved ones detachment from family members due to isolation and quarantine for undetermined duration feed into the narrative of fear the narrative of responsibility is visible in contents that call for the community to play their role as responsible citizen and community members to flatten the curve this responsibility includes stressing the unselfish act of medical health professionals in looking after public in the isolation and quarantine centres general public singing the praises for other front liners including youth volunteers who dedicated their energy and time to support the ministry of health in handling the pandemic this narrative of responsibility is further instilled via the circulation of a video created by the ministry of health a video of a medical health professional captioned hargai pergorbanan mereka english translation  appreciate their sacrifices warmly with teary eyes requesting members of the public to stay at home and together be responsible in preventing local transmission via a personal communication with a public health officer from the ministry of health she confirmed that the ministry wanted the public to hear the voices of the health care workers being apart from their family members while caring for the infected patients and their gratefulness towards the community for their support the video emphasises the need for the community to be equally responsible and supporting the front liners in their effort to curb the spread of the disease and to treat infected individuals was reposted and affectively appropriated on sites such as whatsapp instagram and twitter through this affective content it was hoped that the audience would be able to empathise with the front liners and adjust their views actions and habits pedwell 2017 living in a country with a small population under 440000 population as of may 2020 and in a collectivist society bruneians imagined themselves related to each other either by blood or marriage such an emotive video that emphasised communal responsibility would be more effective in evoking the emotion of the general public and to create and sustain the sense of shared responsibility and sense of community and togetherness in time of a crisis and physical separationa local hip hop duo guardian of rhythm created a video music titled dont push it dedicated to the front liners a title they took from minister of healths famous statement dont push it that reminds public to be vigilant and responsible and to not push the countrys limit in health provision during this pandemic figure 1 this music video uploaded on youtube is one of the many creative contents appropriating minister of healths advice at the daily press conference to put pressure on social distancing stickers gif songs and appropriated hashtags such as dontpushit teranahsajadirumah english translation  stay at home are produced and circulated to reach certain pockets of the population that might not be familiar with english language one user took an initiative to translate the social distancing poster circulated via social media and mass media into colloquial malay language figure 2the narrative of annoyance is apparent in the deliberate sharing of ones frustration towards members of the public who insisted on leaving home travelling overseas and possibly contracting covid19 due to their international travel there were also a few contents on social media highlighting cases of the public undergoing mandatory selfisolation and selfquarantine leaving home the rising number of cases in the country was used strategically by the audience to highlight the severity and potential risk of covid19 the creation and use of new terms such as covaval derived from the word covid and babal a local term for unrepentant individuals particularly those who went to temburong and those insisted on travelling amid covid19 to stress their annoyance and to push public to be more responsible figure 3the narrative of fun by the young people were evident in the growing number of videos to show their coping strategies while on mandatory selfisolation and stay at home are uploaded on tik tok and reshared on twitter instagram and whatsapp one example is a tik tok video made by bruneian international students who were isolated in their homes and a few hotels turned isolation centres for 14 days upon their return to the country as part of the countrys precautionary measures to avoid potential community transmission these students created individual videos of themselves dancing from one end of their room to the other end when combined this video is creatively demonstrating mobilities while in isolation this is one of the isolationquarantine videos such as pass the brush and dont rush challenge seen on tik tok globally during this period exemplifying the spreadability of social media content and the upsurge in the use of one particular social media site tik tok emarketer 2018 crowley 2020 johnston 2020 leslie 2020 as a coping mechanism and a mode to socially and creatively connect with othersinterestingly the narrative of resistance is less prominent in bruneis context as previously mentioned prosocial distancing narratives are more apparent on the local social media contents than those demonstrating antisocial distancing which could be due to the less restrictions imposed on physical mobilities in the country perhaps there are contents demonstrating resistance to the social distancing initiatives in the country but have not surfaced or made known to the public for a number of possible reasons such as the authors limited access to contents of this group of social media users to the best of the authors knowledge there are only two contents in video format known to the public that fit the narrative of annoyance andor resistance to social distancing one video directly addressed the stay at home instruction and was created and uploaded by a 22yearold male on his instagram urging those who fear death to stay at home while criticising the public for fearing the coronavirus a humanmade virus he was charged for causing a breach of peace under the section 19 of the minor offences act chapter 30 faisal 2020 after this event the public is consistently reminded that any act that involves the publishing forwarding or creating fake news and misinformation about covid19 may be regarded as offences another video made and shared on social media by a male in his 30s did not directly address social distancing initiatives but the after effect of the stay at home on parents with schoolkids in his video he expressed his dissatisfaction with the current elearning arrangements where the role of educators is transferred to parents his video was uploaded on local reddit community page rbrunei and received backlash from the rbrunei community other narrative of annoyance demonstrated by the young people are not specifically on staying at home rather was focused on the slow internet connection in the country that affected their ability to continue their studies online and the impact social distancing brought to their livelihoodsthese narratives emerging from the creative production of social media contents demonstrate local youth responses to current situation by contextualising social distancing practice in the country this is supported and made possible by the growing digital creative youth via their digital affective practices wetherell 2012 that went beyond the content sharing to transmitting and recreating a discourse  it was civic engagement both creatives and noncreatives take part in the social distancing initiatives as an active youth citizen who are involved in the community to strive for changes adler  goggins 2005 there are also presence of annoyance and resistance to social distancing as demonstrated above social media sites act as new youth spatialities highlight the spreadability of digital content made possible affective production and consumption of the social distancing narratives the narratives of fear and responsibility in particular and abetted in initiating and sustaining the call for a change in social practices and mobilising youths actions this initiative needs mobile and active youth taking the helm in creating and pushing new subjectivities and taking collective actions to improve and change the society albeit temporarily due to this pandemicas previously mentioned the use of social media by young people is not new this group of users has been known to dominate the online spaces particularly social media sites we could observe new online platforms offering youth with spaces for negotiating their current immobilities stay at homesocial distancing measures new sociotechnological adoptions in the country possibly becoming the new normal in the community post crisis are observed such as poetry club activities open mic and youth mentorship sessions conducted online by young people in the country pointing to the creation of creative spaces online and new ways for conducting social activities such technological adaptation and creation of new social spaces are not limited to the young demographics but have also been adopted by the older generation for instance the group recital of the alquran via zoom exemplifying the rising digitalisation in the country as a matter of fact digital infrastructures applications websites and internet of things to name a few were already in place in the country prior to the crisis but was slow to be taken up by relevant agencies and individuals due to a number of reasons including lack of access due to financial constraints low knowledge of technology lack of motivation and possibly fear of technology the current pandemic that reconfigured our day to day operations and social practice however left these agencies and individuals with no option but to adopt new digital technologiesdigital technologies and platforms have transformed the relationship between media and the geographies of everyday life ash 2019 and young people as the main users of social media play a key role in this transformation as illustrated in this paper via the young peoples creative contents creation on social media these intense sociospatial engagements of young people on social media amidst covid19 demonstrate the interplay between media and the young people in reconfiguring the microgeographies of young people notwithstanding the growing literature on young people and social media use within the geography discipline haji mohamad 2014 2018 arendt  hordijk 2016 blanch 2016 mohamad 2019 skelton  aitken 2019 there is not enough geographical research that discusses the significance and implications of new youth spatialities in the context of onlinemediated environments a closer examination of youth new social realities would offer insights into the changing geographies of young people and the geographies of media focusing on the creation of new types of contents generation of new micro cultures and intensive affective attachments with media contents especially by the young people which have not received adequate attention by geographers ash 2019 these new online spatialities connected with physical spatialities offer broader sociocultural implications that could open new avenues for the progress of two geographies geographies of young people and geographies of media and communication separately or jointly and are in line with the recent turn in the geography discipline towards digital geographies ash et al 2019in the context of brunei a young developing country youth engagements with the countrys progress and development is relatively low the country has only recently seen its young peoples active involvement in addressing key issues and concerns in the country government agencies in the country have been providing the young people with offline platforms for engagements in particular the ministry of culture youth and sports mcys the key supporter of young peoples progress in this time of crisis mcys plays a huge role in expanding and intensifying youth communal engagement as can be seen in the establishment of covid19 youth volunteer group to support the ministry of health other youth involvement includes key youth leaders actively involved in creating and distributing personal protective equipment ppe to the medical health workers moreover the availability of social media platforms offers these young people with spaces to engage leading to the growing number of active and creative youth supporting and sustaining progress and development in the country social media sites as seen in the previous section are affectively used by the young people to promote and support social distancing initiatives such active engagement by the young people during this time of crisis signals the already existing youth leadership in the country online and offline spaces are effectively utilised in pushing forward their agenda and concerns and for personal development the expansion of individual agencies on social media young peoples engagement with the media contents and through the media platforms has potential implications on development planning and execution and could help in creating better futures cupples 2015the growing social media content on social distancing via the cocreation of narratives highlights community engagement and collaboration based on the collective concerns of young people and their interests in keeping the community safe and healthy at this point despite this active participation and the youths role in the context of social distancing initiatives we need to question the reach and success of these narratives and its implication on risk perception of the population the first question considers the issue of digital divide and access who are these young people reaching out to and what about those who are not part of this social media community despite high social media penetration in the country public health information and risk communication on social media remain exclusive and are not reaching the socially disconnected population these narratives and initiatives by the young people only reach the social media users with access to their content the asynchronicity of content delivery and consumption somewhat limit the access of the information for example instagram story posts that are only visible for twentyfour hours are only reaching the audience who are able to access the story within the time allowed second social distancing effort relies on the individuals perception of the risk of covid19 to their individual health and family members connected to the first point risk communication that does not reach the population could have led to low risk perception rendering the initiative impossible or difficult to achieve notwithstanding the efforts made by the young people on creating and adapting to this new social distancing practice if information reach is limited risk perception of the population will remain low the audience young people and relevant government and nongovernment agencies have worked collectively and informally to create contents that are affective and impactful however such efforts would not reach majority of the population if access is limitedclosely tied to this access to contents is the language use in communicating risk using words such as social distancing and social responsibility may not work well with some segments of the population those without access to social media where the social distancing term and practices are commonly demonstrated via caption images and videos would not be able to fully understand what are meant by social distancing official information in the country is commonly disseminated in the official language malay language and in a second language english evidently there are people in the country who are not wellversed in these two languages and would need the information to be translated to their colloquial language or dialects one noteworthy context appropriation action in ensuring the social distancing measures reaching other segments of the population is the translation of the official document to lay peoples everyday language in the forms of caption and hashtag such as teranahsajadirumah by social media users perhaps this is one of the best times for the country to rethink and restructure its risk communication strategy by learning from the current sociospatial practices and the loopholes in our risk communication system and strategy beyond covid19 crisis considering media convergence media accessible through various platforms spreadability of social media differential access and language preferences of the population in communication would improve not only public health communication but has broader developmental implicationsto conclude this paper offers preliminary findings on the localised and contextualised creative productions of social distancing narratives in brunei and the role of young people in emphasising the importance of social distancing in this crisis via social media platforms such as instagram twitter and tik tok using qca on young peoples instagram and twitter contents five narratives of local responses to social distancing practices were apparent the narrative of fear the narrative of responsibility the narrative of annoyance the narrative of fun and the narrative of resistance fascinatingly the research data demonstrated more prosocial distancing narratives than it did for the narrative around resistance technological affordances such as the participatory culture and spreadability of social media content supported the creative production of social distancing initiatives which could bring community and civic impact through individuals collective actions on social media they accentuate the role and social responsibility of each member of the public this is not a single persons tasks everyone plays an equal role in keeping the community safe and healthyin times of a crisis young people in the country played a huge role in supporting the social distancing measures through their everyday creative selfdisclosure on social media and as such has brought three key sociocultural reconfigurations to everyday life that have broader academic and developmental implications the creation of new youth spatialities and intense social engagements were observed which are of importance to geographers in understanding youth social realities and could open up academic discussions relevant to the geographies of young people and the geographies of media and communication the expansion of already existing youth leadership in the country offers a reconsideration of the significance of youths active social media engagements in the context of development social participation and reach in risk communication brought our attention to the issue of access to information differential use of communication platforms and language preference for the betterment of public health communication specific to risk communication during this pandemic what are shared in this paper offer a rethinking of risk communication strategy that includes consideration of socioculturally and politically appropriate and relevant approaches and a strategy that is inclusive to all segments of the population as observed globally the covid19 pandemic has forced us to alter our sociocultural practices and adapt to our drastically reconfigured everyday life creating the new normal in our everyday practices what is clear at this point in time is our dependencies on digital interconnectivity with the uncertainties surrounding covid19 we foresee other significant sociocultural implications of covid19 which could either favourably or unfavourably impact communities in their respective localitieswe used data from the united states to model betacoronavirus transmission in temperate regions and to project the possible dynamics of sars-cov-2 infection through the year 2025 we first assessed the role of seasonal variation duration of immunity and cross immunity on the transmissibility of hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 in the us we used the weekly percentage of positive laboratory tests for hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 31 multiplied by the weekly population-weighted proportion of physician visits due to influenza-like illness ili 32 33 to approximate historical betacoronavirus incidence in the us to within a scaling constant this proxy is proportional to incidence under a set of assumptions described in the supplementary materials and methods to quantify variation in transmission strength over time we estimated the weekly effective reproduction number defined as the average number of secondary infections caused by a single infected individual 34 35 the effective reproduction numbers for each of the betacoronaviruses displayed a seasonal pattern with annual peaks in the effective reproduction number slightly preceding those of the incidence curves fig s1 we limited our analysis to in-season estimates based on adequate samples defined as week 40 through week 20 of the following year roughly october to may for both hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 the effective reproduction number typically reached its peak between october and november and its trough between february and may over the five seasons included in our data 2014-2019 the median peak effective reproduction number was 185 range 161-221 for hcov-hku1 and 156 range 154-180 for hcov-oc43 after removing outliers five for hcov-hku1 zero for hcov-oc43 results were similar using various choices of incidence proxy and serial interval distributions figs s1 to s3to quantify the relative contribution of immunity versus seasonal forcing on the transmission dynamics of the betacoronaviruses we adapted a regression model 36 that expressed the effective reproduction number for each strain hku1 and oc43 as the product of a baseline transmissibility constant related to the basic reproduction number r0 and the proportion of the population susceptible at the start of each season the depletion of susceptibles due to infection with the same strain the depletion of susceptibles due to infection with the other strain and a spline to capture further unexplained seasonal variation in transmission strength seasonal forcing these covariates were able to explain most of the observed variability in the effective reproduction numbers adjusted r2 743 the estimated multiplicative effects of each of these covariates on the weekly reproduction number are depicted in fig 1 as expected depletion of susceptibles for each strain was negatively correlated with transmissibility of that strain depletion of susceptibles for each strain was also negatively correlated with the reproduction number of the other betacoronavirus strain providing evidence of cross-immunity per incidence proxy unit the effect of the cross-immunizing strain was always less than the effect of the strain itself table s1 but the overall impact of cross-immunity on the reproduction number could still be substantial if the cross-immunizing strain had a large outbreak eg hcov-oc43 in 2014-15 and 2016-17 the ratio of cross-immunization to self-immunization effects was larger for hcov-hku1 than for hcov-oc43 suggesting that hcov-oc43 confers stronger cross-immunity seasonal forcing appears to drive the rise in transmissibility at the start of the season late october through early december while depletion of susceptibles plays a comparatively larger role in the decline in transmissibility toward the end of the season the strain-season coefficients were fairly consistent across seasons for each strain and lacked a clear correlation with incidence in prior seasons consistent with experimental results showing substantial waning of immunity within a year 15we integrated these findings into a two-strain ordinary differential equation ode susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered-susceptible seirs compartmental model to describe the transmission dynamics of hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 fig s4 the model provided a good fit to both the weekly incidence proxies for hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 and to the estimated weekly effective reproduction numbers fig 2 according to the best-fit model parameters the r0 for hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 varies between 17 in the summer and 22 in the winter and peaks in the 2nd week of january consistent with the seasonal spline estimated from the data also in agreement with the findings of the regression model the duration of immunity for both strains in the best-fit seirs model is about 45 weeks and each strain induces cross-immunity against the other though the cross-immunity that hcov-oc43 infection induces against hcov-hku1 is stronger than the reversein all modeled scenarios sars-cov-2 was capable of producing a substantial outbreak regardless of establishment time winterspring establishments favored outbreaks with lower peaks while autumnwinter establishments led to more acute outbreaks tables s2 to s4 and fig s7 the five-year cumulative incidence proxies were comparable for all establishment times tables s2 to s4much like pandemic influenza many scenarios lead to sars-cov-2 entering into long-term circulation alongside the other human betacoronaviruses eg fig 3 a and b possibly in annual biennial or sporadic patterns over the next five years tables s2 to s4 short-term immunity on the order of 40 weeks similar to hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 favors the establishment of annual sars-cov-2 outbreaks while longer-term immunity two years favors biennial outbreaksthe amount of seasonal variation in sars-cov-2 transmission could differ between geographic locations as for influenza 12 the r0 for influenza in new york declines in the summer by about 40 while in florida the decline is closer to 20 which aligns with the estimated decline in r0 for hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 table s8 a 40 summertime decline in r0 would reduce the unmitigated peak incidence of the initial sars-cov-2 pandemic wave however stronger seasonal forcing leads to a greater accumulation of susceptible individuals during periods of low transmission in the summer leading to recurrent outbreaks with higher peaks in the post-pandemic period fig 3clong-term immunity consistently led to effective elimination of sars-cov-2 and lower overall incidence of infection if sars-cov-2 induces cross immunity against hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 the incidence of all betacoronaviruses could decline and even virtually disappear fig 3d the virtual elimination of hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 would be possible if sars-cov-2 induced 70 cross immunity against them which is the same estimated level of cross-immunity that hcov-oc43 induces against hcov-hku1even if sars-cov-2 immunity only lasts for two years mild 30 cross-immunity from hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 could effectively eliminate the transmission of sars-cov-2 for up to three years before a resurgence in 2024 as long as sars-cov-2 does not fully die out fig 3eto illustrate these scenarios fig 3 we used a maximum wintertime r0 of 22 informed by the estimated r0 for hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 table s8 this is a low but plausible estimate of the basic reproduction number for sars-cov-2 41 increasing wintertime r0 to 26 leads to more intense outbreaks but the qualitative range of scenarios remains similar fig s8regardless of the post-pandemic transmission dynamics of sars-cov-2 urgent measures are required to address the ongoing epidemic pharmaceutical treatments and vaccines may require months to years to develop and test leaving non-pharmaceutical interventions npis as the only immediate means of curbing sars-cov-2 transmission social distancing measures have been adopted in many countries with widespread sars-cov-2 transmission the necessary duration and intensity of these measures has yet to be characterized to address this we adapted the seirs transmission model fig s9 to capture moderatemildasymptomatic infections 956 of infections infections that lead to hospitalization but not critical care 308 of infections and infections that require critical care 132 of infections 26 we assumed the worst-case scenario of no cross-immunity from hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 against sars-cov-2 which makes the sars-cov-2 model unaffected by the transmission dynamics of those viruses informed by the transmission model fits we assumed a latent period of 46 days and an infectious period of 5 days in agreement with estimates from other studies 26 the mean duration of non-critical hospital stay was 8 days for those not requiring critical care and 6 days for those requiring critical care and the mean duration of critical care was 10 days 26 we varied the peak wintertime r0 between 22 and 26 and allowed the summertime r0 to vary between 60 ie relatively strong seasonality and 100 ie no seasonality of the wintertime r0 guided by the inferred seasonal forcing for hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 table s8we used the open critical care capacity of the united states 089 free beds per 10000 adults as a benchmark for critical care demand 2 we simulated epidemic trajectories based on an epidemic establishment time of 11 march 2020 we simulated social distancing by reducing r0 by a fixed proportion which ranged between 0 and 60 we assessed one-time social distancing interventions for which r0 was reduced by up to 60 for a fixed duration of time up to 20 weeks or indefinitely starting two weeks after epidemic establishment we also assessed intermittent social distancing measures for which social distancing was turned on when the prevalence of infection rose above a threshold and off when it fell below a second lower threshold with the goal of keeping the number of critical care patients below 089 per 10000 adults an on threshold of 35 cases per 10000 people achieved this goal in both the seasonal and non-seasonal cases with wintertime r0  22 we chose 5 cases per 10000 adults as the off threshold these thresholds were chosen to qualitatively illustrate the intermittent intervention scenario in practice the thresholds will need to be tuned to local epidemic dynamics and hospital capacities we performed a sensitivity analysis around these threshold values figs s10 and s11 to assess how they affected the duration and frequency of the interventions we also implemented a model with extra compartments for the latent period infectious period and each hospitalization period so that the waiting times in these states were gamma-distributed instead of exponentially distributed see the supplementary materials and methods and figs s16 and s17 finally we assessed the impact of doubling critical care capacity and the associated onoff thresholds on the frequency and overall duration of the social distancing measureswe evaluated the impact of one-time social distancing efforts of varying effectiveness and duration on the peak and timing of the epidemic with and without seasonal forcing when transmission was not subject to seasonal forcing one-time social distancing measures reduced the epidemic peak size fig 4 and fig s12 under all scenarios there was a resurgence of infection when the simulated social distancing measures were lifted however longer and more stringent temporary social distancing did not always correlate with greater reductions in epidemic peak size in the case of a 20-week period of social distancing with 60 reduction in r0 for example fig 4d the resurgence peak size was nearly the same as the peak size of the uncontrolled epidemic the social distancing was so effective that virtually no population immunity was built the greatest reductions in peak size come from social distancing intensity and duration that divide cases approximately equally between peaks 42for simulations with seasonal forcing the post-intervention resurgent peak could exceed the size of the unconstrained epidemic fig 5 and fig s13 both in terms of peak prevalence and in terms of total number infected strong social distancing maintained a high proportion of susceptible individuals in the population leading to an intense epidemic when r0 rises in the late autumn and winter none of the one-time interventions was effective in maintaining the prevalence of critical cases below the critical care capacityintermittent social distancing could prevent critical care capacity from being exceeded fig 6 and fig s14 due to the natural history of infection there is an approximately 3-week lag between the start of social distancing and the peak critical care demand when transmission is seasonally forced summertime social distancing can be less frequent than when r0 remains constant at its maximal wintertime value throughout the year the length of time between distancing measures increases as the epidemic continues as the accumulation of immunity in the population slows the resurgence of infection under current critical care capacities however the overall duration of the sars-cov-2 epidemic could last into 2022 requiring social distancing measures to be in place between 25 for wintertime r0  2 and seasonality fig s11a and 75 for wintertime r0  26 and no seasonality fig s9c of that time when the latent infectious and hospitalization periods are gamma-distributed incidence rises more quickly requiring a lower threshold for implementing distancing measures 25 cases per 10000 individuals for r0  22 in our model and more frequent interventions fig s16increasing critical care capacity allowed population immunity to be accumulated more rapidly reducing the overall duration of the epidemic and the total length of social distancing measures fig 6 c and d while the frequency and duration of the social distancing measures was similar between the scenarios with current and expanded critical care capacity the epidemic concluded by july 2022 and social distancing measures could be fully relaxed by early- to mid- 2021 depending again on the degree of seasonal forcing of transmission fig 6 c and d introducing a hypothetical treatment that halved the proportion of infections that required hospitalization had a similar effect as doubling critical care capacity fig s15here we examined a range of likely sars-cov-2 transmission scenarios through 2025 and assessed non-pharmaceutical interventions that could mitigate the intensity of the current outbreak if immunity to sars-cov-2 wanes in the same manner as related coronaviruses recurrent wintertime outbreaks are likely to occur in coming years the total incidence of sars-cov-2 through 2025 will depend crucially on this duration of immunity and to a lesser degree on the amount of cross immunity that exists between hcovs oc43hku1 and sars-cov-2 the intensity of the initial pandemic wave will depend fundamentally on the basic reproduction number at the time of epidemic establishment if establishment occurs in the autumn when the reproduction number is rising which could occur in countries that maintain epidemic control by contact tracing and quarantine through the summer or if sars-cov-2 is not subject to the same summertime decline in transmissibility as hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 then a high peak prevalence of infection is likely one-time social distancing efforts may push the sars-cov-2 epidemic peak into the autumn potentially exacerbating the load on critical care resources if there is increased wintertime transmissibility intermittent social distancing might maintain critical care demand within current thresholds but widespread surveillance will be required to time the distancing measures correctly and avoid overshooting critical care capacity new therapeutics vaccines or other interventions such as aggressive contact tracing and quarantine  impractical now in many places but more practical once case numbers have been reduced and testing scaled up 43  could alleviate the need for stringent social distancing to maintain control of the epidemic in the absence of such interventions surveillance and intermittent distancing or sustained distancing if it is highly effective may need to be maintained into 2022 which would present a substantial social and economic burden to shorten the sars-cov-2 epidemic and ensure adequate care for the critically ill increasing critical care capacity and developing additional interventions are urgent priorities meanwhile serological testing is required to understand the extent and duration of immunity to sars-cov-2 which will help determine the post-pandemic dynamics of the virus sustained widespread surveillance will be needed both in the short term to effectively implement intermittent social distancing measures and in the long term to assess the possibility of resurgences of sars-cov-2 infection which could occur as late as 2025 even after a prolonged period of apparent eliminationour observations are consistent with other predictions of how sars-cov-2 transmission might unfold and with assessments of the mitigation efforts that might be needed to curb the current outbreak a modelling study using data from sweden found that seasonal establishment of sars-cov-2 transmission is likely in the post-pandemic period 11 observational and modelling studies 2 26 that find that early implementation of strong social distancing is essential for controlling the spread of sars-cov-2 and that in the absence of the development of new therapies or preventative measures such as aggressive case finding and quarantining 21 intermittent distancing measures may be the only way to avoid overwhelming critical care capacity while building population immunity the observation that strong temporary social distancing can lead to especially large resurgences agrees with data from the 1918 influenza pandemic in the united states 44 in which the size of the autumn 1918 peak of infection was inversely associated with that of a subsequent winter peak after interventions were no longer in placeour study was subject to a variety of limitations only five seasons of observational data on coronaviruses were available though the incidence patterns resemble those from 10 years of data from a hospital in sweden 11 we assumed that the spline coefficients were constant across all seasons though seasonal forcing likely differed from year to year based on underlying drivers to keep the transmission model from becoming unreasonably complex we assumed that there was no difference in the seasonal forcing per-case force of infection latent period or infectious period across betacoronaviruses however our estimates for these values lie within the ranges of estimates from the literature although disease dynamics may differ by age we did not have sufficient data to parameterize an age-structured model we also did not directly model any effect from the opening of schools which could lead to an additional boost in transmission strength in the early autumn 45 the transmission model is deterministic so it cannot capture the possibility of sars-cov-2 extinction it also does not incorporate geographic structure so the possibility of spatially heterogeneous transmission cannot be assessed the construction of spatially explicit models will become more feasible as more data on sars-cov-2 incidence becomes available these will help determine whether there are differences in seasonal forcing between geographic locations as for influenza 12 and will also help to assess the possibility of epidemic extinction while accounting for re-introductions the timing and strength of post-pandemic outbreaks may also depend on stochastic introductions from abroad which can be assessed using more complex global modelswe used percent test-positive multiplied by percent ili to approximate coronavirus incidence up to a proportional constant results were similar when using the raw number of positive tests and the raw percent positive as incidence proxies fig s1 while the percent test-positive multiplied by percent ili has been shown to be one of the best available proxies for influenza incidence 32 the conversion between this measure and true incidence of coronavirus infections is unclear and so we do not make precise estimates of the overall coronavirus incidence this conversion will undoubtedly depend on the particular population for which these estimates are being made in a recent study an estimated 4 of individuals with coronavirus sought medical care and only a fraction of these were tested 46 in addition the method that we adopted to estimate the effective reproduction number depends on the serial interval distribution which has not been well-studied for commonly circulating human coronaviruses we used the best-available evidence from sars-cov-1 the most closely related coronavirus to sars-cov-2our findings generalize only to temperate regions comprising 60 of the worlds population 47 and the size and intensity of outbreaks could be further modulated by differences in average interpersonal contact rates by location and the timing and effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions the transmission dynamics of respiratory illnesses in tropical regions can be much more complex however we expect that if post-pandemic transmission of sars-cov-2 does take hold in temperate regions there will also be continued transmission in tropical regions seeded by the seasonal outbreaks to the north and south with such reseeding long-term disappearance of any strain becomes less likely 48 but according to our model the effective reproductive number of sars-cov-2 remains below 1 during most of each period when that strain disappears meaning that reseeding would shorten these disappearances only modestlyour findings indicate key data required to know how the current sars-cov-2 outbreak will unfold most crucially serological studies could indicate the extent of population immunity whether immunity wanes and at what rate in our model this rate is the key modulator of the total sars-cov-2 incidence in the coming years while long-lasting immunity would lead to lower overall incidence of infection it would also complicate vaccine efficacy trials by contributing to low case numbers when those trials are conducted as occurred with zika virus 49 in our assessment of control measures in the initial pandemic period we assumed that sars-cov-2 infection induces immunity that lasts for at least two years but social distancing measures may need to be extended if sars-cov-2 immunity wanes more rapidly in addition if serological data reveals the existence of many undocumented asymptomatic infections that lead to immunity 50 less social distancing may be required serology could also indicate whether cross-immunity exists between sars-cov-2 hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 which could affect the post-pandemic transmission of sars-cov-2 we anticipate that such cross-immunity would lessen the intensity of sars-cov-2 outbreaks though some speculate that antibody-dependent enhancement ade induced by prior coronavirus infection may increase susceptibility to sars-cov-2 and exacerbate the severity of infection 51 52 at present there is limited data describing ade between coronaviruses but if it does exist it may promote the cocirculation of betacoronavirus strainsto implement intermittent social distancing it will be necessary to carry out widespread viral testing for surveillance to monitor when the prevalence thresholds that trigger the beginning or end of distancing have been crossed without such surveillance critical care bed availability might be used as a proxy for prevalence but this metric is far from optimal since the lag between distancing and peak critical care demand could lead to frequent overrunning of critical care resources critical care resources are also at greater risk of being overrun if the infectious latent and hospitalized periods follow peaked distributions eg gamma versus exponential measuring the distributions of these times and not just their means will help to set more effective thresholds for distancing interventions under some circumstances intense social distancing may be able to reduce the prevalence of covid-19 enough to warrant a shift in strategy to contact tracing and containment efforts as has occurred in many parts of china 21 23 53 still countries that have achieved this level of control of the outbreak should prepare for the possibility of substantial resurgences of infection and a return to social distancing measures especially if seasonal forcing contributes to a rise in transmissibility in the winter moreover a winter peak for covid-19 would coincide with peak influenza incidence 54 further straining health care systemstreatments or vaccines for sars-cov-2 would reduce the duration and intensity of social distancing required to maintain control of the epidemic treatments could reduce the proportion of infections that require critical care and could reduce the duration of infectiousness which would both directly and indirectly through a reduction in r0 reduce the demand for critical care resources a vaccine would accelerate the accumulation of immunity in the population reducing the overall length of the epidemic and averting infections that might have resulted in a need for critical care furthermore if there have been many undocumented immunizing infections the herd immunity threshold may be reached sooner than our models suggest still sars-cov-2 has demonstrated an ability to challenge robust healthcare systems and the development and widespread adoption of pharmaceutical interventions will take months at best so a period of sustained or intermittent social distancing will almost certainly be necessaryin summary the total incidence of covid-19 illness over the next five years will depend critically upon whether or not it enters into regular circulation after the initial pandemic wave which in turn depends primarily upon the duration of immunity that sars-cov-2 infection imparts the intensity and timing of pandemic and post-pandemic outbreaks will depend on the time of year when widespread sars-cov-2 infection becomes established and to a lesser degree upon the magnitude of seasonal variation in transmissibility and the level of cross-immunity that exists between the betacoronaviruses social distancing strategies could reduce the extent to which sars-cov-2 infections strain health care systems highly-effective distancing could reduce sars-cov-2 incidence enough to make a strategy based on contact tracing and quarantine feasible as in south korea and singapore less effective one-time distancing efforts may result in a prolonged single-peak epidemic with the extent of strain on the healthcare system and the required duration of distancing depending on the effectiveness intermittent distancing may be required into 2022 unless critical care capacity is increased substantially or a treatment or vaccine becomes available the authors are aware that prolonged distancing even if intermittent is likely to have profoundly negative economic social and educational consequences our goal in modeling such policies is not to endorse them but to identify likely trajectories of the epidemic under alternative approaches identify complementary interventions such as expanding icu capacity and identifying treatments to reduce icu demand and to spur innovative ideas 55 to expand the list of options to bring the pandemic under long-term control our model presents a variety of scenarios intended to anticipate possible sars-cov-2 transmission dynamics under specific assumptions we do not take a position on the advisability of these scenarios given the economic burden that sustained distancing may impose but we note the potentially catastrophic burden on the healthcare system that is predicted if distancing is poorly effective andor not sustained for long enough the model will have to be tailored to local conditions and updated as more accurate data become available longitudinal serological studies are urgently required to determine the extent and duration of immunity to sars-cov-2 and epidemiological surveillance should be maintained in the coming years to anticipate the possibility of resurgencein march 2020 the world health organization declared the covid-19 outbreak a global pandemic covid-19 is caused by sars-cov-2 a variant of coronavirus as of 6th april 2020 1000am cet more than 1244421 cases have been diagnosed globally with over 68976 fatalities govuk 2020 symptoms of infection are usually non-specific and include fever cough and myalgia with diarrhoea with or without the subsequent development of dyspnea chan et al 2020 severe cases that include respiratory distress sepsis and septic shock have been increasingly reported with critically ill patients requiring intubation and intensive care treatments wang et al 2020covid-19 is a respiratory virus that is transmitted by large respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected secretions who 2020 therefore on 23rd march 2020 the uk government released the following guidance for the uk public to self-isolatesocial distance to reduce the risk of transmission everyone must stay at home to help stop the spread of coronavirus you should only leave your home for very limited purposes 1 shopping for basic necessities for example food and medicine which must be as infrequent as possible 2 one form of exercise a day for example a run walk or cycle  alone or with members of your household 3 any medical need including to donate blood avoid or escape risk of injury or harm or to provide care or to help a vulnerable person and 4 travelling for work purposes but only where you cannot work from home prior to this the advice was that vulnerable adults should voluntary self-isolate ie not leave their home or meet anyone other than those who live in their home nhs 2020the world health organisation has recognised that such self-isolationsocial distancing measures may result in people becoming more anxious angry stressed agitated and withdrawn who 2020 anxiety is among the most prevalent mental health disorders bandelow and michaelis 2015 and may be defined as a persistent feeling of worry fear or nervousness mental health uk 2020 approximately 1 in 10 people living in the uk suffer from an anxiety-related disorder mental health uk 2020 a large body of literature shows that anxiety is associated with several detrimental consequences including lower quality of life brenes 2007 suicidal ideation and attempts nepon et al 2010 physical chronic conditions including multimorbidity sareen et al 2005 relationship complications kasalova et al 2017 and increased alcohol consumption smith and randall 2012 in addition to anxiety depression is also a prevalent mental health complication who 2020 depression causes feelings of sadness andor a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed and for depression to be diagnosed these symptoms must last for at least two weeks american psychiatric association 2020 similar to anxiety depression can lead to a variety of emotional hawton et al 2020 and physical oerlemans et al 2007 problems and can decrease a persons ability to function at both work and at home american psychiatric association 2020 importantly anxiety and depression once developed tend to track across the lifespan owing to the known detrimental consequences of anxiety and depression it is important to ensure strategies are in place to both prevent and manage such mental health complicationsthe literature suggests that a key risk factor for both anxiety and depression is perceived isolation santini et al 2020 moreover literature shows that social network ties social support network structure and participation in social activities are associated with better mental health cornwell and laumann 2015 it is thus possible that the recent restrictions placed on the uk population owing to the covid-19 pandemic may have unintentional consequences per se on the state of mental health and mental health complications of the uk public the consequences of the current uk public health guidance and potential correlates of those who may be worst affected by the consequent effects of self-isolationsocial distancing have not been scrutinised to date moreover the fact that the uk public have not been required to follow such drastic self-isolationsocial distancing guidance in modern history means that there is a limited body of literature to which one can refer to inform effective policy and practice in order to support emotional wellbeing alongside the reduction in risk of exposure to contagionto date just one study exists on the impact of covid-19 on mental health the study investigated the immediate psychological response of the covid-19 pandemic on 1210 participants from 194 cities in china the study found that 538 of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe 165 reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms 288 reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms and 81 reported moderate to severe stress levels female gender student status specific physical symptoms eg myalgia dizziness coryza and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress anxiety and depression wang et al 2020considering the current self-isolation social distancing guidance set out by the uk government and the scarcity of data on its impact on the state of mental health and mental health complications per se it is of the upmost importance to develop an understanding of the impact of such guidance on mental health and correlates of poor mental health to inform targeted intervention the present study aimed to investigate the cross-sectional association between the uk covid-19 self-isolationsocial distancing guidance and levels of anxiety depression and mental wellbeing as well as potential correlates of poor mental healththis paper presents pre-planned interim analysis of data from a cross-sectional epidemiological study administered through an online survey the study was launched on 17 march 2020 17 days after the first case of covid-19 was diagnosed in the united kingdom the study was approved by the anglia ruskin university research ethics committee 16 march 2020participants were recruited through social media and through national media outlets bbc march 26th 2020 and by distributing an invite to participate through existing researcher networks adults aged 18 years and over declaring that they currently reside in the uk and were self-isolatingsocial distancing due to covid-19 were eligible to participate participants were directed to a data encrypted website where they indicated their consent to participate after reading an information sheetdemographic data was collected including sex age in 10-year age bands marital

the four main uk countries they lived in england northern ireland scotland walesmeasures of health status included whether respondents were a current smoker and consumer of alcohol yn the presence of physical multimorbidity ie more than three chronic diseases this is consistent with previous research sakib et al 2019 chronic physical diseases included obesity hypertension myocardial infarction angina pectoris and other coronary diseases other cardiac diseases varicose veins of lower extremities osteoarthritis chronic neck pain chronic low back pain chronic allergy excluding allergic asthma chronic bronchitis emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd type 1 diabetes type 2 diabetes diabetic retinopathy cataract peptic ulcer disease urinary incontinence or urine control problems hypercholesterolemia chronic skin disease chronic constipation liver cirrhosis and other hepatic disorders stroke chronic migraine and other frequent chronic headaches hemorrhoids cancer osteoporosis thyroid disease renal disease and injury participants were also asked if they had experienced any physical symptoms of covid-19 during self-isolationsocial distancing ie persistent cough high temperature sore throat runny nose and the number of days they had been in self-isolationsocial distancingmental health was measured using the becks anxiety inventory bai and becks depression inventory bdi these are both 21-item questionnaires with higher bai and bdi scores indicating more severe anxiety and depressive symptoms the short warwick-edinburgh mental well-being scale is a 7-item measure of mental well-being fat et al 2017 stewart-brown et al 2009 poor mental health was defined as the presence of at least one of the following three criteria moderate-to-severe anxiety symptoms bai score 16 moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms bdi score 20 carney et al 2011 and poor mental wellbeing swemwbs metric score 158 warwick medical school 2020 mental health is a multi-component construct although traditional aspects of mental health have been considered in isolation they may be experienced simultaneously therefore we created a mental health score to capture a wider range of aspects of mental health in individuals than usually is examinedsample characteristics were compared between individuals with and those without poor mental health using chi-squared tests for categorical variables and t-test for the number of days of self-isolationsocial distancing bai bdi and swemwbs scores were further compared between different sex and age groups using analysis of variance anova effect sizes were estimated using phi coefficient chi-squared tests with binary categorical variables cramers v chi-squared tests with categorical variables with more than two categories cohens d t-tests with continuous variables and eta squared anova with continuous variables the association between several potential predictors independent variables and poor mental health dependent variable was studied using a multivariable logistic regression model potential predictors included sex age marital status employment annual income region current smoking current alcohol consumption physical multimorbidity any physical symptom experienced during self-isolationsocial distancing and number of days of self-isolation social distancing sensitivity analyses were conducted with moderate-to-severe anxiety symptoms moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms and poor mental wellbeing as dependent variables results from the logistic regression analyses are presented as odds ratios ors and 95 confidence intervals cis the level of statistical significance was set at p  005 the statistical analysis was performed with r 352 the r foundationthis cross-sectional study

depressive symptoms and poor mental wellbeing as dependent variablesthe present study utilising a sample of 932 uk adults found that the prevalence of poor mental health was 368 in individuals self-isolatingsocial distancing due to the covid-19 pandemic correlates of poor mental health included female sex a younger age lower annual income being a current smoker and having physical multimorbidity moreover scores from the bai and bdi were particularly high ie demonstrating high levels of anxiety and depression and the swemwbs was low ie demonstrating low levels of mental wellbeingfindings from the present study carried out during the covid-19 pandemic support those of the only other study carried out on mental health and mental health complications during this pandemic to date wang et al 2020 suggesting that the covid-19 pandemic may result in a poor mental health epidemic however such a claim cannot be confirmed until further longitudinal epidemiological studies emerge on this topic although it should be noted that mental health complications are often not an acute phenomenon and once developed may reoccur throughout ones life burcusa et al 2007 scholten et al 2013in the present study the prevalence of poor mental health ie 368 is higher than that which was reported during non-pandemic times in the uk namely approximately 25 mind 2020 moreover bai and bdi scores in the present study are also higher than which was previously reported in populations without a psychiatric disorder muntingh et al 2011 veerman et al 2009 similarly scores for the swemwbs were lower fat et al 2017 the higher prevalence for anxiety depression and low mental health may be explained through two pathways first the pandemic itself may be increasing anxiety depression and reducing mental wellbeing indeed previous studies carried out during former pandemics have shown a heightened level of anxiety depression and psychological distress taha et al 2014 wheaton et al 2012 it may be proposed that such a deterioration in mental health may result from worry about contracting the condition oneself or a loved one or friend being diagnosed with covid-19 moreover the unavoidable media coverage and constant exposure to information relating to this pandemic including an increase in cases and mortality rates is likely to be further negatively influencing the respondents reported mental health second self-isolationsocial distancing is likely to negatively impact mental wellbeing and increase levels of anxiety and depression as has been suggested in previous literature cornwell and laumann 2015 santini et al 2020 this impact on mental health may be a result of perceived isolation financial concerns owing to not working or a reduction in custom if a business owner or self-employed and a reduction in social interactions in addition the physical environment of the home space may not be conducive to a healthful experience for individuals or families living in close contact during the pandemic home overcrowding inadequate facilities and poor housing standards may add to feelings of distress furthermore relationships that were strained prior to the pandemic may have heightened tensions either because people are forced to spend the lockdown together media reports confirm that worldwide reports of domestic abuse and violence have increased in frequency and severity the new york times 2020 a potential increase in levels of anxiety and depression owing to government self-isolation social distancing guidance is of concern as these behaviours have been shown to track across the lifespan and may thus present future health complications for the general public post-covid-19 pandemic it could therefore be purported that interventions are thus required to improve mental health during the active phase of pandemics and in order to be most efficient and to bring the most favourable outcomes interventions should be targeted at those at greatest risk to minimise potential long-term individual health and societal health burdenthe present study showed that female sex a younger age lower annual income a current smoker and those having physical multimorbidity had the lowest levels of mental health these results are somewhat surprising as females and young people are not in the groups thought to be at higher risk of complications from covid-19 however these correlates have also been observed to be associated with poor mental health during non-pandemic times lorant et al 2007 mental health 2020 patel et al 2007 stickley and koyanagi 2018 stubbs et al 2018interestingly the results also do not conform to usual u-shape relationship between age and mental wellbeing typically young and older people report higher levels of mental wellbeing blanchflower and oswald 2008 with middle aged adults reporting the lowest levels the u-shaped relationship may result from the quelling of the aspirations of youth as people enter middle age and subsequently adjusted downwards in later life blanchflower and oswald 2008 the apparent linear relationship between age and mental wellbeing suggests that the current pandemic may be disproportionately affecting young people further research is required to understand why this might be including if it is due to declining economic prospects or diminished social contacts once these mechanisms have been identified targeted interventions may be implemented however several interventions to improve mental health status in young adults have been established utilising an internet-based delivery overcoming a key barrier during covid-19 self-isolationsocial distancing ye et al 2014 additional research should also consider the impact of self-isolationsocial distancing on specific marginalised and at risk populations eg lgbt youth interventions to improve mental health during the covid-19 pandemic should apparently focus specifically on those groupsfindings from the present study must be interpreted in light of its limitations first those suffering from poor mental health may have been more likely to complete the present survey and thus potentially introduce self-selection bias into the findings next participants were asked to self-report on their mental and physical health potentially introducing reporting bias third analyses were cross-sectional and thus it is not possible to determine trajectories of mental health during the current pandemic future research using multiple time points is thus warranted fourth the present study collected data on a sample of the uk public utilising an online questionnaire further research is required using other samples of uk adults to confirm or refute the present findings finally those with psychiatric disorders may have higher levels of anxiety than the general public however such data was not reported and thus it is possible that some participants included in this study may have had a psychiatric disorderin conclusion in the present sample of 932 uk adults who completed the survey while under uk government self-isolation social distancing instructions during the covid-19 pandemic high levels of the symptoms of anxiety and depression and low levels of mental health were reported correlates of these mirror those during non-pandemic times among uk adults self-isolatingsocial distancing females younger age groups those with a lower annual income current smokers and those with physical multimorbidity were associated with higher levels of poor mental health interventions to improve mental health during the covid-19 pandemic should focus on these groups moreover future research is now required to understand why the covid-19 pandemic may be disproportionally influencing

research in context
evidence before this study
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 emerged in wuhan china in late 2019 in mid-january 2020 schools and workplaces closed as part of the lunar new year holidays these closures were then extended to prevent sars-cov-2 spread the intended effect of such physical distancing measures was to reduce person-to-person contact which spreads infectious diseases epidemic parameters such as time-dependent reproduction numbers governing sars-cov-2 transmission in wuhan have been estimated based on local and internationally exported cases the frequency of contacts in different age groups and locations schools workplaces households and others in china has also been previously estimated we searched pubmed and medrxiv for studies published in english up to march 7 2020 with the terms coronavirus and school or work and wuhan or hubei and identified 108 and 130 results respectively however to our knowledge no published article has reported use of location-specific transmission models that consider the impacts of school or workplace closures to study the spread of sars-cov-2 in wuhan
added value of this study
we built an age-specific and location-specific transmission model to assess progression of the wuhan outbreak under different scenarios of school and workplace closure we found that changes to contact patterns are likely to have substantially delayed the epidemic peak and reduced the number of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 cases in wuhan if these restrictions are lifted in march 2020 a second peak of cases might occur in late august 2020 such a peak could be delayed by 2 months if the restrictions were relaxed a month later in april 2020
implications of all the available evidence
the measures put in place to reduce contacts in school and work are helping to control the covid-19 outbreak by affording health-care systems time to expand and respond authorities need to carefully consider epidemiological and modelling evidence before lifting these measures to mitigate the impact of a second peak in cases
person-to-person transmission is mostly driven by who interacts with whom9 10 which can vary by age and location of the contact ie school work home and community under the context of a large-scale ongoing outbreak contact patterns would drastically shift from their baseline conditions in the covid-19 outbreak in wuhan physical distancing measures including but not limited to school and workplace closures and health promotions that encourage the general public to avoid crowded places are designed to drastically shift social mixing patterns and are often used in epidemic settings4 although contact patterns can be inferred from reported social contact data that include information on which setting the contact took place in such studies are often focused on high-income countries11 or particular high-density areas12 this limitation can be addressed by quantifying contact patterns in the home school work and other locations across a range of countries based on available information from household-level data and local population demographic structures13
to examine how these changes in population mixing have affected the outbreak progression we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in wuhan and adapted these in the presence of school closures extended workplace closures and reduction in mixing in the general community using these matrices and the latest estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the wuhan outbreak1 9 14 15 16 we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in wuhan using an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed seir model17 18 for several physical distancing measureswe simulated the outbreak in wuhan using a deterministic stage-structured seir model over a 1 year period during which the modelled outbreak peters out an implication of this approach is that all demographic changes in the population ie births deaths and ageing are ignoredwe divided the population according to the infection status into susceptible s exposed e infected i and removed r individuals and according to age into 5-year bands until age 70 years and a single category aged 75 and older resulting in 16 age categories susceptible individuals might acquire the infection at a given rate when they come in contact with an infectious person and enter the exposed disease state before they become infectious and later either recover or die we assumed wuhan to be a closed system with a constant population size of 11 million ie s  e  i  r11 million throughout the course of this epidemic we used the seir model presented in figure 1
 the age-specific mixing patterns of individuals in age group i alter their likelihood of being exposed to the virus given a certain number of infectious people in the population additionally we incorporated contributions of asymptomatic and subclinical cases however the question of whether such individuals are able to transmit infection remains unresolved at the time of writing although evidence suggests that they are likely to19 we also considered a scenario in which we assumed that younger individuals are more likely to be asymptomatic or subclinical and less infectious than older individuals20 21

0 values uniformly from the 95 ci from the posterior of the r
0 distribution from the semi-mechanistic model by kucharski and colleagues appendix p 214
social mixing patterns vary across locations including households workplaces schools and other locations therefore we used the method set out by prem and colleagues13 which accounts for these differences and obtains the location-specific contact matrices c for different scenarios in a normal setting contacts made at all of these locations contribute to the overall mixing pattern in a population so we summed contacts across the different locations to obtain our baseline contact pattern in the population before the outbreak figure 2
 appendix pp 12 in an outbreak setting different intervention strategies are aimed at reducing social mixing in different contexts to lower the overall transmission in the population to simulate the effects of interventions aimed at reducing social mixing we created synthetic contact matrices for each intervention scenario from these building block matriceswe considered the following three scenarios first scenario theoretical assumed no change to social mixing patterns at all location types no school term break and no lunar new year holidays second scenario no interventions winter school break in wuhan and lunar new year holidays assumed no physical distancing control measures school-going individuals did not have any contacts at school because of school holidays from jan 15 to feb 10 2020 and 10 and later 75 of workforce would be working during the holidays from jan 25 to jan 31 2020 and from feb 1 to feb 10 2020 respectively and third scenario intense control measures in wuhan to contain the outbreak assumed school closure and about 10 of workforce eg health-care personnel police and other essential government staff would be working even during the control measures figure 1 figure 2 for the third scenario we modelled the effect of the intense control measures ending at the beginning of march or april and we allowed for a staggered return to work while the school remained closed ie 25 of the workforce working in weeks one and two 50 of the workforce working in weeks three and four and 100 of the workforce working and school resuming figure 23 23 24
analyses and model building were done in r version 362the funder of the study had no role in study design data collection data analysis data interpretation or writing of the report the corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publicationour simulations showed that control measures aimed at reducing social mixing in the population can be effective in reducing the magnitude and delaying the peak of the covid-19 outbreak for different control measures among individuals aged 55 to 60 years and 10 to 15 years the standard school winter break and holidays for the lunar new year would have had little effect on progression of the outbreak had schools and workplaces reopened as normal figure 3
we present the median cumulative incidence incident cases per day and age-specific incidence per day of 200 simulated outbreaks figure 4
 intense control measures of prolonged school closure and work holidays reduced the cumulative infections by end-2020 and peak incidence while also delaying the peak of the outbreak figure 4 our model suggests that the effects of these physical distancing strategies vary across age categories the reduction in incidence is highest among school children and older individuals and lowest among working-age adults figure 4 figure 5
physical distancing measures were most effective if the staggered return to work was at the beginning of april this reduced the median number of infections by more than 92 iqr 6697 and 24 1390 in mid-2020 and end-2020 respectively figure 5 appendix p 3 should the disease have a longer duration of infectiousness and reduced the magnitude and delayed peak incidence across all age categories figure 4 which could have had further beneficial impact by relieving the pressure on the health-care system in the immediate few months after the outbreak began uncertainty in r
0 values has a large effect on the timing of the epidemic peak and final size of the outbreak figure 4the modelled effects of the intense control measures of prolonged school closure and work holidays vary by the duration of infectiousness if the disease had a short infectious period 3 days then our model suggests that relaxing physical distancing interventions in march figure 5 appendix p 4 could avert around 30 of cases in school children and older individuals fewer cases could be averted by end-2020 should the disease have a longer duration of infectiousness eg 7 days figure 5 physical distancing interventions would need to be relaxed a month later in april to observe a larger effect if children were less infectious lifting physical distancing interventions in april instead of march could engender additional health benefits figure 5 appendix pp 56covid-19 a contact-transmissible infectious disease is thought to spread through a population via direct contact between individuals1 9 10 outbreak control measures aimed at reducing the amount of mixing in the population have the potential to delay the peak and reduce the final size of the epidemic to evaluate the effect of location-specific physical distancing measuressuch as extended school closures and interventions in workplaceson the timing and magnitude of the peak and the final size of the epidemic we accounted for these heterogeneities in contact networks in our model we simulated outbreaks and modelled the interventions by scaling down the appropriate component of the contact mixing matrices for chinamathematical models can help us understand how sars-cov-2 could spread across the population and inform control measures that might mitigate future transmission25 26 we simulated the trajectory of the ongoing outbreak of covid-19 in wuhan using an age-structured seir model17 18 as individuals mixing patterns are non-random they influence the transmission dynamics of the disease11 models that assess the effectiveness of physical distancing interventions such as school closure need to account for social structures and heterogeneities in mixing of individuals27 28 29 30 31 in our model we incorporated changes to age-specific and location-specific social mixing patterns to estimate the effects of location-specific physical distancing interventions in curtailing the spread of the outbreak the measures put in place to reduce contacts at schools and workplaces are helping control the outbreak by providing the health-care system with the time and opportunity to expand and respond consequently if these restrictions are lifted prematurely while there are still enough susceptible people to keep the r
e1 once contacts increase the number of infections would increase realistically interventions are lifted slowly partly as an attempt to avoid a sharp increase in infection but also for logistical and practical reasons therefore we simulated lifting the interventions in a staggered fashionevidence of the effects of various physical distancing measures on containing the outbreak are scarce and little is known about the behavioural changes of individuals over time either during an outbreak or otherwise therefore to model the effects of the physical distancing measures implemented in wuhan we assumed the effect that certain types of physical distancing have on age-specific and location-specific contact ratesmuch is unknown about the true age-specific susceptibility and transmissibility of covid-19 therefore we assumed no heterogeneity in susceptibility between children furthermore for simplicity we assumed that children and adults were equally transmissible other than the differences in their contact rates subclinical children could be more infectious than subclinical adults appendix pp 56 similar to an influenza-like pathogen our model suggests that interactions between school children and older individuals in the population have important public health implications as children might have high infection rates but the elderly are more vulnerable to severe infections with potentially fatal outcomes32 33 however unlike models built for pandemic or seasonal flu we accounted for the lack of population immunity to sars-cov-2this study describes a mathematical model that quantifies the potential impacts of physical distancing policies relying on wuhan as a case study epidemiological investigations during the who-china joint mission on covid-19 found many infections clustered around households34 extreme physical distancing measures including school closures workplace closures and avoidance of any public gatherings all at once can push the transmission to households leading to increased clustering of household cases5 as households are not explicitly included in the model we did not consider heterogeneity and clustering of household transmission distinguishing between repeated and new contacts is important for disease propagation in contact network models35 36 more sophisticated methods that account for temporal presence within the household37 would be needed to characterise higher degrees of contact looking at limitations of our study our compartmental model does not capture individual-level heterogeneity in contacts which could be important in super-spreading events particularly early in an epidemic combined with nosocomial infections the risk of covid-19 infection is potentially amplified with close contact between confirmed cases and health-care workers however the compartmental model we present is not equipped to explicitly consider transmission within health-care institutions and households more complex models such as individual-based models with familial and health-care structures should be explored nosocomial infection risk among health-care workers and patients has been identified as a research gap to be prioritised in the next few months by whoa key parameter is the basic reproduction number r
0 which determines how fast sars-cov-2 can spread through the population during the early stages of the outbreak this is an inherently difficult parameter to estimate since the true number of cases that can transmit infection at a given time is unknown reported cases are likely to be just a small fraction of true cases and probably varies over time because of different interventions being introduced and population behaviour changing in response to the epidemic in our analysis we used an existing model that inferred time-dependent r
e based on the growth of reported cases in wuhan and the number of exported cases outside china originating from wuhan14 we acknowledge that the underlying reproduction number in wuhan could have been larger than that used in our study however other studies of early sars-cov-2 transmission dynamics in wuhan using different methods arrived at the same estimate with similar ranges1 9
although the precise effects of interventions might vary by country and different estimates of key parameters our model highlights the usefulness of physical distancing interventions and the need to carefully calibrate their lifting to avoid second and subsequent waves of a covid-19 epidemic areas of china outside hubei and other east or southeast asian regions have managed to avert a major outbreak locally and delayed the peak of the epidemic without resorting to hubeis extreme measures38 policy makers are advised to reapportion their resources to focus on mitigating the effects of potentially soon-to-be overwhelmed health systems39
non-physical distancing factors play a part in mitigating potential spikes in cases especially when physical distancing measures are relaxed the effects of seasonality on sars-cov-2 are difficult to predict without long time series supporting evidence for the link between climate and covid-19 has been largely anecdotal and based on spread in different settings and such analyses are subject to confounding40 41 consequently we have not incorporated climatic factors into our mathematical model future research should be directed towards understanding the potential seasonality of covid-19 and the climatic factors that could affect its transmission dynamics other innovations such as the rapid expansion of hospital capacity and testing capabilities would shorten diagnostic and health system delays3 38 39 thus reducing effective interactions between infectious and susceptible individuals and interrupting transmission effective vaccines42 and antivirals43 that are being developed could counteract this global public health threat the extent to which these strategies can detect cases earlier and isolate infectious individuals from the susceptible pool or protect against infection is less well-understood hence necessitating further evaluationcombined physical distancing and travel restrictions have aided in lowering the transmission of covid-19 over the course of the ongoing outbreak in wuhan8 44 45 evidence for this drop in transmission can be gleaned from the time-varying estimates of the reproduction number14 or observing that the turnover of the epidemic has occurred far before depletion of susceptible individuals indicating the effects of the implemented measures it is difficult to quantify whether physical distancing alone is responsible for the drop in cases especially during the ongoing epidemic therefore we took a broad view of this question making assumptions about the results of certain forms of physical distancing and measuring the effects somewhat qualitatively however to some extent physical distancing has resulted in both a shorter epidemic and a lower peak given what is known about the transmissibility and the relatively long 56 days incubation period of covid-191 16 the efficacy of physical distancing in reducing these important attributes of any epidemic are no surprisein the analysis we have varied the basic reproduction number the average duration of infections the initial proportion of cases infected the susceptibility of children and the role of younger individuals in transmission dynamics of covid-19in conclusion non-pharmaceutical interventions based on sustained physical distancing have a strong potential to reduce the magnitude of the epidemic peak of covid-19 and lead to a smaller number of overall cases lowering and flattening of the epidemic peak is particularly important as this reduces the acute pressure on the health-care system premature and sudden lifting of interventions could lead to an earlier secondary peak which could be flattened by relaxing the interventions graduallyaccess to computer code is provided in the appendix p 1 data used in this study are freely available to the scientific communitythe coronavirus 2019 covid-19 is a newly emergent infectious disease caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 virus originated in december 2019 from mainland china with initial cases emerging from the city of wuhan hubei province cdcp 2020 li et al 2020 although most individuals diagnosed with covid-19 present with mild to moderate respiratory symptoms a substantially minority present with severe symptomatology with accompanying need for hospital treatment a further proportion needing intensive care unit icu admission and an elevated fatality rate risk of mortality follows a clear age gradient verity et al 2020 on 30th january 2020 world health organization who officially declared the covid-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern followed by designation as a pandemic on 11th march ie presence of illness across multiple continents the rapid spread of covid-19 places huge strain on capacity responsiveness and resilience of public and private healthcare systems worldwide emanuel et al 2020 legido-quigley et al 2020 across multiple countries this has been accompanied by implementation of public health policies significantly altering everyday life such as the quarantine of citizens for significant periods of time with both short- and longer-term consequences for psychological distress and wellbeing brooks et al 2020at time of writing the worldwide cases of covid-19 are steadily increasing across all continents on 11th april 2020 the cumulative total of individuals presenting with confirmed covid-19 was 1648365 people with a total of 102216 deaths who 2020 in many countries testing is limited to hospitalised cases therefore these numbers are likely to significantly underestimate the true prevalence of covid-19 in the population given they do not cover mild presentation and asymptomatic cases there is emerging evidence of the psychological impact of covid-19 on populations both directly due to the distress accompanying confirmed cases in individuals and their loved ones and indirectly due to population health interventions such as quarantine however it should be emphasized that the majority of people are not expected to suffer from mental disorders emerging from the pandemic and its impact taylor 2019 however a significant percentage will experience intense emotional adjustment reactions including fear of contagion zhou 2020 impact of prolonged quarantine brooks et al 2020 xiao 2020 the death of relatives wang et al 2020 or increased social adversity as a consequence of geopolitical instability to civil society associated with the economic crisis silva et al 2018 in china a survey of 1210 people found that 538 assessed the psychological impact of the situation as moderate-severe 165 reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms 288 moderate to severe anxiety symptoms and 81 moderate to severe stress levels most respondents 847 spent between 20 and 24 h a day confined at home and the main concern 752 was that hisher relatives would become infected with covid-19 wang et al 2020based on our survey of preliminary current research and on previous literature on coping with past coronavirus-based epidemics eg severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers we identify three groups at risk for psychological morbidity during and after the covid-19 pandemicthe first group are healthcare professionals particularly those working in inpatient physical health settings who experience higher frequency of exposure to the virus and higher viral load in the workplace compounded by significantly increased workload high risk procedures and the low availability of necessary personal protective equipment ppe thus health professionals are at risk of elevated levels of depression anxiety and sleep disorders li et al 2020 and many among them harbour fears of being infected during work shifts recent findings on medical students in the current crisis supporting this al-rabiaah et al 2020 this is also in line with previous experiences from sarsmers showing frontline health professionals constitute a unique risk group especially after pandemic containment ends and systems move towards mitigation of the disease impact gardner and moallef 2015 lee et al 2018 of note many other workers are exposed to the same risk and fear of contagion such as police officer postal carrier emergency medical technicians or trash collectorsthe second elevated risk group that should be considered include individuals who as a result of the crisis have been exposed to potentially traumatic events such as loss of a loved one threats to ones health and to the ability to work and make a living and concerns about their future capacity to maintain a sufficient income these people may express symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder ptsd depression or complicated grief disorder consistent with the literature on psychological and psychiatric sequelae of global emergencies or disasters goldmann and galea 2014 this group may not emerge immediately within the pandemic and presentations may only become apparent after several months even after the incidence of covid-19 has peakeda third group of people at increased risk for psychological problems consists of people with pre-existing psychopathology especially those with severe or complex psychiatric disorders their existing presentation may be exacerbated by extreme isolation due to exposure to either the virus or associated social distancing in this sense social distancing may exacerbate existing social isolation in this vulnerable group there is conflicting evidence from previous studies on the responses of people with severe psychiatric disorders to different types of disasters such as earthquakes with some evidence for higher levels of avoidance-related coping being associated with higher distress horan et al 2007 but other studies showing that this risk is somewhat disorder specific with pre-disaster mood and anxiety disorders but not psychotic disorders predicting further psychological distress katz et al 2002 this group also includes individuals with more common psychopathologies eg depression and anxiety who were receiving primary care mental health treatment or psychotherapy prior to the onset of covid-19 restrictions other people exposed to psychological suffering are those who have to live alone during the quarantine who has been recently bereaved by the coronavirus but the bereavement process has been disrupted by the lockdown and ones that are not allowed to visit their loved ones who are in hospital for whatsoever medical conditionsas duan and zhu 2020 highlight specialized psychological intervention for covid-19 should be dynamic and flexible enough to adapt quickly to the different phases of the pandemic in the early stages clinical psychologists psychotherapist and psychological intervention specialists should actively collaborate with the rest of the multi-professional healthcare system in the treatment of the immediate impacts of covid-19 presentations mohammed et al 2015 this may take the shape of organising or enabling healthcare systems to orientate towards psychological impacts of a pandemic facilitate public mental health approaches to increasing population awareness of mental health or organizing systems for psychologically informed interventions this may also include task-shifting of psychological interventions either to delivery through digital means or by different professional groups potential therapeutic targets includetraining and support for health professionals at high exposure risk to identify and manage emotional reactions that may hinder their clinical work in frontline health delivery this includes for instance managing anxiety fear of contagion episodes of acute stress or promoting self-carereducing burnout the main objective of this approach is to maximise psychological resilience in as many professionals as possible who have frontline duties during a pandemic chen et al 2020 importantly in the peak of a pandemic interventions such as psychological debriefing critical incident stress debriefing or any other single session intervention mandating staff to talk about their thoughts or feelings are not recommended that said compassionate and sensitive awareness of the impact of critical care on health care professionals can be used to facilitate one on one support should that person wish it nice 2018next it is important to engage emotionally vulnerable groups especially people with previous psychopathology the main goal here is to support individuals undergoing covid-19 treatment or preventative quarantine the mental health symptoms of this group of patients with covid-19 should also be monitored although the presence of non-essential professionals such as psychiatrists clinical psychologists or social mental health workers in isolation rooms for covid-19 patients is completely discouraged therefore front-line psychological support either needs to be facilitated by medical staff involved in immediate care which may not be possible if the health system is at capacity or be implemented indirectly through telecare systems serious psychiatric emergencies such as aggression self-harm or suicide attempts will still need to be addressed in person for patients with acute symptomatology and diagnosed or suspected covid-19 professionals who assist them face-to-face should be protected to minimize the risk of contagion eg via appropriate ppe and ensure both their safety and that of the patientall other outpatient psychological interventions can be effectively carried out by digital care phone and internet enabled psychological interventions have been demonstrated to be clinically effective in a wide variety of mental disorders irvine et al 2020 related to this it is also important to tailor standard mental health delivery for individuals with pre-existing psychiatric disorders to acknowledge the impact of social isolation and distancing on mental health as part of adaptation to life under lockdown or quarantinerelatives of patients admitted by the coronavirus in a severe condition poorly prognosed or who have already died in such interventions it is essential not to pathologize the normal emotional reactions of family members and it is important to establish clear and consensual criteria with all the professionals involved to determine whether intervention is more beneficial than not to do so von blanckenburg and leppin 2018as the pandemic plateaus and societies begin to emerge from distancing mental health symptoms such as hypochondriasis anxiety insomnia or acute stress as well as symptoms consistent with ptsd are expected to present across health systems in these cases the first-line intervention should be psychological minimizing as far as possible the use of drugs nice 2014 2018 furthermore the literature emphasizes the importance of not starting formal psychological treatments quickly and without careful assessment including active monitoring as noted above although well intentioned intervening in individuals natural coping mechanisms too early can be detrimental there is evidence that these interventions may be ineffective or even increase the likelihood of developing ptsd nice 2018 special attention should also be paid to potential for re-traumatization of ptsd presentations where trauma-focused therapies are implemented without adequate psychotherapeutic frameworks and structures duckworth and follette 2012 and guarding against the development of interventions for those that have recovered from covid-19 that stigmatize or block access of the to a new functional identity as survivors of the pandemic muldoon et al 2019 going forward it is also crucial to ensure individuals affected by covid-19 retain a sense of their overall identity and that this is not subsumed into an explanatory model reduced to the illnessany intervention should be based on a thorough assessment of possible risk factors that may maintain the problem the patients prior state of mental health the history of bereavement the presence of a history of self-harm or suicidal behaviours in both the patient and hisher family the history of previous traumas and the socio-economic context of the patient at this stage it is also important to recognise the likely profound impact of covid-19 on economic social and political levels at all levels from the individual to international this may therefore require mental health systems to adopt new ways of working with structural inequalities emerging from the aftermath of covid-19 and consistent with a social determinants of mental health model eg lund et al 2018in organizing psychological assistance within and across various stages of the pandemic we highlight four major challengeshealthcare system deficits both in terms of material and human resources ie lack of adequate ppe infrastructure for digital interventions staffing or in mental health professionals not specialized in the psychological approach of crises and emergencies shultz et al 2015 shultz and neria 2013 in china the scarcity of human resources led to individual professionals accumulating multiple responsibilities reducing the effectiveness of their interventions duan and zhu 2020 for this reason government policy makers and health managers need to be aware of health systems strengthening for increasing the capacity of mental health professionals facilitate training for emergency intervention and monitor workload burdens especially when sustained over timesocietal underestimation of the short- and long-term psychological consequences of pandemics and consequently limited resources to cope with them bitanihirwe 2016 there is evidence that individuals exposed to public health emergencies have increased psychopathological vulnerability both during and after the potentially traumatic event fan et al 2015 although the international covid-19 pandemic response has been unprecedented in terms of mobilisation of resource and finance there will also be long-term impacts in terms of treatment burden including mental health particularly in low resource and conflict settings un 2020 in china the progression of covid-19 aggravated the mental health of infected patients the general population and health professionals duan and zhu 2020 therefore it is important to evaluate and identify all risk groups and adapt interventions to their specific needs among the variables to consider are disease trajectory severity of clinical symptoms place of treatment in-home or out-of-home isolation icu etc history of previous trauma and previous history of mental health problems having this information will help classify people at risk and enable specific preventive mental health measures to be put in placepoor planning and coordination of psychological interventions especially when they are applied at different levels and by different professionals zhang et al 2020 in china at the start of the covid-19 outbreak the absence of adequate planning of psychological interventions led to fragmented or disorganized implementation compromising effectiveness and efficacy and hampering access to available health resources any psychological intervention should be planned and coordinated together with all the social-health stakeholders involved particularly primary healthcare services and specialized mental health services this maximised the potential for adequate continuity of care even after acute phase of the pandemic recedesfinally there is also a risk attached to early crisis responses leading to a proliferation of interventions and frameworks associated with an oversupply of well-intentioned but potentially non-evidence based psychological assistance often non-governmental organizations ngo and the third sector this is not to say all ngo interventions are compromised and indeed prevention in mental health is highly desirable that said delivery of preventive interventions must be balanced by delivery andor supervision applied by appropriately qualified professionals loewenstein 2018 ogden 2019as previously noted where health systems have sufficient flexibility for those with existing mental health conditions should continue their psychological interventions by technology enabled means this can include telephone consults or increasingly via digital platforms such as skype zoom or health provider developed platforms this presents a number of specific challenges including familiarity with the technology both therapist and client adaptation of the therapeutic intervention awareness of the additional parameters of delivering therapy in lockdown conditions and the accompanying question of the purpose of therapy in such unusual circumstancesthere are thus several difficulties that psychotherapists and practitioners have in adjusting their practice to technology enhanced therapy which is now delivered from their own homes as opposed to familiar public facilities or private practices the following suggestions of how to adapt psychotherapy to this unique condition have emerged from our everyday clinical experiences over the adaptation to lockdown in several countries and represent an attempt to systemize clinical practice for the duration of the emergence and of social life restrictions therefore we provide a number of key points to guide clinicians in adapting practicedraft a new contract many patients will have difficulties in accepting digital psychotherapy clinicians must be clear that this is pragmatically the only option available if this is the case but also acknowledge and self-regulate their own difficulties with changes such as worry for the clients mental health irritation with the option of discontinuing face to face psychotherapy or guilt at the idea of not being available enough in all of these cases the clinician remains open for phonevideo contact where the patient experiences psychological problem but negotiation is required over whether sessions are for crisis-management only or whether regular sessions are still possible andor desirable to both parties this can help retain a balance between acceptance of difficulties and the maintenance of a robust treatment frameworkraise the bar for what we consider psychopathology reactions of distress such as fear rage anxiety obsessions guilt constriction rebellion against authority emotion and behavioural dysregulation albeit transitory are to a certain extent normal during a crisis the clinician must first and foremost help the patients understand that their suffering is human and mostly unavoidable this is not to say that they should be ignored or minimised when patients can note how their mind is overwhelmed by symptoms affect or relational problems this creates a basis for agreement to work on themcommon factors eg norcross and lambert 2019 are even more important than usual in particular we think that validation sharing and self-disclosure become of uttermost importance validation follows from the above that adjustment to the new normal is normal and patients experience is human therapists can note how experiencing fears for their own and their loved ones health is understandable that to be worried about the future of the economy is reasonable how to behave with a certain degree of obsessions is adaptive eg hand hygiene or that unexpected losses of temper are to be expected in confinement where sharing is appropriate the clinician may provide examples of witnessing the same experiences and noting this is part of what the humanity is experiencing now this is aimed at reducing feelings of self-shaming self-criticism stigma or guilt for ones own weaknesses self-disclosure is unique in this aspect above all it is one of the most powerful interventions safran and muran 2000 and in this moment becomes even more necessary therapists may need to strategically disclose moments of their own personal vulnerability during the outbreak we contend that in this moment clinicians should mindfully and tactically not stick to one of the principles of good self-disclosures eg dimaggio et al 2015 that is clinicians should disclose well-regulated feelings and thoughts in this moment still having command over their own experiences clinicians may disclose moments in which they experienced momentarily feelings of fear even moving closer to panic worry anger sadness rebellion and irritation than one ordinarily would this helps create a sense of human connection and reduces in session risk on the clients side of self-blaming or setting unrealistic standards of good mental health for the self safran and muran 2000 inchausti et al 2019 this can be balanced in session with learning from these experiences of momentary dysregulationcreate the therapeutic environment we are not working in our offices but often from our homes the therapy space must be therefore be created anew for video-therapy the clinician should choose what part of their home they want to show beyond their shoulders and possibly consider the patients personality equally the therapists will be projecting a sense of their own identify in these choices with some patients it is better to choose a more neutralprofessional background for example bookshelves or a working table with other patients there is less this need and they experience a sense of familiarity even when they see the kitchen of the windows of the therapists home in any case asking patients for feedback about how they experience the therapist in this new environment is crucial another issue is how to present oneself in the camera absence of embodied intersubjectivity deprives the session of face-to-face aspects of the human connection we consider that adjusting zoom of the webcam which means placing oneself at some distance can be helpful showing only ones face is artificial and deprives the client of gestures and nonverbal markers from the therapist conversely at least a half-length shot eg breaking news conductors is better and some background must be present so the patients retains a sense of a human being in context this way therapists can use arms and hands and chest and shoulders to convey nonverbal signals making communication more natural alternatively some patients may feel more comfortable without using a camera and the use of audio might suit them better coping with such anxiety disorders as social anxiety might lead patients to avoid video as in any form of coping if using video is too much of an emotional burden to that client the clinician accepts phone consultation but keeps exploring the possibility to switch to video which would be a kind of behavioural exposure a compromise would be using a web platform with video disabled simply accepting coping deprives the clinician the possibility to counteract psychopathology whereas gently asking if the patient feels ready to switch to video and explore the cognitive-affective antecedents of the possible refusal gives precious information about residual maladaptive interpersonal schemas which are one fundamental therapy targethelp patients build their own environment clinicians may offer suggestions for how to create a therapeutic space safe and protected from interference of course having a private distraction-free room is best but even in this case patients can be suggested to use headphones and a microphone and maybe some background music so reducing the risk others listen alternatively sessions can be conducted over smartphone in the open for example a private garden the parking lot or ones car trivial as they may sound we have found these suggestions help many patients to accept and practice therapy even after initial reluctancetherapeutic focus only self-regulation and overcoming distress or exploration of opportunities for building healthy parts and pursuing autonomy exploration and expanding the healthy self dimaggio et al 2015 we have noted that in majority of cases where we have adjusted delivery of psychotherapy to fit the pandemic restrictions patients are seeking a balance between acceptance of the current condition whilst still trying to challenge maladaptive schemas and develop an emergent healthy part of the self indeed once issues relating to the present crisis have been dealt with patient and therapist may explore how the current distressing conditions create suffering not only for their direct traumatic effects but also because they may indirectly bring existing personality cognitive and emotional vulnerabilities to the fore thus clinicians may help the patients connect their present experiences to lifelong vulnerabilities enabling therapeutic work to continue as they did before the emergency albeit with specific adaptations for example prior to lockdown patients with avoidant personality disorders may have started questioning schemas of themselves as inferior and others are judging and therefore they coped with social avoidance inchausti et al 2018 in this moment behavioural experiments aimed at increasing social contact and thus further challenging the schemas are more difficult to enact yet the clinician may still explore opportunities and build more basic steps for future real-life exposures patients looking for employment may be able to access online courses or training for life after patients searching for romantic partner may use dating apps or explore the feelings and thoughts they experience when chatting with some new acquaintance even the home may be a test ground for new experiments one client related difficulty in showing personal vulnerabilities to significant persons because she had learned that if she revealed these emotions others either became unavailable or distressed therefore she had avoided disclosure or felt guilty for burdening them lockdown and having to live with her partner 247 helped her realize that there was no point in her concealing her personal feelings thus she burst into tears with her partner relating afterwards in therapy that she felt relieved as she realized that that was possible this enabled schema-driven difficulties in continuing with disclosure of feelings could be addressed as a current therapeutic issuefinally some practices like two-chairs sensorimotor work guided imagery exercises can regularly be performed simply adjusting the zoom in the patient room the therapists may ask the client to step back so the whole body can be observed and then ask to close their eyes and engage in guided imagery or use bodily oriented work like grounding lowen 1971 to enhance self-regulation or connecting with feelings of strength and personal agency that said for some patients that are unwilling or do not want to use this platform for treatment if they are content to postpone specific elements of treatment until restrictions are lifted the therapist should be sensitive in recognizing distress but also respecting the decision-making process it is still possible to remain open to the patient recontacting the therapist to recommence therapyto conclude the covid-19 pandemic and associated disruption to society poses major challenges to the provision of mental health services these challenges include the need to identify and monitor possible risk groups for psychological morbidity as well as exploring new ways of providing services as a heuristic it is useful to consider three potentially overlapping groups that can benefit from psychological frameworks for mental health andor treatment approaches these are i healthcare workers engaged in frontline response to the pandemic and their patients ii individuals who will experience the emergence of new mental health distress as a function of being diagnosed with covid-19 or losing family and loved ones to the illness or the psychological effects of prolonged social distancing and iii individuals with existing mental health conditions who are either diagnosed with covid-19 or whose experience of social distancing exacerbates existing vulnerabilities there are yet limited data on the mental health impacts of the current crisis but evidence from past epidemics eg mers and sars offer a basis for identifying risk groups and preparing management strategies the current crisis is the first global crisis in the age of mass internet supported communication and this offers opportunities and challenges for delivering high-quality psychological therapies online practical and technical adjustments to therapy can and have already been made but as the pandemic unfolds it will be important to generate a corpus of knowledge both on the effectiveness of technologically supported psychotherapy and to share technique in working with patients in an environment where technological changes intersect with societal changes due to the pandemicsars outbreak took place in 2002 in china and infected 8422 people globally4 the total number of deaths was 916 globally4 as of march 31 2020 the sars-cov-2 has infected over a million and has caused more than 50000 deaths2 one reason why its spread is evidently much wider as compared to sars is the rapid urbanization and the increase in international travel during the last two decades hence the control measures applied at the time of sars are no longer adequate in these days and more vigorous actions are required to control sars-cov-25 another reason is related to a difference in the infectious period between patients infected with sars and those infected with sars-cov-2 while in the former case viral shedding peaks only when the patients illness is advanced and respiratory symptoms occur5 for sars-cov-2 transmission can occur in the early phase of the illness when the patients are completely asymptomatic67 hence isolation after the onset of symptoms might be ineffective in preventing virus transmission and this also makes temperature screening less effective8 finally sars-cov-2 has been proven to hold higher transmissibility and wider community spread than other betacoronaviridae5 despite being highly infectious and having higher transmissibility the severity of sars-cov-2 is much lesser compared to sars5statistical models on the spread of sars-cov-2 suggested that due to lack of herd immunity in the population and the highly contagious nature of the virus 40-70 of the population can be infected unless strong containment measures are timely taken9 based on the past experience with different epidemics and pandemics as well as the current understanding of sars-cov-2 the who suggested frequent hand washing with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water avoiding touching eyes nose and mouth and practicing respiratory hygiene2 the use of face masks by everyone is still controversial though who does not recommend its use by everyone2coronavirus can survive on different surfaces for a long time  plastic 72 hours stainless steel 48 hours cardboard 24 hours and copper 4 hours1011 as regard to contact spreading the virus can be effectively inactivated by surface disinfection with 70 isopropyl alcohol 05 hydrogen peroxide or 01 sodium hypochlorite1011 hence thorough cleaning with disinfecting solutions in health facilities and public places is warranted health care facilities are advised to use personal protective equipment ppe with triple-layered masks or n95 masks and to educate the staff about the proper disposal of the equipment2 respiratory precautions during aerosol-generating procedures are also recommended2 anyone with fever cough and difficulty in breathing is advised to seek medical attention2 social distancing minimum one meter is recommended both at individual and community levels2at the community level the most important measures for reducing infection spread rely on case detection isolation and contact tracing of positive cases followed by quarantine for those exposed other strategies include the closure of places of mass gathering like schools libraries places of worship malls and cinemas and the suspension of all social events as sports celebrations and meetings temperature screening has been introduced at airports railway stations and bus stations as well as the entrance of the main community buildings like hospitals banks or law courts the limitation of temperature screening is that it misses a significant number of asymptomatic carries which has been estimated at around 468 in countries with a worse rate of infection more restrictive measures have been put in place like travel bans reduction or interruption of both internal and overseas flights and boundary closure curfew and lockdown are also implementedall the aforementioned measures aim at reducing the rate of infection transmission thus delaying the timing and lowering the height of the epidemic peak these allow from one side gaining time for the healthcare system to prepare an efficient response to the pandemic and from the other side the development of potential new treatments and vaccines in wuhan it has been calculated that physical distancing with a staggered return to work at the beginning of april instead of march was the most effective strategy with a projected reduction of the median number of infections by 92 interquartile range iqr 66-97 and 24 iqr 13-90 in mid-2020 and end-2020 respectively12a range of strategies has been adopted worldwide based on the population structure as well as the health care infrastructure of each country one of the problems that have been faced is the delay in the implementation of measures a model simulation by lai shengjie and andrew tatem predicted that if china had implemented control measures a week earlier 67 of all cases could have been prevented if implementation had been done at the beginning of january it would have cut infection rate to 513 the events in wuhan show that for at least three weeks after the first cases were reported city authorities had been informed about the virus spreading but they issued orders to suppress the news for instance on january 18th roughly six weeks after coronavirus started to spread in wuhan they allowed the citys baibuting district to organize its traditional annual mass banquet of the 40000 families attending more than 28000 got infected and more than 560 succumbed to the virus in the later weeks just a few days later more than 5 million people had traveled out of wuhan for the upcoming spring festival just before wuhan imposed lockdown thus spreading covid-19 across other provinces of china and abroad the elevated connectivity of wuhan with other international airports such as singapore japan and thailand facilitated the rapid spread to bordering countries1415on january 23rd a 3-week lockdown was ordered to the entire hubei province along with some major cities like beijing and shanghai16 outdoor activities were limited with each citizen being permitted to go out for 30 minutes only on every second day17 all transports in and out of the city were prohibited mobile-phone data location from chinese internet giant baidu was used to track peoples moments as well as person to person contacts18 in wuhan where the infection rate was the highest residents were required to measure and report their temperature daily the mild and asymptomatic cases were quarantined in fangcang hospital as well as in public spaces such as stadiums and conference centers which have been repurposed for medical care19 a 1000-bedded hospital was built in a matter of 10 days to take care of patients with coronavirusthanks to all these measures a decline in the number of infected growth rate and an increase in its doubling time from 2 to 4 days was eventually achieved the median daily reproduction number declined from 235 of january 16 to 105 of january 3020 tian et al estimated that the wuhan shutdown slowed the dispersal of infection to other cities by 291 days 95ci 254-329 delaying epidemic growth elsewhere in china21 other chinese cities that early implemented preventive control measures reported 333 fewer cases in the first week of their outbreaks compared with cities that started control later21 the correlation between domestic air traffic and covid-19 spread became weaker following lockdown17 nevertheless a study from italy china and the united states found that the wuhan travel quarantine delayed the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days in mainland china but had a greater effect at the international scale where case export was reduced by nearly 8022 however with all these measures china prevented cases from increasing by 67-fold ie without these measures there would have been 8 million cases by the end of february13 however replicating the chinese model elsewhere turned out to be extremely challenging as the measures implemented in wuhan and the entire hubei province of china far exceeded the classical definition of local confinement lockdown and isolation fig 217some of the other countries were successful in flattening the curve including singapore taiwan hong kong and south korea one of the key factors in the success of these countries was continuous testing isolation of infected and quarantining of contacts in singapore temperature screening at the airport of all travelers arriving from wuhan was started on january 3rd even before identification of sars-cov-2 sequence aggressive contact tracing and quarantine of contacts of confirmed cases travel advisories and entry restrictions on people who had traveled to china in the preceding 14 days were implemented at a community level people were encouraged to work from home and to record their temperature twice a day to make quarantine less onerous the government offered self-employed people sgd  100 per day respiratory and hand hygiene and social distancing were followed rigorously23temperature checking in all clinics and provision and use of ppe by medical staff were ordered as compulsory strict visitor controls cohorting of patients with pneumonia or respiratory infection and restriction of movement of patients and doctors between different healthcare institutions were also set up to prevent disease spread across multiple institutions a network of 800 public health preparedness clinics phpcs was activated to enhance the management of respiratory infections in primary care settings all pneumonia cases severely-ill patients in intensive care units deceased people with a possible infectious cause and influenza-like illness ili in primary care clinics were tested1624since february 7 2020 the country has been in disease outbreak response system condition dorscon orange the second-highest alert signifying more relaxed measures of containment25 besides singapore also taiwan and hong kong were found well prepared before the outbreak thus making a rapid and vigorous response to the first cases closure of places of mass gathering travel restrictions and case detection isolation and contact reducing quarantine of exposed were widely practiced in south korea authorities called for voluntary social distancing and isolation apart from this testing was scaled up aggressively nearly 18000 per day and contact tracing was done through cctv and credit card transactions the general community was also encouraged to inform about infected people16in contrast countries in europe like italy spain the united kingdom and the united states delayed implementing containment measures and failed in anticipating the impact of the pandemic in their own boundaries italy has recorded the highest number of deaths globally2 before the outbreak was detected the virus had been circulating into the country for at least 4 weeks in just a matter of weeks february 21 to march 22 2020 italy went from the discovery of the first official covid-19 case to a state of complete lockdown26 within this brief period the impact on the country was nothing short of a tsunami the health care system was literally overwhelmed with new pneumonia cases with a considerable number of them in critical conditions in the red zone ie the regions of lombardia and veneto the most hit by the pandemic the situation had become so grim that the risk of treating only those with a better prognosis younger and healthier population to the detriment of older people became almost reality27 the shortage of hospital beds ventilators and health professionals became a concrete threat health professionals from different disciplines including ophthalmology were converted to covid-19 patient care and who came in contact with sars-cov-2 patients were encouraged to work until they show symptoms28at the social community level there was a delay in the implementation of restrictive measures the lockdown started with places of mass gathering but restaurants and bars were left open for one more week and travel within and outside italy were not restricted a total lockdown was imposed in northern italy the red zone but not in central and southern italy concurrently only on march 10 national lockdown was proclaimed this led to the movement of cases to southern italy and subsequently spreading the infection across the entire country26 one other fact facilitating the diffusion of the virus and the lack of homogeneity in the national response is that the italian health system is decentralized and different regions tried varying policy responses most notably lombardy and veneto two neighboring regions with a similar socioeconomic profile and number of cases tried two different approaches26 veneto tested extensively both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases and proactively traced the potential positive cases if someone tested positive everyone in the family as well as neighbors were tested and if testing kits were unavailable they were asked to self-quarantine whenever possible samples were collected directly from home and processed in the laboratory in contrast lombardy conducted only half of the tests done in veneto and focused more on symptomatic cases there was a limited investment in proactive tracing home care and monitoring and protecting healthcare workers recently the epidemic curve flattened and the number of new cases and deaths stabilized started decreasing only when enormous measures of containment were accomplished social media campaigns movement tracing by the police and closure of all non-essential activities were finally working on the other hand conversion of public places and existing hospitals into intensive care units contributed to the reduction of the fatality ratealthough the italian experience might have been a teaching example for the other european countries a steep increase in the number of cases has been recorded in spain france and the united kingdom just a few days later like italy the spanish government reacted late to the pandemic on february 19th 2500 valencia soccer fans mingled with 40000 atalanta supporters for a champions league game in bergamo which was described as the gamechanger a week before the shutdown on march 8th several mass events such as sports events political party activities conferences and a massive demonstration for the international womens day took place three days later about 3000 athletic fans flew together for another champions league match in liverpool when the regional government of madrid closed universities and schools it provoked a holiday atmosphere with crowded bars and parks and many people moved to their beach homes29 the poor coordination and the delay in implementation of restrictive measures led an abrupt surge of cases in spain before they enacted the lockdown on march 14 2020 only after lockdown a decline in the number of new cases have been reported fig 3 we expect a steep decline in new cases in 6-8 weeks provided it is vigorously implemented to face the burden of the case boom the government took over all the private healthcare facilities and converted them to covid-19 care due to the shortage of testing kits laboratory testing was done only for patients needing admission for severe acute respiratory infections sari and the essential service personnel such as health workers in those departments16in the united states us there was a lack of coordination in the national response with an unclear message from the us president with often a variance with information from the us national institutes of health nih and the centers for disease control cdc early and severe outbreaks in washington state and new york state prompted the six counties in the san francisco bay area to impose stay-at-home orders on march 17th 2020 in response to initial cases two days later the entire state of california was placed under these orders to flatten the curve of new severe cases the 50 us states and many localities within them individually imposed measures ranging from tight provisions as in california to more lenient approaches such as bans on gatherings and curfews there was no consistent national policy this chaotic pattern included a wide variation in travel restrictions and even quarantines for travelers from one state to another and travel restrictions30 even in the absence of enforced restrictions social distancing was emphasized and those feeling ill were urged to stay home early in the epidemic policy on investigating contacts and quarantining them varied from city to city for example in denver colorado when there were 49 confirmed cases on march 19 health officials reached out to people who might have been exposed only if they were elderly or had underlying health conditions31 health departments in at least two counties in california  sacramento and placer counties  decided not to quarantine contacts who did not show symptoms despite growing evidence that asymptomatic carriers might transmit sars-cov-231 in seattle washington the health department was no longer routinely investigating contacts because cases were proliferating rapidly and contact tracing was labor-intensive31 there was also an issue with testing due to a shortage of testing kits163233 if the country had accurately tracked the spread of the virus hospitals would have had the opportunity to be prepared and executed their pandemic plans effectively and on time suddenly the system was faced with a virus that had been left to spread untracked through communities around the country34 new york country reported at least 83712 total positive cases of covid-19 and more than 1941 related deaths on april 2nd 2020 making it the state with the most us coronavirus cases new york city hospitals were straining under the onslaught of novel coronavirus cases worsened by a shortage of ppe such as gloves gowns and masks and limited availability of ventilators and intensive care beds27 this stress on the us healthcare system is likely to increase as cases are projected to peak in some areas during mid-april to late-april and some thereafter in fact to track the virus citizen crowd-sourcing methods have been devised including wwwcovidnearyoucom which enables anyone to view the reported healthillness of residents aggregated by postal zip codeamong the middle-income countries iran was the worst hit the iranian government was aware of the outbreak quite early but only little measures were applied to stop it the connections between iran and china were not interrupted until january 31st 2020 in the attempt to maintain strong diplomatic ties35 however the iranian airlines continued their flights between the two countries up to february 23 202035 the outbreak was officially acknowledged following only on february 19 2020 letting the disease spread in the preceding weeks35 iran did not impede the arrangements for the parliamentary elections scheduled on february 21st35 furthermore it also resisted quarantine measures the deputy health minister iraj harirchi publicly opposed it saying quarantines belong to before world war i for diseases like plague and cholera and even chinese are not satisfied with the quarantine they had put in place35 ironically he later tested positive for coronavirus in summary iran lost multiple opportunities to respond to their worst public health crisis35 there were also issues related to a lack of transparency in their reports1636a few data on the impact of traveler screening lockdown travel restriction and quarantine is available these days as the results of these measures have been analyzed only in these days37 however compared to travel restrictions improved detection isolation of cases and social distancing are likely to have a greater impact on the containment of the outbreak social distancing also needs to be continued for several months to have a lasting impact it has been predicted that by reducing the human to human contact by 90 we can stop the epidemic38 countries that have implemented social distancing earlier had a greater doubling time south korea singapore japan hong kong as compared to countries that did not us france italy39 the use of face masks by everyone is still controversial though who does not recommend use by everyone other agencies do recommend it4041in india the first case of covid-19 was reported on january 30th 2020 followed by two similar cases on february 2nd and 3rd all three had a travel history to wuhan china a month later on march 2nd two new cases were reported  one each from new delhi and hyderabad a sharp increase in numbers then followedto contain the spread the ministry of health and family welfare mohfw immediately took action and issued a travel advisory as travel restrictions had previously demonstrated efficacious on outbreaks of sars ebola and bubonic plague all international travelers entering the country were asked to self-quarantine for 14 days all travel visas to other countries were canceled until april 15th 2020 all the states were asked to invoke the epidemic disease act which allowed officials to quarantine suspected cases and close down public places an intensive campaign was rolled out and guidelines were developed for personal hygiene surveillance contact tracing quarantine diagnosis laboratory tests and management people were advised not to visit farms live animal markets or places where animals are slaughtered and to avoid mass gatherings all the health care facilities were asked to stop regular out-patient and in-patient services and to continue with solely emergency services doctors were encouraged to use telemedicine services arogya setu app was also launched to connect essential health services with people of india to fight against covid-19 this app will reach out and inform the users of the risk best practice and relevant advisories pertaining to containment of covid-19 amenities like hotels colleges railway train coaches etc were converted into quarantine facilities and large public places as stadiums were converted into isolation wards to handle an anticipated increased number of cases some of the states converted existing hospitals to exclusively handle covid-19 patients on march 22nd prime minister narendra modi initiated the lockdown process with a 14-hour janta curfew followed by lockdown in 75 covid-19 affected districts and a nationwide lockdown for the 3 weeks a containment plan involving the state and twenty ministries was set up a round-the-clock control room was set up at the headquarters of the general director of health service dghs to address the virus-related queries the countries of the south asian association for regional cooperation saarc were invited to fight jointly against this pandemic and 10 million us dollars were allocated for saarc countries a huge evacuation program of many indian nationals was done from the covid-19 affected areasall the measures implemented in india are revealing efficiency in flattening the curve nevertheless a small effort has been addressed to the identification of asymptomatic and mild cases this might have detrimental effects on the indian economy in the long term a long duration of the lockdown might be more devastating in india than in wealthier countries like the united kingdom or australia and it could result in serious economic damage increased hunger and poverty and it might reduce the populations resilience to handle the infection therefore if these cases remain unidentified there is a possibility of another peak of covid-19 cases once the lockdown is lifted and indias healthcare system might be not able to handle it properly hence moving ahead india should have staggered exit from the lockdown especially in the covid-19 hotspot areas and use this lockdown period to screen and identify as many cases as possible isolate them and quarantine their contacts as compared to other countries worldwide a very low number of tests have been run in india fig 4 with the highest number done in kerala table 1 testing is done in 122 government labs and 44 private laboratories however it is likely to increase in the near future42 at the time this article is being written 158 districts in india have recorded at least one covid-19 case42 hence this opportunity should be taken to screen the high-risk areas in these districts using the mid-level personnel both from the government and private sectors at the same time the capacity for rapid diagnostic testing at the primary level should be implemented to identify cases earlier and limit the transmission this period should be also utilized for producing a large supply of ppe for the safety of health care workers and increasing the number of available ventilators in case the outbreak worsensin conclusion india and the world have a long legacy of successful efforts to prevent or cure widespread infections recalling the successful smallpox eradication campaign of the 1970s we are reminded of the pivotal role of leadership and sound management to stop the killer disease43 hence india has the opportunity to reverse disease predictions with stringent containment measures social distancing increasing case detection isolation and quarantining the contacts efforts should be made to enlist community support and ownership so containment measures do not depend exclusively on administrative measures critical situations like a mass exodus of laborers from the major cities to the rural areas as well as mass gatherings like nizamuddin markaz event which happened recently should be avoidedas the impact of covid-19 is not limited to human infection and death other associated issues should be addressed like social discrimination for instance healthcare workers are increasingly looked at as someone who can spread the virus in the community furthermore asian americans have been experiencing a rising number of episodes of violence and hate after us president made hurtful and misleading comments as china is to blame and calling covid-19 the chinese virusthe impact of covid has been also affecting sectors like entertainment tourism restaurants and the travel industry with a tremendous escalation of job losses44 disrupted supply chain and declining stock markets are the final consequences of these social changes thus hitting the global economy44 finally a greater incidence of panic disorder anxiety depression and other psychosocial issues has been reported45looking into the near future containing the covid-19 epidemic is likely to take several months public health interventions will be directed towards social distancing and improving hygienic practices these interventions will be effective in delaying the onset of wide community transmission reducing peak incidence and its impact on public services5 testing contact tracing isolation of infected and precautionary self-isolation of contacts is critical in reducing the number of new cases46 an exceptionally high degree of understanding in the population and acceptance of these measures is also critical46 these interventions have to be balanced with getting back to normal life and everyday activities to the best extent possible until a reversing the trajectory of the pandemic is traced47a little knowledge is available so far on alternate routes of transmission namely via sewage contaminated water or air conditioning systems it is also poorly known if those who have recovered from sars-cov-2 infection would be protected from reinfection but evidence to confirm this is yet to be generated antibody testing has to be implemented on a large scale to identify who is already immune to the virus the effect of temperature season and humidity on covid-19 also has an impact on the covid-19 outbreak however results from other parts of the world are awaited4849multiple trials are currently underway to develop novel treatment options as well as a vaccine to treat the respiratory syndrome but results are still awaited50 moreover months are needed before a vaccine is developed and approved even though herd immunity develops over time vulnerable groups as the healthcare workforce and elderly people should still be preserved smart working and staggered shifts may have to be adopted to mitigate covid-19 transmission in the future digital didactic and online learning can be protracted for months telemedicine and in particular teleophthalmology needs to be implemented also in the future infectious diseases will be probably included amongst the most important health hazards along with anti-microbial resistance51 in addition timely identification efficient diagnosis rapid isolation and clinical management would remain in the forefront51one of the last concerns regards the second wave of covid-19 outbreak asian countries and cities that seemed to have brought the coronavirus epidemic under control are suddenly tightening their borders and imposing stricter containment measures fearful about new imported infections hong kong suddenly saw new cases spike as high as 65 in one day and ordered a new closure of non-essential activities in japan where infections have remained relatively controlled cases started to rise in march as travelers returned in the home country new cases of local transmission have also been detected similarly singapore again announced one-month lockdown in view of increased local transmission this portends a worrisome sign for the united states europe india and the rest of the world regarding the second wave of the virus spreading once the restrictive measures are relieved52nilthere are no conflicts of interestby the end of march 2020 more than three-quarters of a million people had been diagnosed with covid-19 and more than 39 000 had died 1 even though the disease was declared a pandemic by the world health organization who only earlierthat month the pandemic has swiftly reached and affected all continents and countries around the globe measures taken to reduce the rapid spread of the sars-cov-2 virus 2 have extended the impact of the pandemic on health systems economies and society everywhere in the worldno treatment for covid-19 exists and a vaccine will not be available in less than 18 months in an optimistic scenario nonpharmacological practices such as covering the mouth and nose when coughingsneezing frequent handwashing and maintaining spatial separation between persons can only retard the spread of the virus and mitigate the burden of the disease the strategies of social distancing include closure of educational institutions and workplaces cancellation of mass gatherings isolation of suspected or confirmed cases quarantine of persons in contact with confirmed cases stay-at-home recommendations and even mandatory quarantine in some cities and residential areas 3 these and further measures have been implemented especially to protect populations at higher risk the elderly and people with comorbidities such as cancer hypertension diabetes and cardiovascular diseasegovernmental interventions have aimed above all else as they should at the protection of physical health however social distancing seeds the spread of misinformation and can have profound consequences for psychological wellbeing in vulnerable populations 4 see fig 1
social distancing can diminish the wellbeing of not just those thought to be members of at-risk populations it can reduce the wellbeing of anyone experiencing confinement even in small degrees and all humankind in general given the dire situation posed by this pandemic some experts have recommended changing the term social distancing to spatial distancing because of social distancing can be misleading 5 spatial distancing more correctly connotes maintaining the physical distance from others that the use of social distancing intends to promote but proper adherence to spatial distancing or isolation can have the side-effect of a social distancing that can have unfortunate consequences for psychological wellbeinga study conducted during the epidemic in january among over 17 000 users of weibo  one of the most popular social networks in china - found differences in the expression of emotions among its users from which inferences about users psychological states may be drawn in a two-week period of social distancing the number of posts talking about depression anxiety and indignation increased while the expression of positive emotions decreased significantly 6social interaction can still take place using the internet mobile phones and other technological devices in challenging times the value of social capital rather than being neglected should be highlightedmisinformation not only inheres in the inaccuracy of information it can emerge from the torrent of information coming from non-experts and commercially-driven interests misinformation may lead to uncertainty that is increased by the novelty of the virus to which we are being exposed this state of uncertainty often in combination with mobility restrictions and isolation increases the risk of feelings of insecurity anxiety and a general emotional tension all of which may impair our quality of life fear arising from the excess or unreliability of information about disease can lead to erratic behaviour trigger the onset of psychiatric disorders and even increase rates of suicide 7 the daily flood of often contradictory information has led to panic buying of supplies that are unnecessary under conditions of spatial or social distancing and to the misinterpretation of health care recommendationsmisinformation on the other hand can also create a false sense of reassurance statements underestimating the severity of the disease eg it is just a flu and downplaying the risk that young populations run eg it only kills old people could have contributed greatly to the spread of the disease and its rapid progressionflawed communication is not confined to the media researchers academia and policymakers are disconnected from each other both recommendations and measures already adopted are not being coordinated producing scientific evidence takes time but preventive measures often have to be taken before science can yield all the answers moreover research findings are written using technical insider terminology and usually published in english this impairs policy-making everywhere but especially in non-english-speaking countriesthe situation in low- and middle-income countries lmic could be even worse some countries in latin america have younger populations than those in europe and some asian countries which is an advantage in terms of biological resistance against the coronavirus but most of these countries have weaker health systems and socioeconomic conditions that can exacerbate consequences of the pandemic and increase social and health inequalities indigenous populations homeless people populations of lower socioeconomic status migrants and people in prison or detention bear high burdens caused by of high-risk environmental exposures the inaccessibility of both accurate information and timely healthcare services and myriad demographic and psychosocial conditions that impose poor health upon themthe largest proportions of indigenous populations live in lmic they are frequently marginalised do not live in big urban centres and have limited access to health care services beliefs about wellbeing and health can also influence how they seek medical attention this poses challenges for health systems based on or oriented towards typical european and north american norms and values language barriers can intervene between the healthcare providers and indigenous people whose lifestyles foods physical activities and hygienic practices also vary the immune profile of indigenous populations can also differ from those of the majority populations living in the same region response to a new virus and disease may therefore be unexpected and even deadlier among such minority groupsa high proportion of homeless persons have chronic physical and mental disorders these persons can be even more overlooked once healthcare services are allocated almost exclusively to fighting the covid-19 pandemic detection of cases and prevention of disease in a transient population are more difficult yet worse is that many countries lack the infrastructure and resources to shelter and assume the care of homeless persons in an eventual quarantine 8the situations of imprisoned populations or people living in detention centres are similar the spread of the coronavirus will be unimpeded in both overcrowded prisons and detention centres chronic diseases are more prevalent and mortality rates are higher in prisons in many states just as it is for the homeless the provision of healthcare services for incarcerated or detained persons is deficient in centres in which the workers might not be prepared for the outbreak of an epidemic 9the pandemic is already exacerbating the precarious situation of migrants refugees and asylum seekers now that most countries have closed their borders people fleeing their countries due to war and insecurity are struggling to find shelter migrants have poor access to healthcare services and a large proportion of them do not even have access to clean and safe water colombia has almost 6 million internally displaced personas and in the last few years approximately 2 million venezuelans have migrated into the country the majority of this migrant population lack adequate housing healthcare and social support they are also victims of xenophobia and discrimination being accused of spreading the covid-19 in the country 10on the frontline of the epidemic stand healthcare professionals hcp whose workload is increased by the pandemic as they have to work with limited medical resources they are themselves highly exposed to infection these factors in addition to the frustration of not being supported by a strong health care system and the fear of infecting people around them increase the prevalence of symptoms of stress depression and anxiety disorders with long-term consequences as was seen during the sars epidemic in 2003 11 a study of the covid-19 epidemic in hubei china conducted among 493 physicians and 764 nurses found that around half of them showed symptoms of depression and anxiety many of the participants also reported insomnia and 70  psychological distress women and nurses  who in great proportion were the first responders - were more affected it is important to point out that the consequences of working under stressful conditions are not confined to hcp stressful conditions also compromise their performance in caring for patients 12the elderly who are the main target group of most of the policies of social distancing due to their high risk of presenting complications from covid-19 need stronger psychosocial support because so many live in permanent isolation and do not have social networks and have limited social activities 1314 persons with psychiatric disorders face similar situations because policies of social distancing can worsen their symptomslarge families that are financially constrained and live in poor housing conditions are very common in lmic the combination of confinement and isolation increases the risk of interpersonal conflict in families which in turn puts children and women at higher risk of domestic violence for as long as the stay-at-home measures last 15 authorities in china have warned families about the consequences of spending too much time together sharing the same space appointments to file for divorce rose significantly in march after couples had been under the stay-at-home order for over a month experts argue that impulsive decisions caused by daily conflict can lead to divorce 16recently human rights watch called for the protection of the rights of persons who live with disabilities who constantly deal with barriers that impair their access to healthcare services they must receive reliable information on the pandemic and support to adopt preventive strategies 17although a certain level of stress is practically unavoidable when facing dramatic circumstances such as those currently unfolding wellbeing is a key concept to support and facilitate mental healthcaring for the wellbeing of individuals is not limited to preventing the incidence of mental health disorders the onset of symptoms of stress and other psychiatric disorders can affect the immune system furthermore reduction in the expression of positive emotions and the loss of life satisfaction is associated with higher levels of inflammation which increases the risk of contracting disease 18 for this reason experts are making recommendations that can promote mental health and overall wellbeingduring confinement it is important to be creative in the ways we maintain meaningful affective and social links strategies for doing this can be not only technological very vulnerable populations such as elderly persons in nursing homes may not have wide access to the internet and electronic devices affording certain kinds of social support community action to alleviate the psychological impact of social isolation is thus even of greater importance in spite of the imposition of strict confinement routines nursing homes could risk continuing relatively safe social activities among the elderly to avoid the much greater risk of impairing the overall state of the residents healthto reduce anxiety caused by overexposure to news experts advise that people update themselves on the current situation no more than twice a day and rely only upon mainstream sources with reliable access to official information the access of children and minors to the news and mobile devices should be restricted scientifically knowledgeable source are opening up accounts on social media so that reliable information which counters the plethora of fake news reaches more people 19 we must emphasize that much remains uncertain about the science and management of covid-19 and the virus that causes the disease this will remain the case for some time and reliable reporting of what we learn should not misrepresent the evolving and provisional state of our knowledgeto reduce misinformation among vulnerable populations news broadcasts should be more inclusive add languages like sign language and use diverse channels that include television radio newspapers mobile apps and landlines information should be communicated in simple language that is understandable by everyone no matter his or her educational level 17 instead of using complex terms and neologisms such as social distancing experts recommend giving specific advice for example you should go to the supermarket only once a week once you are there avoid getting too close to the others states can also collaborate with non-governmental organizations to promote lifestyle changes and establish initiatives that help the most vulnerable populationsregarding the provision of specialised services healthcare systems should explore the use of telemedicine to protect mental health professionals from getting infected improve the delivery of mental health services and ensure access to the internet and other means of communication by vulnerable populations 20 some countries are already offering psychological assistance via the internet or telephone and using mobile apps to provide counselling or treatment amid the covid-19 crisis 12 hcp should also be trained in psychosocial skills to cope with stress and receive practical training on surveillance and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders 19finally it is worth considering that etymologically the word pandemic derives from pan all and demos people greek doctors used this term to refer to that which affects the entire population and that is precisely the message of this article we call upon hcp public health specialists academics researchers and policy-makers to engage in communitarian strategies that favour the wellbeing of the population - and especially those who are so often overlooked all of us share responsibility independent of the state your wellbeing is our wellbeing only through cooperation and solidarity will long-term solutions to pandemic disease and its consequences be achievedcristina mesa vieira was responsible for

involved in the conduction of this study therefore no informed consent was required the anonymity of individual data is also preserved according to ethical and international regulationsthis article was commissioned and peer reviewedthe outbreak of highly contagious covid-19 pandemic came as a surprise event with unprecedented uncertainty with respect to how deadly disease really is and whether and when can we get a vaccine in response governments across the world scrambled with emergency actions such as lockdowns travel restrictions testing and quarantining and economic packages the main purpose of these actions was to ensure social distancing among people to contain the spread of the disease on the one hand while to minimize the adverse economic impact on the other hand however these actions generated additional uncertainty regarding their effectiveness and impact for instance lockdowns though could be effective in reducing new infections increased the economic distancing as well thereby hurting the jobs and incomes of tens of millions of people despite the fact that long-term effect of these government actions yet has to be seen in this paper we examine their expected impact by analyzing the stock markets reaction to these actions stock markets which include the pool of sophisticated and opinionated investors provide an incentivized survey of future expected outcomes wagner 2020 argues stock markets provide particularly useful information in fast evolving complex situationsparticularly we examine stock markets reaction to three types of government actions including social distancing measures containment and health response and income support packages social distancing measures include the closure of schools workplaces parks public transport among others containment and health response is mainly about government public awareness campaigns and testing and quarantining policy income support packages include the government financial assistance to households in the form of direct cash transfers or relief in debt or other payments for utilitieswe postulate that these government actions have both direct and indirect effects on stock market returns for the direct effects social distancing measures might have direct negative effect on stock market returns by adversely affecting economic activity on the contrary government containment and health response and income support packages are likely to lead to positive market reaction by enhancing the investors confidence and reducing the adverse economic effects due to the diseasethe indirect effect of these government actions channels through the reduction in the intensity of covid-19 outbreaks comprehensive and strict government actions such as stringent social distancing measures aggressive testing and quarantining policy and generous government income support programs might reduce the rate of new infections building on the recently emerging literature which reports that stock markets around the world have reacted to covid-19 pandemic with strong negative returns al-awadhi et al 2020 ashraf 2020a baker et al 2020 ramelli and wagner 2020 zhang et al 2020 we argue that if strict government actions reduce the intensity of local outbreaks then they weaken the negative market reaction to the growth in covid-19 confirmed casesto empirically examine the above hypothesized relationships we use a panel dataset of daily stock market returns government responses and the growth in covid-19 confirmed cases from 77 countries over the period january 22 to april 17 2020 after controlling for country characteristics and systematic risk due to international factors we find that social distancing measures have direct negative impact on stock returns while an indirect positive impact by reducing the growth rate of new confirmed cases containment and health policies and income support packages have direct positive impact on stock returns but do not affect stock returns indirectly through the reduction in growth in confirmed cases together our results provide evidence that stock markets have priced in the impact of government actions results remain robust against alternative sample compositions and alternative estimation methodswe offer at least two important contributions to the existing literature first we add to the emerging literature which examines the impact of covid-19 on financial sector outcomes in this regard recent literature surveys by goodell 2020 and yarovaya et al 2020 suggest that covid-19 pandemic might have important impact on the functioning of financial sector and is a promising research domain focusing on more specific issues corbet et al 2020a examined the impact of being named corona on stock returns and find that the companies with corona word in their names experienced strong negative hourly returns and an exceptionally large increase in hourly volatility when covid-19 pandemic was announced likewise sharif et al 2020 find that the pandemic has a greater effect on the us geopolitical risk and economic uncertainty than on the us stock market debating the safe heaven properties of different assets corbet et al 2020b conlon and mcgee 2020 and conlon et al 2020 conclude that crypto assets largely do not act as hedges or safe havens but perhaps rather as amplifiers of contagion during the bear market amid the pandemic on the other hand goodell and goutte 2020 analyze the bitcoin reaction to daily covid-19 world deaths and show that bitcoin is a safe haven asset moreover sharif et al 2020 find gold and soybean futures as having strong safe-haven role during the covid-19 outbreak in this regard we examine how stock markets reacted to government actions aimed to control the pandemic besides we also examine how government actions interact with local covid-19 outbreaks to affect the stock market returnssecond we complement the recent studies which examine the impact of covid-19 on financial markets al-awadhi et al 2020 ali et al 2020 ashraf 2020a baker et al 2020 haroon and rizvi 2020 ramelli and wagner 2020 schell et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 for instance focusing on stock market volatility baker et al 2020 compared the reaction of us stock market to various infectious diseases and found that covid-19 has inflicted the unprecedented volatility likewise zhang et al 2020 examined the volatility of ten stock markets in the countries with most confirmed cases over the months of january and february 2020 and found that volatility increased substantially in february due to covid-19 focusing on stock market returns alfaro et al 2020 use data from the us and found that equity market value declined in response to pandemics such as covid-19 and sars likewise al-awadhi et al 2020 found overall share prices declined in china due to the expected adverse economic outcomes of covid-19 ashraf 2020a examined data from 64 countries and found that overall stock markets reacted negatively to the covid-19 outbreak however this reaction was only significant to the growth in number of confirmed cases but not to the growth in number of deaths we add to this literature by finding that stringent social distancing measures have significantly weakened the stock markets negative reaction to the growth in covid-19 confirmed cases in this regard our study is comparable to ashraf 2020b who shows that higher national-level uncertainty avoidance significantly strengthens the negative stock markets reaction to the growth in covid-19 confirmed casesthe rest of the paper proceeds as follows section 2 introduces data collection procedure section 3 introduces the indexes which measure government response during the covid-19 pandemic section 4 explains testable hypotheses section 5 is about empirical model section 6 reports empirical results final section concludes the studyfor the purpose of this study we mainly collected data from three main sources daily stock market returns data was collected from the wwwinvestingcom website this data was available for around 80 countries to maintain consistency we choose only one major stock index from each sample country next we downloaded the data of daily covid-19 confirmed cases for each country from the john hopkins university coronavirus resource centre jhu-crc website lastly we collected data of government response indexes from the oxcgrt website we chose sample period from january 22 to april 17 2020 we selected this sample period because both early covid-19 confirmed cases and government responses in each country mainly occurred during this period for example ramelli and wagner 2020 argue that the most important period regarding market reaction to covid-19 was from january 20 to march 20 2020 likewise hale et al 2020a show that average global government response curves flattened and even started declining from mid-april onwardwe appended three datasets together to get the main sample we applied two filters to refine the main sample first we dropped countries with missing data of stock returns covid-19 confirmed cases or government response indexes second we dropped daily observations with missing values of any of the required variables our refined sample consists of 2750 daily observations from 77 countries over the period january 22 to april 17 2020 table 1 reports basic information about the sample distribution
we use oxford covid-19 government response tracker oxcgrt database hale et al 2020b to quantify governments response to covid-19 led crisis oxcgrt has measured governments responses with three main indexes stringency index containment and health index and economic support indexstringency index records information on social distancing measures and is coded from 8 indicators including school closing workplace closing cancel public events restrictions on gathering size close public transport stay at home requirements restrictions on internal movement and restrictions on international traveleconomic support index is constructed from 2 indicators including the government income support and debtcontract relief for households programs this index represents government policies regarding income support to citizens amid crisiscontainment and health index is coded from 3 indicators representing public awareness campaigns testing policy and contact tracing this index represents government emergency policies regarding health system such as the covid-19 testing regimeeach of the three indexes is simple additive score of the underlying indicators and is rescaled to vary from 0 to 100 the indexes are for comparative purposes and should not be interpreted as a rating of the appropriateness or effectiveness of a countrys response hale et al 2020a appendix reports detailed definitions of these government response indexesin this section we draw testable hypotheses regarding the direct and indirect impact of announcements of government social distancing measures containment and health policies and economic support programs on stock market returnssocial distancing saves lives on the one hand while imposes large costs on society due to the reduced economic activity on the other hand therefore government actions such as lockdowns and travel restrictions targeted to ensure social distancing are expected to have both direct and indirect effects on stock returns for the direct effect such policies have adverse economic impact by shutting down places of work such as schools offices and factories for instance sauvagnat et al 2020 estimate that a 10 increase in state-level labor restrictions in the us led to a 3 drop in employment and a 187 drop in firms market value in the month of april 2020 only when investors price these adverse valuation effects the stringent government social distancing measures lead to decline in stock market returns based on this discussion we write our first hypothesis in the following form
h1a the announcements of government social distancing measures lead to decline in stock market returnsdespite the direct negative effect on economic activity social distancing might also have positive economic impact by reducing the risk of mortalities greenstone and nigam 2020 thunstrm et al 2020 in this regard greenstone and nigam 2020 estimate that moderate social distancing in the usa beginning from late march 2020 would save 17 million lives by october 1 in the usa the major chunk of lives saved is due to avoided overwhelming of hospital intensive care units using the estimates of the united states governments value of a statistical life they project 8 trillion economic benefits of social distancing through reduction in mortalities likewise thunstrm et al 2020 estimate a net benefit of about 52 trillion of social distancing in the usa the people in countries where government implemented stringent social distancing policies are more likely to practice social distancing hussain 2020 and hence have lower chances to get infected and consequently die from the virus thus the benefits of social distancing mainly channeled through the reduction in new infectionsa number of recent studies show that stock markets reacted to the growth in covid-19 confirmed cases with negative returns al-awadhi et al 2020 ashraf 2020a we postulate if social distancing has positive impact by reducing new infections then stringent government social distancing measures would weaken the negative stock market reaction to the growth in confirmed cases our specific hypothesis is as follows
h1b the announcements of stringent government social distancing measures are likely to weaken the stock markets negative reaction to the growth in covid-19 confirmed caseslikewise stock market reaction to government measures regarding the containment and healthcare system might be positive for instance government aggressive information campaign provides awareness about the benefits of staying at home sanitize common places and washing hands regularly moreover testing and contact tracing helps to identify infected and suspected cases in the early phases of the pandemic countries such as south korea and japan have achieved enormous success in controlling the local outbreaks through extensive testing and contact tracing better healthcare policies are likely to lead to positive market reaction by boosting investors confidence and trust in government to control the pandemic
h2a the announcements of government containment and healthcare policies lead to increase in stock market returnsfurther better containment and health policies are likely to produce benefits in terms of lower new infections and mortality rates lower mortality rate in turn provides enormous economic benefits in terms of more saved lives greenstone and nigam 2020 thunstrm et al 2020 therefore we hypothesis if public awareness campaigns and testing and contact tracing have positive impact by reducing new infections then announcements of containment and health policies would weaken the negative stock market reaction to the growth in confirmed cases
h2b the announcement of government containment and health policies are likely to weaken the stock markets negative reaction to the growth in covid-19 confirmed casesfinally stock market reaction to government economic support programs is likely to be positive economic support programs to some extent can counter adverse impact of the social distancing measures on incomes and employment direct cash transfers help households to buy essential goods while staying under lockdowns therefore investors might react positively to such actions and our specific hypothesis is as under
h3a the announcements of government economic support programs lead to increase stock market returnsincome support programs might also affect stock returns by reducing the infection rate due to higher compliance with social distancing measures recent studies such as lou et al 2020 and wright et al 2020 find that compliance with stay-at-home orders varies significantly with income where lower-income groups are less likely to follow the orders and more likely to get exposed to the virus since income support is largely provided to poor segments of the society more generous income support programs can lead to reduction in infection rates by motivating lower income individuals to stay at home
h3b the announcements of government income support packages are likely to weaken the stock markets negative reaction to the growth in covid-19 confirmed casesfollowing ashraf 2020a we specify following pooled panel ordinary least squares regression model to examine the direct impact of government actions on stock market returns 1yctc1governmentresponsect2covid19ct1c1c1ccct1t1tdtct
here y is the dependent variable and measures stock market returns in county c on day t c is a constant term specifically daily stock market return equals indexvaluetindexvaluet1indexvaluet1 government response is represented with the daily change in three government response indexes from oxcgrt dataset hale et al 2020b these variables include stringency index containment and health index and economic support index following ashraf 2020a who found that stock markets reaction was significant to covid-19 cases but not to fatalities we measure covid-19 as the daily growth in covid-19 confirmed casesin a cross-country setting investors reaction to similar events might vary due to specific institutional or cultural contexts of countries ashraf 2020b since our study sample is very short most of the country-level factors remain fixed therefore rather than to include individual country-level control variables we add a matrix of country fixed-effects dummy variables these dummy variables effectively control for all factors which remain fixed over the sample period but differ across sample countries stock markets also react to international events such as oil prices or major international events with strong spill-over effects across borders to control for this systematic risk due to international factors we include daily fixed-effects dummy variables dt in the model ct is an error term we use heteroskedastic-robust standard errors to estimate p-values in regressionswe modify eq 1 as follows to examine the indirect impact of government actions on stock market returns through the channel of reduction in new infections 2yctc1governmentresponsect2covid19ct13governmentresponsectcovid19ct1c1c1ccct1t1tdtct
the interaction term governmentresponsectcovid19ct1 is the main variable of interest where the estimated values of coefficient 3 show whether the stock market reaction to the growth in covid-19 confirmed cases depends on government actions we use interaction terms for each of the three government response indexes with growth in confirmed cases all other variables are same as in eq 1
this section reports empirical results table 2 reports summary statistics for main variables the stock market returns variable has a mean value of 000 with a standard deviation of 003 zero mean value confirms the random walk property of stock market returns the 017 mean value of the growth in confirmed covid-19 cases variable indicates on average covid-19 cases observed a 17 percent daily increase the minimum and maximum values of government response indexes show that governments have responded with significant changes in policies
table 3 reports main empirical results model 1 is the baseline specification the growth in confirmed cases variable enters negative and significant this result confirms the findings of previous studies such as al-awadhi et al 2020 alfaro et al 2020 and ashraf 2020a that stock markets reacted to covid-19 outbreaks with strong negative returns and validates our model for further analysis we include government response indexes in model 2 the stringency index enters negative and significant showing that stock markets react with negative returns to government actions regarding increase in social distancing measures this result indicates that corporate valuations on average decline due to the adverse effect of social distancing on economic activity and supports our hypothesis h1a both containment and health and economic support indexes enter positive showing that overall stock markets reacted to these government actions with positive returns however the result of economic support index is not statistically significant one possible reason is that economic support index which we use measures the income and debt relief support to households but not to businesses therefore stock market reaction to these actions though positive is not very strong on the contrary stock markets might have reacted more strongly to financial support to businesses which unfortunately economic support index does not measure future studies might focus on this area
next we examine how government actions interact with the growth in covid-19 confirmed cases to affect stock market returns as shown in model 3 the interaction term growth in confirmed cases  stringency index enters positive and significant suggesting that the negative impact of growth in confirmed cases on stock market returns weakens in countries with more stringent social distancing measures this result confirms that markets take social distancing positively because of its effectiveness in reducing the number of covid-19 confirmed cases other two interaction terms growth in confirmed cases  containment and health index and growth in confirmed cases  economic support index are not statistically significant suggesting that the impact of government actions related to healthcare and income support is not channeled through the reduction in confirmed cases together these results suggest investors expect that government social distancing measures are the most effective mechanism to contain the disease while public awareness and testing and quarantining policies are less so
following ashraf et al 2020 we use graphical approach to explain the moderating effect of government actions on the relationship between stock returns and growth in confirmed cases with interaction terms for doing so we graph relationship between stock returns and growth in confirmed cases at mean and  one standard deviation of mean value of all three government response indexes one-by-one graphs 1 2 and 3 in fig 1 are drawn from model 3 of table 3the overall downward slopped lines in these graphs show that stock market returns and growth in confirmed cases are negatively associated however lines with different slopes in each graph show that the negative association between stock returns and growth in confirmed cases varies with variation in government actions this variation is the strongest in graph 1 for social distancing measures where the slope of the lower line with embedded circles turns to be positive as compared to the negative slope of the upper line with embedded squares this suggests when government implements stringent social distancing measures the stock markets negative reaction to the growth in confirmed cases not only weakens but becomes positive in graphs 2 and 3 slopes of upper and lower lines change only slightly and remain negative confirming that government actions regarding containment and health and economic support do not significantly moderate the negative association between stock returns and growth in confirmed caseswe perform several robustness tests to further confirm the above results in this regard first we replace country fixed-effects dummies with country-level macroeconomic and institutional control variables specifically following ashraf 2020a we include log gdp investment freedom democratic accountability and uncertainty avoidance definitions of these variables are given in appendix log gdp variable controls for the differences in economic development of countries investment freedom index measures the easiness with which foreign investors can invest in a country and controls for the presence of foreign competition in local financial market democratic accountability index controls for the cross-country differences in political institutions likewise uncertainty avoidance index controls for the differences in uncertainty aversion of stock market investors from different countries as shown in table 4 the main results largely are similar to those in table 3 even after replacing country fixed-effects dummies with specific country-level control variablessecond we use panel random-effects model as an alternative estimation method and re-estimate all specifications of table 3 in unreported results1
we observe findings largely remain similar as in table 3in this paper we examine the expected economic impact of government actions such as social distancing measures public awareness programs testing and quarantining policies and economic support packages during the covid-19 pandemic by analyzing the effect of such actions on stock market returns for empirical analysis we use the daily data of stock market returns growth in covid-19 confirmed cases and announcements regarding government policies from 77 countries over the period january 22 to april 17 2020we find the announcements regarding the implementation of social distancing measures by governments have dual a direct negative and an indirect positive effect on stock market returns specifically the announcements of social distancing measures result in negative stock market returns due to their expected adverse impact on economic activity while these announcements lead to positive market returns through the channel of reduction in covid-19 confirmed cases government announcements regarding public awareness programs testing and quarantining policies and income support packages largely result in positive market returnsour findings have important implications though some studies such as heyden and heyden 2020 shanaev et al 2020 and zaremba et al 2020 show government social distancing measures are counterproductive however we show that such measures also have indirect beneficial economic impact through the channel of reduction in the intensity of covid-19 outbreaks therefore it is difficult to predict their net impact on economic outcomes and more research needs to be done with the availability of further data to better understand the economic impact of such government measures our findings to some extent are aligned with correia et al 2020 who find that stringent non-pharmaceutical interventions used across the us cities during the 1918 flu pandemic led to better economic outcomes in the medium run as the frequency of pandemics including contagious diseases has increased over recent decades ross et al 2015 a consensus regarding the net economic impact of government social distancing measures can help in designing better government response in the futurethe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paperhuman population faces a grave health-related challenge in the form of infectious diseases that are responsible for the highest number of deaths globally the tiniest primitive invisible life form is now controlling the behavior of the most powerful and evolved life form on earth tough times ahead 12between 1940 and 2020 around 340 new infectious diseases have emerged globally the compromised health and disability due to infectious diseases which accounts for 30 of all disability- adjusted life years decreases work productivity and increases morbidity12 since the dawn of civilization humans and microbes have co-existed and interacted with each other is the situation worse now the answer to this question might be yes it is because of our immense population and our several activities that lead to flourishing of infectionsmodern civilization dates back to approximately 10000 bc we are consuming earths resources at a rate that is unsustainable at around 8000 bc the global human population was 5 million by 1 ad the population grew up to 200 million it reached around 1 billion in the 1800s during industrial revolution the second billion was achieved in only 130 years 1930 the third billion in 30 years 1960 the fourth billion in 15 years 1974 and the fifth billion in only 13 years 1987 during the 20th century alone the population in the world has grown from 165 billion to 6 billion it is projected to reach 14 to 18 billion by the end of the 21st century3 today sars-cov-2 has spread to 216 countries areas and territories with nearly 6310635 infected cases and 374723 deaths as on 1 june 2020 and has officially been termed as a pandemic by who on 11th march 2020 most of the covid- 19-related deaths occurred in the usa united kingdom italy france spain germany belgium brazil iran turkey etc4in a global world with hyperconnected international travel and transport points of entry poes - airports ports and ground crossings - could play a key role in the worldwide spread of diseases the travel and transport sectors are indispensable part of public health emergency preparedness and response actions related to poesmost of the human respiratory infections caused by coronaviruses including nl63 oc43 hku1 and hcov-229e are mild in nature however in the past two decades two beta-coronaviruses middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarscov have severely infected more than 10000 individuals with mortality rates of 37 and 10 respectively5 the fatality rate of covid-19 is lower than both of these infections6the pattern of infection of covid-19 is unique and unpredictable previous studies have suggested that similar to sarscov covid-19 might interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans the amino acid sequence of the nucleocapsid n protein of covid-19 is 90 identical to that of sars-cov covid-19 might cross-react with the n protein antibodies of sars-cov however these antibodies might not provide cross-immunity in addition similar to sars-cov sars-cov-2 might inhibit the rna interference defense mechanism of the host organism7super-spreaders release significantly higher levels of viral particles compared to other infected individuals which increases their chances of spreading the infectioncoronaviruses are enveloped non-segmented positive-sense rna viruses belonging to the family coronaviridae and order nidovirales coronaviruses target the upper respiratory tract which leads to several ailments including pneumonia however they might also affect the central nervous system that leads to longterm neurological damage the rna genome of coronavirus encodes for sixteen nonstructural proteins nsp 116 with known or predicted rna synthesis and modification functions and they have also been suggested to trigger evolution of large genomes8virus characteristics primarily define the risk of infection these characteristics include the efficacy of the virus to spread the severity of the disease after infection and the efficacy and success rates of the available medical resources to contain the spread of the virus with no vaccine or medication community intervention becomes the most important response strategy against a pandemic in a nutshell covid-19 risk can be defined as the risk of exposure versus risk of serious illness and death the general risk factors of covid-19 include advanced age and chronic medical conditions such as diabetes cardiac disorders etcreducing the number of emerging cases to a level where health-care facilities can adequately manage them is important to flatten the curvethe world responded to covid-19 pandemic with remarkable speed and resource mobilization within a matter of weeks the causative agent for this pandemic was identified and sequenced by the chinese scientists further genomic and clinical data were shared rapidly around the world to date various potential treatments have been proposed for this virus however none of the antiviral treatments have been approved there is still no vaccine available for covid-19 with ongoing research it can be assumed that we would soon have a vaccine for sars-cov-2social distancing is crucial in the regulation of the spread of the infection at community level it plays an indirect role in prevention of the overwhelming of our health care systems by reducing the number of infection persons and the rate of infection however social distancing tests the degree of cooperation among humans there is a correlation between perceived social connectedness and stress responses more prominent effect could be observed on those who are already lonely or isolated better mental health is critical for better physical health prioritizing mental health is important during times of high stress in the digital age and information superhighway people are fortunate to live in an era where technology will allow us to see and hear our friends and family even from a distance having said that social distancing is not a permanent state this is a moment in time a multifarious approach is required and involvement of community leaders is critical responsible electronic and print media also have an important role to play governments around the world are struggling with the question of how to reopen their economies while still containing the virusthe covid-19 could become endemic like hiv it is here to stay and it is impossible to predict that when this pandemic is supposed to control this would take a massive effort even if a vaccine was found it is still possible to control the virus with effort strong and robust control of the virus is required in order to lower the assessment of risk everyone should contribute to stopping this pandemicboth life and livelihood are important deprivation is unacceptable shelter food healthcare and subsistence for weaker sections of population are the key challenges poor like migrant workers and casual labourers eat from garbage containers which is a disgrace equally important is the care of internally displaced people and refugees they need special attentionshaping the future is critical as schools remain closed during the pandemic the education of many children for whom long distance learning is unavailable stands at great risk nations must do everything in their power to protect children from the dire consequences teens are feeling lonely and anxious in isolation poor children with limited access and illiteratesemi-literate parents are in serious trouble they are losing out this will impact them severely as the pandemic pushes up levels of hunger among the global poor governments must prevent devastating nutrition and health consequences for children missing out on school meals amid school closuresthe covid-19 pandemic could also lead to the spread of other preventable diseases economic recovery from covid-19 will be much harderaccording to the global health security index 2019 india ranked 57th among 100 countries on a scale to gauge preparedness for the outbreak of serious infectious diseases densely populated cities low awareness and unhygienic conditions can turn this outbreak into an epidemic in a matter of days shortage of health facilities like hospital beds rapid testing facilities healthcare equipment and quarantine facilities would lay immense burden on an already over-stretched healthcare system india with over 138 billion population must have robust and evidence-based health care management and action plans in place along with extraordinary monitoring supervision and continuous assessment to control this pandemic while maintaining a zero-breach screening system must be a priority it is equally important to ramp up the preparedness to meet any major outbreak if it occurs india does not at present has the infrastructure and preparedness to face the challengescommunity spread is already here containment facilities must be established right away and human resource should be effectively trained in handling patients to minimize chances of virus spread india has two major challenges the size of population and limited resources rapid diagnosis is a very critical aspect in the collective response to covid-19some states in india are experimenting with containment zones they could consider employing the cluster containment strategy which includes containment of the pandemic within a defined region with high rate of infection and thus preventing its spread to new areas the bhilwada model included a complete citywide curfew an extensive follow-up and testing of its residents and travel ban this approach is considered to be more flex- ible and efficient after implementation of this approach intensive risk communication campaign can be employed to encourage the citizens to stay in their homes for an initial period of 28 days which can later be extended after subsequent risk assessment the government of india has decided to divide the entire country into three regions red orange and green based on the severity of the infection rates however the restrictions should be lifted in a staggered manner otherwise it can lead to a deadly resurgenceindia is far short of resources required to impede the pandemic nearly 41 of the population lack basic handwashing facility indias health system cannot handle the upcoming turmoil and the government has done a great job containing the virus till now this time should be used for consolidating patient-level data clinical labs images and outcomes from the cases around the world starting with india and free access should be given to all the researchers this data could have three potential applications population- level predictions patient-level predictions of outcomes and quicker and more effective diagnosisindian government ordered a nationwide sudden severe and absolute lockdown on 24th march 2020 which is likely to end on 1 june 2020 however owing the immediate imposition of the lockdown proper planning could not be implemented migrant workers daily wagers manual laborers and informal workers were left to fend for themselves hundreds of thousands had to walk over 400 kilometers to reach their homes in rural areas as they had no job or source of income in locked down metropolitan cities government should have arranged for shelter food and money for these poor people before ordering lockdown initially india also lagged behind in testing on an average 10000 tests were conducted a day now 15000 per day which was too small for a huge population of 138 billion contact tracing has also been weak health professionals do not have enough ppe there is a shortage of ventilators and ppe all over the country indias economy might be heading for its first full-year contraction in more than four decades the lockdown would result in an 8 output loss and would also have indirect consequences such as persistent fear community after the lockdown is over it has been predicted that the gross domestic production would decrease by 04 and 01 till the end of this year and till march 2021 respectively the lockdown will adversely affect the unorganized workforce as well as the banking and the corporate sectors overall a precipitous recession is inevitable in indiacovid-19 has been a disaster for the americans to date the us has had the highest number of covid-19-related cases and deaths than other countries the american governments inaction has allowed the virus to spread inside its borders and it has actively increased the risk to other countries a faulty diagnostic kit rolled out by the american centre for disease control and prevention and slow approvals for other testing kits led to the disease spreading under the nose of the administration the key problem with the kits was their negative control cdcs test uses the polymerase chain reaction pcr assay to find tiny amounts of the sars-cov-2 genome in say a nose swab to make sure a test is working properly kits also include dna unrelated to sars-cov- 2 the assay should not react to this negative control but the cdc reagents did react with it at many but not all state labs9because of slow initial response to the pandemic tens of thousands more people might die millions more might lose their jobs if the situation is not brought under control immediately social distancing and lockdown are inescapable necessitiesthe need of the day is to prioritize diagnostic tests and strengthen laboratory response network laboratories in all the major cities and government hospitals must be prepared to handle the diagnostic burden rapid diagnostic kits to identify the virus are currently being tested at different centers their testing readiness and approvals must be prioritized and sped up to ensure adequate diagnostic preparednesseffective communication is an indispensable tool the indian state of kerala which is the first state in india to encounter the disease tackled the outbreak with a combination of swift measures travel curbs and effective communication timely dissemination of surveillance data as well as effective communication with the healthcare system allowed the state to contain the threat and prevent panic at the same timethe governments must effectively communicate with all the stakeholders including hospitals health professionals diagnostic facilities as well as the general public a daily advisory informing everyone about the situation the need for precautions and travel restrictions will help keep a check on the disease at the community level professional management of health care delivery is an essential component of a successful program to contain this great challenge before us effective mitigation is an equally important component of the overall strategyclinical diagnosis is done on the basis of symptoms chest imaging data etc however the infection can be confirmed only by genetic testing of the samples obtained from the respiratory tract such as throat swabs due to absence of an appropriate antiviral therapy the patients are kept on supportive care10 the suspected individuals must be isolated until confirmation if they are confirmed to be positive then they must be quarantined furthermore since asymptomatic transmission is also possible it is necessary to test all the persons who have been in the areas with known transmission in addition the symptomatic mothers who are still breastfeeding must maintain proper hygiene before and after handling the babyit might be more efficient to obtain the samples from the suspected individuals and then send them home with appropriate instructions to maintain proper hygiene and to use respiratory masks until the test results come back in case of shortage of hospital beds the infected individuals who are not severely ill could be isolated and treated at their own homes no hospitalization is needed unless the symptoms worsen this strategy could be employed to save the hospital capacity for the needier people and prevent unintended infections to the otherwise healthy individuals while they await their test results at the hospitalit is necessary to develop point-of-care diagnostic tests to rapidly test for 2019-ncov infection in general population such tests could be widely used at checkpoints in hospitals and even in homes for suspicious persons moreover they can also be used after every few weeks to check if any asymptomatic person is unintentionally spreading the virus however the individuals who are screened positive by these tests would still have to undergo laboratory tests for confirmationcovid-19 infection has led to the development of clusters of pneumonia with manifestations similar to those of sars-cov infection covid-19 infection might lead to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome admission to the icu and even death the severity of the infection might also be associated with the development of cytokine storm syndromethe community-level of covd-19 diagnosis is achievable via the aid of accurate and scalable point-of-care poc tests1112 such poc tests could help in obtaining rapid diagnosis which in turn could facilitate early detection of covid-19 cases and adequate use of resources and implementation of preventive measures currently several such tests are in development phases different devices may be more suitable for diagnosing new cases on infection while others especially those that test for the presence of antibodies are better suited to determining whether an individual has previously been infected13the rates of evolution and mutations in coronaviruses are very high which makes it difficult to develop a vaccine against them even after quick diagnosis decision of an adequate treatment is very challenging in this regard government support and funding play a crucial role because the processes like development of vaccine and antiviral agents require decades of research and assessmentanother danger posed by this pandemic on peoples lives arises from the disrupted supply of personal protective equipment ppe due to increase in demand hoarding misuse panic buying etcsouth korea has shown an exemplary performance by significantly slowing the infection spread in the country with a population of 50 million without any lockdowns or other severe measures that were adopted by china south korea had a well-organized testing program that involved efficient isolation of the infected individuals as well as their contacts in south korea more than 270000 people have been tested which indicates that more than 5200 tests per million individuals have been conducted there in the us only 74 tests per million individuals have been conducted south korea has demonstrated that diagnosis at large scale is key to epidemic control along with case isolation and contact tracing 14 a speedy recovery would depend on most of the world getting the pandemic under control or achieving herd immunitytoday we are confronted with an unprecedented crisis this world has never experienced before the global economy has hit the worst recession due to the covid-19 pandemic the pandemic and societys responses to it are hitting the economies across the world simultaneously suffering both a demand and a supply shock the worst economic fallout since the great depression is anticipated the international monetary fund imf on 14th april 2020 slashed growth forecast for the indian economy projecting a gdp growth of 19 in 2020the covid-19 has forced the general population around the world to rethink their daily lifestyle in response to travel bans school closures and social distancing recommendations to limit the spread of the virus many people have turned to digital tools to keep some semblance of normality according to the international labour organization the labor and economic crisis induced by the covid-19 pandemic could lead to a rise in global employment from 53 million to 247 million overall the global impact of this pandemic has been predicted to be around 01 to 04 of global gdp15the uns trade and development agency unctad predicted that the economic triggered by covid-19 might cost the global economy 2 trillion in 2020 the most prominent adverse economic impact would be faced by the already heavily-indebted developing countries particularly commodity exporters16in the long-term the pandemic will reduce the productive capacity of the global economy greater moves toward selective self-sufficiency can be anticipated given supply the chain vulnerabilitycovid-19 pandemic might result in permanent shifts in political and economic powers many businesses that rely on human contact are already feeling an immediate impact and we expect to see significant changes across all industries many countries will have difficulty in recovering from the present scenario in the aftermath of pandemic people will rush to regain their sense of equilibrium and normalcy the nations that responded early to the pandemic such as korea taiwan singapore hong kong and china have emerged as victors and will write the historyaccording to un report regarding the impact of covid-19 on children covid-19 can cause deaths of hundreds of thousands of children furthermore in the aftermath of this crisis 42-66 million more children could fall into poverty the impact of this pandemic could essentially reverse the recent improvements in infant mortality the children living in slums refugee camps and regions of active conflicts would suffer the most from this crisis furthermore unicef has reported that practically all the schools have been closed globally this has directly affected the education and indirectly affected the nutrition of the children with schools shutdown around 310 million children who are dependent on the school meals now miss a vital part of their nutrition17another concern is delay in routine immunization of children that makes them vulnerable to disease once the pandemic is over every child in need must be vaccinated unprecedented international solidarity is crucial for children and humanityas scientists strive to understand the respiratory covid-19 disease and its causal agent the need for aggressive and fruitful research on the subject is the need of the hour during sars outbreak south korea had learned the importance of being prepared with emergence of novel coronavirus korea centers for disease control and prevention kcdc raced to develop commercial test kits in cooperation with industrial manufacturers they also designed the following protocolseverely ill patients are first hospitalized the individuals with moderate symptoms are sent to repurposed facilities for basic medical support if they are tested negative twice then they are released the individuals with minimal symptoms are advised to quarantine themselves for two weeksthe covid-19 pandemic is tackled by various strategies some of these strategies include minimizing human-to-human transmissions to reduce secondary transmissions identifying and isolating infected individuals at early stages minimizing transmission via animals elucidating the factors that affect clinical severity accelerating the development of diagnostic kits and vaccines communicating the risk factors to arise awareness among the communities minimizing the spread of misinformation and minimizing the economic and social impactsthe four key stages of any pandemic include investigation recognition initiation and acceleration maximum number of infected individuals is found at the end of the acceleration phase this stage is finally followed by a deceleration stage in which the number of infected individuals decreasesto reduce community spreads mass gatherings must be discouraged increased incidences of community spread would lead to increase in the number of individuals who would need medical care this would surely lead to overloading of healthcare systems due to increased hospitalizations and deathscurrently the primary global focus is on minimizing the spread of the virus everyone can do their part to help us respond to this emerging public health threatthe early studies on covid-19 from hubei province in china have reported case series of hospitalized covid-19 patients and could provide information regarding the severe end of the disease spectrum based on these reports about 81 of covid-19 patients suffer from only mild fever and do not require hospitalization there have note bee extensive reports on such patients yet18the absence of adequate ppe leads to a much higher risk of exposure to healthy individuals who are either close to infected persons or are working in healthcare systems putting high-risk persons under quarantine with minimal public interactions could play a key role in the spread of sars-cov-2 clinicians should work in association with public health departments on a case-bycase basisvaccine development is crucial a faster way has to be developed to identify antibodies that neutralize the virus researchers have to generate lung tissue models called organoids to test candidate drugs for covid-19 and harness the power of individual genomes to identify variants that raise or lower peoples risk of serious illness when infected by sars-cov-2 more than 90 vaccines for the sars-cov-2 are at various stages of development some six groups have already begun injecting formulations into volunteers in safety trials others have started testing in animalswe need a drug or combination of drugs that work remdesivir has generated hope it is an antiviral and works by attacking an enzyme that a virus needs in order to replicate inside our cells experts believe that remdesivir has a clear-cut significant positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery thus can block this virus it may prove to be a magic bulletcovid-19 pandemic management requires a planned proactive strategy for efficient prevention and control of the virus life threatening situations demand extraordinary response and more stringent measures to contain the pandemic extreme social distancing and avoiding public places like theatres clubs and pubs can flatten the pandemic curve and peak it may place huge pressure on the society we are living through an unprecedented biopsychosocial crisis we find ourselves in a time of great economic social and medical uncertainty the human cost of covid pandemic could be extraordinary it endangers thousands of lives the pandemic has catalysed the development of novel coronavirus vaccines across the biotech industry future pandemics are likely to happen more frequently spread more rapidly have greater economic impact and kill more people if we are not extremely careful about the possible impacts of the choices we make today nations have to build a healthier world by focusing on the shared good health of human and naturecovid pandemic has exposed the health systems weaknesses and deficiencies of most if not all countries science is failing all over health care workers around the world have shown unimaginable bravery dedication and commitment to helping others during the pandemic often at great risk to themselvescountries like new zealand south korea taiwan singapore hong kong vietnam have done exceptionally well to contain the spread of covid-19 new zealand has shown the way decisive action going hard and going early helped to stamp out the worst of virus testing was done widelythe covid-19 pandemic highlights the need to protect people from health emergencies as well as to promote universal health coverage and healthier populations to keep people from needing health services through multisectoral interventions like improving basic hygiene and sanitation the covid-19 pandemic demands action on many fronts from prevention to testing to treatment we need to create simple cheap more accessible testing for sarscov- 2 the virus that causes covid-19 both in humans and on various surfaces scientists have to develop a faster way to identify antibodies that neutralize the virus it is crucial to identify any antibodies that inadvertently help the virus enter cells so researchers who are developing vaccines can avoid including those antibodies there are some opportunities to pursue other interventions in the short- and long-term that could save lives till proper treatment or vaccine is made available people have to rely on social distancing contact tracing self-isolation and other measuresto end this pandemic we must act in solidarity nations will have endemic sars-cov-2 infection for the foreseeable future a structured and well-coordinated approach is critical for success global crisis needs global action collaboration among the researchers clinicians industry and government is critical for efficient disease diagnosis improved basic and clinical research devising of appropriate countermeasures timely manufacture of relevant drugs and vaccines and adequate therapeutic management of infected individualspandemic will disproportionally harm the poor globally this is because they lack access to health care and have lower immunity nations responses to existing inequalities is critical moreover safety of health workers must be strengthenedworld is facing such an unprecedented global crisis every day refugee and migrant children and those affected by conflict face major threats to their safety and well-being the pandemic is deepening inequalities and millions more women and girls now risk losing the ability to plan their families and protect their bodies and their healthgroup upon group of terrified starving exhausted people leave the cities they built carrying with them precious items packed into sacks some clothes biscuit packets bread they flee on foot bicycles hitch a ride on goods-laden trucks hungry thirsty and tired to rest under the shade of a tree or a school converted into a shelter for migrantscountries must address the fragilities inequalities and gaps in social protection that have been so painfully exposed and place women and gender equality front and centre nations must keep food supply chains alive and protect the most vulnerable what the world needs right now is solidarity along with bold and courageous leadership guided by science data ethics and empathy recovery from covid can steer the world toward a safer healthier more sustainable and inclusive paththe pandemics lead to communities or individuals being stigmatized it is not only irresponsible but unethical to associate a virus and the disease it causes with a specific place or members of a particular race or community it is tragic and unacceptable the stigma must stop now every nation and every individual is experiencing the societal strain of this disease in new and powerful waystoday to efficiently tackle the global crisis of covid-19 pandemic several countries have employed a combination of containment and mitigation strategies for proper treatment of the infected and to prevent the spread of the infection these strategies include self-isolation quarantine contact tracing public health management improving health facilities etc19in china where severely aggressive strategies were employed minimal level of nosocomial transmission was observed chinas epidemiological records showed that most of the viral transmissions occurred within the family clusters20 this data indicated that the viral transmission mainly occurred via direct contact or contact with fomites in close proximity to the infected individualsnations need to rapidly and robustly increase their preparedness readiness and response actions intensified case finding and contact tracing are crucial other than case and contact finding containment or other measures that aim to delay the onset of patient surges where feasible and measures such as public awareness promotion of personal protective hygiene preparation of health systems for a surge of severely ill patients stronger infection prevention and control in health facilities are of paramount importancesurveillance and rapid testing to identify both asymptomatic and symptomatic cases contact tracing is required followed by quarantine and appropriate treatment contract tracing can play a key role in interrupting the pathways of future transmissions moreover pool testing in non-hotspot areas can be beneficialmoreover the large numbers of infections reported among health workers need urgent attention risk of transmission must be substantially minimised if not prevented their safety is absolutely essential solidarity at national and global levels is need of the hour nations have a responsibility to look after weaker sections of society supply chain must be maintained ppe ventilators oxygen kits etc equitably at global and national levels no failures in this regard are acceptable furthermore over 16 billion children are out of school novel methods have to be developed to ensure that education does not sufferit is widely believed that during the covid pandemic treatment suffers cancer patients get either neglected or do not have access to quality healthcare and medicines similarly patients with diabetes have difficulties in managing the disease at an appropriate health facility patients who need renal dialysis suffer because of non-availability of medical care or transportation facility pregnant ladies from rural areas or even from towns face immense problems so far conducting delivery normal or caesarean section is concerned those who have cardiac disease are unable to reach hospitals for any prompt medical attentioncovid pandemic is turning us into a cruder society fear of virus else seeing the death coming so near is forcing us to think of individual safety rather than collective security and dignity stigma is a curse and needs to be discouraged with full might what is required is burying dead with dignity giving human face to lockdown citizen-state engagement creating a social-security net for poor moreover this is the time of reason and science not rhetoric the number of women unable to access family planning facing unintended pregnancies gender-based violence and other harmful practices could skyrocket by millions of cases in the months aheadit is widely believed that during the pandemic treatment suffers patients with diseases like cancer diabetes renal failure cad and pregnant women need special attention as the pandemic pushes up levels of hunger among the global poor governments must prevent devastating nutrition and health consequences for children missing out on school meals amid school closures initial response to this global crisis by some countries has been so feeble and spotty the response serves as a critical reminder for why strong government leadership is needed during a global crisismany basic facts about the virus remain unknown viruses have no nationality so there is no place for discrimination on the basis of race religion caste etc we have to work all together to defeat the virus empathy and simple kindness are essential powerful tools of national recoveryto date no specific therapy has been scientifically proven to reduce mortality tackling this global crisis scientists are working hard to develop vaccines and treatments to slow the pandemic and reduce morbidity and mortality drugs are still being tested in clinical trials to see if they are effective against covid-19 the medications have to be safe for this particular use the coronavirus vaccines in various stages of development

researchers across the globe are racing against the time to develop a vaccine for the novel covid-19 more than 100 potential vaccines are being developed including several in clinical trials but experts have underscored the difficulties of finding vaccines that are effective against coronaviruses collaborating across the healthcare innovation ecosystem to making the impossible possible is need of the hour researchers and scientists have been relentlessly working to develop an investigational antiviral compound a vaccine to prevent infection as well as evaluating other therapies that have scientific potential to help infected patients fight the virus both antivirals and vaccines will be valuable tools in combating covid-19the countries that effectively managed covid-19 disease by implementing strong measures in place included were taiwan vietnam new zealand south korea and singapore each of these countries imposed travel restrictions quarantines social distancing and heightened hygiene in singapore three university hostels were converted into quarantine facilities and people were compensated for any workdays lost officials then began aggressively tracing all contacts of known infected people using data from transport companies hotels and cctv footage though large gatherings have been suspended schools and offices have remained open to limit the outbreaks social and economic costs however all students and employees undergo daily health checks and temperature screeningstaiwan screened the passengers on planes after landing it later halted the flights incoming from wuhan and other parts of china after its first imported case it used home quarantines more extensively than others despite the availability of state facilities disobeying quarantine orders also drew a penalty of up to inr 2500000 mass gatherings and religious services were bannedhong kongs strategy focused on limiting the local transmission rather than preventing infected people from entering the city boundaries it expanded its existing temperature screening facilities at entry points and asked local clinics to report any patient showing symptoms and with a travel history to wuhan all the people crossing the border from china were placed under mandatory 14-day quarantine vacant newly constructed public housing buildings were converted into quarantine facilities social distancing was extensively implemented - large-scale events were canceled schools were closed until april and civil servants were asked to work from home for a month in south korea everyone was tested however in italy sick people were tested number of covid-19 cases has dropped in south korea it necessitates the need for increase in number of tests to minimize the impact of future epidemics laboratories and epidemiological capacities must be established at regional and national levels improved surveillance could facilitate higher degree of prevention and treatment of the disease new zealand has shown the way there is no widespread undetected community transmission decisive action going hard and going early helped to stamp out the worst of virus testing was done widely an effective or ideal vaccine may take more than a year to develop even after the vaccine has been developed its effectiveness side effects availability and accessibility will be a larger issue the world community will see pockets of resurgence of disease moreover antibody testing can be used for public testing to determine who is immunized and free to work and intermingle older people will have to be protected during this exercise by lockdown and social distancingthe covid-19 could become endemic like hiv it is here to stay and it is impossible to predict that when this pandemic is supposed to control this would take a massive effort even if a vaccine was found it is still possible to control the virus with effort strong and robust control of the virus is required in order to lower the assessment of risk everyone should contribute to stopping this pandemic both life and livelihood are important deprivation is unacceptable shelter food healthcare and subsistence for weaker sections of population are the key challenges poor like migrant workers and casual labourers eat from garbage containers which is a disgrace equally important is the care of internally displaced people and refugees they need special attentionshaping the future is critical as schools remain closed during the pandemic the education of many children for whom long distance learning is unavailable stands at great risk nations must do everything in their power to protect children from the dire consequences teens are feeling lonely and anxious in isolation poor children with limited access and illiteratesemi-literate parents are in serious trouble they are losing out this will impact them severely as the pandemic pushes up levels of hunger among the global poor governments must prevent devastating nutrition and health consequences for children missing out on school meals amid school closuresin a world of 78 billion people countries have to be in a state of emergency preparedness to tackle emerging infectious diseases it needs an aggressive and focused action with coordination among all departments of the government - health security finance commerce transport trade information diplomacy etc global eid threats require an organized global response including adequate communication epidemiology behavioral science laboratory science adequate public health infrastructure increased surveillance and primary prevention efficient prevention and regulation of problems would require elucidation of causal factors of disease disability and premature death under such evolutionary changes the future trends cannot be predicted by the extrapolation of current scenarios instead accurate prediction can be made by scientists and professionals by applying the current data to various possible scenariosan optimum harmony can be maintained between humans and environment by improving human resistance environmental safety and adequate healthcare systems one might consider infectious diseases as an imbalance between humans and environment caused by the dominance of microbes the economic social administrative and legal forces must work together towards better human healththe approach to tackle this pandemic has to be solidly evidence- informed balancing act between public health crisis and complex societal implications is an inescapable necessity in these unprecedented and critical times the global community has a moral responsibility to jointly fight this dreaded virus that can otherwise lead to millions of avoidable deaths the private sector also has an important role to play in efforts to fight this pandemic during these most difficult times in human history nations need to ensure that the needs of the general public are met and the businesses can resume normal operationsafter the pandemic is over structure of the society will change new geopolitical and socioeconomic dynamics will emerge values will change and our lives and habits will also change nations will have to prioritise their expenditure weaker sections of society will need all the possible help however regardless of the devastation caused by the crisis human population will prevail humanity will still find the strength to recover investing in public health preparedness and relying on science will bring a better futuretelemedicine coverage policies are complex dynamic and geographically specific much of the current policies have limited the extent to which patients can be cared for remotely many jurisdictions have strict requirements as to the type of provider the location of the patient and medium of communication in addition barriers to engaging patients where they are are driven by early conceptions for telehealth for example hiv-related telemedicine was primarily developed as a way for hiv specialists or consultants to provide care to remote areas including rural contexts or to inaccessible patients such as incarcerated persons in such cases there is local control on both ends of the connection with well-established and controlled systems in illinois for example the provision of care required patients to be in a clinical setting this system has recently been upended by the covid-19 pandemic in order to increase social distancingon march 17th 2020 the telehealth waiver in medicare under hr 6047 was implemented allowing for an expanded fee for services provision 1 2 while the provision did not expand the allowable types of secure digital platforms or disciplines of care providers this change importantly eliminated site limitations for patients such that a patient-centered approach can be deployed allowing for patients to be seen where they wish clearly this is perfect social distancing in a covid-19 context it ensures that providers and patients are kept as safe as possible with the additional benefit of helping providers avoid clinical contexts that have additional coronavirus transmission risk particularly in hyperepidemic locations such as new york city as a case example of illinois academic medical centers such as the university of chicago and federally qualified health centers such as howard brown health rapidly transitioned scheduled patients to telemedicine developed telemedicine protocols billing algorithms and hippaa compliant communication videoconferencing platforms this occurred over days with clinical flows and patient acceptability still being examined from an implementation science perspective there are several important questions around telemedicine effectiveness feasibility acceptability and contextual variation 3 in addition while covid-19 presents a unique solution to social distancing it is unclear how telemedicine will change as we move to the post-covid era and how hiv and routine prep care may be impactedsocial media chatbots and mobile apps have been studied across a number of clinical and public health settings including patient outreach screening and monitoring intervention delivery remote vital sign assessment as well for providing treatment recommendations and retaining patients in care for example social media discussions about hiv and syphilis-related risk behaviors can be modeled with artificial intelligence to monitor and predict future cases within regions helping to inform interventions that can be digitally delivered and tailored to at-risk populations 4 social media and mobile apps can also be used to engage and retain patients at risk for and living with hiv helping to keep them connected to clinical care during times when non-essential in-person visits are discouraged the already widespread use of these technologies makes them appropriate tools for keeping patients engaged in care automatically-responding chatbots can be also be integrated into health settings such as by asking questions and routing patients to appropriate educational resources or next steps for treatment eg setting up an appointment based on responses for example specific to covid-19 the cdc has released a coronavirus self-checker tool to assess symptoms and provide recommendations for next steps based on screening results 5 tools like this could be adapted for the special needs of hiv populations including items on substance use-related risk behaviors and hiv medication adherence in order to assess comorbid risks between hiv covid-19 substance and mental healthbiosensors and wearable including non-wearing remote sensing devices can assist with clinical care especially in settings where remote patient monitoring of behaviors vital signs and other clinical outcomes is needed 6 in addition to the most common sensors being used that track sleep activity and heart rate sensors are also available to track respiratory rate sweat temperature breathing abnormalitiescoughing and oxygen saturation all important covid-19-related signs and symptomsbiosensors and wearables can be used to assist with clinical monitoring and care while maintaining social distancing and stay-at-home orders for example respiratory oxygen saturation and temperature sensors can be used to monitor vital signs among patients such as for substance useaddiction medicine treatment monitoring hypertensive medication adherence and pulmonary care patients biosensor technologies can also facilitate social distancing between patients and between high-risk covid-19 patients and providers newer approaches eg digital contact tracing are using bluetooth signals to identify whether and when people have been socialphysical distancing by assessing distances between 2 or more phonesmobile devices data from these devices can be used to not only inform social distancing efforts but also to inform hiv research efforts as these methods of measuring distances between phones might be integrated into hiv studies to hypothesize whether and when people are engaging in sexual risk behaviorssimilar to early studies on electronic health records studies integrating telehealth technologies into hiv prevention interventions have had mixed results on health outcomes for various practical and intervention design reasons however studies including a report from the agency for health research and quality largely support use of these tools to remotely monitor patients and keep them engaged if used correctly 7 findings suggest that these tools are especially impactful when delivered based on specific rather than general needs eg keeping hiv patients engaged in socially-distanced care and on evidenced-based behavioral and social science frameworksalthough this note has categorized and separated the technologies above to help distinguish their use the most effective approaches would likely integrate several of these technologies because of their complementary features a number of potential issues need to be addressed before implementing fully-integrated systems however including ethicalrisk monitoring patient engagement costs and staffing requirements due to the rapid changes required related to covid-19 it is expected that these issues will be addressed quicklycovid-19 will continue to impact the way that technologies are integrated into hiv clinical care and research long after the removal of social distancing policies making it important to begin investing in the knowledge infrastructure and implementation of these technologies now to be prepared for the futureon dec 31 2019 the who china country office received notice of a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology in the chinese city of wuhan hubei province1 the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has since risen exponentially now affecting all who regions the number of cases reported to date is likely to represent an underestimation of the true burden as a result of shortcomings in surveillance and diagnostic capacity affecting case ascertainment in both high-resource and low-resource settings2 by all scientifically meaningful criteria the world is undergoing a covid-19 pandemicin the absence of any pharmaceutical intervention the only strategy against covid-19 is to reduce mixing of susceptible and infectious people through early ascertainment of cases or reduction of contact in the lancet infectious diseases joel koo and colleagues3 assessed the potential effect of such social distancing interventions on sars-cov-2 spread and covid-19 burden in singapore the context is worthy of study since singapore was among the first settings to report imported cases and has so far succeeded in preventing community spread during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov outbreak in singapore numerous non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented successfully including effective triage and infection control measures in health-care settings isolation and quarantine of patients with sars and their contacts and mass screening of school-aged children for febrile illness4 each of these measures represented an escalation of typical public health action however the scale and disruptive impact of these interventions were small compared with the measures that have been implemented in china in response to covid-19 including closure of schools workplaces roads and transit systems cancellation of public gatherings mandatory quarantine of uninfected people without known exposure to sars-cov-2 and large-scale electronic surveillance5 6 although these actions have been praised by who5 the possibility of imposing similar measures in other countries raises important questions populations for whom social-distancing interventions have been implemented require and deserve assurance that the decision to enact these measures is informed by the best attainable evidencefor a novel pathogen such as sars-cov-2 mathematical modelling of transmission under differing scenarios is the only viable and timely method to generate such evidence koo and colleagues3 adapted an existing influenza epidemic simulation model7 using granular data on the composition and behaviour of the population of singapore to assess the potential consequences of specific social-distancing interventions on the transmission dynamics of sars-cov-2 the authors considered three infectivity scenarios basic reproduction number r
0 of 15 20 or 25 and assumed between 75 and 500 of infections were asymptomatic the interventions were quarantine with or without school closure and workplace distancing whereby 50 of workers telecommute although the complexity of the model makes it difficult to understand the impact of each parameter the primary conclusions were robust to sensitivity analyses the combined intervention in which quarantine school closure and workplace distancing were implemented was the most effective compared with the baseline scenario of no interventions the combined intervention reduced the estimated median number of infections by 993 iqr 926999 when r
0 was 15 by 930 815997 when r
0 was 20 and by 782 590944 when r
0 was 25 the observation that the greatest reduction in covid-19 cases was achieved under the combined intervention is not surprising however the assessment of the additional benefit of each intervention when implemented in combination offers valuable insight since each approach individually will result in considerable societal disruption it is important to understand the extent of intervention needed to reduce transmission and disease burdennew findings emerge daily about transmission routes and the clinical profile of sars-cov-2 including the substantially underestimated rate of infection among children8 the implications of such findings with regard to the authors conclusions about school closure remain unclear additionally reproductive number estimates for singapore are not yet available the authors estimated that 75 of infections are clinically asymptomatic although data on the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic are scarce as shown by koo and colleagues in sensitivity analyses with higher asymptomatic proportions this value will influence the effectiveness of social-distancing interventions additionally the analysis assumes high compliance of the general population which is not guaranteedalthough the scientific basis for these interventions might be robust ethical considerations are multifaceted9 importantly political leaders must enact quarantine and social-distancing policies that do not bias against any population group the legacies of social and economic injustices perpetrated in the name of public health have lasting repercussions10 interventions might pose risks of reduced income and even job loss disproportionately affecting the most disadvantaged populations policies to lessen such risks are urgently needed special attention should be given to protections for vulnerable populations such as homeless incarcerated older or disabled individuals and undocumented migrants similarly exceptions might be necessary for certain groups including people who are reliant on ongoing medical treatmentthe effectiveness and societal impact of quarantine and social distancing will depend on the credibility of public health authorities political leaders and institutions it is important that policy makers maintain the publics trust through use of evidence-based interventions and fully transparent fact-based communication

on late december 2019 in a hospital in wuhan city in china an unusual pneumonia was noticed with a link to an animal market that sells poultry fish and other animals to the public xu et al 2020 this event was soon reported to the world health organization who in a month 26 january the causal microorganism had been identified as a novel coronavirus that was named covid-19 genome sequencing and reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions tests of this virus had been done who rd had been started to quicken diagnostics therapeutics and vaccine development and a candidate vaccine was prepared for initial laboratory testing wang et al 2020the emergency committee of who declared a global health emergency on 30 january 2020 based of growing case notification rates at chines and international locations the case detection rate is changing on a daily basis and could be tracked in nearly real time on the developed website by johns hopkins university and other media in the middle of february 2020 china suffered the huge burden of morbidity and mortality whereas the incidence in other asian countries in europe and north america remains low so far velavan and meyer 2020coronaviruses are single-stranded rna viruses that can infect not only humans but also a huge variety of animals as well kooraki et al 2020 these viruses were first studied by tyrell and bynoe in 1966 who cultured them from patients with common cold due to their spherical virions morphology along with a shell and surface projections like a solar corona these viruses were named coronaviruses in latin corona means crown and there are four different subfamilies including alpha beta gamma and delta coronaviruses identified so far alpha and beta- coronaviruses have been originated from mammalians particularly from bats gamma- and delta- coronaviruses originated from pigs and birds ather et al 2020 the genome of these viruses differs between 26 kb and 32 kb the beta- coronaviruses could cause severe disease and fatalities among the other seven subtypes of these viruses alpha-coronaviruses cause mildly symptomatic or even asymptomatic infections sarscov-2 is a beta-coronavirus and is related to the sars-cov virus there are four structural genes encoding the nucleocapsid protein n the spike protein s a small membrane protein sm and the membrane glycoprotein m with an extra membrane glycoprotein he occurring in the hcov-oc43 and hku1 beta- coronaviruses the whole genome of sars-cov-2 is 96 identical to that of a bat coronavirus kucharski et al 2020 cao et al 2020 sars-cov-2 seemingly had made its transition from animals on an animal market in wuhan city in china although the efforts to identify potential intermediate hosts seem to have been neglected in wuhan and the exact transmission route have to be clarified the primary clinical symptoms of the sars-cov-2- linked disease covid-19 which permitted the case detection as pneumonia recently literatures report the description of gastrointestinal symptoms and asymptomatic infections especially among young children the average incubation period is ranging from 0 to 24 days li et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 as we are writing these lines the pandemic affects 200 countries and territories with around 1357382 infected subjects more than 120 438 deaths and 456773 recovered patients according to the johns hopkins universityas who has declared the fast spreading of covid-19 as an epidemic the citizens around the globe hastened to go home for instance in the case of wuhan city in china which has been the epicenter of the pandemic with over than 11 million people is shown to have produced 200 tons of clinical trash on a single day exactly 24 february2020 which is four times the amount the citys only dedicated facility can incinerate per day as coronavirus is spreading rapidly to other parts of the world very soon the medical waste management could be a big issue medical health organizations waste management companies have already taken step in coronavirus decontamination services it is becoming very crucial for governments to find solutions soon at the meantime it is every individuals duty to follow the regulations while discarding of their face masks and other medical wastes luan and ching 2020 to the end it is possible only by mutual understanding and willingness and world will emerge stronger than this epidemic some people are at higher risk of adverse effects from contact to medical wastes as well including cleaners trash collectors and some other people who have to spend a great amount of time in public places all over the world governments stopped students to go to schools and universities and a lot of employees are being asked to work from home only those who are maintaining the cleanliness of cities have to go to their jobs daily that makes them among the most vulnerable groups and one that is highly susceptible to the virus from respiratory shed droplets on the masks they may also be infected by other pathogens existing in the discarded pieces of garbage for instance meningitis and hepatitis b the masks are made up of plastic based materials that are liquid- resistant and are long lasting after they are discarded ending up in ocean or landfill the surgical masks should not be worn longer than one day discarding them and empty bottles of hand sanitizer along with solid tissue papers are ending up to a huge trail of medical waste in the environment for instance in hong kong where covid- 19 infection started in late january2020 the medical wastes have already polluted the environment recently an environmental ngo ocean asia in soko islands took a survey according to it in hong kong a large amount of discarded single-use masks washed up to a 100-meter stretch of beach gary stokes the director of the ocean asia ngo who has been monitoring the ocean surface trash his team has seen a few masks over the years but now they were spotted all along the high tide line and seashore with new deposits coming with each current while this recent covid-19 outbreak the general public have started wearing surgical masks in order to take precautionary measures when 7 million people suddenly start wearing one or a couple of masks daily single use gloves and hand sanitizers the amount of trash created is going to be substantial the contrary impacts of such medical wastes are far-reaching when these are remained discarded in an animals natural habitat in both land and ocean this could cause animals to mistakenly eat this as food and lead in their death hellewell et al 2020 the diagram below illustrates the problems of polluting the environment by medical wastes while covid-19 pandemic fig 1
covid-19 does not affect everyone in the same way there are several reasons thats why different socioeconomic groups are affected by this pandemic in different ways to understand the consequences and to predict how this pandemic affects differently with various socioeconomic groups is not easy and good data is the key to it these socioeconomic factors include population density urban and rural settings education level lifestyle the size of household and homeowners  tenants sometimes only a single block distance neighborhood household within the socioeconomic spectrum can make a huge difference in ones life demonstrate form the us in club vitas us longevity map therefore sometimes it is very unfortunate that people who are feeling the effects of covid-19 very severely are probably in your neighbors messner 2020 majority of the countries are now trying different tactics to stop the spreading of the disease and trying to limit only a subset of the people would catch the disease it has been indicated that groups with lower socioeconomic status could be more at danger from the spread of the covid-19 based on the analysis of new york showing that poor neighborhoods have been affected highly covid-19 spreads by droplets shed of the respiratory system by someone with the virus which means it would spread with higher proximity of people larger contact networks and lower levels of hygiene there are some factors which increase the risk of catching the virus1-population density close contact among people is very high in urban areas rather than rural areas2-household size a big household will have a higher chance to bring the virus home while in household where one person lives alone heshe will have to catch the virus outside the household in sweden social-distancing regulations are not taken very strictly due to the high proportion of single person household whereas in italy based on the multi-generational homes apparently contributed to the multiplication of the coronavirus3-social distancing level social distancing is very effective to stop the spread of the disease but several reasons that various groups might show dissimilar levels of social distancing
official advice might be dependable between regions for instance guidance in the us has varied even between neighboring towns access to local guidance might be different between socioeconomic groups for instance guidance might be provided online or in particular languagesworking from home might reduce social contact but can only be available to some people focused in jobs linked to higher socioeconomic statusstay at home regulations would be more than a challenge for those who live in smaller and crowded houses or without outside spacesome groups would be obedient to social distancing regulations not allnot all who are infected by the covid-19 will react severely to it there are some factors that contribute to the risk of covid-19 but they are probably felt differently by different socioeconomic groups lipsitch et al 2020people who have had medical problems of diabetes chronic respiratory disease cardiovascular disease or even high blood pressure and cancer are at higher risk from coronavirus giannis et al 2020 fang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020who has warned the smokers that they might be highly at risk because to the obvious effects of smoking on the lungs and smoking is common in lower socioeconomic groupsdifferent socioeconomic groups do not have access to the same level of healthcare services this would particularly common in countries like us where the huge number of uninsured population is concentrated in certain industries not to universal health care system
therefore some socioeconomic groups are more likely at risk compared to others so logically higher numbers of deaths can be expected from certain parts of society this can be highly related for pension plans using analysis of this experience of the population to predict future mortality rates the post pandemic population may look more different compared to the start point of this outbreak the annual percentage change in gross domestic products is shown in table1
the short-term scenarios of the covid-19 environmental aspects raise many questions china is struggling to rebound from the epidemic and has to limit the re-entry of covid-19 to its region by put a check on travelers coming from abroad bogoch et al 2020 in a country with such a high population where the majority of its population has not yet experienced covid-19 and has no immunological contact with this virus the possibility of second wave is a big risk european and north american countries has not yet reached to the peak of the epidemiological curve one crucial aspect seems obvious the fast control of the outbreak done by china could not be implemented to democratic countries where rights of individuals are very high therefore outside china no leader has the capability to enforce these measures at the level of china bai et al 2020 the question is what will happen in countries of indian sub-continent the middle-east and south america where they live in crowded forms traditionally big gatherings are common and the public health systems are insufficient the possibility of secondary peak appearance could not be estimated in the mid-term the scenario in the southern hemisphere should be considered not almost all south american and african countries have access to national health systems and sufficient health care services many of these nations decided to close the borders however very late when they already had patients of covid-19 inside all these indications show that the southern hemisphere would not escape from this pandemic the outbreak is widening in the southern hemisphere now and this is happening while the higher income nations are struggling over their own problems in i applying control actions ii trying to recuperate from the massive social and economic impacts and iii focusing in preventing re-entry of covid-19 by foreign travelers chinazzi et al 2020 the long-term scenario of probable secondary waves of outbreak is concerning as well a second wave might be devastating more than the first one based on other pandemics in history economists have shown serious concerns about the economic effects of control measures taken during this crisis hemida and abduallah 2020 however there are many models that show the economic impacts of the disease and majority of the economists are challenged by the social and economic depth of the pandemic they are trying to understand the control as soon as possible although the economic losses are obvious but still economists are not able to grasped the extending nature of the outbreak that is causing far more economic damage compared to drastic measures taken to end the pandemic globally as soon as possible meo et al 2020 anderson et al 2020 the covid-19 pandemic will have severe impact on socioeconomic growth across the globe as shown in table2
general actions to decrease person to person transmission of coronavirus are needed to control the present outbreak special restrictions strategies and efforts should be applied to protect the highly vulnerable populations such as children health care workers and older aged people kucharski et al 2020 a guideline has been already published for the medical employees health care providers and public health individuals and researchers who are interested in working in the coronavirus mossa-basha et al 2020 the major death cases of coronavirus outbreak are happening mainly in old people probably because of a poor immune system that allows rapid growth of viral infections the public services must provide in decontaminating reagents for sanitizing hands multiple times on a daily basis luan and ching 2020 physical contact with contaminated and wet things must be counted in dealing with the coronavirus particularly agents which could be a possible rout of transmission china and some other countries such as the us applied travel screening that could control and prevent the spread of the virus epidemiological alterations in coronavirus infections must be observed the probable routes of transmission and subclinical infections adaptation progression must be taken into consideration and spreading of virus among people and potential intermediate animals and reservoirs should perceived moreover still there are significant numbers of questions that need to ponder these are but not limited to details about how many people have been tested how many of them turned positive and whether this range stays constant or fluctuating additionally only fewer pediatric cases have been reported to date that could be due to lack of testing and not due to true infection rothan and byrareddy 2020only in a period of few months the world has changed thousands of people have been deceased and hundreds of thousands have been infected by covid-19 and the rest of people who are not infected their entire life has been changed by this virus in italy the most massive travel restrictions are being placed since second world war in london the normal busy bars theatres and other public places have been closed and people are asked to stay in their homes the flights are being canceled in all over the world majority of people are staying at home practicing social distancing and working remotely harapan et al 2020 it is all happening to control the spread of coronavirus and to decrease the death rate however all these changes have led some unexpected consequences as industries transportation systems and all other bossiness have shut down it has caused a sudden drop in carbon emission compared to this time last year levels of air pollution in new york have dropped at almost 50 due to measures that have been to restrict the spread of virus in china emissions data shows a 25 decrease at the starting point of the year as people were told to stay at home factories closed and coal use feel by 40 at chinas largest power plants since the last three months of 2019 according to the ministry of ecology and environment the amount of good quality air was around 114 compared with the same time last year in more than 330 cities all over china in europe nitrogen dioxide no2 emission dropped over northern italy spain and uk as shown in satellite images ficetola and rubolini 2020this epidemic has also caused extensive job losses and threatened the sustenance of millions of people as businesses are struggling and are shut down to control the spread of virus economic activities have been stopped and stock markets dropped along with the falling carbon emission on contrary it is definitely a decarbonized maintainable economy that many have been supporting for decades an epidemic of this type that is taking peoples lives definitely should not be seen as a route of bringing about environmental change either first of all it is not certain for how long this dip in emission will be when the epidemic finally subside carbon and pollutant emissions get back then it would be as if this clear skied interlude never happened and the changes we see today will not have lasting impact mccloskey and heymann 2020another unexpected environmental impact of coronavirus has been observed in venice italy as the tourists numbers culled due to the coronavirus the waters in venices canals are cleaner compared to the past while motorboats sediment churning and other water pollutants have been dropped efficiently residents got amazed by seeing the clear water and the fish could be seen once again in the canalsone of the other effects of coronavirus on environment is the noticeable drop in coal consumption this contributed in a large scale drop in air pollutants in china the number of airborne pollutants like co2 co and nitrous oxides has fallen too as millions of people are holding on lockdown across the globe energy consumption profiles in buildings are being disturbed as many people working from home nowadays domestic energy consumption is predicted to rise very quickly the predictions data showed that this has risen around 6 to 8 in the us this pandemic would ultimately save energy and also might have an effect on reducing the consumption of polluting fuels in power stations as the demand has been dropped lau et al 2020 the covid-19 pandemic has changed the air quality in many cities across the world as shown in the fig 2
the covid-19 pandemic is spreading very quickly every day and the number of people putting on lockdown is increasing to date more than 120 438 people have died across the globe and there is a direct loss to the world economy however many think that there is a good side that the spread of virus has been decreasing air and water pollution and probably even saved lives in this process nevertheless this epidemic which is taking peoples lives certainly should not be seen as a way of bringing about positive environmental change first of all it is not certain for how long this dip in emission will be when the epidemic finally subside then carbon and other pollutant emissions get back then it would be as if this clear sky view never happened and the changes we see today will not have lasting impact general actions to reduce person to person transmission of covid-19 are required to control the current outbreak special attention and labors should be applied to save the highly vulnerable populations including children health care workers and old people there is already published guideline available for the medial employees health care providers and public health individuals and researchers who are interested in working in the coronavirus most of death cases of coronavirus outbreak are happening largely in old people possibly due to a weak immune system that permits rapid growth of viral infections the public services must provide decontaminating reagents for sanitizing hands multiple times on a routine basis physical contact with contaminated and wet things must be taken into count while dealing with coronavirus particularly agents that could be a possible route of transmission epidemiological alterations in coronavirus infections must be observed taking into consideration the probable routes of transmission and subclinical infections furthermore to the adaptation progression and spreading of virus among people and potential intermediate animals and reservoirs there are still some remaining doubts that have to be considered the most important thing is about the details of how many people have been tested how much of them turned positive and whether this range stays constant or variable a less number of pediatric cases have been reported to date that could be due to lack of testing and not due to true infectionstarting in january 2020 coronavirus disease-19 covid-19 has rapidly developed into a global pandemic with the number of deaths continuing to climb worldwide1 the world health organization who and many governments have promulgated social distancing and social isolation to slow the spread of the virus ie flatten the curve2 these public health efforts are targeting the entire population however these strategies may be less effective for certain marginalized groups notably those with schizophrenia and related disorders referred as schizophrenia in the rest of this manuscript features of these disorders such as delusions hallucinations disorganized behavior cognitive impairment and poor insight and sociodemographic characteristics including living in congregate housing and homelessness3 may put these individuals at higher risk of becoming infected with covid-19 furthermore people living with schizophrenia are at greater risk for adverse outcomes including death because compared with the general population they typically have poorer physical health46 greater socioeconomic disadvantage7 are more socially disconnected8 and experience pervasive stigma and discrimination9 here we discuss 1 why people with schizophrenia are at increased risk of infection with covid-19 and poor outcomes 2 possible mental health consequences of covid-19 infection in people with schizophrenia 3 possible consequences for health professionals and institutions that serve patients with schizophrenia and 4 potential adverse impact on clinical research related to schizophreniapeople with schizophrenia may be more susceptible to transmission of covid-19 due to a number of factors cognitive impairment lower awareness of risk and barriers to adequate infection control including congregate living10 as schizophrenia is characterized by impairments in insight and decision-making capacity11 it may be harder for people with schizophrenia to adopt and adhere to the protective measures recommended to prevent infection eg hand washing social distancing or isolation confinement12 comorbid substance use disorders highly prevalent in schizophrenia may compound impairments in judgment and decision-making13 furthermore people with schizophrenia are overrepresented in vulnerable populations that are at increased risk for covid-19 outbreaks including prisoners and individuals experiencing homelessness1415 for these groups as well as people living in congregate housing such as rooming houses and mental health supportive housing social distancing is near impossiblemultiple factors increase the risk of poor outcomes from covid-19 in people with schizophrenia smoking which is prevalent in more than 60 of people with schizophrenia16 may increase the risk of disease progression and severe complications from covid-19 including death via its effects on lung health and immune responsiveness17 early but robust data indicate that mortality from covid-19 is particularly elevated in people with comorbid conditions in particular cardiovascular disease diabetes and chronic respiratory disease1819 all of which are more common in people with schizophrenia than the general population2022 antipsychotic medications commonly prescribed in schizophrenia particularly clozapine appear to be associated with risk of death from pneumonia related to impaired swallowing sedation and hypersalivation which worsen during the immune response due to a feedback loop that increases clozapine concentrations23 while we are unaware of evidence specifically linking clozapine to deaths from coronaviruses there is at least a hypothetical risk several other factors put people with schizophrenia at risk they experience substantial disparities in access to health care related in part to the effects of stigma on help-seeking2425 and discrimination when they access care they are more likely to experience underdiagnosis of comorbid physical illnesses less likely to receive screening and definitive interventions and generally receive poorer-quality care26 the who recommends that isolating testing and treating every suspected case and tracing every contact is the best way of preventing widespread community transmission2 barriers to uptake of protective measures and appropriate use of health care services among people with schizophrenia could have profound implications for containment of the pandemic furthermore preexisting health disparities could be exacerbated in the context of limited resources failure to promote fair and equitable resource allocation could result in more severe complications for people with schizophrenia including death27 mechanisms and guidelines to uphold the rights to health for people with schizophrenia and promote equitable outcomes are urgently neededprevious outbreaks have had persistent mental health effects following the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars pandemic significantly elevated rates of psychiatric disorders and psychological distress were present28 researchers have already sounded the alarm on how the covid-19 pandemic may affect the mental health of the general population and more specifically patients with mental disorders10 if the stress related to the covid-19 pandemic and corresponding public health measures worsens mental health in the general population one would expect that their impact might be even higher in people living with schizophrenia29 in addition covid-19 infection itself may exacerbate symptoms in people with schizophrenia as coronaviruses may be associated with psychotic symptoms through an immune-related mechanism30 furthermore symptoms associated with coronaviruses and their treatment have been associated with distress related to symptom severity and isolation as well as psychosis secondary to steroids and other interventions31social distancing whereby governments have discouraged and imposed restrictions to reduce physical proximity has been widely adopted in order to decrease community transmission of covid-19 fears of contracting covid-19 along with significant social isolation have led to more than half of the general public surveyed in china to report that the outbreak had a moderate or severe psychological impact on them32 social distancing practices could have a particularly negative impact on individuals with schizophrenia typically individuals with schizophrenia on average have smaller and poorer-quality social networks than the general population33 thus they may be more able to comply with and tolerate social distancing directives however social support has been associated with higher scores on recovery measures in schizophrenia34 and broad community supports including casual contacts at pharmacies grocery stores and cafes have also been associated with improved recovery and community integration scores in schizophrenia35 these casual contacts will be disrupted by social distancing putting patients at risk among people with schizophrenia social isolation may increase the risk for suicide36 and stress has been associated with aggressive behavior37 social distancing may also disproportionately impact the ability of people with schizophrenia to maintain their basic needs given their high reliance on income support and other community services that become more difficult to access38 for those with substance dependence changes in the ability to access substances and their treatments including agonist therapies can precipitate crises thus developing approaches to maintain social connection to instrumental supports in the face of social distancing may be especially crucial for people with schizophrenia video conferencing apps are widely used to maintain face-to-face connection during the outbreak similarly programs and government agencies that provide essential services to the community should strive to find ways to maintain their efforts to ensure continued and safe delivery of services to vulnerable populationsthe covid-19 pandemic has created challenges for the health professionals and programs that provide services to patients with schizophrenia continuity of care is critical for these patients to prevent decompensation and its consequences including emergency department visits and hospital admissions resulting in further strain on the health care system mental and physical deterioration and even deaths39 in february 2020 a cluster of approximately 50 patients and 30 medical staff were diagnosed with covid-19 at the wuhan mental health center40 factors hypothesized to have increased the risk of outbreak on an inpatient psychiatric unit included crowded wards lack of isolation of suspected or early cases and lack of clinical pathways to prevent infectious diseases in mental health settings40 a covid-19 outbreak in a south korean inpatient psychiatric unit infected 100 of its 102 patients and resulted in 7 deaths at the time accounting for nearly half the covid-19-related deaths in the country41 factors identified as having contributed to this outbreak were the lack of ventilation due to windows having been sealed shut to prevent suicides and restrictions on the use of hand sanitizer due to fears that some patients would drink it42 the recommendations of the wuhan group included use of a preadmission observation ward screening of admitted patients screening of hospital staff temporary prohibition of in-person visitors external food and clothing and improved skills among psychiatric care providers to identify and treat physical diseases40 similar practicesincluding isolation of at-risk individuals infection control training and auditswere successfully implemented on some psychiatric inpatient units during the 2003 sars outbreak43 additional concerns for psychiatric inpatient units include managing agitation given the risk of contagion and managing patients and staff who may have been exposed to covid-19 in the face of shortages of both personal protective equipment and staff44 strategies implemented at the centre for addiction and mental health in toronto canada modeled after a system developed during the 2003 sars outbreak involve designating different units to segregate patients with suspected infection diagnosed infection or absence of infection and assignment to every inpatient psychiatrist of backup outpatient psychiatrists prepared to seamlessly assume care in the event that an inpatient psychiatrist becomes unable to workthe immediate impact of covid-19 could be even greater in outpatient settings where the majority of mental health care is delivered evidence-based models of care for schizophrenia including assertive community treatment and intensive case management emphasize in-person contacts in the community and in patients homes45 while outreach visits increase the risk of transmission to both patients and providers abrupt changes to how mental health services are delivered could increase the risk of service disengagement medication nonadherence and distress all leading to decompensation and relapsephone and video consultations have been rapidly implemented as an alternative to in-person clinical care during the covid-19 outbreak4647 however there is little research examining the suitability of telepsychiatry for schizophrenia compared with other less severe mental disorders eg depressive and anxiety disorders for which it has been typically used to date48 a recent randomized-controlled trial of adjunct videoconferencing in patients with severe mental illness compared with usual care found high levels of satisfaction associated with the service but low use over the 18-month study period49 while mobile phone ownership approaches 100 in the general population in north america or europe the use of digital technologies is lower in those with psychosis5051 despite these challenges outpatient services should strive to reduce in-person contacts when it is safe to do so through the use of telepsychiatry and the provision of longer prescription durations in addition to digital solutions used to deliver direct patient care automated text messages52 and mobile applications53 can augment care and provide support between appointments in the midst of the pandemic providers should be flexible and payers should remunerate care provided over either videoconferencing or phone to ensure access and uptake54despite its merits virtual care cannot completely replace in-person care for schizophrenia for example the ability to detain someone involuntarily still requires in person assessment and hearings in many jurisdictions the covid-19 pandemic may lead to an increase in the acceptability of telepsychiatry for these quasilegal processes much as it has facilitated novel funding mechanisms for the expanded delivery of telehealth services54 furthermore in-person visits are required for the administration of long-acting injectable antipsychotic medications which are increasingly used in the management of schizophrenia given the role of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in reducing hospitalizations compared with oral medications55 it is prudent to continue using them even if these visits may increase the risk of infection for patients and providers similarly clozapine is associated with superior outcomes and reduced mortality in treatment-resistant schizophrenia but it requires regular bloodwork56 in response to the covid-19 pandemic the us food and drug administration fda has changed some of their regulations for laboratory monitoring requirements on an emergency basis57 thus during the pandemic the frequency of blood monitoring required for clozapine maintenance could be reduced however the risks and benefits of such a change need to be carefully consideredthe fda58 and national institutes of health nih59 have provided guidance for researchers conducting clinical trials and human subject studies impacted by covid-19 emphasizing safety of study participants suggestions include coordination with institutional review boards to limit study visits to those needed for participant safety or coincident with clinical care conducting virtual study visits and arranging for required laboratory tests or imaging needed for safety monitoring to occur at local laboratories or clinics certain self-administered investigational products typically picked up at the study site may be delivered through alternative secure methods58 in addition to upholding the safety of research participants it is important to safeguard the integrity of research efforts in schizophrenia which despite its substantial global public health burden has historically lagged in research funding compared with physical health conditions60 clinical trials in schizophrenia typically have smaller sample sizes than in physical disorders associated with comparable disability and costs reducing their statistical power and the generalizability of their results a prolonged cessation of new recruitment into ongoing research studies coupled with the reduction or elimination of in-person research visits will exacerbate the challenges already present in schizophrenia research including challenges in study retention ensuring the safety of both participants and research staff should be the foremost priority however research with participants with schizophrenia should continue through the use of remote assessments and delivery methods in order to prevent worsening disparities in the progress of schizophrenia research61the covid-19 global pandemic is expected to have an outsized impact on people with schizophrenia further exacerbating health and economic disparities they experience public health interventions designed to slow and curb the spread of the virus flatten the curve will likely disproportionately affect people with schizophrenia we propose the following recommendations for consideration to temper the effect of covid-19 on people with schizophreniawe suggest that thoughtful consideration of the implications of covid-19 for people with schizophrenia may not only reduce the burden of the global pandemic on people with schizophrenia but also on the population as a wholesevere acute respiratory coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which causes the novel beta coronavirus 2019 disease covid-19 has emerged as a life-threatening infection affecting more than 57 million people worldwide and caused the death of more than 350000 patients as of may 2020 1 categorized as a global pandemic by the center for world health organization who covid-19 has created global health care and economic crisis 2 the immediate objective of healthcare systems is to facilitate the management of critically ill patients with severe respiratory symptoms requiring hospitalization due to covid-19 given the lack of effective treatment strategies and herd immunity the main focus of public health efforts have been social distancing to flatten the curve of covid-19 case growth rates thereby offsetting the significant influx of patients into the healthcare environment 34 however social distancing along with additional psychosocial factors including fear of healthcare systems and economic strain resulting in potential hardships including loss of employment or health insurance in the private payor model can impact the behavior of the patients with chronic medical conditions including those with history of transplant 5 in general solid organ transplant recipients require extensive monitoring of patient and graft well-being and close follow up by a multidisciplinary team that includes members from the transplant center including nephrology surgery nursing social work and pharmacy as well as the patients local primary care provider 6 how these issues associated with social distancing and covid-19 will influence long-term outcomes in the transplant recipients is unknown 6covid-19 appears to more negatively affect patients with chronic co-morbid conditions studies exist demonstrating patients with cardiovascular disease diabetes and the elderly have more severe clinical manifestations and have an increased risk of negative outcomes 7 many of these are co-occurring conditions found in ktrs 8 recent case series describing ktrs with covid-19 have demonstrated an incidence of intensive care unit admission from 27 to 100 acute kidney injury from 16 to 50 and mortality rates ranging from 6 to 50 9 10 11 12 13 14 when reviewing reports of covid-19 infection published in journals with impact factor  25 between january 1st and april 24th 2020 it appears ktrs have more negative outcomes overall indeed patient-level incidence of aki ktr 275 vs non-ktr 133 p  001 renal replacement therapy ktr 154 vs non-ktr 33 p  001 requirement for icu care ktr 341 vs non-ktr 151 p  001 and death ktr 227 vs non-ktr 162 p  10 representing relative risks of 206 144 296 472 262 851 225 167 303 and 141 095 208 favored non-ktrs in all categories 910121315 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23while it seems clear that ktr with suppressed immune systems and baseline chronic kidney disease after transplantation ckd-t appear to be at a higher risk of covid-19 related morbidity and mortality the collateral damage of the massive changes to the provision of chronic medical care due to the pandemic in this population is less apparent 1415 therefore the purpose of this manuscript is to review and describe potential ramifications of the pandemic on the routine care of the renal transplant recipient and present strategies to address these challenges in an attempt to prevent adverse outcomesas aforementioned the primary public health measure to contain covid-19 has been government-mandated social distancing practices these orders are endorsed by national health bodies including the center for disease control cdc and who and practically interpreted at the discretion of state governments 24 in the healthcare setting these orders have resulted in the cancelation of non-emergent elective procedures to limit face-to-face contact with patients 2526 to maintain contact with patients centers have turned to the use of telehealthtelehealth is a complex enterprise and raises multiple challenges at different levels multiple studies showed that telehealth implementation involves a set of professional legal technological and strategic factors 27 28 29 telemedicine also offers significant potential for improving access continuity of care and quality for the benefit of society 3031the cdc recommends increased utilization of telehealth services to maintain providerpatient contact while still following social distancing measures 32 while telemedicine can help fill the void created by covid-19 several factors limit its effectiveness including barriers to using the technology lack of internet lack of device etc hesitancy from patients to share less severe problems with providers and difficulty in understanding changes in medications over the telephone furthermore physical examination by providers cannot effectively take place via a virtual visit and significant findings like an assessment of volume status may be missed although this approach helps to maintain social distancing it can expose ktrs to potential unintended consequencesdue to ongoing economic pressures healthcare systems have been required to adopt cost-reduction strategies which include reducing work hours and income of the transplant providers coordinators nurses and pharmacists furthermore in areas more significantly impacted by covid-19 redeployment of transplant providers to the front-line for covid-19 related care also functionally reduces transplant-related work hours the effect of these on the care of ktrs is unknown but may affect both short-term and long-term patient and allograft outcomesthe pandemic exposes the weaknesses of the current private payor health system in the united states where help from the federal government has been required to keep the system functional 33non-adherence to immunosuppressant medications by ktrs is associated with increased risk of allograft rejection which in turn is associated with increased morbidity and mortality 3435 despite the adverse outcomes associated with non-adherence rates of non-adherence to medication in ktrs has been reported to be 20 to 70 36 the government-issued shelter at home orders increasing unemployment and loss of health insurance during the covid-19 pandemic can threaten adherence again highlighting the limitations of a private payor based healthcare system over a public system as is found in europe this non-adherence can then be amplified by difficulties in procuring medications due to issues with transportation accessibility and affordability indeed in our center-specific experience we have had a number of ktrs present with acute allograft rejection due to non-adherence with laboratory monitoring and medications due to their interpretation of shelter at home orders and fear of healthcare exposure article recently published will provide reference later due to the journal double-blind review policyseveral studies have shown that ktrs are at increased risk of emotional distress and affective disorders such as anxiety and depression 37 38 39 the enormity of social distancing economic crisis and grief over the death of loved ones related to covid-19 has the potential to affect mental health significantly wang et al conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques in immunocompetent people the survey collected information on demographic data physical symptoms covid-19 exposure and symptoms they also looked into the psychological impact of covid-19 by using depression anxiety and stress scale dass-21 the study found that 538 of respondents rated the psychological impact of the pandemic as moderate or severe 165 reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms 288 reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms and 81 reported moderate to severe stress levels female gender student status specific physical symptoms and poor self-related health status were significantly associated with the psychological impact of the pandemic p  05 40 based on previous experiences from prior outbreaks patients with chronic health conditions are most susceptible to the stress of this crisis 41 beyond covid-19 related exacerbation of anxiety and depression the lack of access to primary care physicians social workers and transplant providers can potentiate anxiety and depression in the ktrs there is also concern that the current crisis can trigger unhealthy behaviors including excessive smoking increased alcohol intake poor sleep reduced activity and dysregulated eating in patients with pre-existing psychiatric or other medical conditions 42 43 44 this maladaptive stress response can have a significant impact on ktrs given their reliance on medication adherence for positive outcomes as well as common co-morbid conditions that would be exacerbated by these behaviorsto minimize viral exposure for patients and transplant providers many transplant centers have adopted virtual modalities for routine visits a virtual visit despite its shortcomings is preferable to delaying or skipping a routine visit increased frequency of virtual visits may be needed for those patients considered to be at the highest risk including patients with multiple medical conditions underlying anxiety and depression devices and platforms that facilitate visual communication including video chat allow for interpretation of visual conversational cues as well as some physical examinationwith the recent changes in reimbursement policies by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms to expand virtual visits most of the virtual visits will be reimbursed 45 reimbursement for medicaid varies by state though many states have expanded telehealth coverage in response to this crisisfrequent checking of vitals and reporting to the transplant team when abnormal is encouraged patients should be educated about the symptoms of covid-19 infection with any concerning symptoms patients should inform their primary care physicians andor the transplant centers and should be instructed if covid-19 testing is warranted it is important to note that even if a patient has not had an exposure or is at low risk for covid-19 due to social distancing a fever in a ktr still requires clinical workup the infectious complications that plague kidney transplantation continues during this era including urinary tract infection cytomegalovirus infection pneumonia and other opportunistic infections patients should be similarly educated about the need for ongoing vigilance in monitoring for these and other infectionsmobile phlebotomy services to obtain routine laboratory blood work from transplant patients are an exciting avenue to explore during the pandemic services such as this are available for cytomegalovirus virus cmv molecular diagnostics as well as routine blood work these alternative strategies will both allow the transplant team to monitor important indicators of kidney function and avoid potential covid-19 exposure from visiting phlebotomy laboratoriesthe cell-free dna and active rejection in kidney allograft dart study suggests that the use of a non-invasive allosure test to measure donor-derived cell-free dna can be used to diagnose rejection in the kidney allograft 46 the allosure test has been approved by medicare for clinical use when kidney transplant rejection is suspected high-risk patients who might previously have undergone a protocol biopsy for routine surveillance can be closely monitored by allosure testing during the evolving pandemic the negative allosure testing will be reassuring and patients can potentially be observed without being called into the hospital for the kidney allograft biopsy those protocol biopsies can be delayed based on the allosure testing in patients with stable renal allograft function however the patients with abnormal kidney allograft function with elevated creatinine increasing urine protein creatinine ratio or denovo or rising donor-specific antibodies will still need transplant kidney biopsy as standard of their carewhile the covid-19 pandemic presents challenges to medication adherence we offer several strategies to address these issues below1pharmacy avoidance utilization of mail order over brick and mortar pharmacies should be encouraged the education of patients regarding delays related to shipments should occur to avoid disruption of therapy2stockpiling the cdc has encouraged patients to obtain an extended supply of medications during the covid-19 pandemic to avoid the need for frequent refilling 47483cost mitigation strategies manufacturer sponsored patient assistance programs pap should be explored for patients that qualify based on income those who are under-insured or have high deductibles may be eligible for manufacturer-sponsored co-pay assistance plans both pap and co-pay assistance are typically only available in the setting of branded drug products pharmacy specific generic-drug programs as well as the good rx drug credit program can be explored in the setting of generically available drugs or those patients that do not qualify for papco-pay assistance ie patients with state and government-funded insurance programs co-payment waivers during covid-19 is another option that has been suggested 4950 most importantly the 3-year medicare coverage issue needs to be addressed to improve access to ongoing coverage of immunosuppressive medications and avoid returns to dialysis
as mentioned earlier ktrs are at increased risk of depression anxiety and stress especially during the time of the covid-19 pandemic specific strategies should be adopted to deal with this ktrs should be encouraged to stay in touch with their family and friends through phone or video technologies with more severe symptoms of anxiety and depression they should contact their health care providers several studies have shown that mediation programs can reduce multiple negative dimensions of psychological stress 51 the continuation of physical activity during this crisis is essential regular exercise is an effective reducer of stress and anxiety 5253 although many government policies enforce quarantineslockdown if physical distancing is upheld outdoor exercise is allowed even when outdoor activities are not possible regular indoor exercise should be done many virtual exercise classes are now available for high-risk individuals and should be encouraged various challenges and strategies are summarized in fig 1
the covid-19 pandemic will have a long-lasting effect on our health system to avoid long-lasting effects on our patients strategies to prevent adverse outcomes are needed these strategies must address both risks associated with covid-19 as well as risks associated with a lack of proper maintenance care of the allograft in the absence of clear guidelines for the type or frequency of monitoring during the pandemic we suggest that rigorous medical and psychosocial patient-centered risk stratification strategies avoid adverse outcomes in stable solid organ transplant recipients increased utilization of technology newly developed immune-monitoring assays and patient and provider vigilance will all contribute to this goal this era of covid-19 necessitates the multidisciplinary collaboration and inventive spirit that is central to the field of solid organ transplantsthe authors have no financial disclosuresno grant funding directly supports this manuscriptall authors declare no conflict of interestcredit - conceptualization chowdhry a investigation chowdhry a kapoor p popli db review kapoor p popli dbwriting - original draft preparation chowdhry a review chowdhry a kapoor p popli editing chowdhry a kapoor p

the problem the world-wide crisis of covid-19 pandemic challenges us all with uncertain disruptive circumstances this pandemic has majorly changed daily lives global economies intrainter-country political outlook and educational systems schools universities and researchers havent faced this magnitude of disruption in generations with nearly total closures of schools universities and colleges with approximately 1725 billion learners are currently affected world over as per unicef data of impact on global student population 985 are believed to be affected with 186 countries on complete and eight on local shut down4
since march 16 2020 indian schools and colleges are under lock-down to maximize social distancing and minimize the spread of infection amongst students and teaching staff5 important changes have been made pan-india in relation to online teaching admission and student assessmentjournal of oral biology and craniofacial research jobcr is publishing contributions in platform for both clinical and translational research and to promote interdisciplinary sciences6 hence this perspective article attempts to highlight positive impacts and opportunities provided by covid-19 pandemic period to health care research and academic set up the article also enlists numerous challenges both short-term and long-term in academics and research in indian health care setup during and after covid 19 pandemic and proposes ways and policies to shape up post-coronavirus health care universities landscape in future by collective efforts
in the time of crisis we should be aware of danger  but also recognise the opportunity-jf kennedy
while covid-19 pandemic is a genuine danger to human wellbeing with diminishing degrees of contamination it very well may be considered as surprisingly positive development7 making environment a health friendly one respiratory illnesses such as influenza parainfluenza respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus have shown decline at children hospital in san diego8
due to less traffic as a result of lockdown doctors and para medical staff dont need to drive significant distances to get to medical clinics and dispensaries this can prompt better quality and quantity of rest home cooking and eating is being done which is a healthier option than eating out in these infectious times9
covid-19 has made a positive impact on patient to doctor interaction dynamics nelson b 2020 brings up covd-19 pandemic may cause public to be more willing to adapt and act on public health and wellbeing messages8
covid-19 pandemic has already changed health care technology and its usage for distant consultations using telecom technology telehealth visits are booming as doctors and patients embrace distancing amid the coronavirus crisis10 quarantine management program real time patient managements sars-cov-2 vaccine are few opportunities for research and transforming how health care will be delivered beyond 202011
government of india and its prime minister have commended the job of medical community in these pandemic times indian government has amended epidemic diseases act of 1897 for providing safety to doctors medical attendants paramedical staff medical community can now perform duties fearlessly and translate data generated into good ethical research12
after careful appraisal of literature and addition of personal reflectionopinion authors have compiled following points and management suggestion to mitigate the impact on research and academic front fig 1
1
prepare to work and collaborate virtually laptop charger webcam will be most required armamentarium to disseminate knowledge world has already shrunk and it is quite easy to engage and convince stalwarts and eminent scientists to share their knowledge on various live streaming softwares
as suggested in previously new authors in scientific writing are recommended to join experienced researchers this is can be easily done by virtual collaborations13

14 collaborations with experienced and expert stalwarts in ethics politics or public policy have positive implications on final submitted research work for publication15 topics like biomedical ethics can be easily imbibed at grass root level by these online team work2
check deadlines it is obviously possible that federal agencies and other funders including indian council of medical researchdepartment of biotechnologydepartment of science and technology might extend deadlines for project submissions in these pandemic times principal investigator should take a lead here and share how the crisis has affected team-work and how team plans to keep progressing with deadlines in mind16

it is recommended that students are not pressurised for deadlines and that teachers show flexibility in submission dates as many of students might be stranded or might be compromised in establishing communication due to limited online resources authorities should know that too many deadlines pressure to publish and api annual performance index score for promotion are responsible for plagiarism13
3
alter research methodology online institutional review board should be constituted in all the universities so that virtual approval can be provided many of the project and research work might change methodologies which rely on face-to-face interaction to collect data4
have plan b these are infectious times and chances of co-workers falling sick is possible hence cross training of staff is important single investigator maintaining and storing entire data should be avoided maintaining data on spread sheet with multiple access is recommended5
maintain communication and virtual socialization frequent communication is key to not only keeping the research going but also safeguarding mental health of students and researchers17 bregman d et al 2020 suggests what we need in a pandemic is not social distancing but physical distancing with social connectedness18

many of the stalwarts can use these pandemic times for self-promotion of own articles ethically for increasing scientific impactcitation bloggingtweetingresearch gate etc platforms can be used for increasing academic foot print it may be noted here that sharing data ethically does lead to increased citations over a longer period of time19
6
time to upgrade the pandemic crisis lock down time gives each student and academician a chance to increase their academic outputs the researchers can utilise their time in writing proposals for grants and simultaneously also enhance their skills and knowledge by various online pedagogical learning courses or discussions government of india wwwswayamgovin has initiated and designed online courses which are interactive free of cost available to any learner7
build-up a support system as a student its important to keep in touch with authorities so that a support system can be build up to tackle any kind of critical situations since many of universities have told students to vacate hostel immediately its important that teachers ensure that students reach respective homes safely8
rapid sharing of data in policy brief developed by the who working group on ethics  covid-19 states that research projects should be coordinated nationally and internationally to avoid wasteful duplication and underpowered studies and to ensure that priorities and activities are consistent with response efforts20
9
pandemic reading and writing covid-19 has disrupted life all over the world but one practice relatively unaffected by the pandemic is reading students and academicians should have a daily read list to make best out of these social distancing times online free access journals can be handy in this teachers and mentors should share favourite titles and abstracts to initiate discussions and drive students to read articles various online modes like google classrooms can be effectively used for sharing presentations books assignments and also hold quiz or interactive discussions with students
students teachers researchers etc can hone skills of writing both scientific and casual text during these crisis times the entire focus can be to disseminate knowledge which can be utilized by students and researchers once lockdown and isolation conditions are removedabove mentioned suggestions are not exhaustive and can be modified as per individual situations since the scientific knowledge and related data keeps on increasing these guidelines can be modified to suit region based cases most of the recommendations provided can be applied in global perspective also
the show must go on - freddie mercury  queen bohemian rhapsody
who has declares covid-19 outbreak as pandemic on the march 11 2020 and entire world including indian sub-continent is under lock down isolation has given science a whole new perspective on health care related research and academics non-contact mode of teaching and research is new mantra of safe-studying at universities including ones involving health care givers however at the same time it has also given an opportunity to healthcare researchers academicians and also students to build up their research quotient utilising virtual connectivity and spend their time effectively to upgrade their skills and knowledge the article suggests online ethical reviews for speeding up proposals while easing the deadlines in the current scenario also at the same time compliments the government on their initiatives of quality online courses for benefit of academic communityin the midst of all the confusion and shock caused by covid-19 it is crucial that universities and research intuitions providing health care should stick to their basic principles and ethical standards which will offer a sense of direction and legitimacy to patient care academics and research india and abroad medical community comprising of doctors nurses paramedical staff and accredited social health workers and students shall face these dark times fearlessly collectively and shall act today to define future of mankindone mental health consequence of social distancing is the terrible loneliness that
can prevail as people are necessitated to remain inside our homes and away from the
communal comradery of our daily lives which we may have taken for granted until
now our worlds can feel eerily quiet and small when mandated to work and school
from home avoid restaurants and bars and stay at a six-foot distance from others
for weeks or months to come physical distancing can certainly be experienced as a
psychological distancing without intentional efforts to offset the isolation health
care professionals are well aware of these mental health consequences they
encourage frequent virtual check-ins with one anotherparticularly those that are
most vulnerable to covid-19 such as our beloved eldersto preserve our sense of
intimate community bonding in this time of self-quarantiningas a therapeutic form of art music offers that bonding power historically music
has been used by people to remain motivated resilient and united in the face of
collective challenge from the sea shantis that sailors in the 18th
century chanted together as they labored to weather harsh ocean tides to the
freedom songs sung by the black community in the 20th century amid the tiring fight
for civil rights tracey nicholls
2014 writes about musics emotional power to join people in solidarity
and build movements togetherit is because of the way music feeds into our emotional lives and because of
the sense of social well-being we get from sharing emotional states with
others that music so frequently accompanies movements that build and depend
upon solidaritywhereby solidarity is defined as the harmony of interests and responsibilities among
individuals in a group especially as manifested in unanimous support and collective
action for something laurence
 urbain 2011 p 5 musical solidarity has the therapeutic ability
to puncture the isolation of social distancing to foster resiliency by lifting the
collective spirit and to move peoples emotions toward spirited
actioneven if that action in these circumstances means
staying home to save the lives of others music can also assuage the stress
inflicted by social distancing and the covid-19 pandemic by soothing the autonomic
nervous system through rhythm and melody thoma et al 2013in this time of coronavirus examples of therapeutic music-making unceasingly flow
as a psychology professor who teaches art therapy my undergraduate students and i
were supposed to do a music therapy lesson last week and engage in an
improvisational jam-session together in the classroom each student was invited to
bring an object that can serve as an instrument be it a guitar or harmonica or
spoons or their voice to comply with the social distancing mitigation strategy
recommended by health care organizations we decided to move the class online via
zoom meetings as a last-minute plan yet social distancing did not impede our
musical solidarity instead the 20 students and i experimented with a virtual
improvisational jam session to join our spirits in a fun rhythmic flow of course
the rhythm was slightly delayed because of the internets lag-time of course our
harmony could not find perfect synchronization through our laptops and phones yet
still we sang together clapped together strummed together and laughed together
accessing a primal mode of communal being-together through collective sound making
across our individual screens our improvisational virtual jam session brought us
enough joy and love to overpower the terror of covid-19 for just a little while but
the next day i awoke to something all the more moving one of the most poignant
demonstrates of musical solidarity i have ever seen a video was circulating of the
people in italy who are currently undergoing a national quarantine because of the
rapid uncontainable spread of the infection across their nation at a capacity that
far overwhelms their health care capacities and has led to dire life-and-death
decisions in the hospitals with warning that the united states may follow suit if
we do not social distance now the situation in italy is tragic
there can be no denying the collective trauma among covid-19 patients and health
care providers and self-isolated citizens alike and yet this video of the italians
conveys unbridled joy viewable at httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv8r357ugh7hu the video captures
them congregating on the balconies of their apartments strumming and shaking
whatever instruments are available to them and joining the voices to sing together
into the wide open air they are laughing dancing and clapping in celebration of
one another it brings the viewer to tears to witness such a delightful display of
community it brings me close to tears to write this even now the antidote of
musical solidarity in a time of coronavirus provides a joyful reminder of the deep
human will to always find our way back to one another even a nationwide quarantine
or a deadly pandemic cannot prevent us from connecting and supporting each other
through lifes darkest hours since this video of the italians impromptu concert
went viral social media has become abundant with musicians generously sharing
virtual concerts for the general public to watch from the safety of their homes
such as members of the atlanta symphony orchestra john legend coldplay and many
of my musical friends on facebook in the days to come i imagine these bonds of
music will exponentially grow to remind each of us that we are not aloneone challenge in mobilizing the masses to understand the severity of threat of
covid-19 and the importance of social distancing is the invisibility of the disease
our eyes cannot literally see how the coronavirus spreads from
person to person in the united states at the time of writing this essay many of
us can also not yet see the tragic effect of the disease on our
community members or loved ones with the exception of the major epicenters of the
outbreak such as washington and new york at this point the pandemic remains
shrouded in invisibility to most american eyes lest we find the courage to watch
news clips of the traumatic hospital scenarios in china and italy similar to a
psychological understanding of climate change apathy it is difficult to hold
tangible concern for a future calamity that appears intangible to us in present day
thus health care professionals pleas for american citizens to take seriously the
adoption of health precautions and social distancing practices can fall on apathetic
ears and eyes what can help people reverse apathy and confront reality is the
restoration of visionof literally seeing the coronavirus and its
impact on us and our loved ones vision is    one of the means by which we
interact with and relate to the world and by increasing our visual awareness we
extend and intensify our relationship to life mcniff 1981 p 155as a therapeutic vehicle the visual arts help make the unconscious conscious
creating an image brings tangible form to psychological realities which remain
typically unseen to the human eye thereby allowing us to become aware of and
confront these realities during crisis experiences that are emotionally difficult
to confront such as the threat of covid-19 an image can act as an external
container within which to place our inner disturbances so we can safely understand
and work through them as mcniff
1998 statesthe art of placing a troublesome experience or thought into a creative space
we have made literally changes its place within our lives the artistic act
will often have a corresponding effect on our overall relationship with the
disturbance    when we use our disturbances as materials of expression we
see that everything in life is fuel for the creative process p 74after making visual artwork we can then examine our image at a safe distance so a
new perspective can be discovered which allows our feelings and relationship to the
crisis to transform as tangible products our artwork can also be shared with
others inviting them to dialogue with our image discover personal meanings in it
and emotionally connect to it as shared human experience thus visual artwork can
offer collective healing finally visual artworks can have an everlasting and
historical quality behaving as tangible memorials that forever commemorate this
present moment in our personal and collective histories shulman  watkins 2008 memorial
making during times of collective crisis can bring healingprior to most countries enforcing or strongly encouraging social distancing it is
amazing to witness the coronavirus street art that sprung up as if overnight in
london street artist pegasus painted a mural on a street corner featuring prime
minister boris johnson urging people to stop panic-buying supplies in grocery stores
as they prepare to social distance he wanted to remind them to be considerate to
others during this crisis in rome street artist laika painted a mural above a
popular restaurant to address the ignorance and xenophobia toward chinese people in
italy as a result of covid-19 the image includes a chinese woman dressed in
surgical attire and a face mask with a speech bubble that reads theres an
epidemic of ignorance going around    we must protect ourselves in naples
artist nello petrucci erected a giant street mural of the simpsons
family wearing face masks on their couch with the words stay home spray-painted
onto the image from within their homes adults and children are transforming
boredom into creativity by crafting their own images to share with the public in
italy many quarantined families hang colorful painted banners outside their
balconies with words of encouragement such as andra tutto bene meaning
everything will be fine in the united states where a national quarantine has not
yet been administered the visual arts are embraced to make the invisible visible
remind americans of the gravity of the situation and offer encouragement and
precaution i painted an acrylic painting called social distancing blues which
visualizes the coronavirus hovering across the sky in bright red paint outside my
apartment windows i shared the image on social media as a public service
advertisement with the message even though the virus looks pretty from afar dont
trust it stay at home folks a few days later my mother a senior citizen who is
in the high-risk category of covid-19 was inspired to create her own graphic image
as a public service announcement she used the phone app bitmoji to create a comic
strip of herself as a cartoon character social distancing in the comic strip she
offers healing greetings and safety strategies to help others cope with covid-19
good day thinking of you all are you ok i am social distancing cuz i want
to listen to the cdc advice and so should you wash your hands dont touch your
face nature walks healing through the internet no peeking at the 401k
hang in there dont panic we can do it what is so moving about these
examples is that in the process of making and sharing coronavirus art a shift seems
to occur where we become empowered to do something about the
covid-19 crisis we seem to be creating images to help slow the virus down spread
reminders of kindness and nurture collective resiliency just as mcniff suggested
that placing a troublesome experience into an artistic container can transform our
relationship to it making visual art about coronavirus and social distancing can
help transform collective anxiety into collective support and action thus this
time in history may forever be memorialized as a moment of precious human
solidarity





one stressful aspect of coronavirus is that it is a new pandemic we do not know much
about our understanding is evolving day by day moreover mixed messages are being
disseminated from politicians health care professionals organizational leaders
and our intimate social circles this lack of information and mixed messaging breeds
anxiety by making us feel out of control and unsure of what to believe the future
feels unknown and we struggle to find a secure leg on which to stand grasping for
some semblance of certitude with which to anticipate a narrative about the impending
days weeks and months to comecinema is increasingly embraced as a form of expressive art therapy because movies
offer relatable narratives with characters and plotlines that can express the shared
human experience cinematherapy is the intentional use of movie
viewing to gain self-insight and psychological transformation as audiences
emotions and perspectives transform while watching a movie berg-cross et al 1990 sharp et al 2002 most
films offer narratives with a reliable temporal structurala
beginning in which a conflict emerges a
middle during which the crisis is grappled with and an
ending during which the conflict is resolved if we watch a
movie whose crisis is similar to our own we can find incredible catharsis and
relief by witnessing a resolution to our crisis offered by the movies storyline
moreover because movies are a multisensory experience they can evoke the full
spectrum of emotion about a situation onscreen cinemas ability to express strong
emotion through sight sound and motion can offer emotional catharsis and
containment for audiences allowing us to externalize our own inner suffering by
viewing it onscreen the movie offers a container for our strong emotions aside
from watching movies cinematherapy also includes therapeutic filmmaking
interventions ordinary people can shoot edit and produce videos and films that
express their difficult psychological experiences johnson  alderson 2008 it can be
empowering to control the narrative by making a film of ones own making movies
helps us restore agency gain mastery and reduce the anxiety that corresponds with
feeling out of control in crisis situationsan interesting trend during this coronavirus crisis has been the plethora of people
flocking to watch the 2011 fictional film contagion on their movie
streaming platforms contagion is a movie about a deadly fictional
pandemic named mev-1 whose outbreak kills 26 million people worldwide the virus in
the film kills 25 to 30 of people who catch it as opposed to the 2 of covid-19
despite this significant difference contagion is nevertheless a
pretty terrifying flick to watch at this time the film gruesomely depicts the
health and social impacts of a deadly pandemic so why has it become one of the top
movies streamed from netflix and itunes since our own pandemic broke loosea film
which appears more and more like a medical documentary than fictional thriller each
day because despite the massive death toll that the film depicts the movie ends
with a vaccine developed which effectively immunizes human beings from mev-1
despite the emotional rollercoaster the audience endures as the film world explodes
because of a deadly pandemican emotional journey that likely mirrors what we will
experience as the pandemic develops in our real worldby the end of the movie the
audience can breathe a sigh of relief as the crisis is resolved and daily life
returns to normal thus contagion offers audiences a cathartic
container for our panic a sense of control to combat uncertainty and hope for
whats to come aside from the healing power of watching movies agency and hope can
also be discovered by therapeutic filmmaking in this time of coronavirus i will
again reference the magnificent art pouring from the italians amid their current
situation of enforced national quarantine a filmmaking collective in milan called a
thing by recently created a video compilation of italians talking to their former
selves from 10 days ago which can be viewed here httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvocimrzkxosfeatureyoutube
the italians in the video have a dialogue with the camera of what they wish they
could tell themselves 10 days ago hello daniele-from-10-days-ago are you scared
nah im speaking to you from the future i know youre busy but wait a second i
want to update you on italys latest a huge mess is about to happen     the
video showcases italians imploring their former selves to take seriously the threat
of the virus such that they can adopt social distancing and health precautions
before it is too late while they cannot turn back time i imagine this video was
cathartic to make by providing an expressive container for feelings of regret and
despair moreover the italians may regain agency and control in making this video
for it is being shared by the cdc in the united states to warn americans of whats
to come if they make the same mistake through therapeutic filmmaking the italians
may experience empowerment by helping the rest of the world avert the crisis that
they themselves endured as the pandemic spreads across the world i imagine in-home
video production will be embraced as significant therapeutic vehicle as we
collectively seek to tell the story of our timeacross the history of our species crisis has always been intertwined with
creativity humans are called again and again to discover and harness our primal
will to create which resides within us all in order to survive existential
psychologist rollo may
1975 suggestedif you wish to understand the psychological and spiritual temper of any
historical period you can do no better than to look long and searchingly at
its art for in the art the underlying spiritual meaning of the period is
expressed directly in symbols this is not because artists are didactic or
set out to teach or to make propaganda    they have the power to reveal
the underlying meaning of any period precisely because the essence of art is
the powerful and alive encounter between the artist and his or her world
p 52it is still early in the game but if i am learning anything about the meaning of
this time from the artists among us it is that there is a profound desire to
protect each other sacrifice for each other and be together-in-solidarity as an
interconnected global community when faced with this grave threat to the human
species our lives depend quite literally on our ability to love each otheracross
