coronavirus questions that will not go away interrogating urban and
socio-spatial implications of covid-19 measures ashraf salama m   on 20th january 2020 epidemiologists at the chinese centre for disease control and
prevention published an article stating that the first cluster of patients with
pneumonia of an unknown cause had been identified on 21st december
2019 in wuhan  bfpg 2020 a city with a
population of more than 11 million following this announcements were made -- that
thousands of cases were identified in china and substantial numbers of cases were
broadcasted in many countries around the world on 30th january whos
director-general declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of
international concern  who 2020 given
that thousands of cases have been reported reaching all corners of the world in one
month this declaration was coupled with a number of recommendations related to
early detection of infection isolating and treating infected cases contact tracing
and social distancing measures that correspond to the level of risk in each country
with a key objective to interrupt or delay and hopefully limit the virus spread within the united kingdom public health england announced it is moving the risk
level to the british public from very low to low on
22nd january this is also when first two patients in the uk tested positive for
coronavirus after two chinese nationals from the same family staying at a hotel in
york fell ill a plane clearing britons from wuhan and evacuees went into a 14-day
quarantine at a specialist hospital in merseyside  bfpg 2020 after confirming the first transmission of
disease within the uk the government decided not to follow italy and china where
the highest figures of infection and death were recorded the lockdown approach that
imposes restrictions on liberty and movement was not favoured by the government
instead throughout february 2020 the government advised a range of voluntary
restrictions such as social distancing and if any symptoms are
exhibited self-isolation and quarantine on the 5th march infected cases were
reported in all areas of the uk 105 in england six in scotland three in wales
and one in northern ireland  bbc
2020 by the third week of march the prime minister announced a further set of measures as
part of a nationwide lockdown  beadsworth
2020 this was due to the continuous increase in infected and death
cases which reached according to public health england a total of 14543 cases
and 759 deaths on 27th march  phe 2020
the virus is highly infectious and at the time of writing this article there is no
known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for covid-19 disease despite claims
by various governments that a vaccine or treatment is being developed the key
measure of the global public health campaign in response to the pandemic is social
distancing which in essence is avoiding face contact and encouraging physical
distancing the significant contributions to stop and treat viruses and associated diseases fall
within various academic disciplines and professions most important medical
scientists biologists and public health researchers are the key contributors to a
pandemic of this nature and scale they conduct laboratory research to understand
the attributes of the virus and the characteristics of the family of viruses it
belongs to they experiment develop test and advance vaccines for mass use and
eventually identify effective treatments professionals and scholars from other
disciplines are also contributors such as mathematicians and computer scientists
whose work through modelling techniques enable an effective understanding of
global patterns of virus spread and mortality rates social and behavioural
scientists contribute to the development of policies in the sense that they enable
institutions and organisations to identify risks and manage responses as they relate
to their employees and communities while addressing issues related to anxiety
loneliness and mental health architecture and urbanism as academic disciplines and professions that influence in
many different ways individuals communities and societies can support efforts
through developing new insights into the impact of a pandemic on cities and urban
environments now and in the future developing new understandings relevant to the
characteristics of urban spaces which ensue from these insights conducting research
to comprehend the socio-spatial implications of covid-19 measures and guidelines
introduced by governments and authorities to fight the spread of the disease
identifying new conceptions related to emerging lifestyles which stem from the new
spatial environments that integrate working and living patterns and ultimately
developing design responses towards creating healthy environments that successfully
accommodate the infected populations while addressing the associated social and
psychological ramifications at the time of writing this article there is no sufficient or available empirical
research conducted to address to the preceding areas of potential contributions both
at the architectural building and urban city scales this article nonetheless
aims to interrogate these areas by instigating important questions while striving to
generate responses through conceptualisation operationalization and referencing
the available literature the fundamental aim is to underscore relevant factors
originate insights of potential use to policy makers architects and planners
highlight areas where future research will be critically needed and emphasise the
positive role architecture and urban design and planning fields can play in
developing healthy environments in a globally virtual world social distancing measures are a vital part of mitigating pandemics they complement
other measures in decreasing the prospect of the spread of disease the current body
of knowledge points out that social distancing is not a new measure to mitigate the
spread but has been introduced and practiced during the past several decades
researchers have developed important evidence on the potential impact of social
distancing arguing that it is moderately effective  ahmppi 2019 therefore where socio-economic impacts are
insignificant social distancing has been viewed at least as an acceptable
temporary measure while referred to as physical distancing in many writings social
distancing is a set of infection control actions envisioned to slow down or delay
and eventually stop the spread of an infectious disease  harris et al 2020 it aims to reduce the
likelihood of contact between persons carrying an infection and others who are not
infected so as to reduce virus transmission sickness and minimise mortality 
hensley 2020 despite the suggestion made by ahmppi
2019 there appears to be growing evidence of the effectiveness of social
distancing when infection is transmitted through droplet contact which may result
from all forms of physical contact between people and contact with contaminated
surfaces and fabrics it is also effective when transmission is airborne where the
virus can survive in the air for a period of time there is no clear evidence
however that social distancing is effective when infection is transmitted through
contact with water food or through insects social distancing measures were introduced by the world health organization in
response to the initially gradual and then exponentially global spread of
coronavirus the measures were generic in nature and were subject to various
interpretations of governments in the global north and the global south so they can
respond to the level of risk in each country or even residential neighbourhood or
locality these interpretations range from flexible or minor social distancing
measures to lockdown or in some countries various types of curfews during defined
timeframes within the day or the week measures of social distancing are practiced at both institutional and individual
levels at an institutional level there is common agreement on what social
distancing entails as evidenced in government documents of countries around the
world  phe 2020 pancap 2020 in this context the key elements are school
closure workplace closure and cancellation of mass gatherings this is further
expanded to include closure of small businesses restaurants cinemas theatres
bars pubs and clubs according to phe
2020 at an individual level social distancing entails reducing or
minimising interaction between people and involves a avoidance of non-essential
use of public transport especially during rush hours b working from home where
possible with regulations set for employers to support this c avoidance of contact
with someone who is displaying symptoms of coronavirus covid-19 which include
high temperature andor new and continuous cough d avoidance of large gatherings
and gatherings in smaller public spaces and e avoidance of gatherings with friends
and family with recommendations to use distance technology including phone
internet and social media strikingly many social media posts online newspapers portals and discussion
boards and academic platforms are now introducing and discussing the notion of the
new normal portraying this as a new paradigm which will involve
many new realities and intensive online activities that range from retail and
shopping to banking and higher education prevision to name a few it is argued
social distancing is here to stay for much more than a few weeks it will
upend our way of life in some ways forever  lichfield 2020 there is strong evidence that there is now
a high degree of acceptability among governments institutions organisations and
universities that contemporary societies are approaching a new era characterised by
intensive digitalvirtual practices to which the way of life must be adapted in
particular and in the immediate future until it becomes actually
normal there is a general appreciation that such a new normal will have
negative consequences which include loneliness reduced productivity unhealthy
sleeping and eating habits potential obesity and loss of various benefits
associated with reduced human-human and human-environment interactions with social distancing measures the remarkable shift from the physical to the
virtual and the acceptance of this there are many social and spatial implications
that architects planners and built environment professionals would be keen to
examine in this respect key questions arise to address various scales and scopes
and can be outlined as follows the preceding questions do not cover the entire spectrum of issues and potential
impacts arising from social distancing and the new normal for example issues
associated with risk management construction processes and practice management are
not included yet the questions cover some fundamentals that are believed to be of
interest to the global community of architects and urban designers and planners and
that are predicted to generate new conceptions develop new insights and eventually
inform new thinking about the future of architecture and urbanism this would also
instigate a discourse on role of architecture and urbanism in developing healthy
environments and supporting emerging lifestyles in a post pandemic virtual era answering complex questions like the ones presented in the preceding section requires
responses underpinned by a commitment to trans-disciplinarity it should be seen as
a form of research involving co-operation among different parts of society
professionals and academia  dunnin-woyseth
 nielsen 2004 pohl  hirsch
hadorn 2008 in order to meet complex challenges in the context of
covid-19 spread and the resulting new normal and eventually the actual normal
therefore trans-disciplinarity is about blurring then transcending the boundaries
of different disciplines starting from tangible real-world problems knowledge is
developed produced and reproduced based on a collaboration of people from different
disciplinary backgrounds  doucet  janssens
2011 its hybrid nature and non-linearity enables it to transcend and
indeed incorporate any academic disciplinary structure adopting trans-disciplinary
thinking at conceptual and critical analysis levels a framework is developed
through which responses to the questions are based on operationalization of concepts
and theories derived from various disciplines as they relate to architecture and
urbanism  figure 1 outlined as follows while the discussion does not fully address every single discipline shown in the
diagram all the perspectives and dimensions discussed have to do with researching
and designing built environments it is argued that infectious disease has a direct relationship with urban
development and would result in significant impact on our understanding of
urbanism hang 2020 suggests that
the increasing density of cities has generated conditions for the rapid spread
of viruses by comparing the spread of sars-cov in 2003 and sars-cov-2 in
201920 it is evident that population density has a direct impact on the rapid
spread in the case of sars-cov within china more than 5000 people were
infected and more than 300 died over a period of eight months yet in the case
of sars-cov-2 more than 4000 people were infected over a period of seven weeks
this could be attributed to the fact that chinese cities have developed into
both dense and sprawling urban areas with higher population density resulting
from migration from rural to urban areas klaus 2020 interviewed michele acuto professor of global urban
politics in the school of design at the university of melbourne and the
question of density and density management were central to the discussion and
were portrayed as the  long term survival in a pandemic
world klaus
2020 supports this view and argues  part of the
history of urbanization is building and managing your way out of infectious
diseases such as cholera outbreaks in the middle of the 19th
century 
badger 2020 adopts an opposing view
and argues that high density is not necessarily a public health issue she
evidences this by putting the case of singapore and hong kong as urban
environments that are dense or denser than new york and how they were able to
develop early testing and extensive tracing of coronavirus cases rather than
extensive isolation she advocates density for the multiple benefits it brings
to cities unique cultural richness these include facilitating mass
transportation creating walkable environments enabling the masses to enjoy
public spaces supporting childrens needs through urban parks and
playgrounds limiting climate emissions supporting personal and public safety
to name a few it is increasingly acknowledged following sennett 2016 and shenker 2020 that the future of cities will involve a renewed
focus on developing architectural and urban solutions that enable people to
socialise without higher densities and sardines-like
packing the work of keil et al
2020 suggests that there is a close relationship between urban
development and new or re-emerging contagious diseases rapid means of
transportation the continuous expansion of urban sprawl and connectivity
between urban life and nature are factors that contribute to such a spread from
urban peripheries to urban centres however patterns of disease emergence and
spread within urbanisation would require in-depth empirical modelling and
investigations of historical cases and juxtaposing these with the case of
coronavirus spread the persistent question that urban design and planning experts will face in the
future is about balancing conflicting value on the one hand densification and
making cities more compact and concentrated for the environmentally and socially
sustainable benefits compactness is viewed to bring on the other hand
compartmentalisation and separation of populations through various measures
including social distancing as a key tool being used to delay or stop virus
spread while compactness and density are important determinants for successful
urban environments in cultural social and environmental terms current
discussions suggest that the future development of cities will witness
encounters between contested requisites including public health climate and
socio-economic dynamics in meeting the challenge of the covid-19 spread cities are adopting various
strategies at a large scale while cities are at the forefront of the response
to the pandemic they will likely see enduring transformation and permanent
changes while it is argued that cities and urbanism have been shaped by
contagious disease for centuries the global nature of covid-19 is anticipated
to bring significant changes to policies and the associated institutional and
individual behaviours in essence these changes while they have already
started to alter the way people live and work will alter how cities are planned
and managed for decades to come null 
smith 2020 identified a number of areas that delineate various
strategies restricting access to travel and questing for alternatives to public
transit locally and globally measures for limiting travel are most apparent in the sense
of how cities are now operating in a short period of time travel restrictions
among other measures have had negative impacts including destroyed economies
unemployment and a dramatic reduction in industrial production however some
positive impacts are also witnessed in terms of a reduction in air pollution and
carbon emissions in the cases of italy and china nasa satellite data
illustrate significant changes in air pollution levels  nasa 2020 and a 25 drop in carbon emissions as
lockdown and restrictions started to show results  null  smith 2020 coupled with the reduction in train and bus operations in many cities around the
world local and global travel restrictions are expected to have significant
implications on the what and how of urban planning in the future given the
established correlations between morality rates and urban air pollution with
positive impacts on the health of urban societies however these will need to
be balanced in the context of climate change and sustainability if the city is
expanded rather than compacted this must be associated with better connectivity
through alternative forms of public transport as people avoid crowds and
movement is restricted reports suggest that public transit use has taken a
sharp decline  hawkins 2020 moovit 2020 nuki 2020 the planning of future cities would be
derived from enhanced policies that further support cycling and walking contagious disease outbreaks are indeed global incidents as evident in the
spread of coronavirus from wuhan to various cities around the world lockdown
and quarantining of many mega and global cities is impacting the global
condition at various scales including globalised urban lifestyles the rapid
spread of disease takes place through infrastructures of globalisation which
includes global air travel links keil
et al 2020 argue that airports are often
located at the peripheries of cities and urban areas and this raises questions
about responsibility and accountability in terms of managing disease spread to
the wider urban regions in 2003 sars impacted global centres of trade and
commerce including beijing hong kong singapore and toronto however covid-19
has severely impacted global cities in the global north such as london and new
york and global infrastructure such as airport hubs aviation networks and
places of industrial production an interesting phenomenon emerges out of the current discussion of the threat of
covid-19 there is a heavy focus on discussing repercussions of spread in
universal terms and this reinforces existing inequalities  wilkinson 2020 in particular
informal settlements and slums in the global south and the associated urban
poverty do not seem to have enjoyed a sufficient share within current
discussions and media reports this could be attributed to the fact that these
settlements are already on the margin and that communities are already
underrepresented where crises are the norm and thus there is nothing new
despite the significant lack of information there is a risk that infection
rates and transmission will be significantly higher than in planned cities and
urban areas to alleviate the negative consequences of these and introduce
positive interventions in informal settlements in the long term architects and
planners would need to establish new lenses through which they can comprehend
health and living conditions that generate relevant intervention strategies geographical locations refer to the key places and areas that influence
peoples perception of the city such as living working shopping and
entertainment places or destinations derived from the theory of territoriality
home zone and home range are constructs that
represent areas which influence peoples mental image of important
geographical locations establishing links between the physical environment and
social behaviour theorists and researchers have examined these insights in
various contexts  abdel-hadi et
al 2011 altman
1975 rapoport 2005 salama et al 2013 in
this respect it is important to discern how these constructs can be
differentiated home zone signifies an environment with minor or no requirement
for transportation this includes locales that are accessed effortlessly through
walking thereby stimulating a sense of ownership and belonging among the
residents within these locales irrespective of scale and size home range
denotes a more inclusive mental image of the entire residential environment
placing emphasis on the perceived geographical boundary such as that of
residential neighbourhood or clusters of housing developments within urban design and planning disciplines a city is perceived as a fluid
dynamic system which involves material and non-material inputs and outputs that
flow in out and within this relates to the notion of geographical locations
and represents at a larger scale a process of movement and mobility within the
city and beyond in historical writings  burgess 1925 sorokin
1927 and contemporary debates  geyer  kontuly 1996 movement and urban mobility have been
discussed from various perspectives in the past the focus was on social and
behavioural factors recently however the notion of networks the spatial
structure and the peoples perception of both were introduced understanding urban mobility or movement patterns within the city will be crucial
to conceiving interaction measures between geographical locations within the
spatial structure urban networks and the associated operational requirements
the distribution of functions and uses peoples movement patterns and
the rhythm of commuting between geographical locations within the city will all
constitute important design and planning criteria that carefully consider health
and the potential spread of disease within the citys urban structure
acting as imperatives these considerations will enable lessening or
eliminating the spread of viruses to various geographical locations from the
urban peripheries and around airports to urban cores or residential
neighbourhoods this incudes in depth modelling of how far from and how long it
takes to commute to the city core from living areas to work areas public
places entertainment places and within residential neighbourhoods such
modelling should also embed user types and age ranges with a focus on
vulnerable groups since social distancing measures are currently planned to last at least six
months it is believed that they will have various forms of impacts on both
urban researchers and the public concepts and theories related to place
attachment personal space and relationships between individuals and groups as
well as proximity to nature will need to be revisited place attachment is highly influenced by an individual and his or her personal
experiences  rollero  de piccoli
2010 it is multi-dimensional and cannot be explained through a
cause and effect relationship since it depends on a reciprocal relationship
between human behaviour and past and current experiences  giuliani 2016 scannell  gifford 2010 in essence it relates to affect
cognition and behaviour places of attachment include the home neighbourhood
urban settings and natural landscapes attachment to these places is typically
measured through many qualities depending on the typology and use of place
these qualities include aesthetics heritage family connection recreation
therapeutic biological diversity wilderness home intrinsic spiritual
economic life-sustaining learning and future post pandemic place attachment
conception would involve reweighing many of these qualities with more emphasis
placed upon on qualities related to healthy hygienic sanitised and healing
environments this may also lead to the rise of disaster psychology which aims
to examine the relationship between a city urban area or neighbourhood and
their inhabitants attitudes and emotions in the context of detrimental
incidents such as coronavirus spread and an increasing sense of personal safety
and health the established canons of personal space and proximity relationships introduced
in the mid 1960s  hall 1966 and
hall  hall 1966 are
critical to grasp in the context of social distancing measures personal space
determines how people relate socially and psychologically and can be represented
by an area bubble with an invisible boundary surrounding the persons
body into which intruders may not come such a bubble is carried everywhere one
goes based on intensive empirical studies hall 1966 explained the relative distances between people
depending on the relationships they have and classified them in four discrete
distance ranges intimate distance 1 to 46 cm personal distance 46 to 122
cm social distance 12 to 37 m and public distance 37 to 76 m and
more with social distancing measures and the minimum allowance of 2 meters
personal distance the relative distance ranges would entirely change
especially if social distancing measures are viewed in the future as accepted
standards currently there is a growing interest in designing healing environments ryan et al 2014
argues that the surge of interest in creating spaces and places that support
health and wellbeing is viewed as a renaissance in design thinking and the way
in which buildings and cities are designed and built salingaros 2015 contends that biophilic design
effectively eliminates stress and anxiety from the built environment and is
achieved by maintaining thoughtful engagement with nature recently researchers
have been investigating the syntactic relationships between people and nature 
asfour 2019 rice 2019 to 
grierson 2019 in such a quest they attempt to demonstrate the
role of architecture and urbanism in developing healthy and healing environments
and how design can be informed to allow critical humannature associations to
prosper social distancing measures may encourage less association with people
in urban settings and may give further rise to biophilic design trends the urban has been defined as a place of encounter
assembly simultaneity  lefebvre
1970118 it is argued that there are two polar perspectives
associated with the term which stem from various disciplinary territories
urban form and urban life while urban from is the sphere of urban designers
architects urban planners and transportation engineers urban life is the
territory of social scientists human geographers and sociologists as argued
by susser 2002 urban form refers to
the spatial concentration of populace within a specific area of land limits to
building and population densities and certain qualities of buildings and
spaces urban life epitomises the collective which refers to
the diffusion of the system of values attitudes customs and behaviours of a
specific group of people associations between urban form and urban life have
been studied thoroughly  salama et
al 2017a through a sustained and consistent
understanding that they cannot be discussed in isolation where urban form is
shaped and influenced by urban life and urban life arises from urban form the urban place has been expressed in various studies as having contrasting
attributes based on the characteristics of form and the nature of the activities
taking place within that form positive attributes include diversity tolerance
association integration personal network-formation  fischer 1977 and frequent spontaneous interactions
while these qualities represent an ideal condition and confirm lefebvre 1970 postulation the urban
place has been portrayed in negative attributes  halpern 1995 that include anonymity detachment
loneliness formalised social control segregation isolation fear and mental
illness the covid-19 social distancing measures will have an impact on the
perception of some of these qualities especially if these measures in part or
in whole become the norm and part of the new normal an example for this is
that spontaneous interactions would become less or non- spontaneous while
formalised social control will take place as a positive rather than a negative
attribute the suggestion made by walzer 1986
that public space is where we share with strangers people who
arent our relatives friends or work associates could entirely
change given the cognizance of users regarding the risks associated with
engaging with others they do not know if social distancing measures become part
of the collective psyche of societies it could lead to a significant change in
comprehending the needs in public spaces by revisiting the notions of social
interaction assembly and simultaneity active engagement which represents the
direct experience a person has with a place and the people within it would be
limited or directed more towards passive engagement that involves meeting the
need for encounter without becoming actively involved this includes watching
the passing scene rather than talking or doing since the mid 1970s urban theorists have conceived various triadic relationships
that established a common understanding of places canter 1977 developed an understanding of the
constituents of place which include psychological conceptions physical
attributes and actions and behaviours punter 1991 introduced mental image form and activity while
mongomery 1998 discussed factors
that generate a sense of place involving meaning physical setting and activity
post pandemic urban design would need to emphasise factors relevant to spatial
proximity as it relates to health in order to limit the potential spread of
viruses or reacting to peoples awareness of it this could eventually
lead to altering the triadic relationships which were part of urban discourse
for several decades social distancing guidelines coupled with operating in a post pandemic virtual world
will instigate new living and working patterns which will result in different
spatial requirements and place standards to understand the spatiality of these
dynamics it is crucial to relate to the body of knowledge developed within social
sciences  adler et al
1987 which has significant implications on the notion of place as a
human product involving human choices following giddens 1984 and pred
1984 these products and choices are based on factors relevant to how
different elements of a society interact and a critical understanding of people
organisations agencies and the power that each element of a society has this
understanding can be further elaborated based on ethnographic and anthropological
perspectives as they relate to the built environment  salama 2011 salama
et al 2017b from an ethnographic perspective the concept of life-mode  hojrup 2003 offers insights into the understanding that
human values are constrained by cultural-relational dialectics and are products of
cultural life modes which can be classified according to work styles self-employed
mode wage-earner mode and career-oriented mode from an anthropological
perspective douglas 1996 discusses a
life style scheme that relates to attitudes rather than work these attitudes can be
envisaged as sub-cultures that include competition and individualism isolation and
avoidance of social controls equity and negotiation and hierarchical communities
the two perspectives have direct spatial implications on how post pandemic emerging
patterns of living and working will be spatially accommodated the spatial implications resulting from the two perspectives can be extrapolated when
looking at various manifestations of the home environment and home choices  salama 2011 in terms of work the
self-employed life mode is where means of production are owned and included within
the house this means that the home environment is conceived as an integrated living
and working place where work time and spare time are not separated the wage-earner
life mode means that the home environment is regarded as either a primary place
serving recreational purposes or a place where important spare-time family or
personal activities are undertaken the career-oriented life mode means that the
home environment reflects the personal progress position social status and past
and recent experiences additionally the notion of sub-cultures determines housing
preference based on social attitudes especially isolation and avoidance of social
control and will manifest in post pandemic housing choices including preferred
aspects related to the house integration within the neighbourhood and the overall
house size and image whether work-based or status- and attitude-based the spatial attributes of home and
work environments post pandemic should be seen as a product of distancing measures
and of operating in a virtualdigital world which will instigate new living and
working patterns these implications will influence the existing housing stock and
working places which will require appropriation and adaptation and the new
developments of home and work environments requiring new standards and
specifications the public health catastrophe caused by coronavirus and the rapid spread of covid-19
disease has significant impacts on societies and cities around the world the
trans-disciplinary conceptual framework utilised for analysing urban and
socio-spatial implications of covid-19 measures reveals important insights into the
factors that will impact future education research and practice of architecture
and urban design and planning these factors act as a base for potential
contributions of architecture and urbanism as academic disciplines and professions
to develop new insights into the impact of a pandemic on cities and urban
environments and the socio-spatial implications of covid-19 measures and guidelines
immediate research areas were classified under three key areas urban dynamics
during and post covid-19 socio-spatial implications of distancing measures and the
requirements of the new spatial environments to accommodate post pandemic emerging
living and working patterns  figure 2 as the
spread of covid-19 has influenced individuals communities organisations and
governments its impacts will be on every level and scale from global networks and
infrastructure to global cities and urban regions and from residential
neighbourhoods and public spaces to home and work environments and will continue
for many years to come according to forsyth 2020 
the current pandemic brings the question of designing for infectious
diseases back to the forefront however and raises important questions for
future research and practice therefore the development of
healthy environments must be central to architecture and urbanism in the future
despite that health does seem to be absent within the education and practice of
architecture and urban design and planning professions forsyth 2020 asserts this view and argues 
for the past decades those looking at the intersections of planning
design and public health have focused less on infectious diseases and more on
chronic disease hazards and disasters and the vulnerable
rice 2019 maintains that the design
of the built environment is a determinant of health and thus there is an increasing
need for greater synergy between architectural and urban education research and
practice and public health the spread of the disease generated a condition which is labelled as the new normal
resulting from social distancing measures and is characterised by human detachment
isolation and engagement in a virtual world coupled with an emphasis on working
from home through the utilisation of information and telecommunication technologies
the acceptability of the new normal as a result of attempting to limit the disease
spread appears to be a catalyst for a future stable condition the actual normal
while addressing health in a post pandemic virtual world negative consequences
emerge where many people around the world will be living and working in confined
spaces surrounded by gigantic cities and massive high-rise agglomerations the new normal  to be the actual normal  was foretold in the writings
of theorists in architecture and urbanism manuel castells in his book the rise of the network society economy society
and culture 2000 developed a methodical theory of the information
society which is based on the overpowering impacts of information technology in a
contemporary global world his assumption that the global city is not necessarily a
place but a process seems to manifest in the future stable condition the visionary
trilogy of the late william mitchell is clear evidence that the actual normal
represents the prospects of societies and cities the stable condition of the actual normal is palpable in the city of
bits  mitchell 1995 where
mitchell examines architecture and urbanism in the context of the digital
telecommunications revolution the continuing miniaturization of electronics the
commodification of bits and the growing domination of the digital over the
physical in the e-topia 1999 mitchell
examines the way in which an electronically connected world will shape cities of the
future and the associated urban relationships with a focus on digital
infrastructure and its implications for future daily lives mitchell asserts that we
must extend the definitions of architecture and urban design to integrate virtual
places as well as physical ones and interconnection by means of telecommunication
links as well as by pedestrian circulation and mechanized transportation systems he
proposes strategies for the creation of cities that not only will be sustainable but
also will make economic social and cultural sense in an electronically
interconnected and global world while this conceptualisation would seem an
imaginary future it appears now as a representation of the stable condition of the
actual normal mitchells book me the
cyborg self and the networked city 2003 answers the question of how the
transformation of wireless technology and the creation of an interconnected world
are changing our environment and our lives he argues a world governed less and less
by boundaries and more and more by connections requires the reconstruction of our
environment and our cities and reconsideration of the ethical foundations of
architecture urbanism and allied disciplines in a transition period called the new normal which will eventually become a stable
condition of the actual normal societies communities and individuals appear to be
at odds speculating the future that future seems to have already arrived at our
doorsteps perhaps forcefully perhaps arbitrarily perhaps in a shock and
awe manner but surely at the expense of disease panic mental illness and
death no data are associated with this article  augmenting contact matrices with time-use data for fine-grained intervention modelling of disease dynamics a modelling analysis edwin van leeuwen frank sandmann  background social distancing is an important public health intervention to reduce or interrupt the sustained community transmission of emerging infectious pathogens such as sars-cov-2 during the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic we aimed to explore the impact on the epidemic curve of fewer contacts when individuals reduce the time they spend on selected daily activities methods we combined the large-scale empirical data of a social contact survey and a time-use survey to estimate contact matrices by age group 0-15 16-24 25-44 45-64 65 and daily activity work schooling transportation and four leisure activities social visits barcaferestaurant visits park visits and non-essential shopping we assumed that reductions in time are proportional to reductions in contacts the derived matrices were then applied in an agestructured dynamic-transmission model of covid-19 to explore the effects findings the relative reductions in the derived contact matrices were highest when closing schools in ages 0-14 years workplaces 15-64 years and stopping social visits 65 years for covid-19 the closure of workplaces schools and stopping social visits had the largest impact on

no language restrictions we found several studies that used time-use data to re-create contact matrices based on time spent in similar locations or to calculate the length of exposure we identified no study that augmented social contact matrices with time-use data to estimate the impact on transmission dynamics of reducing selected social activities and lifting these restrictions again as seen during the covid-19 pandemic our study combines the empirical data of two large-scale representative surveys to derive social contact matrices that enrich the frequency of contacts with the duration of exposure for selected social activities which allows for more fine-grained mixing patterns and infectious disease modelling we successfully applied the resulting matrices to estimate reductions in contacts from social distancing measures such as adopted during the covid-19 pandemic as well as the effect on the epidemic curve from increased social contacts when lifting such restrictions again social distancing measures are an important public health intervention to limit the close-contact transmission of emerging infectious pathogens by reducing the social mixing of individuals our model findings suggest a higher fraction of close-contact transmission occurs at work schools and social visits than from visits to parks barscafesrestaurants and non-essential shopping the minimal predicted impact is suggestive of lifting the restrictions on certain activities and excluding them from the list of social distancing measures unless required to maintain sufficient healthcare capacity however potential replacement effects of activities and in mixing patterns remain unclear particularly immediately after re-allowing social activities again social contacts between individuals in close physical proximity drive the transmission dynamics of many respiratory infections such as influenza virus and coronavirus 1 2  in community outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases such as with the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic social distancing measures are an important public health intervention note that we use the term social distancing in line with convention however it aims at avoiding physical contacts only while other non-physical interactions via information and communication technologies are encouraged 3  measures of social distancing aim to reduce or interrupt the spread between individuals of unknown infection status by reducing the mixing of populations 3  individuals are requested to make fewer and shorter contacts by changing their daily activities and the locations at which they spend their time contact matrices are typically used when evaluating such public health interventions as they account for the heterogeneity in mixing of individuals in a n  n matrix with n equal to the number of different age groups 4  empirical contact matrices are derived from contact surveys which collect data on the frequency and location of social interactions between individuals by age with some collecting limited information on the duration too 5  however these matrices often lack detailed information on the time individuals spend on daily activities and the covid-19 pandemic highlighted the need for a more fine-grained modelling of contact patterns 6  in contrast to contact surveys time-use surveys collect information on how much time individuals spend per day on a wide range of social activities at what location and with some limited information on with whom 7  previous studies have used time use data to re-create contact matrices based on time spent in similar locations 8 9 or used time-use data to calculate the length of exposure 10  this study combined both data sets to estimate number of contacts per activity and we applied the resulting matrices to estimate reductions in contacts from social distancing measures as adopted during the covid-19 pandemic this study aimed to augment existing social contact matrices with timeuse data to estimate the effect of social distancing measures for the number of contacts per day when reducing the time spend on selected daily activities some of which are considered to be non-essential the derived contact matrices were based on the empirical data of two large-scale population-wide surveys allowing for more fine-grained intervention modelling afterwards we applied the derived contact matrices in a dynamic-transmission model to explore the impact on the covid-19 pandemic which was characterised by many countries with sustained community transmission adopting wide scale social distancing measures at population-level 3 11 12  3  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has

datasets that included information on the agemixing patterns of individual contacts by location and daily activity the contact matrices were obtained from the polymod study 13  which was a nationally-representative social contact survey that collected data on the frequency duration type physical or non-physical and location home work school leisure transport or other of social interactions in 7290 individuals for each of their 97904 contacts in eight european countries in 2005-2006 participants filled out a diary for 24 hours on a randomly selected weekday or weekend day recording physical skin-to-skin contacts eg a kiss or a handshake versus non-physical contacts a two-way conversation of more than two words without skin-to-skin contact the age-mixing patterns were similar across countries and revealed a strong assortativeness ie individuals spend more time with others of their same age 13  individual time-use data were obtained from the united kingdom time use survey uktus 14  which was a nationally-representative survey that collected data on the frequency duration and location of a wide range of daily activities in 16550 diary entries of 9388 individuals aged 8 years from the uk in 2014-2015 and whether activities were spent alone or with others participants were asked to complete diaries for 24 hours on two randomly selected days one on a weekday one on a weekend day recording sequences of activities at intervals of 10 minutes 14  all activities in the time use survey were grouped according to codes these codes were then associated with certain polymod locations and activities using table s1 in the supplementary materials contact studies such as polymod measure the number of contacts k ilj  by age group i and location of the participant l and the contacts age group j time-use surveys such as the uktus measure the time t ial  spent by age group i activity a and location l this makes it possible to estimate the contact by activity and location as follows with  ial the activity weight for age group i activity a at location l t ial is the average time spent by an individual a is the set of activities and w ial is an activity specific weight which reflects the relative number of people met during this activity compared to other activities at the same location most weights will be kept equal to 1 unless specified otherwise we considered five age groups 0-15 16-24 25-44 45-64 65 as well as the six locations used in polymod home work school leisure transport or other the selected daily activities with potential for non-essential close physical 4  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the

visits ie visiting other peoples home and receiving visitors in ones own home as part of celebrations and social life barcaferestaurant visits park visits and non-essential shopping for a full list of the codes used to map activities to locations see table s1 in the supplementary materials when an individual changes the relative time spent on an activity r ial  while everyone elses behaviour stays the same the weight changes relative to the change in time  ial  r ial  ial  of course in reality the behaviour of the contact will also have changed and this also influences the probability of a contact during that activity and at that location this is further complicated by the fact that the activity and location of the contact can be distinct from the activity and location of the participant for example in a restaurant the staffs location and activity would be work while the patrons location and activity would be leisure and restaurant the changes in the contacts behaviour at the participants activity a and location l  alj  therefore could be distinct from changes in the participants behaviour  ial  still this behaviour is likely to be proportional eg if fewer people go to a restaurant then the restaurant will also reduce its number of staff furthermore for most contacts the activities and locations will likely be the same for this study we thus assume that the contacts change in behaviour is in line with changes of behaviour relevant for that activity location and the contacts age group ie alj  jal  under the assumptions above when an encounter happens at random then the probability of the encounter occurring is relative to the reduction of activity by both individuals as follows ialjal  if the encounter is initiated by either individual and we assume that either contact is 50 percent likely to be the initiator then the probability is 1 2  ial  jal  therefore we also need to know the fraction of contacts that were initiated by one of the individuals compared to being at random q al  the new probability following changed activity is therefore equal t  using the estimated change in the number of contacts the contact matrix can then be calculated as follows as less time is spent on certain activities more time will be spent doing other activities for this study we assume that the replacement activities mostly do not increase the number of contacts partly because they would be spent alone exercise or at homewith members of the household while extra time spent at home would increase the number of contact events most of those encounters will be with other members of the household and therefore the number of unique contacts will not increase linearly to reflect this distinction we assumed the number of contacts in the household is independent of the extra time spent there  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted june 5 2020  the potential effect of the reduced contacts following social distancing interventions was explored by using the derived contact matrices as part of an epidemiological dynamic-transmission model epidemiological disease dynamics of covid-19 were modelled using an age stratified seeiir model which was based on models used in influenza modelling 15 16 and the latent and infectious periods were assumed to be 46 and 5 days long respectively in line with estimates for sars-cov-2 17  the basic reproductive number r 0  was assumed to be 28 this age-stratified model made it possible to estimate the effect of changes in the incidence when the time spent performing certain activities is being changed and to explore the impact on specific at-risk individuals such as the elderly aged 65 years we present the results of two main scenarios first to examine the contribution of different activities to transmission we allowed all but one activity to continue second allowing individual activities to resume again while all other activities continue to be reduced table 1 shows the relative contribution of each activity to the contacts at the polymod locations calculated using  social visits were the most important leisure activity regardless of age bars cafes and restaurants are the second most important leisure activity except in children where indoors exercise is more important the results also showed that a large share of the time spend on transport is linked to school and work activities therefore if school and work activities were reduced then this will also have a considerable impact on the contact pattern during transport using the results from table 1 it was possible to calculate the difference in the contact matrix if certain activities were reduced figure 1 highlights the impact of stopping these activities on the contact matrix closing schools clearly had the highest relative effect on contacts in the young age groups ages 0-24 years but still had effect on the number of contacts in adults as well work had by far the highest effect in adults aged 16-64 years if we focus on the elderly age group then reducing social visits had the highest impact on reduced contacts when using the derived contact matrices in the epidemiological model for covid-19 results were consistent in that the three activities that had the largest impact on reducing the epidemic curve and delaying its peak were school work and social visits figure 2 and figure 3  the exact impact of each activity depended on whether we used physical contacts only right columns or all contacts figure 2 and figure 3  for physical contacts social visits had a larger impact than work especially in the elderly population in the elderly the reduction in peak height is similar between stopping visits and closing schools but closing schools would slow down the epidemic more looking at all contacts work had the largest impact on peak height this difference is probably because contacts at work were more likely 6  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who

shopping had the least impact but the impact was still significant as illustrated best when re-allowing only those activities figure 3  social distancing is an important public health intervention to reduce or interrupt the sustained transmission of emerging infectious pathogens for which close contact and the social contact mixing patterns of communities drives the spread 2 18 19  the covid-19 pandemic highlighted the need for a more fine-grained modelling of contact patterns to capture the impact of reducing or stopping selected daily activities possibly involving non-essential physical human contact our findings for the augmented contact matrices showed the highest relative effect on reducing physical contacts for children and young adults aged 0-24 years when spending less time at schoolsinstitutes of higher learning which also still reduces contacts in adults who may take younger children to school for adults aged 25-64 years closing workplaces has by far the highest effect on reducing physical contacts for the elderly aged 65 years reducing the number of social visits has the highest impact on reduced contacts with a comparable reduction also in adolescents and young adults aged 16-24 years reductions of contacts were largely assortative by age except for non-essential shopping where reductions are slightly higher between ages 25-64 years and those aged 65 years these findings mirror in part the underlying contact matrices which were also highly assortative by age 13  the dynamic-transmission model results suggest a higher fraction of closecontact transmission at workplaces schools and social visits than from visits to parks barscafesrestaurants and non-essential shopping the largest impact on reducing the epidemic curve and delaying its peak was achieved when implementing all social distancing measures followed by reducing work schooling and social visits when looking at the subset of physical contacts only the order changes to school social visits and working possibly due to less physical contact and shorter duration of contacts while working these results do depend on the assumption that the number of contacts in each activity is proportional to the time spent on that activity this assumption might well be violated for certain activities such as going to barscafes or restaurants where the number of contacts per time spent could be significantly higher than in other leisure activities if more fine grained data was available then the method presented here could accommodate such concerns by changing the activity specific weight these findings are in line with the modelled benefits from workplace distancing and school closures in the early stages of covid-19 in singapore and china 6 20  studies of previous pandemics also found that eg the early sustained and layered application of school closures and cancellation of public gatherings during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic were significantly associated with reductions in weekly excess deaths and delays in reaching peak mortality in the usa 21   cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted june 5 2020  obviously not all factors of influenza epidemics particularly from over a century ago will be present or relevant in the currently ongoing coronavirus pandemic most notably a certain degree of pre-existing immunity in older adults and the availability of anti-virals and vaccines 22 23  during the previous coronavirus sars-cov pandemic in 2003 extensive measures of social distancing were also implemented in areas with widespread suspected community transmission including closing schools theatres and public facilities as well as cancelling public mass gatherings the combined effect led to dramatic declines in new sars-cov cases 18  nonetheless the isolated impact of these measures remains unclear as they were adopted simultaneously and combined with other measures of enhanced contact tracing increased hygiene and requiring face masks for individuals using public transport working in restaurants or entering healthcare facilities 18  moreover the 2003 sars-cov outbreak may differ epidemiologically from the 2019 sars-cov-2 pandemic due to eg no pre-symptomatic transmission having been observed for the 2003 strain emergence 18  while a potential issue with sars-cov-2 24  furthermore transmission of the 2003 sars-cov strain was primarily in healthcare or household settings 25  which are characterised by close person-toperson contact 18  while the 2019 sars-cov-2 pandemic is characterised by widespread community transmission in a growing number of countries 3  taken together the empirical evidence for the effectiveness in reducing transmission of non-pharmaceutical interventions is heterogeneous 26 27 28  our findings that the predicted impact of fewer contacts in parks barscafesrestaurants and non-essential shopping is small is suggestive of excluding these activities from the list of social distancing measures however reducing these activities may nonetheless be required if otherwise eg healthcare capacity is exceeded 29  where every little impact helps ease the pressure on services it may thus be in the best interest of the public to not completely lift social distancing measures too early as that may inadvertently initiate an immediate second epidemic wave as seen eg in the 1957 influenza pandemic when schools in the northern hemisphere were re-opened after the summer holidays 19  furthermore we were unable to account for substitution effects in the time use and activities of individuals when reducing or stopping one activity and turning instead to another which could possibly lead to increased numbers of contacts previous studies on school closures found eg shifting mixing patterns of children to other non-school settings and highlighted the need for physical distancing as much as possible 30 31  at high rates of compliance however the derived matrices would not need to be adjusted further nonetheless mixing patterns and time-use may change immediately after re-allowing social activities for a short time which may pose increased transmission risks especially in crowded environments indoors that may not be covid-19-secure and if individuals chose to spend longer durations than usual at leisure activities such as bar visits a related concern is the potentially impaired judgment of individuals following alcohol consumption one crucial aspect to achieving widespread compliance with social distancing measures is the risk perception and the risk communication individuals who understand the relationship of the transmission risk from direct 12  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display

resulting contact matrices in a dynamictransmission model to explore the impact of social distancing measures adopted during the covid-19 pandemic 3 11 12  augmenting the social contact matrices with time-use data has enriched the frequency of contacts with the duration of exposure in the derived matrices which allows for more fine-grained mixing patterns than conventionally used 6 13 34  these findings from the augmented contact matrices will be more broadly applicable to newly emerging infectious pathogens whose spread is highly dependent on the social contact mixing patterns of communities including influenza pandemics our application to infections with sars-cov-2 causing covid-19 illustrated the impact of reducing social contacts and when lifting these restrictions again future pandemics however will require suitably adapted models that are tailored to the epidemiology of that pandemic pathogen and the disease it causes although additional information is elicited in both surveys we considered them the most robust for their main purpose social contacts and the timeuse per day furthermore a significant amount of transport is linked in the data to school and work activities and reductions will thus likewise impact transportation we cannot rule out that some activities were misclassified however for instance the number of contacts in bars may relate just to the group of individuals with whom someone went there instead of all individuals in close physical proximity also both datasets grouped data under unspecified locations and activities that could not be used directly about 16000 contacts ie 16 of all contacts occurred in other places in polymod while 06-08 hours per day were unspecified in uktus when using our list of coding see table s1  given the likely inverse relationship of the number and intensity of contacts 35  however the impact on results may be minimal moreover without knowing the amount of contacts a particular worker has we cannot account for some complicated interactions eg if people go less often to the shop then shop employees will also meet fewer people for as long as the shops stay open altogether we also assumed a proportional reduction in the risk of infection by number of contacts which is a frequently made assumption but not necessarily true 35  moreover transmission risks may be reduced when contacts keep a larger physical distance all of these considerations point towards the importance of conducting additional empirical research into how where and with whom individuals spent their time during pandemics and the behavioural changes that may be expected in mixing patterns as a consequence of social distancing measures when adopted and after lifting restrictions again we also focused on contact matrices from empirical surveys as the predominant method emerging of parameterising social contacts in public health intervention modelling in at least a decade 5  although empirical diary data may suffer from recall bias and reporting inaccuracies all other methods have their 13  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to

polymod and the uktus is illustrative of using social contact matrices and time-use data in general which are widely used and available internationally and largely harmonised 7  allowing to repeat our methods in different settings furthermore others have successfully applied time-use data in epidemiological modelling 8 9 10  or reduced contact matrices by scaling factors to simulate behavioural changes in mixing 36  our study improves our understanding of how time-use data and mixing patterns can be combined to understand when and where transmission occurs and which activities are to be targeted in response to social distancing measures such as adopted in many countries for the covid-19 pandemic 3 11 12  our study was concerned with social distancing measures adopted domestically in populations with widespread community transmission hence we ignored measures such as increased hygiene and personal protective equipment case findings approaches or international flight restrictions

phillip singer  social distancing policies are critical but economically painful measures to flatten the curve against emergent infectious diseases as the novel coronavirus that causes covid-19 spread throughout the united states in early 2020 the federal government issued social distancing recommendations but left to the states the most difficult and consequential decisions restricting behavior such as canceling events closing schools and businesses and issuing stay-at-home orders we present an original dataset of state-level social distancing policy responses to the epidemic and explore how political partisanship covid-19 caseload and policy diffusion explain the timing of governors decisions to mandate social distancing an event history analysis of five social distancing policies across all fifty states reveals the most important predictors are political all else equal republican governors and governors from states with more trump supporters were slower to adopt social distancing policies these delays are likely to produce significant on-going harm to public health for helpful comments and suggestions and erika steiskal for graphic design assistance state social distancing data are available at httpcovid19statepolicyorg  social distancing or practices which reduce the probability of contact between infected and non-infected people has emerged as the primary tool for reducing the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes covid-191 2 3 as of march 2020 other methods for fighting infectious disease are mostly unavailable or ineffective due to the characteristics of this pathogen 1 it is an emergent virus to which there is no pre-existing immunity available vaccine or proven treatment 2 it spreads easily through human contact and airborne droplets leading to exponential growth in cases and 3 those affected may be contagious during a prolonged asymptomatic incubation period and many never develop symptoms distinctive from a mild flu making it difficult to identify and isolate the infected before they pass the virus to others 4 broad public mandates for social distancing are also vital to help manage a key multiplier of covid-19 fatality rates a substantial fraction of patients require lengthy on average 8 bed days intensive care unit icu support to survive acute respiratory distress and uncontrolled spread of the disease is expected to generate at its peak far greater demand for icu care than existing capacity can meet5 2 6 public health experts have pleaded with officials to quickly mandate social distancing to flatten the curve of coronavirus infections -that is reduce the peak caseload -before exponential case growth leads to hundreds of thousands or millions of deaths in particular it is important to keep peak levels low to prevent the fatality rate from rising to the levels seen in areas where hospitals are overwhelmed with cases 7 in the united states the emergence of the coronavirus has created a natural experiment in which elected officials face incredibly urgent and far-reaching policy decisions for which they typically have no personal experience or expertise and for which the history of policy examples is either mere days old or so dated as to be largely unknown except by public health experts the most significant policy decisions of this kindboth in terms of their potential to mitigate the epidemic and their economic consequences -are mandates for social distancing through restrictions on public gatherings closure or restriction of schools restaurants and other non-essential businesses and orders for the public to stay at home 8 under the federal and state constitutions the key actions fall to executives and particularly to governors whose powers in public health emergencies are typically singular and extensive in particular the exponential growth of cases of an emergent virus has unique implications for policy making estimates of the uncontrolled doubling-time of covid-19 cases vary and are complicated by the slow rollout of effective testing in the us but many studies find doubling times in the range from four to seven days9 10 3 2 these estimates correspond to alarming growth rates of 104 to 260 per day even if the true doubling time of infections prior to social distancing is as long as a week delaying these measures just three days would all else equal raise the eventual peak number of cases by more than 30 potentially increasing total deaths by thousands or more in a given state evidence from the 1918 influenza pandemic underscores the stakes for elected officials in that earlier natural experiment american cities faced similar decisions regarding social distancing policies for example philadelphia decided to hold a parade welcoming soldiers returning from world war i while st louis cancelled its parade and ultimately experienced one eighth as many deaths per capita during that wave of influenza the height of the infection in saint louis was two months later than in philadelphia and was far lower with deaths peaking at fifty per hundred thousand rather than 250 per hundred thousand11 12 shortly after community transmission of the coronavirus was discovered in washington and california in late february 2020 public health experts drew the comparison between philadelphia and saint louis hoping to inspire policymakers to promote social distancing nevertheless in an echo of the decisions made a century before there are significant differences in the timing of governors decisions to mandate social distancing for instance on 6 march 2020 after kentucky had its first confirmed case of covid-19 governor andy beshear d immediately called a state of emergency encouraged social distancing and closed bars and restaurants ten days later but when neighboring tennesse uncovered its first confirmed case of covid-19 on march 5th governor bill lee r waited until 12 march to declare a state of emergency and finally closed restaurants and bars on 22 march 13 why did governors responses to a sudden shared threat differ under normal circumstances governors policy decisions are shaped by the national leaders and agenda of their political party and the demands of their own constituents particularly those in their partisan base governors may also look to innovative peers and neighbors for examples to follow but the fast-moving nature of the coronavirus threat the need to rely on experts to understand complex scientific material and uncertainty about the nature and scope of the threat might scramble all or some of these usual motivations pandemic politics  adolph amano bang-jensen fullman  wilkerson the public health case for mandatory social distancing in the united states developed quickly in the wake of the first reports of community transmission on 26 february in washington state one might expect social distancing measures to quickly follow across the fifty states perhaps more quickly in states with greater number of confirmed cases but mandating social distancing is a difficult decision for any political leader if these measures are successful in preventing widespread mortality many members of the public who suffered the costs of these mandates may never fully comprehend the benefits indeed the more successful the intervention the more likely it will appear to many as an overreaction moreover some states faced higher potential costs from these policies closing schools is more painful in states where more children depend on schools for subsidized lunches and shutting restaurants and public places is more difficult in states highly dependent on tourism 14 more generally states with more limited economic resources are likely far less able to weather the deprivations caused by economic shutdowns or to expand social insurance protections during mandated social distancing and thus may be considerably more reluctant to take these steps but the greatest barrier to swift social distancing measures seems political numerous surveys have found significant partisan divides in public opinion about the severity of the coronavirus threat 15 16 countering the message from public health leaders the white house downplayed covid-19 on 4 march 2020 president trump insisted that covid-19 was similar to the flu two days later he falsely claimed the situation in italy was improving and that the us was handling coronavirus much better than other industrialized countries as late as 15 march 2020 with reported cases rising rapidly trump still maintained that the epidemic within the us was under control17 similar messages filled news sources relied on by republican voters fox business host trish reagan insisted the pandemic warnings were a democratic hoax and another effort to impeach the president while sean hannity another fox news personality validated the conspiracy theory that coronavirus was an effort by the deep state to manipulate markets suppress dissent and push mandated medicines 18 for governors already reluctant to impose draconian measures this messaging both provided cover for inaction and may have reduced public support particularly among republican voters and as social distancing measures have spread republican leaders including trump have been more vocal in their desire to quickly rollback these measures to restore the economy moving beyond general impressions of the determinants of social distancing poses challenges states with democratic governors and voters tend to be both richer than republican states and to be more urban and coastal the seemingly quicker action of pandemic politics  adolph amano bang-jensen fullman  wilkerson blue states could simply be a result of the coronavirus first emerging in cities like seattle san francisco and new york as well as in states better able to endure prolonged social distancing mandates likewise disentangling the role of republican governors from republican voters is challenging though some blue states like maryland have republican governors and vice versa to investigate why some states acted quickly to implement social distancing while others took longer we identified five critical areas of social distancing policy -recommendations and restrictions against public gatherings mandatory school closures restrictions on the normal operation of restaurants closure of non-essential businesses and stay-at-home orders -and collected the dates each state first announced such measures our primary objective is to explain the variation in timing of these measures across states using an event history analysis this approach allows us to statistically separate the impact of having a republican governor or a republican electorate from a series of potential confounders including the number of confirmed covid-19 cases in the state state income and cases and policies in neighboring states our findings are unambiguous political variables are the strongest predictor of the early adoption of social distancing policies all else equal states with republican governors and republican electorates delayed each social distancing measure by an average of 270 days 95 ci 249 to 288 a far larger effect than any other factor including state income per capita the percentage of neighboring states with mandates or even confirmed cases in each state we study state social distancing measures enacted over the period from the first reported case of transmission in the us on 26 february 2020 up through 23 march 2020 at which point all states had at least one social distancing policy 1 to capture variation in these policies across states over time we draw on data compiled by the national governors association nga which we verified and further documented by collect- 1 we consider the first community transmission in the us more epidemiologically and politically relevant than initial reported transmission in each state at the time of first community transmission in the us virologists including trevor bedford suggested this strain had been circulating in washington state since mid-january 19 given scarce and unreliable testing governors faced a choice to either take immediate action as national cases increased or wait for potentially belated reports of in-state cases we prefer to treat the decision to wait for a confirmed case as something to be explained and so control for confirmed in-state cases in our model  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a display the preprint in perpetuity is the authorfunder who

among differences in state classifications of essential and non-essential businesses which differ by state 5 stay-at-home orders this coding includes mandates to stay at home but not advisory orders that recommend that citizens remain at home although we also coded implementation dates for each of these policies our focus is on the dates policies were announced for two reasons first we expect much of the effect of these emergency measures on social behavior to be immediate the states power to compel socially responsible behavior is often said to act through quasi-voluntary compliance in which most citizens choose pro-social behaviors given a cue from the state that is backed with the threat of sanction 21 this effect should be all the stronger to the extent people treat costly social distancing measures as a credible signal of the viral threat second our focus is on predicting the timing of governors actions which naturally points to announcement dates rather than implementation dates which may be delayed in the case of school closures for example by weekends and spring breaks figure 1 displays the timing of different states adoptions of these five social distancing policies over the four-week study period no state acted before 10 march a full thirteen days after the first report of community transmission yet by 15 march uptake was rapid across states in general states typically started social distancing through recommendations or restrictions on public gatherings then turned to restrictions on schools 2 we include recommendations in this category for two reasons first this was often the first action states took and early actors did not always revisit these policies with a restrictive mandate second the target of these measures was typically large events that would be unlikely to maintain viable attendance under the cloud of a state recommendation to cancel events  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a display the preprint in

social distancing measures as well as the presence of a substantial number of laggard states still lacking most social distancing policies as late as 23 march 2020 we estimate an event history model to predict the timing of implementing social distancing directives across us states from 26 february 2020 to 23 march 2020 3 we model the likelihood that a state will implement each social distancing policy as a function of time measured in days with a pooled stratified cox proportional hazards model often referred to as the wei-lin-weissfeld marginal model 22 in our application this approach allows us to examine the common factors affecting implementation of social distancing across states by 1 pooling the five social distancing measures shown in figure 1 in a single model 2 stratifying baseline hazards across the five policy types to allow for varying underlying tendencies to adopt some policies more quickly than others and 3 clustering standard errors by state as usual the cox model allows us to estimate a baseline hazard rate which shifts in proportion to changes in covariates and accommodates right-censored cases states that have not yet adopted a given social distancing measure at the end of the study period the baseline hazard rate also captures any purely national trends such as the common tendency of states to adopt social distancing policies as national deaths climb or public awareness of covid-19 increases while leaving cross-state variation to be explained by covariates we expect state level responses to vary based on differences in social economic and political costs we include five covariates in our baseline model is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to which was not peer-reviewed preprint the copyright holder for this

trump-voting electorates on average these states endured a combined partisan delay of 270 days 95 ci 249 to 288 barring positive developments in the fight against covid-19 the public health impact of this delay is likely to be massive in a state where coronavirus infections are doubling every seven days this would raise the peak caseload by 306 in a state where infections are doubling every three days republican partisanship might raise the peak level of cases by 866 confirmed state-level caseload had only a small effect on social distancing timing controlling for partisanship the number of confirmed covid-19 cases in a state had only a small effect on the implementation of social distancing measures we emphasize this measure captures state-level cases the total national cases are captured non-parametrically by the baseline hazard to show just how small this effect is we compare a state with just four confirmed cases the median among all state-days in our study period to a state with 426 cases the 95th percentile the state with fewer cases was just 122 95 ci 65 to 178 less likely to implement social distancing on a given day for a cumulative delay of just 038 days 95 ci 036 to 041 while many of the early epicenters were democratic-leaning states it does not appear that the more aggressive action of democratic states is a simple function of caseload 5 this is from a public health perspective a fairly reasonable result early implementation of social distancing is likely to be far more effective so pro-active governors may have realized there was little sense in waiting for a certain threshold of cases to act especially given delays and failures in testing poorer states are less likely to adopt social distancing policies all else equal states at the 25th percentile of gross state product per capita were 262 95 ci 58 to 428 less likely to implement social distancing than states at the 75th percentile which translates 5 the partisan result does not

governor social distancing delays due to limited state economic resources are particularly troubling as poorer states may also have larger vulnerable populations and more fragile health systems neighboring state actions increase the likelihood of social distancing policy as in other policy areas governors may look to their peers to determine appropriate action the policy diffusion literature suggests different ways to determine each states peer group because the coronavirus spreads spatially we focus on actions by neighboring states and estimate the likelihood a state will implement a specific kind of social distancing as a function of the percentage of contiguous states also mandating that policy we find that a state with no neighbors adopting a given policy was 320 95 ci 84 to 508 less likely to adopt it than a state with 50 or more of its neighbors adopting that policy this corresponds to a delay of 120 days 95 ci 113 to 126 investigation of other possible mechanisms -including policy diffusion based on the number of confirmed covid-19 cases in neighboring states or based on the actions of peers a given state typically looks to for policy innovations -failed to uncover additional patterns of diffusion we speculate that actions by neighboring states may grant cover to governors to take similar actions28 in this paper we focused on decisions by governors who through the structure of us and state constitutions and the abdication of presidential leadership found themselves on the frontlines of the battle against covid-19 future research should consider the role of local governments but in march 2020 it was often governors who led their states -or allowed them to fall behind why do republican governors and states with republican voters seem to resist social distancing policy even controlling for many potential confounders we strongly believe that realistic assessments of decision-making by elected officials must take electoral motivations and career ambitions seriously -as impolitic as that may be elected officials regardless of party must be responsive to the concerns of their voters and party leaders however this essential feature of democratic representation does not inevitably produce the best policy outcome where the early stages of the covid-19 pandemic were concerned republicans had fewer incentives to act quickly than

voters were more likely than democrats to incorrectly assume that the covid-19 fatality rate and disease burden was effectively the same as the flu15 third partisans worldviews are shaped by cues provided by their leaders 34 in the early stages of the us pandemic president trump strongly signaled in press conference and on social media that the coronavirus was an exaggerated threat or even a hoax a position that was magnified and reinforced by republican-leaning media outlets finally republican officials almost surely considered the possibility of reprisals -both to their political careers and discretionary federal assistance to their states -from a president who frequently attacks members of his own party that he perceives to be disloyal 41 42 43 to be clear we are not arguing that politics was the sole motivation behind governors social distancing decisions our results suggest otherwise however we do believe that the political headwinds were significantly greater for republican governors in republican leaning states it is likely that governors will face this difficult decision again governors may choose to roll back social distancing at different points in time some experts contend that authorities will need to alternate between two months of social distancing and one month of restored freedoms to reduce the likelihood that health systems are overwhelmed by severe cases until a vaccine is developed produced and circulated 3 44 this implies state governments will be asked to impose difficult social distancing policies not once but many times each instance will be a test of whether states can act promptly to prevent covid-19 cases from peaking at unmanageable levels if republican governors and states with republican majorities continue to lag behind the

study louis gagnon stephanie gagnon jessica lloyd  phone number 613-533-6707 background to date no study has examined the effectiveness of social distancing while controlling for social mobility and social distancing restrictions in the united states we utilize the quasi-experimental setting created by the nationwide protests precipitated by george floyds tragic death on may 25 2020 to assess the causal impact of social distancing on the spread of sars-cov-2 methods our sample period spans from january 22 2020 to june 20 2020 and consists of 474422 county-days representing 3142 counties from all 50 states and the district of columbia to assess the change in covid-19 case counts following the protests we employ a differences-in-differences estimation strategy in a multivariate setting in which we control for social distancing restrictions and social mobility across counties we also control for covariates that may influence sars-cov-2 transmission and implement placebo tests using a monte carlo simulation findings we document a country-wide increase of over 306 cases per day per 100000 population following the onset of the protests 95ci 247-365 and a further increase of 173 cases per day per 100000 population in the counties in which the protests took place 95ci 059-287 relative to the week preceding the onset of the protests this represents a 612 country-wide increase in covid-19 cases and a further 346 increase in the protest counties interpretation our study documents a significant increase in covid-19 case counts in counties that experienced a protest and we conclude that social distancing practices causally impact the spread of sars-cov-2 the observed effect cannot be explained by changes in social distancing restrictions and social mobility and placebo tests rule out the possibility that this finding is attributable to chance funding we acknowledge the financial support from the smith school of business distinguished faculty fellowship at queens university  the highly contagious novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 responsible for coronavirus disease 2019  emerged in december 2019 in wuhan city hubei province china 1 the initial outbreak quickly evolved into a public health emergency of international concern and by march 2020 the world health organization who characterized covid-19 as a pandemic 2 as of june 2020 covid-19 has reached over 180 countries and regions and the total number of confirmed cases has surpassed 10 million globally 3 when compared to other countries covid-19 has spread throughout the united states us at an unparalleled rate infecting over 25 million individuals and claiming over 125000 lives 4 transmission of sars-cov-2 can occur through both indirect and direct modes including person-to-person contact and the spread of respiratory droplets from infected individuals via coughing and sneezing 5 recent evidence estimates the average and median basic reproduction number r 0  of sars-cov-2 as 328 and 279 respectively the r 0 indicates the contagiousness and transmissibility of a virus with an r 0 greater than one implying that each infected individual spreads the virus to multiple individuals public health measures designed in consideration of the viruss specific transmission properties have been implemented with the aim of reducing the r 0 to a value less than one as research has demonstrated that sars-cov-2 can travel across a minimum distance of 6 feet 2 meters 6 social distancing the maintenance of at least a 6 foot physical distance from others has been introduced as an important public health measure a variety of social distancing restrictions have been instituted across the us ranging from statewide stay-at-home orders to more focused policies including non-essential business closures large gathering bans school closure mandates and restaurant and bar limits 7 moreover the us federal government has granted individual states the authority to design their own covid-mitigation strategy therefore the extent and type of social distancing policies adopted differs across states 8 the widespread adoption of social distancing restrictions in various jurisdictions has created an opportunity to examine the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing the spread of sars-cov-2 in the us research examining government-imposed restrictions found that social distancing measures were effective in reducing the doubling rate of covid-19 among us states 9 as well as the daily growth rate of covid-19 cases across counties 710 with a lag period consistent with the 14-day incubation time of sars-cov-2 11 this is consistent with early predictive models which suggest that the absence of social distancing measures would result in a greater spread of sars-cov-2 12 13 14 however recent evidence suggests that rather than reducing the number of daily confirmed cases social distancing merely stabilizes the spread of covid-19 9 the lack of consensus in the literature regarding the effectiveness of social distancing measures stresses the necessity for a study to explore the causal impact of these measures on the sars-cov-2 infection rate research has demonstrated that greater population mobility influences the r 0 of sars-cov-2 and facilitates the spread of covid-19 across different geographic areas 15 given the relationship between mobility and r 0  several studies have used mobility data as a measure of social distancing when examining the effectiveness of social distancing in reducing the spread of sars-cov-2 7 16 17 18 however social mobility measures represent an imperfect proxy for social distancing because individuals can be mobile while still maintaining the recommended 6 foot interpersonal separation to prevent viral transmission therefore future studies should control for mobility in order to identify the direct relationship between social distancing and the sars-cov-2 infection rate social distancing practices were abruptly relaxed during the mass protests precipitated by the tragic death of george floyd in minneapolis mn on may 25 2020 during these protests thousands of people across the us congregated potentially increasing their exposure to sars-cov-2 the unpredictable nature of the protests creates a natural experimental setting to investigate the causal impact of social distancing on the sars-cov-2 infection rate two key requirements for the identification of the causal link between social distancing and the spread of sars-cov-2 are satisfied in this setting namely 1 the existence of a strong theoretical basis supporting the relationship in question and 2 exogenous variation in the variable of interest ie social distancing 19 the latter is key to establish causality because it mitigates concerns that omitted variables correlated with both the protests and the spread of sars-cov-2 might be driving our findings this experimental setting also enables us to circumvent common concerns about endogeneity and self-selection which besets most non-randomized-trial experiments 20 to assess the causal impact of social distancing on the sars-cov-2 infection rate we implement our empirical analysis in a differences-in-differences did setting in which the onset of the protests represents the treatment effect and the counties in which protests take place represent the treatment group this paper differs from its predecessors in that rather than investigating the effectiveness of social distancing following the imposition of social distancing restrictions it examines their effectiveness as social distancing practices are abruptly relaxed furthermore this study controls explicitly for social distancing restrictions imposed by states in the period surrounding the protests as well as for the concurrent increase in social mobility establishing the effectiveness of social distancing practices in a statistically reliable way has important public health implications as states are in the midst of relaxing the social distancing restrictions initially imposed in march 2020 we source our us covid-19 data from the john hopkins github repository this data consists of confirmed cases in each county at the end of every day since the start of the outbreak in late january 2020 we calculate the number of new cases for each county and each day by subtracting the cumulative number of confirmed cases at the end of the day from the number of cumulative cases from the previous day this sampling procedure yields a panel data-set consisting of a total of 474422 county-days representing 3142 counties from all fifty states as well as the district of columbia dc for the period starting on january 22 2020 and ending on june 20 2020 we describe our sample in table i  and in figure 1 we show the counties in which protests took place according to media reports along with the size of the first protest taking place within each county we obtain our county-level population data and our county-level demographic data from the us census bureau we extract our county-level gross domestic product gdp data from the us bureau of economic analysis bea regional economic accounts database table cagdp1  we retrieve county-level data on the prevalence of obesity diabetes smoking and hypertension from the university of washingtons institute for health metrics and evaluation ihme the hypertension and obesity data are for the years 2009 and 2011 respectively and the diabetes and smoking prevalence data are for 2012 the ihme reports hypertension and obesity data for females and males separately so we construct a population-weighted average measure for these two covariates fitness centres gyms casinos etc 4 closure of non-essential businesses 5 stay-at-home orders for non-essential activities 6 state curfews on non-essential activities 7 mandated quarantines for people entering the state 8 travel restrictions prohibiting residents from leaving the state nonresidents from entering the state or residents from travelling across counties within the state 9 self-isolation requirement for individuals with confirmed covid-19 infection and 10 mandatory wearing of masks or other mouth and nose coverings in public places we construct our social distancing restrictions index by adding the number of restrictions that are in place in a state on any given day based on the date at which each restriction is enacted relaxed or expired figure 2 shows the evolution of our index for randomly selected states we obtain our mobility data from the descartes labs this data consists of mobility indexes calculated at the end of every day and aggregated at the county level the indexes which we will refer to as the social mobility index are based on geolocation reports from smartphones and other mobile devices and track the movements of individual mobile phone subscribers the methodology employed to construct these indexes is described in warren et al 2020 21 the mobility index data is available at a daily frequency from march 1 2020 until the end of our sample period thus we lose a total of 122538 county-day observations from the start of our sample period up until february 29 2020 in all our regression analyses featuring this data figure 3 shows the mobility index for a randomly selected small and large county in the states of new york and texas finally we construct a comprehensive list of protests that took place across the us our starting point is the list of george floyd protests in the united states assembled by wikipedia at the time of writing the main wikipedia page cited 134 news articles from national regional and local media outlets and the secondary pages cited hundreds more from these media citations we extracted the location and the date at which the protests reportedly took place as well as the estimated number of individuals involved in each protest we complement this process with a search on the dow jones factiva database we examine the impact of the abrupt relaxation of social distancing practices which occurred during the us nationwide protests on the sars-cov-2 infection rate with an ordinary least squares ols differences-in-differences did panel regression equation which is specified as follows where ci ijt corresponds to new confirmed sars-cov-2 infections in county i from state j on day t per 100000 population p rotest i is an indicator variable which is set equal to one if a protest took place in county i and to zero otherwise p ost gf ijt is an indicator variable set equal to zero from the first day of our sample period up until may 25 2020 the day of george floyds tragic death and to one on every subsequent date p rotest  p ost gf is an indicator variable which captures the interaction between p rotest i and p ost gf ijt  x ijt and y jt are vectors of county and state characteristics which we use as control variables and  i  represents state-level fixed effects to control for time-invariant differences across states in our regressions in equation 1  1 captures any differences that may exist between the sars-cov-2 infection rate in protest and non-protest counties and that are unrelated to the protests we expect this coefficient to be statistically indistinguishable from zero regressions we cluster the standard errors at the county level to account for any potential crosssectional dependence in the error terms ijt  22 we perform our statistical analysis with stata 16 and use sergio correias reghdfe command to estimate equation 1  23  in our differences-in-differences regressions we include control variables which may influence the transmission rate of sars-cov-2 these control variables account for demographic health geographic and income level variations across counties for demographic indicators we include male sex and age 60 years since these factors are associated with both an increased risk of testing positive for sars-cov-2 and greater illness severity 24 we also include ethnicity as a demographic variable to account for the increased risk of a positive sars-cov-2 test observed among blacks and hispanics obesity diabetes and hypertension are clinical risk factors included as health covariates in the regressions as they are associated with an increased risk of severe illness and a greater risk of mortality from covid-19 25 we also include smoking as a clinical risk factor as some evidence suggests that smoking may be associated with an increased severity of covid-19 26 we include population density among our control variables as higher rates of sars-cov-2 infections are observed in more densely populated urban areas 15 25 consistent with previous research showing that residents from more economically deprived areas are more likely to test positive for sars-cov-2 we use real gdp per capita to control for income in our regressions 25 4 results we report results from regression equation 1 in table iii  in model 1 the coefficients associated with p rotest is equal to 122 95ci 079-165 and is highly significant this implies that over the entire sample period the sars-cov-2 infection rate is 122 cases per day per 100000 population higher in the counties where protests took place relative to the counties where no protests took place the coefficient associated with p ost gf is positive and highly significant implying that the sars-cov-2 infection rate increases by 339 cases per day per 100000 across the us following the onset of the protests finally the coefficient associated with the p rotest  p ost gf interaction indicates that the infection rate is even greater in the counties in which protests actually took place following the onset of the protests 401 95ci 324-478 to put this number into perspective recall that the average number of new case infections across all counties is equal to 5 per day per 100000 population in the week preceding the onset of the protests see column 2 of table i  using this number as a reference point covid-19 cases increase by a further 802 on average in protest-counties relative to non-protest counties and by 339  401  740 cases per day per 100000 population or 148 overall models 2-6 of table iii provide evidence that is consistent with model 1 the coefficient associated with p rotest loses its statistical significance in models 2 and 6 suggesting that the higher overall infection rate of protest-counties is attributable to cross-county differences in demography we note that the coefficient associated with p ost gf is very stable across the six models ranging between 333 and 339 likewise the coefficient associated with our p rotest  p ost gf interaction is quite stable across the six models ranging between 280 in model 6 and 401 in model 1  although there is no telling which one of these six models provides a better description of the causal impact of relaxing social distancing practices on the spread of sars-cov-2 out of conservatism we will employ our omnibus regression model 6  in the period preceding the onset of the protests the number of new covid-19 cases began to drop steadily across the country 3 accordingly several states began to unwind their social distancing restrictions in a carefully staged manner figure  2 illustrates this trend in alabama california florida and new york for instance starting in mid-march we observe a steady rise in our social distancing restrictions index in these four states and we observe the start of a slow unwind by mid-april notably while social distancing restrictions were being relaxed across the nation social mobility was on the rise see figure 3  consequently it may very well be that the concurrent relaxation of social distancing restrictions and the increase in social mobility during the event period has prompted individuals to relax their social distancing practices and that the effect that we document in table iii is partly contaminated by these contemporaneous changes we address this issue in table iv  where we include our social distancing restrictions and social mobility indexes in our baseline did regression equation 1 as additional control variables 2 includes the additional control for social distancing restrictions model 3 includes the additional control for social mobility and model 4 includes both controls in model 2 we see a drop from 333 to 301 in the coefficient associated with p ost gf  relative to model 1 but the coefficient remains highly significant we observe a similar drop in the coefficient associated with the p rotest p ost gf interaction from 280 to 229 with no drop in its statistical significance in model 3 controlling for social mobility has a slightly larger impact on the coefficients associated with p ost gf and p rotest  p ost gf  the first coefficient drops from 333 to 297 while the p rotest  p ost gf drops from 280 to 181 evidently social distancing restrictions and social mobility are correlated with one another for instance we should expect social mobility to rise when travel restrictions are lifted when we control for both factors in model 4 the coefficient associated with p ost gf is equal to 306 95ci 247-365 which is highly significant and the coefficient associated with p rotestp ost gf is equal to 173 95ci 059-287 also highly significant in summary after controlling for the reduction in social distancing restrictions and the increase in social mobility that occurred following the onset of the protests we still observe a significant increase in the number of daily covid-19 cases across all counties 612 relative to the week preceding the event and a further increase of 173 cases 346 in the counties where protests took place we attribute the latter to the relaxation of social distancing practices during the protests this interpretation is supported by the abundance of video footage demonstrating that the mass protests brought people into close physical proximity to one another in contravention to social distancing restrictions that were in place at the time in table v  we report the results of a placebo test assessing whether the causal impact of the protests on the spread of sars-cov-2 that we document in tables iii and iv can be attributed to chance for this purpose we implement a monte carlo simulation exercise centered on our baseline did panel regression specification 1 ie model 4 of table iv  in this simulation we pick a random date between february 6 2020 and june 1 2020 to represent the onset of the protests and we assign counties to the protest group randomly in proportion to the actual fraction of counties that took part in the protests 18 we carry out this exercise 10000 times and each time we estimate our model with the simulated protest onset date and protest county pair and collect the key parameter estimates from the regression ie p rotest p ost gf  and p rotest  p ost gf  along with their county-cluster robust t-statistics in this simulation the impact of the random date on the randomly assigned protest counties on the sars-cov-2 infection rate is negligible on average only 25 of the coefficients from the simulation are positive and at most 1 of them are statistically significant furthermore the coefficients associated with p ost gf and p rotest  p ost gf from the actual regressions panel b ie 306 and 173 are well above the 95 confidence thresholds inferred from the simulated distribution ie 135 and 137 respectively indeed our baseline regression coefficients fall at the very top end of the simulated distribution this implies that we can safely reject the null hypothesis that the causal impact of protests on the sars-cov-2 infection rate that we document is due to pure chance with at least 99 confidence in this paper we employ the natural experimental setting created by the us protests precipitated by george floyds tragic death to document the causal impact of social distancing measures on the spread of sars-cov-2 using a did analysis in which the treatment effect corresponds to the onset of the protests and the treatment group corresponds to the counties in which protests reportedly took place we document a country-wide increase of more than 306 cases per day per 100000 population following the onset of the protests and a further increase of 173 cases per day per 100000 population in the counties in which the protests took place relative to the average number of new cases per day during the week preceding the onset of the protests this represents a 612 country-wide increase in covid-19 cases and further 346 increase in the protest counties the increase in the sars-cov-2 infection rate that we document in this study cannot be explained by the relaxation of state-imposed social distancing restrictions in the period surrounding the protests nor by the concurrent increase in social mobility during the protest period as we control explicitly for these two factors in our regressions therefore it stands that the increase in sars-cov-2 infections that we observe following the onset of the protests can be attributed to the relaxation of social distancing practices the causal impact is also robust to both the inclusion of a host of covariates that are known to influence the sars-cov-2 infection rate and to placebo tests that enable us to rule out the possibility that our findings are attributable to chance our study is not without limitations in particular over 70 testing centers across the us were closed following the onset of the protests therefore the increase in the sars-cov-2 infections that we document likely underestimates the true increase we are also unable to assess protest participants vulnerability eg age underlying health conditions personal protective wear etc and variability along these dimensions may influence the risk of sars-cov-2 infection additionally we cannot control for the actual degree of physical proximity between participants which would impact the transmission rate of sars-cov-2 during the protests moreover we rely on the accuracy of media reports to identify the counties in which protests took place finally we do not account for the magnitude of the protests in each county however expressing the case counts in rates rather than in levels should minimize any potential scale-related effects  we wish to express our sincere thanks to the descartes labs for making their mobility data available

the 2019 novel coronavirus calistus ngonghala n enahoro iboi steffen eikenberry matthew scotch chandini macintyre raina matthew bonds h abba gumel b   the world is currently facing a pandemic of a novel coronavirus covid-19 which started as an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause in wuhan city of china in december of 2019 1 2 3 as of april 14 2020 covid-19 caused by the novel sars-cov-2 coronavirus has spread to over 210 countries and territories causing about 19 million infections and 125000 deaths 4 5 6 7 the united states is now the epicenter of the covid-19 pandemic recording over 613800 confirmed cases and 26000 deaths within a short time with new york state bearing the brunt of the us burden over 203000 confirmed cases and 10800 deaths 4 5 6 7 the first documented confirmed case of the novel coronavirus in the us a resident who had recently visited wuhan city in china was reported on january 20 2020 8 while the first confirmed case in the state of new york was reported on march 1 2020 most of the covid-19 related deaths and severe cases occur in the elderly 65 years of age and older and people with underlying medical conditions 9 younger people and frontline healthcare workers are also at high risk of acquiring covid-19 infection as with two other coronaviruses that caused major outbreaks in humans in recent years namely the severe acute respiratory syndrome and the middle eastern respiratory syndrome 2 10 covid-19 is transmitted from human-to-human through direct contact with contaminated objects or surfaces and through inhalation of respiratory droplets from both symptomatic and asymptomatically-infectious humans 11 there is also limited evidence that the virus can be exhaled through normal breathing 12 the incubation period of the disease ranges from 2-14 days 3 13 14 15 most infections over 80 show mild or no symptoms 16 common symptoms of the disease include fever coughing and shortness of breath for mild cases and pneumonia for severe cases 1 2 7 in the absence of pharmaceutical interventions such as a safe and effective vaccine for use in humans and a covid-19 anti-viral efforts aimed at containing covid-19 are focused on the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social-distancing using face-masks quarantine of suspected cases isolation and hospitalization of confirmed cases contact-tracing and quarantine mass testing etc in particular since the novel coronavirus is transmitted among people who come in close contact with each other the implementation of strict social-distancing measures has been the primary tool for curbing the spread of the pandemic as of april 7 2020 stringent social-distancing mechanisms mandatory lockdownsstay-at-home orders have been imposed in over 42 states of the united states together with washington dc guam and puerto rico representing over 95 of the us population involving approximately 316 million americans 17 the state of new york the current epicenter for covid-19 has even imposed a fine against people who fail to comply with its stringent social-distancing measures that took effect march 22 2020 common social-distancing measures or guidelines being employed in the us include temporary closures of schools and non-essential businesses avoiding crowded events and mass gatherings moving in-person meetings online etc the city of wuhan lifted its 76-day strict lockdown on april 8 2020 this was done in a phased way with the first relaxation of measures on february 9 2020 contact-tracing is another major public health strategy for combating the spread of covid-19 contact-tracing involves searching for or identifying individuals with whom the confirmed case has closely interacted within a certain time frame eg two days prior to the onset of symptoms 18 interviewing testing and isolating or hospitalizing them if they have the disease 19 20 the use of face-masks in public by members of the general population has historically been a common practice to try to limit or combat the spread of respiratory diseases dating back to at least the 1918 h1n1 pandemic of influenza 21 22 23 24 25 26 face masks may have been instrumental in limiting the community spread of the 20022003 sars epidemic in asia particularly in china singapore hong kong and taiwan 27 28 as well as the containment of the covid-19 pandemic in taiwan 29 face-masks have dual purposes if worn by a susceptible individual the mask offers efficacy against the acquisition of infection on the other hand if the wearer is already infected but is asymptomatic or mildly-symptomatic and unaware heshe is ill the face-mask offers efficacy against their ability to transmit infection to susceptible individuals 12 30 31 32 33 predicting the course or severity of a pandemic such as covid-19 as well as the realistic assessment of proposed public health intervention strategies for combating them in real time is a major challenge to both the public health and the scientific community a number of models have been developed and used to study covid-19 dynamics ferguson et al 34 used an agent-based model to investigate the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on human deaths from covid-19 and in reducing burden on healthcare facilities and equipment they projected that in the absence of control measures over 81 of the populations of the us and great britain might become infected and covid-19 may cause up to 22 million deaths in the us mizumoto and chowell 35 used a mathematical model and incidence data to study changes in covid-19 transmission potential as the outbreak progressed through the diamond princess they obtained a higher reproduction number and noticed a substantial decrease in the effective reproduction number after improved quarantine was instituted hellewell et al 36 used a stochastic model with covid-19 data to examine the impact of contact-tracing and isolation on disease control and suggested that for most instances covid-19 spread can be contained in 3 months if these measures are highly effective using a stochastic model kucharski et al 37 examined the covid-19 trajectory in wuhan from januaryfebruary 2020 showing a reduction in transmission a 13 reduction in the associated effective reproduction number of the model when travel restrictions were implemented consequently there is a need to examine the combined impact of multiple non-pharmaceutical interventions applied together or in sequence the present study is based on the development of a new mathematical model for studying the transmission dynamics and control of the covid-19 pandemic in the us particularly in the state of new york the epicenter of covid-19 the model takes the form of a kermackmckendrick compartmental deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations 38 it incorporates features pertinent to covid-19 transmission dynamics and control such as the quarantine of suspected cases and the isolationhospitalization of confirmed covid-19 cases similar to the models developed in 39 40 41 the model parameterized using available covid-19 mortality data more reliable than case data provides a realistic real-time assessment and estimate of the burden of the pandemic in the us state of new york in addition to assessing some of the main intervention strategies being implemented in the state in particular quarantine isolation contact-tracing social-distancing and the use of face-masks in public 
 we designed and analyzed a novel kermackmckendrick-type mathematical model for the transmission dynamics and control of covid-19 in a population 38 the model which incorporates the main non-pharmaceutical interventions being implemented to curtail covid-19 transmission in a community such as social-distancing quarantine of suspected cases isolation of confirmed cases contact-tracing testing and use of face-masks in public is formulated based on stratifying the total human population at time t denoted by nt into the mutually-exclusive compartments of non-quarantined susceptible sut quarantined susceptible sqt non-quarantined exposed ie newly-infected individuals who do not yet show symptoms of the disease and cannot transmit infection eut quarantined exposed eqt symptomatically-infectious iut asymptomatically-infectious iat hospitalizedisolated iht intensive care patients iicut and recovered rt so that ntsutsqteuteqtiutiatihtiicutrt
 it should be mentioned that the asymptomatically-infectious compartment ia also includes those with mild symptoms of covid-19 data from the world health organization shows that about 80 of covid-19 confirmed cases show mild or no symptoms 16 and that individuals in this category particularly those who are in the 65 age group or those with pre-existing health conditions can develop a mild form of pneumonia that might require self-isolation or hospitalization 42 43 44 45 furthermore some individuals in this compartment particularly those who show no clinical symptoms 46 can be detected via testing andor tracing and testing of the contacts of confirmed covid-19 cases and sent to self-isolation or hospitalization it is worth mentioning that although the self-isolation or hospitalization of individuals in the ia class is associated with contact-tracing the ia to ih transition can also result from improvement in or scaling up of testing as is the case in iceland 47 in fact in our study contact tracing is very much inter-linked with testing contact tracing is carried out after a confirmed case is diagnosed following testingdiagnosis of a confirmed case furthermore individuals in the quarantine class sq or eq are those who have been traced following the positive diagnosis of someone they have had close contact with ie a confirmed covid-19 case they have been exposed to people in quarantine can be susceptible or newly-infected but unaware of their infection status and are continually monitored tested to determine their status those who test positive are moved to the eq class and those who remain negative after the incubation period are returned to the su class thus the process of quarantining individuals suspected of having had close contacts with an infectious individual can be interpreted as contact-tracing in addition to contact-tracing of contacts of confirmed cases people can be placed in quarantine because of other factors such as having traveled to areas with high covid-19 transmission eg new york italy china spain uk etc quarantine and isolation can either be at home self-quarantine and self-isolation or at designated healthcare facilities furthermore hospitalization in the context of this study includes self-isolation at home and isolation at the hospital hence hospitalization and isolation will be used interchangeably in this study the model is given by the following deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations where a dot represents differentiation with respect to time 21su1p1qpqpsuqsqsq1psujqsqeu1qpsuuueueqqpsuueujsqqeqiuf1ueuuuuiuihf2ueurqequiuaiahhhihia1f1f2ueu1rqeqaaaiaiicuhihicuicuiicuruiuhihaiaicuiicuwhere force of infection

are of near or perfect efficacy against the acquisition or transmission of infection reduction in the contact rate parameter  can be thought of a measure of effectiveness of strategies that limit contacts between people to avoid community transmission notably social or physical distancing the parameter 0a1 measures the relative infectiousness of asymptomatically-infectious humans in the ia class in relation to symptomatic individuals in the iu class similarly 0h1 is a modification parameter accounting for the relative infectiousness of hospitalizedisolated infectious humans in the ih class in relation to individuals in the iu class the parameter 0q1 is a measure of the effectiveness of quarantine hospitalizationisolation and icu admission to prevent infected quarantined hospitalizedisolated individuals and icu patients from transmitting infection in particular q0 implies that infected quarantined hospitalizedisolated individuals and icu patients mix freely with the rest of population and can transmit at the same rate as other infectious individuals on the other hand q1 implies that the efficacy of quarantine hospitalizationisolation and icu admission in preventing infected quarantined hospitalizedisolated individuals and icu patients from transmitting infection is perfect in other words q1 means infected quarantined hospitalizedisolated infectious humans and icu patients are no longer part of the actively-mixing population hence do not contribute to disease transmission in the model 21 the parameter 0p1 is the probability of infection per contact while q is the proportion of non-quarantined individuals that are infected at the time of quarantine the parameter q measures the rate at which quarantined-susceptible individuals revert to the wholly-susceptible non-quarantined class su at the end of the quarantine period the modification parameter 0j1 is a measure of the efficacy of quarantine to prevent the acquisition of infection by quarantined-susceptible individuals during quarantine it should be mentioned that in the formulation of the model 21 the quarantine rate is defined as a function of the proportion of infectious individuals in the community in particular the quarantine rate of susceptible individuals is 1p while that of newly-infected exposed individuals in the eq class is qp where  is the force of infection in other words the more the number of confirmed covid-19 cases in a community the more the number of residents of that community that are quarantined the parameters uq is the rate at which exposed non-quarantined quarantined individuals progress to the symptomatic hospitalized class ie 1u and 1q is the intrinsic incubation period of non-quarantined and quarantined exposed individuals respectively a proportion f1 of exposed individuals move to the iu class at the end of the incubation period at the rate f1u similarly another proportion f2 moves to ih class at the rate f2u and the remaining proportion 1f1f2 moves to the ia class at the rate 1f1f2u noting that f1f21 the parameter a represents the rate at which asymptomatically-infectious humans are detected via contact-tracing and hospitalized the parameter a represents the rate at which asymptomatically-infectious humans are detected via contact-tracing and hospitalized a proportion r of exposed quarantined individuals move to the ih class at the end of the incubation period at a rate rq while the remaining proportion 1r moves to the ia class at a rate 1rq the parameter u represents the rate at which exposed non-quarantined individuals are detected by contact-tracing and placed in quarantine the parameter uahicu is the recovery rate for individuals in the iuiaihiicu class while h is the rate at which hospitalized individuals are placed into icu furthermore the parameter uahicu represents the covid-induced mortality for individuals in the iuiaihiicu class it is worth mentioning that in the formulation of the model 21 the community transmission rate  is assumed to be the same for both the symptomatically-infectious iu and the asymptomatically-infectious ia classes it may be possible that the community contact rate for asymptomatically-infectious individuals is higher than that of symptomatically-infectious individuals this is due to the fact that the former are less sick or are not even aware that they are infected and may therefore be having more contacts and causing more infections the assumption for the homogeneity in the community contact rate allows for a more tractable assessment of the impact of social-distancing and other community contact reduction strategies as well as mathematical tractability the model 21 is an extension of the quarantine model for ebola viral disease developed by denes and gumel 39 by adding epidemiological compartments for asymptomatically-infectious humans and hospitalized individuals in icu as well as incorporating contact-tracing of suspected cases and the use of face-masks by members of the general public to the authors knowledge this may be the first deterministic model for covid-19 that incorporates five non-pharmaceutical interventions quarantine isolation contact-tracing use of public masks and social-distancing in addition to allowing for the assessment of the impact of asymptomatic transmission on the trajectory and burden of covid-19 by adding a compartment for asymptomatic-infectious humans a flow diagram of the model is depicted in fig 1 and the state variables and parameters of the model are tabulated in table 1 table 2 to keep track of covid-19 related deaths required for calibrating our model with cumulative death data for covid-19 and for quantifying and predicting the public health impactburden of disease we define the book-keeping state variable dt to measure the number of covid-deceased individuals it then follows from some of the equations of the model 21 that the rate of change of the population of deceased-individuals is given by 22duiuhihaiaicuiicu
 
 we estimated the baseline epidemiological parameters of the model from available covid-19 data and sources from the published literature since the generally recommended period for quarantine of people suspected of being exposed to covid-19 is 14 days 6 16 we set the rate at which quarantined susceptible individuals revert to the non-quarantined susceptible class q to be q114
per day further while some studies have estimated the incubation period for covid-19 to range from 214 days with about 975 of infected people developing disease symptoms within 115 days of infection 13 14 15 other studies have estimated the incubation period to be 56 days 3 we consider an average incubation period taken from these ranges of 51 days so that uq151
per day 13 similarly we set the progression rate from the asymptomatically-infectious class ia to the isolatedhospitalized class ihto be a14
per day following 34 48 we consider an infectious period of about 10 days so that the recovery rate from covid-19 infection  is set to uicu110
per day ferguson et al 34 estimated the average time covid-19 patients spent in hospital for infections that do not lead to complications requiring icu admission to be about 8 days therefore we set h18
per day furthermore following ferguson et al 34 it is assumed that there is a short time lag of about 5 days between the onset of disease symptoms in non-quarantined humans and hospitalization hence we set the hospitalization rate u to be u15
per day some studies have suggested that most covid-19 infections over 80 show mild or no symptoms about 14 show severe symptoms but without requiring icu admission and 6 show critically-severe symptoms requiring icu admission 16 49 50 consequently we set f202 and assume that half of the 80 of cases that show no or mild symptoms are asymptomatic hence we set f104 and 1f1f204 the modification parameter for the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic people a was estimated from 34 51 to be 05 further li et al 51 estimated this parameter to be between 042 and 055 hence we set ah05 since about 15 of covid-19 patients die 34 we estimated uh0015
per day to obtain estimates for a and icu we assume that a05u so that a00075
per day and icu15u so that icu00225
per day 52 the parameter for the efficacy of quarantine to prevent acquisition of infection during quarantine j is estimated to be j05 we estimated the efficacy of face-masks m based on the results of a number of clinical trials for instance data from driessche et al 53 shows that surgical masks reduced p aeruginosa infected aerosols produced by coughing by over 80 in cystic fibrosis patients a similar study by stockwell et al 54 shows that surgical masks reduced colony-forming unit cfu count by over 90 these two studies in 53 54 show that the n95 masks respirators were more effective similarly van der sande et al 55 show that home-made tea-cloth masks had an inward efficiency between 58 and 77 over a 3-hour duration of wear while inward efficiency ranged 7285 and 9899 for surgical and n95-equivalent masks consequently following eikenberry et al 52 we estimate inward mask efficacy to range widely between 2080 for cloth masks and at least 50 for well-made tightly fitting masks made of optimal materials and 7090 for surgical masks and over 95 typical for p in the range of properly worn n95 masks based on this we set m05 we set the proportion of quarantined exposed individuals who are hospitalized r to be r07 there is no good data for the efficacy of isolationhospitalization to prevent disease transmission by symptomatic individuals in isolationhospital nonetheless it seems plausible to assume that at the later stage of the pandemic such as at the present moment the public health system capacity has been greatly improved to the extent that such transmission do not occur hence we set q1 the parameter h for the rate of icu admission is estimated to be h0083
per day based on data from 56 it is in the range of 612 the remaining parameters of the model 21  cm a and u were estimated from the mortality data for the state of new york and the entire us 4 5 6 7 based on the fitting of the state of new york data in fig 2a and data for the entire us in fig 2b the estimating process involved minimizing the sum of the squares of the difference between the predictions of model 21 cumulative deaths and the observed covid-19 cumulative deaths data from new york state for the period from march 1 2020 to april 7 2020 in particular the fitted values obtained using the state of new york mortality data were 08648

 the quantity c is the control reproduction number of the model 21 it measures the average number of new covid-19 infections generated by an average infected individual introduced into a population where basic public health interventions quarantine isolation social-distancing testing etc are implemented the quantity rc is the sum of the constituent reproduction numbers associated with the number of new covid-19 cases generated by symptomatically-infectious humans cu hospitalizedisolated individuals ch and asymptomatically-infectious humans ca the epidemiological implication of theorem 31 is that a small influx of covid-19 cases will not generate a covid-19 outbreak if the control reproduction number c is less than unity it is worth mentioning that for kermackmckendrick-type mathematical models with no vitaldemographic dynamics ie births or natural death processes or waning immunity to continuously feed the susceptible class such as the model 21 it is instructive to compute the final size of the epidemic 40 59 60 61 62 the final epidemic size relations which are natural quantities associated with the dynamics of epidemic models with no vitaldemographic dynamics allow for the realistic quantification of disease burden and can be used to assess the impact and effectiveness of various intervention and mitigation strategies 40 the final size relations for the epidemic model 21 are calculated in section 32 
in this section the final size of the covid-19 pandemic will be calculated using the notation in 59 let xr6 yr2 and zr represent the sets of infected susceptible and recovered components of the model thusit follows from the model 21 that xt

 using the above change and variables and definitions the model 21 reduces to 32xdyxyzbxvxydyxyzbxzwxwhere w is a kn matrix with the property that the ij entry represents the rate at which individuals of the jth infected compartment transition into the recovered ith z compartment upon recovery and the matrix v is as defined in section 31 it is worth stating that the reproduction number c of the model 21 or equivalently 32 can be recovered using the definition c0y0z0bv1dy0 given in theorem 21 of 59 it should be noted that this theorem also allows for recovering the local asymptotic stability result for the family of disease-free equilibria of the model 21 given in section 31 furthermore the results below for the final size relations of the model 21 or equivalently 32 can be established using theorem 51 of 59

 we simulated the model 21 using the baseline parameter values tabulated in table 3 unless otherwise stated to assess the population-level impact of the various control and mitigation strategies against the spread of covid-19 in the us state of new york discussed in section 21 we also simulated the model using the calibrated parameters in table 4 together with the other estimated parameters in table 3 to assess the population-level impact of various control measures in the entire us it should be mentioned that in all the simulations carried out the various non-pharmaceutical interventions are maintained at their baseline values unless otherwise stated 
we simulated the model to first of all assess the impact of social-distancing which in our study extends beyond individuals staying 2 meters or 6 ft apart to include school and non-essential business closures staying at home avoiding large gatherings etc further in our study we measured the effect of social-distancing by the overall reduction in the baseline value of the community contact rate parameter  the simulation results obtained depicted in fig 3 show a projected 66300 patients in hospital or in self-isolation at the pandemic peak expected to be attained on may 5 2020 fig 3a and 105100 cumulative number of deaths fig 3c for the state of new york under the baseline scenario ie for the baseline level of social-distancing similarly the projections for the entire us under the baseline nation-wide social-distancing scenario are 115000 daily hospitalizations at the pandemic peak fig 3b and 164000 cumulative number of deaths fig 3d it is noteworthy that our projection for the cumulative mortality for the entire us of 164000 falls markedly below the 22 million mortality projected by ferguson et al 34 our us-wide mortality projection however falls within the range of 38243162106 estimated by murray et al 65 when social-distancing is improved above the baseline effectiveness levels ie increase in efficacy and adherencecoverage of social-distancing fig 3 shows a dramatic reduction of covid-19 burden for both new york state and the entire us in particular for a social-distancing regimen that reduces the contact rate parameter  by 10 from its baseline value the expected number of daily hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases at the peak of the pandemic decreases to 50380 corresponding to a 24 decrease in hospitalizationsisolation from baseline for the state of new york similarly nation-wide hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases at the peak of the pandemic decreases by 21 to 89930 furthermore for a highly-effective social-distancing strategy such as a social-distancing strategy that results in at least 40 reduction in the baseline value of  the peak hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases for new york state and the entire us dramatically reduce to 5000 and 14000 respectively this represents a 92 and 88 reduction in peak hospitalizations for the state of new york and nationwide respectively similarly for this scenario the cumulative mortality for new york state and the entire us reduce respectively to 20700 and 59600 thus implementing a highly-effective social-distancing strategy which can reduce the baseline community contact rate  by at least 40 will avert over 80 and 64 of the predicted baseline deaths in new york state and nationwide respectively the effectiveness levels and coverage of social-distancing in new york state and the entire us has greatly improved by april 2 2020 66 67 68 69 to the extent that it is plausible to assume that 40 reduction in the baseline value of  has already been achieved in both the state of new york and nationwide therefore this study shows that the state of new york and the entire us could have recorded catastrophic covid-19-induced mortality between 100000 to 200000 if not for the high effectiveness levels and coverage of the strict social-distancing measures implemented in the state and nationwide our study suggests that if the current level of social-distancing effectiveness and coverage is maintained through may or june 2020 in the state of new york and nationwide covid-19 can be eliminated from both the state and the entire nation extending the simulations for fig 3 shows that the current level of the social-distancing regimen in the state of new york should be extended until late september 2021 to guarantee the elimination of covid-19 in the context of fig 3 covid-19 elimination is measured in terms of when the cumulative mortality stabilizes similarly for the entire us social-distancing needs to be maintained until march 2021 additional simulations were carried out to assess the population-level impact of the duration and timing of when to terminate the current strict social-distancing protocols for the best-case scenario where the current strict social-distancing protocols were assumed to be implemented right from the very beginning of the covid-19 pandemic in new york state march 1 2020 and the entire us january 20 2020 and maintained until early december 2020 the results obtained for the cumulative mortality recorded for new york state and the entire us are 25000 and 60000 respectively this represents 76 and 63 reductions respectively in the cumulative mortality for new york state and the entire us in comparison to the baseline scenario ie worst-case scenario where the social-distancing and other community contacts-reduction strategies have not been implemented at the stringent levels blue curves in figs 4af furthermore if the social-distancing regimens were implemented on the days they were officially implemented in new york state march 22 2020 and the entire us march 16 2020 but maintained until early december 2020 the cumulative mortality to be recorded will be 55000 and 75500 this represents 48 and 53 reductions respectively in the cumulative mortality from the baseline magenta curves in figs 4af the effect of the timing of when to terminate the current strict social-distancing protocols was also monitored our simulations show that terminating the current strict social-distancing by the end of april 2020 ie the 40 reduction in the baseline value of  is now lost due to the termination of the social-distancing measures a significant rebound of covid-19 burden will be recorded in as early as july 2020 in particular new york state will record 144000 deaths representing a 37 increase from the baseline scenario fig 4a while the entire us will record up to 156000 deaths this represents a mere 5 reduction of cumulative mortality in relation to the baseline scenario fig 4d in other words the early termination of the current strict social-distancing measures by the end of april 2020 will result in catastrophic covid-19 burden similar to the dire projections made for the pre-social-distancing period ie all the gains of the social-distancing and other control and mitigation measures will essentially be lost however if the strict-distancing measures were to be terminated by the end of may 2020 the cumulative mortality figures are projected to be 91800 for new york state and 118300 for the entire us this represents a 13 and 28 reduction respectively in the baseline cumulative mortality figs 4b and e finally if the social-distancing measures are terminated at the end of june 2020 the projection for the cumulative mortality figures are 33200 for new york state and 50300 for the entire us this represents 68 and 69 reductions respectively in the baseline cumulative mortality figs 4c and f these projected mortality numbers for the early termination of social-distancing fall within the range given by murphy et al 65 our study clearly shows that the clamor to relax or terminate the social-distancing measures that have proven to be hugely successful in both the state of new york and the entire us as part of the move to re-open the state and the country would undoubtedly trigger a devastating rebound of covid-19 in both new york state and the entire us data has already shown that certain countries that have relaxed the successfully-implemented social-distancing measures such as taiwan hong kong and south korea are now witnessing a rebound of covid-19 70 in particular hong kong announced 84 newly-confirmed cases on march 28 followed by over 70 new daily cases in the next three days further taiwan reported more than 20 newly-confirmed cases per day in mid-march up from barely 5 cases per day late in january south korea reported 83 newly-confirmed cases on april 3 2020 70 
it is worth mentioning that the aforementioned simulations for the effect of social-distancing were carried out for the case where other interventions contact-tracing quarantine face-mask usage etc are also implemented at their baseline values in table 3 table 4 if face-masks are not used then the above cumulative numbers will be even more catastrophic for instance if the strict social-distancing protocol is terminated in new york state by april 30 2020 and no face-mask-based intervention is implemented about 150800 deaths will be recorded by july 2020 furthermore terminating the social-distancing protocols by end of may 2020 or end of june 2020 will result in projected 108500 and 44300 deaths respectively in the state the corresponding numbers for the entire us for the case where mask-based intervention is not implemented are projected to be 167000148000 and 91900 respectively thus this study strongly suggest that utmost caution should be exercised before terminating the current strict social-distancing protocols being implemented in the state of new york and nationwide at the very least a careful state-by-state or county-by-county phase withdrawal based on the updated covid-19 incidence mass testing data and proximity to covid-19 hot spots should be carried out the effect of quarantine of individuals suspected of being exposed to covid-19 is monitored by simulating the model 21 using the baseline parameter values and various levels of effectiveness of quarantine to prevent the acquisition of infection during quarantine j the results obtained depicted in fig 5 show that quarantine of susceptible individuals has only marginal impact in reducing covid-related hospitalizations for both new york state fig 5a and the entire us fig 5b in particular at the baseline quarantine efficacy j05 the state of new york will record 66000 daily hospitalizations the implementation of a perfect quarantine in the state ie j0 reduces the number of hospitalizations marginally to 60000 the numbers for the entire us for the baseline and perfect quarantine are 115000 and 97000 respectively the marginal effect of quarantine in minimizing covid-related hospitalizations is even more pronounced when the isolation strategy is perfect figs 5c and d that is for the epidemiological scenario where the isolation or hospitalization of confirmed cases is perfect that is individuals in isolation at home or in hospital are not part of the actively-mixing population so that q1 the community-wide implementation of mass quarantine of individuals suspected of being exposed to covid-19 will have very marginal impact on covid-19 burden measured in terms of reductions in covid-19 hospitalizations this result is consistent with that reported in 71 thus this study suggests that since self-isolation and isolation in hospitals have been implemented at high effectiveness levels in both the state of new york and in the entire us the mass quarantine of suspected cases may not be a cost-effective public health strategy for combating the spread of covid-19 in both new york state and the entire us figs 5c and d illustrate the dynamics of the model 21 for various effectiveness levels of quarantine and isolation for both new york state and the us further emphasizing the marginal nature of quarantine even for the cases where isolation was not implemented at a perfect level in minimizing covid-19 hospitalizations the effect of contact-tracing measured in terms of the detection of asymptomatic cases following testing diagnosis of a confirmed covid-19 case they may have had close contacts with or random testing on the transmission dynamics and control of the covid-19 pandemic is also monitored by simulating the model 21 using the baseline parameter values in table 3 and various values of the contact-tracing parameters u and a in particular the simulations are run by increasing the values of u and a simultaneously and by the same amount from their respective baseline values fig 6 depicts the solution profiles obtained showing the worst case scenario of 49400 cases in the state of new york and 64600 cases nationwide on the day the pandemic peaks on april 26 2020 if no contact tracing is implemented if implemented at its baseline rate contact tracing reduces the size of the pandemic peak number of new covid-19 cases by 27 for the state of new york and by 22 nationwide while a 75 improvement in contact-tracing will reduce the predicted number of confirmed cases to approximately 31300 for the state of new york and 41200 nationwide this represents 13 and 10 reduction from baseline and shows that while contact-tracing implemented even only at baseline is important in reducing the size of the pandemic peak number of new covid-19 cases investing much resources towards contact-tracing beyond the baseline rate might not be cost-effective simulations were further carried out to assess the population-level impact of the widespread use of masks in public by running the model 21 with various values of mask efficacy m and coverage cm the results obtained depicted in fig 7 show a marked decrease in the number of hospitalizations for both new york state figs 7a b and c and the entire us figs 7d e and f with increasing values of the mask efficacy and coverage further using an efficacious mask such as a mask of efficacy 50 can greatly flatten the pandemic curve in addition to significantly reducing the burden of the pandemic measured in this case in terms of hospitalizations however such a mask will fail to lead to the elimination of the disease fig 7b it is worth emphasizing that although the use of masks with low efficacy may not lead to disease elimination they still are highly useful by causing a significant decrease in the burden of the pandemic ie significantly reduce hospitalizations if a significant proportion of the populace wear them for instance if 75 of the populace in new york or the entire us wear masks with efficacy as low as 25 ie cloths masks the number of hospitalizations will be reduced by 63 and 64 respectively compared to the scenario were masks were not used figs 7a and d a contour plot of the reproduction number of the model c as a function of masks efficacy m and compliance cm is depicted in fig 8 if masks of higher efficacy such as surgical masks with estimated efficacy 70 are used in the state of new york disease elimination is indeed feasible if at least 70 of the populace wear the masks figs 8a and b similar results were obtained for the entire us figs 8c and d additional simulations were carried out to assess the combined impact of public face-masks use strategy and strict social-distancing strategy which reduces the baseline value of the community transmission parameter  by 40 on the control of covid-19 in new york state and the entire us the results obtained depicted in fig 9 show that combining the strict social-distancing strategy with a strategy based on using moderately-effective face-masks with efficacy m05 in public will lead to the elimination of the disease in new york state if only 30 of the population use face-masks in public fig 9a this clearly shows that disease elimination in new york state is more feasible if the face-masks-based strategy is combined with the strict social-distancing strategy similar results were obtained for the entire us fig 9b where in this case only 10 compliance in mask usage in public will be needed for covid-19 elimination in summary the above simulations show that the use of face-masks even those with low efficacy but with high coverage in public offers significant community-wide impact in reducing and mitigating the burden of covid-19 in both new york state and the entire us in other words the use of low efficacy face masks with high coverage is always useful further combining the face-masks use strategy with a strategy based on the implementation of strict social-distancing is more effective in curtailing and eliminating covid-19 in comparison to the singular implementation of either strategy the world is currently experiencing a devastating pandemic of a novel coronavirus caused by sars-cov2 that emerged in wuhan city of china in december of 2019 the deadly covid-19 pandemic has spread to over 210 countries causing over 3 million cases and 230000 deaths worldwide by the end of april 2020 with some parts of asia europe and now the us suffering the brunt of the burden there is currently no safe and effective vaccine for use in humans against covid-19 there is also no safe and effective antiviral consequently control and mitigation efforts against covid-19 are limited to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social-distancing which involves keeping a physical distance of at least 6 ft from other humans in public lockdowns of communities closure of schools malls places of worships and other gathering places quarantine of suspected cases contact-tracing isolation at home or in hospital of confirmed cases and the use of face masks both low quality cloth masks and the higher quality surgical masks in public this study is based on the design analysis and simulations of a new mathematical model for providing deeper insights into the transmission dynamics and control of covid-19 in a community specifically the model designed in this study was parameterized using covid-19 data from the us state of new york and the entire us population the model was used to assess the population-impact of the aforementioned control and mitigation interventions we parameterized the model using covid-19 data from new york state and the entire us and extensive numerical simulations were carried out using the parameterized model to assess the population-level impact of the various intervention strategies with the baseline levels of the four main intervention strategies considered social-distancing quarantineisolation contact-tracing and the use of face-masks the state of new york is projected to see a peak of the pandemic around mid april 2020 with 66300 number of hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases and 105100 deaths at the peak while the entire us will see its peak around end of april 2020 with 115000 hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases and 164000 deaths at the peak our projections for baseline worst-case mortality for the us are much lower than the 22 million deaths suggested by ferguson et al in the absence of interventions 34 but fall within the range estimated in 65 our projected numbers for covid-19 burden morbidity and mortality dramatically decreases if strict social-distancing measures are implemented at high adherence levels for instance it was shown that strict compliance to the statewide lock-down in new york state which corresponds to reducing the baseline contact rate in our model by at least 40 will reduce the peak values for hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases and mortality by 92 and 80 respectively similarly the peak values for cases and mortality in the entire us if a nation-wide lockdown capable of reducing baseline contact rate by at least 40 will decrease by 88 and 64 respectively the duration and timing of the termination of strict social-distancing measures are critically-important in the battle to effectively combat pandemics of respiratory diseases such as the devastating covid-19 pandemic while the rapid implementation of strict social-distancing measures during the early stage of the pandemic maintained over a relatively long period of time eg until the summer will undoubtedly effectively combat the burden of the pandemic early termination of these measures will cause catastrophic outcomes for instance our study shows that relaxing or terminating the strict social-distancing measures in the state of new york and the us as a whole by end of april 2020 will trigger a devastating second wave generating covid-19 burden similar to those obtained during the pre-strict-social-distancing time in the state and in the entire nation by the end of july 2020 with cumulative mortality numbers in the range reported in 65 for both new york state and the entire us in particular up to 144000 and 156000 cumulative deaths will have been recorded in the state of new york and the entire us if the social-distancing measures are shut down by the end of april 2020 extending the termination of social-distancing such as to end of june 2020 significantly reduces the likelihood of a second wave in addition to significantly reducing the associated burden of the pandemic consequently a great deal of caution must be exercised before decisions are made to relax or terminate the existing highly-successful social-distancing protocols in both the state of new york and the entire us it is noteworthy that countries that have recently relaxed these measures such as taiwan hong kong and south korea have already started seeing a rebound of covid-19 our study suggests that the decision to relax or terminate the social-distancing measures should by on a case-by-case ie state-by-state or county-by-county basis and should be informed by updated covid-19 incidence and mortality data number of covid-19 tests both antibody and surveillance tests and proximity of a locality to covid-19 hot spots in particular our study shows that strict social-distancing should be maintained until the year 2021 up to late september 2021 for new york state and early march 2021 for the entire us to eliminate covid-19 quarantine of people suspected of being exposed to a respiratory disease is perhaps the oldest public health control measure in human history our study shows that widescale implementation of quarantine intervention may not be very effective in minimizing the burden of covid-19 if the strategy of isolating confirmed cases is effective in other words our study suggests that if isolation can be implemented effectively high efficacy and coverage then quarantine of people suspected of contracting covid-19 may not be necessary this result is consistent with what was reported by day et al 71 tracing the contacts of confirmed cases known as contact-tracing was also shown to only be marginally-effective in minimizing the burden of the pandemic in particular even if contact-tracing is implemented at the highest possible level represented in our study based on increases in the contact-tracing parameters by 75 the decrease in the burden of the pandemic recorded was only marginal 13 and 10 for cases in new york state and nationwide respectively and 5 and 3 for mortality for new york state and nationwide respectively the use of face-masks in public in times of outbreaks of respiratory diseases has a rich history although quite popular in some parts of the world notably asia the use of face-masks in public is somewhat controversial this was more evident in the us during the covid-19 leading ultimately to the recommendation to use face-masks home-made cloths masks in public by the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc on april 2 2020 our study shows that the use of high efficacy masks such as surgical masks with estimated efficacy of at least 70 will lead to a dramatic reduction of covid-19 burden if its coverage is high enough at least 70 in fact our study shows that even face-masks of low efficacy home-made cloths masks will lead to a dramatic reduction of disease burden albeit this will not lead to the elimination of the disease for example even face-mask efficacy of 25 can lead to a 63 and 64 reduction in the number of hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases at the pandemic peak in new york state and nationwide if 75 of the population wear face-masks in public these results are consistent with those reported by eikenberry et al 52 furthermore by generating contour plots for the control reproduction number of the model 21 c as a function of mask efficiency m and coverage cm our study shows that the use of high efficacy masks such as surgical masks with estimated efficacy of 75 will indeed lead to the elimination of covid-19 in both the state of new york and in the entire us nation if the coverage is high enough about 80 this study shows that the use of face-masks in public is always useful and their population-level impact increases will increases efficacy and coverage in particular even the use of low efficacy masks will greatly reduce the burden of the pandemic if the coverage in their usage in the community is high enough furthermore our study shows that combining the masks-based strategy with the strict social-distancing strategy is more effective than the singular implementation of either strategy for instance our study shows that covid-19 can be eliminated from the state of new york if the strict social-distancing measures implemented are combined with a face-masks strategy using a moderately-effective mask with efficacy of about 50 if only 30 of the residents of the state wear the masks the masks use compliance needed to eliminate the disease nationwide under this scenario with strict social-distancing nationwide is a mere 10 in summary our study suggests that like in the case of the other coronaviruses we have seen in the past namely sars and mers 10 covid-19 is a pandemic that appears to be controllable using basic non-pharmaceutical interventions particularly social-distancing and the use of face-masks in public especially when implemented in combinations the factors that are obviously critically-important to the success of the anti-covid-19 control efforts are the early implementation and enhancement of effectiveness of these intervention measures and ensuring their high adherencecoverage in the community the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper  age-structured impact of social distancing on the covid-19 epidemic in india rajesh singh r adhikari  the outbreak of the novel coronavirus covid-19 has been declared a pandemic by the who the structures of social contact critically determine the spread of the infection and in the absence of vaccines the control of these structures through large-scale social distancing measures appears to be the most effective means of mitigation here we use an age-structured sir model with social contact matrices obtained from surveys and bayesian imputation to study the progress of the covid-19 epidemic in india the basic reproductive ratio r0 and its time-dependent generalization are computed based on case data age distribution and social contact structure the impact of social distancing measures -workplace non-attendance school closure lockdown -and their efficacy with duration is then investigated a three-week lockdown is found insufficient to prevent a resurgence and instead protocols of sustained lockdown with periodic relaxation are suggested forecasts are provided for the reduction in age-structured morbidity and mortality as a result of these measures our study underlines the importance of age and social contact structures in assessing the countryspecific impact of mitigatory social distancing  the novel coronavirus covid-19 originated in wuhan and has spread rapidly across the globe the world health organization has declared it to be a pandemic in the absence of a vaccine social distancing has emerged as the most widely adopted strategy for its mitigation and control 1  the suppression of social contact in workplaces schools and other public spheres is the target of such measures since social contacts have a strong assortative structure in age the efficacy of these measures is dependent on both the age structure of the population and the frequency of contacts between age groups across the population as these are geographically specific equal measures can have unequal outcomes when applied to regions with significantly differing age and social contact structures quantitative estimates of the impact of these measures in reducing morbidity peak infection rates and excess mortality can be a significant aid in public-health planning this requires mathematical models of disease transmission that resolve age and social contact structures in this paper we present a mathematical model of the spread of the novel coronavirus that takes into account both the age and social contact structure 2  we use it to study the impact of the most common social distancing measures that have been initiated to contain the epidemic in india workplace non-attendance school closure janata curfew and lockdown the latter two of which attempt respectively complete cessation of public contact for brief and extended periods we emphasise that models that do not resolve age and social contact structure cannot provide information on the differential impact of each of these measures this information is vital since each of the specific social distancing measures have widely varying economic costs our model allows for the assessment of the differential impact of social dis-tancing measures further both morbidity and mortality from the covid-19 infection have significant differences across age-groups with mortality increasing rapidly in the elderly it is necessary therefore to estimate not only the total number of infections but also how this number is distributed across age groups our model allows for the assessment of such age-structured impacts of social distancing measures the remainder of our study is organized as follows in section ii we compare the age and social contact structure of the indian chinese and italian populations age distributions are sourced from the population pyramid website 3 and social contact structures from the stateof-the-art compilation of prem et al 2 obtained from surveys and bayesian imputation we show that even with equal probability of infection on contact the differences in age and social contacts in these three countries translate into differences in the basic reproductive ratio r 0  in section iii we study the progress of the epidemic in the absence of any mitigation to provide a baseline to evaluate the effect of mitigation in section iv we investigate the effect of social distancing measures and find that the three-week lockdown that commenced on 25 march 2020 is of insufficient duration to prevent resurgence alternative protocols of sustained lockdown with periodic relaxation can reduce the infection to levels where social contact tracing and quarantining may become effective estimates of the reduction in morbidity and mortality due to these measures are provided we conclude with a discussion on the possibilities and limitations of our study an appendix provide details of our mathematical model and the social contact structure it has been known from retrospective analyses of the 1918-19 pandemic that delays in introducing social distancing measures are correlated with excess mortality 4 5  our study confirms the urgency and need for sustained application of mitigatory social distancing italy the first column shows population pyramids by age and gender the second and third columns show the contact structures in households and workplaces with darker colours representing greater contacts the diagonal dominance of these matrices shows strong assortative mixing in all three countries significant differences appear in the off-diagonals in india the pentadiagonal character of the household contacts reflects the prevalance of three-generation households which are smaller in china and negligible in italy in fig1 we compare the age and contact structures of the populations of india china and italy the aim of this comparison is to highlight their differences and to emphasise the effect these have on the spread of an infectious disease panels a d and g show the fraction of the population separated by gender in five-year age groups terminating at the age of eighty the taj mahal dome shape of the indian age distribution is typical of those undergoing a demographic transition the narrower base of both chinese and italian populations is typical of aging populations at or near sub-replacement fertility panels b e and h show the contact between age groups in the household setting represented by matrices c h ij where darker squares indicate larger con-country basic reproductive ratio italy r0  119 table i  country-specific basic reproductive ratio of the age-structured sir model for fixed probability of infection on contact  and unit rate of recovery see text the difference between countries is attributed to their differing age and social contact structures tacts as noted in 2  the features common to all three are the diagonal dominance reflecting contact within age groups ie siblings and partners and the prominent offdiagonals separated by the mean inter-generation gap reflecting contacts between age groups ie children and parents the principal difference in india is the presence of a third dominant diagonal again separated by the mean inter-generation gap reflecting the prevalence of three-generation households this quantifies the significant contact between children and grand-parents and the possibility of substantial of transmission of contagion from third to first generations such contacts are smaller in china and negligible in italy panels c f and i show the contact c w ij between age groups in the workplace in contrast to households the work contact patterns are more homogeneous across age groups in all three countries indicating that the workplace contributes to the transmission of contagion between age groups that are otherwise largely separated from each other in the household the boundaries of these age groups are larger in india and china than in italy the matrices c s ij for schools shown for india in the appendix are strongly assortative with primary contacts within the school-going ages and smaller contacts between age groups reflecting student-teacher interactions the matrices c o ij for other spheres of contact shown for india in the appendix are strongly assortative reflecting the preferential social contact within age groups in this sphere but otherwise do not show systematic patterns in summary then in india the home provides the main channel of transmission between three generations the workplace provides the main channel of largely homogeneous transmission between working age groups the school the main channel of transmission within children and to a smaller extent between children and adult teachers while other spheres of contact due to the assortative mixing contribute to transmission within age groups do these differences have a quantitative impact on the transmission of disease we answer this affirmatively by comparing the basic reproductive ratio r 0 for each of these populations for an infectious disease with identical probability of infection on contact  and rate of recovery  for the age-structured sir model described in ap-pendix 1 these differences underline the importance of resolving the age and social contact structure of a population when forecasting the progress of an infection and the impact of social distancing measures with this background we now turn to our forecast for the progress of the covid-19 epidemic in india we fit our mathematical model described in detail in appendix to case data to estimate the probability of infection on contact  though our model allows for infectives to be both asymptomatic and symptomatic given the large uncertainty in estimating asymptomatic cases we assume all cases to be symptomatic a possible effect of this is to underestimate the severity of the outbreak we then run the model forward in time to forecast the progress of the epidemic with results shown in fig 2  panel a shows the fit to case data available upto 25th march 2020 and a three-week forecast in the absence of social distancing measures the basic reproductive ratio is r 0  2 10  panel b shows a five month forecast again in the absence of social distancing the peak infection is reached at the end of june 2020 with in excess of 150 million infectives the total number infected is estimated to be 900 million panel c shows the time-dependent effective basic reproductive ratio r eff 0 t which gives the dominant contribution to the linearised growth at any point in time this number is greater than unity before peak infection and smaller than unity beyond peak infection the serves as a useful measure of the local rate of change of infectives at any point in time in fig 3 we provide estimates of a the morbidity and b the excess mortality from the unchecked spread of the epidemic the fraction infected across age groups is the largest for the 15-19 year olds and least amongst the 75-79 year olds however due to the strong age-dependence in death rates mortality is amongst the least for the 15-19 year olds and greatest for the 60-64 year olds we emphasise that these numbers alarming as they are are counterfactuals as mitigation measures are already in place of this writing they do however point to the unbearable cost in human life that must be paid for the any lack of or delay in mitigatory action we now investigate the impact of social distancing measures on the unmitigated epidemic we assume that social distancing in any public sphere which in our model is partitioned into workplace school and all others removes all social contacts from that sphere this of course transfers the weight of these removed contacts to the household where people must now be confined we ignore this in the first instance we interpret the lockdown imposed from 25 march 2020 to remove all social contacts other than the household ones this is an optimistic interpretation but it does allow us to assess the most favourable impact of such a measure the results that follow then are an expected best-case scenarios then the time-dependent social contact matrix at time t is where c ij  c h ij  c w ij  c s ij  c o ij is the sum of all social contacts comprising of contributions from the household workplace schools and all others with obvious superscripts the control function described in appendix is constructed to reflect a social distancing measure that is initiated at t  t on and suspended at t  t off  the measure has a lag t w to be effective which we choose to be shorter than a day the function varies smoothly from zero to one in the window t on  t off  for repeated initiations and suspensions the control function is a sum of such terms with times adjusted accordingly it is possible of course to have differentiated controls which apply distinct social distancing measures at different times and for different durations we do not explore these here as the general setting for such an investigation would be within the framework of optimal control theory 6 with an appropriate cost function we postpone this to future work our results are show in in the four panels of fig 4 for four different control protocols panel a shows the effect of the three-week lockdown while this immediately changes the sign of the rate of change of infectives it does not reduce their number sufficiently to prevent a resurgence at the end of the lockdown period panel b shows the effect a suspension of the lockdown by 5 days followed by a further lockdown of 28 days this too does not reduce the number of infectives sufficiently to table ii  estimates of mortality in a 73 day window from 25th march with mitigatory social distancing cases 1 through 4 correspond respectively to panels a through d of fig4  the parameters are identical to those in fig 4  prevent resurgence panel c shows a protocol of three consecutive lockdowns of 21 days 28 days and 18 days spaced by 5 days of suspension this brings the number of infective below 10 where explicit contact tracing followed by quarantine may be successful in preventing a resurgence panel d shows a single lockdown period to reach the same number of infectives which our model predicts to be 49 days table ii show the excess mortality that can be expected for each of the social distancing measures above while we emphasise again that these are likely to be best-case scenarios the substantive message is that of the crucial importance of rapid and sustained social distancing measures in reducing morbidity and mortality we have presented a mathematical model of the spread of infection in a population that structured by age and social contact between ages since contagion spreads through the structure of social contacts and the latter varies with age it is necessary to resolve both these aspects of a population in any model that attempts to understand and predict how the modification of the social contact structure through social distancing impacts the spread of disease such models become useful when reliable estimates of contact structures are available we have combined our mathematical model with the stateof-the-art contact structure compilation of prem et al 2 and empirical case data available till the 25 march 2020 to assess the impact of social distancing measures in the spread of the covid-19 epidemic in india our principal conclusion is that the three-week lockdown will be insufficient our model suggests sustained periods of lockdown with periodic relaxation will reduce the number of cases to levels where individualised social contact tracing and quarantine may become feasible our mathematical model contains both asymptomatic and symptomatic infectives due to the paucity of data on the number of asymptomatic cases we have chosen to set these to zero this provides a lower bound on the number of morbidities and mortalities and the intensity and duration of the social distancing measures that are required for mitigation extensive testing of the popu-lation can provide data on the number of asymptomatic cases and this when incorporated into our model will provide more accurate estimates of the progress of the epidemic and the impact of mitigatory social distancing more generally there are uncertainties in all parameters of our model and these would translate into uncertainties in forecasts and estimates these uncertainties can be reduced with better availability of case data and the uncertainties can be quantified through bayesian error propagation analysis the principal regional differences in india appear to be in the time of initiation of the infection and for the cases to reach the critical size where community transmission begins though our model is not spatially resolved it can be applied region-wise by fitting it to regional case data in closing we issue the necessary caveats to quote g p box since all models are wrong the scientist must be alert to what is importantly wrong it is inappropriate to be concerned about mice when there are tigers abroad 7  the three components of our study involve the mathematical model the sources of data and the numerical code we have provided an explicit description of our mathematical model our data sources are referenced and our numerical implementation is open-sourced we take these to be essential desiderata for modeling to inform policy the mathematical model of an infection can aid in qualitative understanding and quantitative prediction but it should not be used in isolation from other perspectives including economic medical social and ethical ones rs acknowledges the support of a royal society-serb newton international fellowship ra thanks colleagues at kings college cambridge for their encouragement and forbearance while this work was being completed epidemiological model  we consider a population aggregated by age into m groups labelled by i  1 2    m  the population within age group i is partitioned into susceptibles s i  asymptomatic infectives i a i  symptomatic infectives i s i and removed individuals r i  the sum of these is the size of the population in age group i n i  s i  i a i  i s i  r i 8 9 10 11  we ignore vital dynamics and the change in age structure on the time scale of the epidemic therefore each n i and consequently the total population size fig 3  the second rows show the eigenvalue of the l matrix for      1 the magnitude of the largest eigenvalue determines the basic reproductive ratio the eigenanalysis helps estimate this quantity for each of the structures contributing to social contacts remain constant in time we assume that the rate of infection of a susceptible individual in age group i is where  is the probability of infection on contact assumed intrinsic to the pathogen and c a ij and c s ij are respectively the number of contacts between asymptomatic and symptomatic infectives in age-group j with susceptibles in age-group i reflecting the structure of social contacts we take the age-independent recovery rate  to be identical for both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals whose fractions are respectively  and  1 with these assumptions the progress of the epidemic is governed by the age-structured sir model the age structure of the population is specified the proportions n i n and the contact structure by the matrices c a ij and c s ij  we assume that symptomatic infectives reduce their contacts compared to asymptomatic infectives and set c s ij  f c a ij  f c ij  where 0  f  1 is the proportion by which this self-isolation takes place social contact model  partitioning contacts into spheres of home workplace school and all other categories the contact matrix can be written as for populations of fixed size the contact matrices obey the reciprocity relation n i c ij  n j c ji  social distancing model  we model large-scale social distancing measures by time-dependent controls u w t u s t and u o t imposed on the non-household contacts leading to the time-dependent contact matrix this allows for each one of the possible social distancing measures to be implemented at different points in and for different durations for a lockdown corresponding to the elimination of all social contacts other than household ones a single control function is sufficient staggered social distancing measures can be constructed from linear combinations of these controls basic reproductive ratio we obtain the basic reproductive ratio by linearising the dynamics about the disease-free fixed point where s i  n i  and the evolution of infectives is governed by the 2m  2m linear stability matrix the 2m  2m next generation matrix and 1 is the 2m  2m identity matrix collecting both the asymptomatic and symptomatic infectives in the vector i  i a  i s   i a 1      i a m  i s 1      i s m  their dynamics at early times is expressing l in its spectral basis of eigenvectors v and diagonal matrix of eigenvalues for the epidemic to grow it is sufficient for the spectral radius of l to be greater than unity the basic reproductive ratio is defined to be the spectral radius of l 12  if eigenvalue with the largest magnitude is real the basic reproductive ratio gives the most dominant contribution to the initial growth of the epidemic this shows that the basic reproductive ratio depends on a the probability of infection on contact  b the social contact structure encoded in the matrix c ij  c the fraction of asymptomatic to symptomatic infectives  and d the fraction by which symptomatic infectives self-isolate f  ie a combination of pathogen-specific social and individual factors the linearisation above can be carried out at any point in time t by making the replacements n i  s i t and c ij  c ij t in the expression for l giving the time-dependent stability matrix l t  we may define the spectral radius of l t as the effective time-dependent basic reproductive ratio r eff 0 t  l t   max  the linearised dynamics gives the number of infectives at time t  t to be it  t  exp l t  1t  it if the eigenvalue with the largest magnitude is real the effective basic reproductive ratio gives the most dominant contribution exp r eff 0 t  1t to the short time growth of the epidemic at time t the number of infectives will have a negative rate of growth if r eff 0 t is reduced to below unity upon effecting the social distancing measures therefore r eff 0 t is diagnostic of the instantaneous efficacy of social distancing measures and can be computed from the eigenspectrum directly assuming controls are imposed and relaxed periodically and over durations short compared to intrinsic relaxation times the progress of the epidemic can be described as a series of rising and possibly falling exponentials with dominant time scales determined by the spectral radii of l and l t  to a first approximation the dynamics of the rise and fall of infections with the removal and application of social distancing is governed by a pair of exponentials the rising time constant is r 0  1 while the falling time constant is r eff 0 t on   1 from fig   2c it is clear that the spectral radii are approximately constant away from peak infection times and therefore the time-dependence of the r eff 0 t can be neglected to first approximation numerical integration we choose m  16 to correspond to the 16 age groups into which the contact matrix data is partitioned the 3m  48 ordinary

and bayesian imputation  school closure and management practices during coronavirus outbreaks including covid-19 a rapid systematic review russell viner m simon russell j helen croker jessica packer joseph ward claire stansfield oliver mytton chris bonell robert booy   who declared the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 to be a pandemic on march 12 20201 on march 18 2020 the un educational scientific and cultural organization estimated that 107 countries had implemented national school closures related to covid-19 affecting 862 million children and young people roughly half the global student population this situation had rapidly escalated from 29 countries with national school closures a week before2 school closures are based on evidence and assumptions from influenza outbreaks that they reduce social contacts between students and therefore interrupt the transmission3
 school closures can affect deaths during an outbreak either positively through reducing transmission and the number of cases or negatively through reductions in the health-care workforce available to care for those who are sick studies of uk children and young people report that the mean number of daily social contacts during school holidays are approximately half that of school term days4 5 however contacts continue and mixing between children and adults and between children at different schools actually increases during holidays and school closures4 5 6 7 the evidence for the effectiveness of school closures and other school social distancing measures comes almost entirely from influenza outbreaks for which transmission of the virus tends to be driven by children it is unclear whether school measures are effective in coronavirus outbreaksfor example due to severe acute respiratory syndrome sars or middle east respiratory syndrome mers and most specifically covid-19 for which transmission dynamics appear to be different four systematic reviews8 9 10 11 of the effects of school closure on influenza outbreaks or pandemics suggest that school closure can be a useful control measure although the effectiveness of mass school closures is often low school closure strategies might be national regional local or reactive closure of individual schools in response to student infection rates a systematic review8 commissioned by the uk department of health in 2014 to inform influenza pandemic preparations included 100 epidemiological and 45 modelling studies and concluded that school closures can reduce transmission of pandemic influenza if instituted early in outbreaks school closures result in greater reductions in peak than in cumulative attack rates and according to modelling studies are likely to have the greatest effect if the virus has low transmissibility reproductive number r 2 and if attack rates are higher in children than in adults a second review9 of modelling studies by the same authors drew similar conclusions a 2018 review10 of 31 studies that addressed whether school closure had a quantifiable effect on influenza transmission reported that school closure reduced the peak of the related outbreak by a mean of 297 and delayed the peak by a median of 11 days they also reported that earlier school closure predicted a greater reduction in the outbreak peak although these estimates did not come from formal meta-analyses10 a 2015 systematic review11 of social distancing practices including school closures for influenza pandemics reported a wide variation in the reduction of transmission range 150 but noted that up to 70 of students might shift social contacts to other non-school sites during closures reducing the effect of closures a 2020 systematic review12 of school closures and other social distancing measures during influenza outbreaks also found compelling evidence that closures reduced transmission particularly among school-aged children 517 years however there was substantial evidence that transmission surged again once schools reopened and there was little consensus on the appropriate timing of closures let alone reopening of schools one way that school closures are effective during outbreaks might be through forcing parents to work at home and thus reducing work-related contacts however reviews have also noted the adverse effects of school closure including economic harms to working parents health-care workers and other key workers being forced from work to childcare and to society due to loss of parental productivity transmission from children to vulnerable grandparents loss of education harms to child welfare particularly among the most vulnerable pupils and nutritional problems especially to children for whom free school meals are an important source of nutrition8 10 11 social isolation itself brings a range of psychological harms13 a rapid review13 found evidence that during unplanned school closures childrens activities and contacts decreased but did not cease with some evidence that this was particularly so among older children and those whose parents disagreed with closures7
 the economic harms of school closures are high a uk study14 from 2008 suggested that approximately 16 of the workforce are the main caregivers for dependent children and are at very high risk of absenteeism if schools are closed a proportion that rises to 30 in the health and social care sectors in the usa unpublished estimates suggest that 29 of health-care workers have childcare obligations15 a 2010 economic modelling analysis16 of school closures as mitigating interventions during influenza outbreaks suggested that 4-week or 13-week closures reduced the clinical attack rate minimally but markedly increased the economic cost to the nation in particular through forced absenteeism by working parents in the uk france belgium and the netherlands costs have been estimated to be as high as 021 of uk national gross domestic product gdp per annum for school closure for 1213 weeks14 or up to 3 of gdp for an 8-week closure in us studies17 reviews have not summarised economic harms from school closure in detail but economic modelling from an influenza outbreak in hong kong china suggested that the most cost-effective models were selective local closures rather than city-wide closures18
 notably regardless of official school closure or other distancing policies unofficial student and staff absenteeism whether due to illness or precautionary can be very high during epidemics staff absenteeism can lead to forced local school closures19 school dismissalwhereby all students except the most vulnerable and children of health-care and other essential workers are sent home but the school stays openhas been suggested to be a less strict intervention than school closure although there is no evidence supporting its use separately to full closure20
 there are many other potential social distancing actions available for schools that are less drastic than full closure although these have received little attention21 a 2018 systematic review21 of such strategies noted that potential practices include suspending affected classes or year groups or changing the school organisation structure to reduce student mixing eg by closing playgrounds cancelling non-essential activities and meetings keeping students in constant class groups or classrooms increasing spacing between students in classes shortening the school week and staggering school start and lunch or break times across year groups or classes the review concluded that few studies have been done but that a small number of modelling studies supported the use of alternative strategies during influenza outbreaks22 23 there were no uk studies included in this review21 in the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic taiwan instituted class suspensions rather than school closures facilitated by keeping students in a homeroom class with a core teacher and having other teachers routinely moving between classes studies suggest that this approach was an effective social distancing measure in this outbreak while reducing social disruption24
 to reduce the transmission of covid-19 many countries had instituted large-scale or national closure of schools by march 2020 these actions appear largely based on assumptions that the benefits apparent in influenza outbreaks are also likely to be true for covid-19 there are several theoretical reasons why school closures might be less effective in covid-19 than in influenza outbreaks children contribute more to influenza transmission than do adults25 with low levels of immunity and high levels of transmission due to symptomatic disease however in the covid-19 pandemic thus far children appear to form a much lower proportion of cases than expected from their population although evidence for this is mixed and some data suggest that children might be as likely to be infected as adults but largely remain asymptomatic or have a mild form of the disease26 it remains unclear whether the low proportion of confirmed covid-19 cases among children in mainland china relate to a reduced risk of infection having subclinical or milder infections or specific population factors eg one-child policy evidence of covid-19 transmission through childchild contact or through schools is not yet available although family transmission has an important role in the outbreak in some previous coronavirus outbreaks evidence suggested that transmission in schools was very low or absent27 as modelling studies of school closures for influenza outbreaks rely on assumptions about the proportion of cases transmitted in schools being relatively high28 these models cannot be assumed to be informative regarding effectiveness for covid-19 emerging epidemiological data suggest little evidence of transmission of covid-19 through schools in china although this might reflect closure of schools during most of the outbreak notably school closures began with not reopening schools after the chinese new year holidays29 as of april 3 2020 taiwan has been recognised to have effectively minimised spread of covid-1930 but with national policies that avoided widespread planned school closures and instead mandated initially local class closures and subsequently local temporary school closures based on low thresholds for infected cases within individual schools30 in view of the scarce information and pressure on countries to consider school closures to deal with the covid-19 pandemic we did a systematic review of the literature to answer the question what is known about the use of and effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of school closure and other school social distancing practices on infection rates and transmission during coronavirus outbreaks we sought to include quantitative studies using diverse designs to model or empirically evaluate the effects of school closure and other school social distancing practices on infection rates and transmission during coronavirus outbreaks our search was designed to be inclusive of any studies providing data on

medrxiv for all papers using the search terms sars or mers or coronavirus or covid-19 we did not find it useful to include search terms relating to schools as the search facilities were not sophisticated all articles were triple screened by sjr hc and jp on title and abstract we excluded opinion pieces systematic reviews studies addressing other viruses university-specific settings epidemiological studies not examining intervention effects eg of prevalence of infection in schools and studies in other languages with no english translation all full-text articles identified were reviewed by rmv for each retrieved full-text article we hand searched included references and examined the citation chain for additional studies we did not attempt to rate the quality of included studies in this review we considered findings from preprint articles separately to published peer-reviewed articles the pubmed search identified 119 articles of which 22 full-text articles were assessed and eight included in the review searching the who global research database on covid-19 did not return relevant articles the search on medrxiv yielded 480 articles of which 36 full-text preprint articles were assessed and six included in the review hand searching of full-text articles identified one additional reference and one additional modelling study31 published as a non-peer-reviewed report was identified and included in total 16 studies were included in this review figure
 all published articles concerned the 2003 sars outbreak one preprint article32 concerned the effect of school closures on transmission of other endemic coronaviruses 229e nl63 oc43 and hku1 and five preprints and one report31 concerned the covid-19 pandemic six papers described or evaluated school actions as part of control measures undertaken in response to the sars outbreak in taiwan24 singapore33 34 35 and beijing china36 37 two papers were modelling studies that estimated sars transmission in schools38 or the effect of school closure39 on transmission in sars outbreaks one paper reported qualitative research with health-care workers after the sars outbreak relating to the effect of school closures40 five preprint articles reported on school closures during the covid-19 outbreak in mainland china41 42 43 and hong kong12 44 one preprint article described the impact of school closure on winter transmission of other human coronaviruses32 one report modelled the impact of school closures in the uk on transmission of covid-1931
 preprint studies41 42 report that school closures were initiated nationally across mainland china in late january 2020which manifested as delaying the restarting of schools after the chinese new year holidaysas part of a broader series of control measures during the covid-19 epidemic no data are available on the effectiveness of school closure as there was little variation in timing of closures closures were reportedly applied in all chinese cities uniformly and without delay and school closures were part of a broad range of quarantine and social distancing measures both of these studies concluded that the overall package of quarantine and social distancing was effective in reducing the epidemic in mainland china41 42 although the relative contribution of school closures was not assessed preprint studies of actions in hong kong related to covid-19 noted that a 4-week school closure was initiated across the city on feb 1 2020 approximately 1 week after the first cases were identified in hong kong school closures were implemented at the same time as a number of other stringent social distancing measures with school closures extended initially to march 2020 then to april 202012 44 collectively these measures were considered to have reduced the r below 1 controlling the spread of the outbreak12 as in mainland china no data were available from either paper on the effect of school closures separate from other measures cowling and colleagues12 noted that the social distancing measures implemented during the covid-19 outbreak reduced community transmission by 44 which was much greater than the estimated 1015 reduction in influenza transmission conferred by school closures implemented alone during the 2009 pandemic in hong kong44
 during the sars epidemic schools in beijing were closed on april 24 2003 approximately 6 weeks after the beginning of the outbreak and remained closed for over 2 months one study36 concluded that school closures made very little difference to the prevention of sars in beijing given the very low attack rate in schools before the closure and the low prevalence of disease in children a second study37 estimated the effective r for each day of the beijing sars outbreak noting that school closures occurred after the r had dropped below 1 and that school closures in this case added little to control of the outbreak class cancellation strategies in which upper high-school and college students remained on college campuses but did not attend classes were also widely used during the sars outbreak in mainland china45 there was no recorded transmission of sars in schools during the outbreak in mainland china46
 a review33 of the 2003 sars outbreak in singapore noted that twice daily mandatory temperature screening of all children aged 616 years in schools was part of the containment measures instituted pupils were excluded from school if their temperature was more than 378c for students aged 12 years or younger or more than 375c for students older than 12 years although there were school children diagnosed with sars in singapore none of them were identified through temperature screening35 all educational facilities in singapore were closed for 3 weeks from march 27 2003 the sars outbreak ran from late february to may 2003 together with suspension of other activities to prevent the congregation of large groups of children34
 a review24 of responses in taiwan to the sars outbreak and 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic noted that schools were designated as alternative health-care sites in case the health system was overwhelmed during the sars outbreak but that there were no school social distancing measures including closures introduced during the sars outbreak this finding is in contrast to the use of class suspensions during the h1n1 pandemic in taiwan24
 schools were also closed in hong kong during the sars epidemic however the extent to which this was at a city-wide or local level is unclear there was no evidence of spread of the infection in schools with spread among children almost entirely through family settings and living in the same apartment blocks as infected cases27
 a preprint study by jackson and colleagues32 used routine viral surveillance to examine the effects on transmission of endemic human coronaviruses 229e nl63 oc43 and hku1 and other viruses of a 5-day closure of nearly all schools in the greater seattle metropolitan area in february 2019 due to extreme weather on transmission of these viruses their study estimated that the school closure resulted in a 56 95 ci 4169 reduction in coronavirus infections similar to influenza h1n1 76 5297 but higher than influenza h3n2 31 2532 all of which were prevalent at the time32
 a preprint modelling study43 examined the effect of school closure together with other social distancing measures in wuhan china the study used transmission data representative of covid-19 but it was unclear whether epidemiological data from the outbreak were used further in the modelling this study concluded that the package of social distancing measures was effective in reducing the final size and peak incidence of the outbreak while also delaying the peak43 however it did not examine the effect of school closures relative to other measures it modelled different timings of relaxation of social distancing measures and concluded that earlier relaxation after 2 months of restrictions risked a second peak whereas 3 months of restrictions did not result in a second peak43
 only one study examined the effect of school closures separately to other social distancing measures in a non-peer-reviewed but widely cited report from an established group ferguson and colleagues31 modelled the estimated effects of a range of different social distancing measures and combinations of measures they used uk population and schools data together with data on transmission dynamics reported from the covid-19 outbreak in wuhan using data from previous influenza outbreaks they assumed that per-capita contacts within schools were double those in households workplaces or the community and that overall approximately a third of transmission occurred in schools they modelled a scenario in which all schools and 25 of universities were closed and where the effect on non-school social contacts was an increase of 50 in household contact rates for families with children and a 25 increase in community contacts during the closure they concluded that school closure as an isolated measure was predicted to reduce total deaths by around 24 during a covid-19 outbreak in the uk whereas single measures such as case isolation would be more effective and a combination of measures would be the most effective the authors concluded that school closure is predicted to be insufficient to mitigate never mind suppress the covid-19 pandemic in isolation which is in contrast to seasonal influenza epidemics where children are the key drivers of transmission31
 an early modelling study of a sars-like illness in school children concluded that a school closure policy would reduce the effective r by 1241 depending on the proportion of between-household mixing that occurred during school hours the study noted that modelling was based on plausible assumptions regarding characteristics of the sars virus noting that obtaining good quality estimates of epidemiological parameters for sars was difficult as the outbreak was contained rapidly39
 a modelling study of the transmission of sars in hospitals and in elementary school classrooms in taiwan using data from the 2003 sars outbreak concluded that a single case of sars would infect an average of 26 secondary cases in a population from transmission in hospital whereas less than 1 secondary infection would be generated per case in a school classroom38
 conflict between the work and family requirements of health-care professionals during the sars epidemic was explored in qualitative research with 100 canadian emergency and critical care nurses many of whom had been involved with the sars outbreak40 the study found that health-care workers experience substantial personal dilemmas in balancing work and family commitments particularly relating to childcare needs if schools are closed and childcare services are unavailable the study concluded that there was a need for provision of adequate resources to protect the families of health-care workers during outbreaks to maintain maximal staffing40
 this review provides the first summary of data on school closures and other school social distancing practices during coronavirus outbreaks we were able to include only nine published studies and seven non-peer-reviewed studies we decided to include unreviewed studies as data would not otherwise be available on covid-19 although findings were interpreted with caution except for one modelling study none of the included studies were designed to specifically examine the effectiveness of school distancing measures thus data provided on the effect of school measures were of relatively low quality we identified a remarkable dearth of policy-relevant data on the implementation of school social distancing during coronavirus outbreaks this finding is perhaps not surprising for the rapidly emerging covid-19 pandemic but previous coronavirus outbreaks such as sars and mers provide limited information about the effectiveness of school closures and no data on cost-effectiveness no data on other less disruptive school social distancing practices during coronavirus outbreaks were identified data from the sars outbreak in mainland china hong kong and singapore suggest that school transmission played no substantial role in the outbreak and that school closures and other activities such as school temperature monitoring did not contribute to control of infection transmission it is possible that these findings reflect an effect of school closures in rapidly stopping transmission however this is unlikely as schools remained open for prolonged periods during the early part of the outbreak modelling studies from the sars outbreak produced different results although becker and colleagues39 estimated that school closure resulted in potentially important reductions in transmission liao and colleagues38 estimated that transmission in school classrooms was low school closures were rapidly deployed across mainland china and hong kong in early 2020 as part of a wider set of control measures for covid-19 with the result that no data were available on the comparative effectiveness of school closure interventions in isolation authors of preprint studies41 44 concluded that school closures likely contributed to the control of covid-19 in china as part of a package of very broad quarantine measures however they provide no data to support this assertion and indeed it might be very difficult to disentangle the relative contribution of school closures modelling studies from the covid-19 pandemic support the use of national school closure as part of a package of social distancing measures yet the only study to examine school closures as a separate intervention warned that the impact was relatively marginal given the reasonable assumptions that household and community contacts would rise as a consequence there are few data available from the literature on coronavirus outbreaks to guide countries on the use of school closures or other school social distancing practices during the covid-19 pandemic available evidence is consistent with a broad range of impacts of school closures from little effect on reducing transmission through to more substantial effects yet the economic costs and potential harms of school closure are undoubtedly very high as evidence from coronavirus outbreak control is scarce we must turn to evidence for the benefits of school closures from influenza epidemics and pandemics school closures have been widespread in some countries during influenza pandemics and many studies report important effects on reducing transmission and the size of the pandemic yet there is considerable heterogeneity in the impact of school closures on transmission depending on characteristics of influenza serotype transmission systematic reviews of influenza outbreaks suggest that school closures are likely to have the greatest effect if the virus has low transmissibility r2 particularly if attack rates and transmission are higher in children than in adults8 although our information on sars-cov-2 remains incomplete this appears not to be the case with covid-19 outbreaks reported r values for covid-19 are high 2547 although children appear to contract infection at the same rate as adults they largely have mild or asymptomatic forms of the disease and appear to be less likely to spread the virus through coughing or sneezing however a precise understanding is as yet lacking notably analyses using uk clinical data from the 1957 asian influenza pandemic suggest that school closures would reduce the epidemic size by less than 10 when the r was similar to that of covid-19 ie 253548 reviews also note that the benefits of school closure might be less than what have been assumed or modelled as social contacts between children and between children and adults continue as part of informal childcare and non-school gatherings of children and young people11 this conclusion is a particular concern for covid-19 with its higher mortality among older people as around 40 of the uks grandparents provide regular childcare for their grandchildren49
 the who director-general noted on march 12 2020 that all countries must strike a fine balance between protecting health preventing economic and social disruption and respecting human rights1 currently the evidence to support national closure of schools to combat covid-19 is very weak and data from influenza outbreaks suggest that school closures could have relatively small effects on a virus with covid-19s high transmissibility and apparent low clinical effect on school children at the same time these data also show that school closures can have profound economic and social consequences more research is urgently needed on the effectiveness of school closures and other school social distancing practices to inform policies related to covid-19 we also need more detailed knowledge about how covid-19 affects children and young people as the role of school measures in reducing covid-19 transmission depends on the susceptibility of children to infection and their infectiousness once infected12 however observational studies might be uninformative if closures are national and implemented at the same time as other mitigation measures better learning might come from countries that have instituted later or subnational closures modelling studiesparticularly those parameterised for covid-19 in children and those that can consider interaction with other contextual factors eg timing parents working from home and additional social mixing as a consequence of school closures or different strategies national vs staged roll outare likely to be more informative and are urgently needed these findings pose a dilemma for policy makers seeking measures to protect populations school closure presents an apparently common-sense method of dramatically reducing spread of disease and the evidence from previous influenza outbreaks appears compelling however policy makers need to be aware of the equivocal evidence when proposing or implementing national or regional school closures for covid-19 given the very high costs of lengthy school closures during pandemics decisions about closures and their timing and length involve a series of trade-offs between conflicting factors and a substantial loss of health-care staff to childcare duties during closures might substantially reduce any benefit to health systems and populations brought by closures of schools50 nonetheless in a context of high rates of staff absence through disease school systems will be under strain and schools remaining open only for the children of health-care and other essential workers might be a better strategy than a haphazard process of schools closing and therefore providing no childcare for any essential workers the scale and speed of school closures are unprecedented globally it is unclear how long countries can maintain tight suppression measures before behavioural fatigue in the population occurs31 given predictions that social distancing measures might need to be in place for many months or even years31 there is an urgent need to identify how countries can safely return students to education and parents to work education is one of the strongest predictors of the health and the wealth of a countrys future workers and the impact of long-term school closure on educational outcomes future earnings the health of young people and future national productivity has not been quantified once the number of covid-19 cases begin to fall the measures used to achieve suppression might evolve over time schools have begun to reopen in parts of china2 and it will be essential for studies to monitor the effect of the reopening of schools on the numbers of covid-19 cases examining countries that have not implemented school closures will also be important taiwan reopened schools in late february 2020 relatively early in the outbreak it has not yet initiated further large-scale closures but has been recognised to have effectively minimised spread of covid-19 policy makers and researchers should also look to other school social distancing interventions that are much less disruptive than full school closure and might substantially contribute to maintaining the control of this pandemic although strong evidence is not available for the effectiveness of these practices they might be implementable with much less disruption financial costs or harms modelling and observational studies are urgently needed to guide policy on the opening of schools once the pandemic is under control  impact of policy interventions and social

npis on the effective reproductive number rt and other covid-19 outcomes in us states in order to standardize the stage of disease spread in each state this study analyzes the weeks immediately after each state reached 500 cases the primary outcomes were average rt in the week following 500 cases and doubling time from 500 to 1000 cases linear and logistic regressions were performed in r to assess the impact of various npis while controlling for population density gdp and certain health metrics this analysis was repeated for deaths with doubling time from 50 to 100 deaths and included several

transmission metrics  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 causing coronavirus disease 2019 covid- 19 was first reported in wuhan china in december of 2019 1 it quickly spread globally and was characterized as a pandemic by the world health organization who in march 2020 local and national governments worldwide have employed a variety of nonpharmaceutical interventions npis to mitigate the impact of this novel coronavirus mandated policies including limitations on mass gatherings business closures and stay-at-home orders have aimed to encourage social distancing and flatten the curve 2 3 4 as of april 30 2020 over 3249000 covid-19 cases have been confirmed worldwide with more than 1067000 cases and 62000 resulting deaths in the united states 5 in an effort to contain the virus broad shutdowns have resulted in severe economic impacts including 26 million americans filing for unemployment within a 5 week period 6 simultaneously there is concern that quarantine puts people at increased risk of domestic violence and severe psychological suffering as well as physical inactivity weight gain behavioral addiction disorders and insufficient sunlight exposure 7 8 9 10 11 12 it is therefore important to quantify the effects of social distancing measures on disease spread in order to guide future policy decisions which may continue to limit economic security and healthy lifestyles previous modeling studies predicted that social distancing policies could be critical in mitigating the spread of covid-19 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 recent reports have begun exploring the effectiveness of social distancing in reducing disease spread at the country level and local county level 2 20 21 22 mandated npis have also been associated with reduced transmission of sars-cov-2 in wuhan 23 further the united states cdc has demonstrated that social distancing policies have reduced community mobility in seattle san francisco new york city and new orleans 3 however literature exploring the actual effects of various social distancing policies on disease transmission across states in the us remains sparse furthermore efforts to quantify the effects on transmission have not accounted for different stages of disease burden discounting that the efficacy of policy changes will likely differ if they are instituted in the context of 20 cases or 10000 this study accounts for the stage of disease spread by selecting a normalized point on the epidemic curve analyzing each state in the week following its 500th case and assessing how different npis influence the burgeoning case load in order to retrospectively analyze metrics of disease spread and mortality case and death data were compiled up to april 30th 2020 from the covid-19 time series made available by the new york times daily estimates of the viruss effective reproduction number rt were collected for all 50 us states and the district of columbia from rtlive which tracks covid-19 spread and provides state-level estimates of rt details on the methodology they used to calculate rt are publicly available online to standardize the stage of disease spread and minimize the confounding effect of increased caseload on disease transmission across states these analyses were conducted in the weeks after a states 500th case the 500 case threshold was chosen to ensure that each state had a sustained epidemic while still encompassing almost all states the primary outcomes were average rt in the weeks following the 500th case and doubling time from 500 to 1000 cases both measures of disease transmission rt is a real-time measure of the basic reproduction number r0 which estimates the number of infections expected from one case interacting with a susceptible population a secondary analysis investigated the effects of npis on doubling time from 50 to 100 deaths and case fatality rate again the 50 deaths threshold was chosen to ensure that each state had faced enough covid-19 spread to experience sustained morbidity while still encompassing most states only a minority of states have reached 500 deaths to date so the threshold used for the case analysis was not applicable a rough estimate of case fatality rate was calculated by simply dividing deaths by total cases for each state in order to better understand effects of npi on social mobility and the effects of social mobility on disease spread social distancing metrics were collected from the covid-19 community mobility reports made available by google these reports compare the average time spent in places of residence based on google location tracking data compared to the median value for the corresponding day of the week during the 5-week period jan 3-feb 6 2020 averages of these measures were calculated for the week after stay-at-home order to assess the impact of npi on social distancing furthermore average increase in time spent in residential areas was also calculated for the week before the 500th case to assess the impact of social distancing on disease transmission directly we tested the association between five unique policy changes and the change in rt stay-athome orders school closures closure of non-essential businesses and bans on mass gatherings demographic data including population density population size and gdp were obtained from publicly available data for each state and territory and examined as covariates in multivariable models state-wide health information including the percentage of state residents with diabetes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd current and ever smokers and cardiovascular disease were included to control for potential confounding effect lastly the number of hospital beds and physicians per 1000 people were used

analyzes state-level transmission rates of covid-19 after each states 500th case grouping them according to policies implemented prior to their date of 500 cases in order to determine the efficacy of various social distancing measures in states that implemented a stayat-home order prior to reaching 500 cases we observe a significant decrease in the effective viral transmission rate subsequent multivariable analyses indicate that this effect may have been driven by a state-wide increase in the amount of time spent at home we also determine that enacting stay-at-home orders prior to the 500th case significantly increased the time it took to reach 1000 cases but find no association between social distancing policies and deaths or case fatality rate early data to support the efficacy of various npi measures in reducing sars-cov-2 spread has relied mostly on model-based analysis rather than empirical data derived from observations in the real world 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 as cases have accumulated around the world it has become increasingly possible to retrospectively assess the impact of npis on measured outcomes as presented in this study previous characterization of disease burden across research studies and news sources has largely relied on the metrics of cumulative case and death counts however these metrics are unidirectional and do not account for bidirectional changes in the rate of viral transmission over time a much more powerful metric for predicting an epidemics trajectory in this study we examine effective reproduction number rt as the primary metric of disease burden which describes the viruss transmission potential in real-time and can thus account for the impact of contextual changes in policy and behavior on disease spread retrospective analyses of npi impact on disease spread to date have primarily consisted of cross-country analyses or focused on outcomes in china 2 20 21 23 24 25 in one comparison of 20 countries banholzer et al found public venue closures to be the most effective npi in reducing new cases followed by public gathering bans non-essential business closures and international travel restrictions with school closures decreasing case count minimally interestingly they found lockdowns to be among the least effective policies in mitigating disease spread 2 analysis at the city level in china has also associated comprehensive social distancing measures with preventing disease spread 23 24 in wuhan a reduction in rt was shown to chronologically follow implementation of traffic restrictions home confinement centralized quarantine and other social distancing measures 23 the united states presents unique challenges in epidemiological management due to its governmental emphasis on state and local autonomy as such an analysis of the pandemics impact in the us should account for potentially different trajectories across states and at the local level outside of china local-level studies exploring the effectiveness of npis have been scarce and more granular analysis across us states is currently warranted 22 26 27 ebell  bagwell-adams compared differences in social distancing measures employed by counties in the state of georgia they demonstrated that clarke county which implemented a shelter in place policy two weeks before it was adopted at the state level had increased case doubling time compared to surrounding counties and the state as a whole 22 siedner et al performed a time-series analysis to compare disease spread before and after statewide social distancing policies were put in place and found that decreases in epidemic growth rates were shown to occur four days after implementation of each states first social distancing policy 28 however in this section of their analysis the authors did not differentiate between alternate social distancing measures additionally once an initial policy was in place they found no significant effect of further enacting statewide lockdowns 28 in this study we compare the effects of different policies finding stay-at-home orders to be most effective in reducing transmission furthermore by normalizing disease burden across states to 500 cases we standardize the time point in each states outbreak lasry et al used cell phone data from safegraph to assess the relationship between various social distancing policies and percentage of mobile devices leaving home in four major us cities 3 they found that combinations of multiple social distancing policies including limits on gatherings and school closures significantly reduced mobility stay-at-home orders further reduced movement in their study as well 3 by including cell phone tracking data made publicly available by google this study directly assesses the connection between mobility and virus transmission at the state level in agreement with lasry et al we demonstrate that stay-athome orders significantly increase the amount of time people spend at home 3 further our multivariable linear regression analysis which demonstrates that percent time spent at home was the most significant modulator of rt indicates that the primary driving factor in reducing viral transmission was limiting mobility in conjunction these results provide evidence that npis can be useful in controlling covid-19 outbreak by effectively reducing social mobility in our analysis we found that stay-at-home order the strictest policy included in our models had the most significant effect on disease spread this measure both reduced transmission rate and increased doubling time from 500 to 1000 cases within states comparatively mass gathering restrictions had the least effect on reducing rt across states as several states across the us prepare to ease social distancing restrictions in the coming weeks our results suggest that mass gathering restrictions alone may have less of an effect in maintaining rt values below 1 careful monitoring of rt values in these states may be necessary to proactively identify and control potential recurrent outbreaks in order to assess the efficacy of stay-at-home orders at different points in disease outbreak we also compared states by number of confirmed covid-19 cases at the time this policy went into effect we found that reduction in average rt the week following stay-at-home order was consistent across variation in number of cases at the time of policy implementation states benefited from similar reduction in rt regardless of how many confirmed cases they had before their stay-at-home orders went into effect however this finding does not imply that timing of stay-at-home order is unimportant since high rt in the weeks prior will contribute to greater overall caseload furthermore when looking at more recent rt averages for the week of april 23rd to april 30th states that have yet to implement a state-wide stay-at-home order currently have amongst the highest values in the country accounting for four of the eight states with an average rt  1 suggesting that they have not yet successfully contained the virus our analysis found no significant correlation between mobility or social distancing policy and time from 50 to 100 deaths this lack of association may be a result of studying outcomes early on in each states disease outbreak during this relatively early timeframe states may not have reached hospital capacity yet future studies that look at death rates later on may find that social distancing measures help prevent overflow of healthcare systems and therefore reduce fatality at this time more longitudinal data is warranted to more accurately characterize the relationship between social distancing efforts and these lagging indicators of disease burden

version posted may 6 2020  our study has a number of important limitations to consider first our state-level analysis may miss variation at the county level individual counties may have implemented social distancing measures before mandated state-wide thus states considered to lack certain policies at the time of 500 cases may in reality have been benefiting from more localized control similarly county variation in covid-19 cases resulting deaths population density and other demographic factors were not accounted for future analyses should consider county-level data to account for these local variations our mobility results are further limited by potential flaws in googles publicly available phone data that this study relies on for mobility analyses as noted by lasry et al data that tracks phones not people are subject to distortion by individuals with multiple devices and people leaving home without their phones 3 further these data do not differentiate between individuals leaving home but remaining distanced from others and people who ignore social distancing guidelines altogether while in public finally our analysis focused exclusively on social distancing policies and did not account for other transmission preventing npi that states may have employed such as requiring masks lastly though rates of testing have been noted to vary widely between states and serve as a potentially confounding variable the model used to calculate rt values analyzed here corrects for these state-wide differences in testing the rt model also accounts for variation in serial interval and delay between symptom onset and a positive test result however it does not account for any period in which individuals are infectious but asymptomatic which mounting evidence suggests is an important factor in sars-cov-2 dynamics as such future analyses of rt should be calibrated with this in mind reducing covid-19 spread to alleviate overburdened healthcare systems has become an international priority and understanding the effectiveness of policy interventions is paramount disease modeling has indicated that social distancing is a critical measure to achieve this goal but few studies have validated this finding with emerging case data furthermore few have analyzed epidemiology across states in the country with the largest disease burden the united states this study indicates that stay-at-home orders limitations on mass gatherings educational facility closures and non-essential businesses closures are all effective measures at reducing transmission rates thereby flattening the curve among these policies stay-at-home orders had the largest effect and as states aim to step down from such policies metrics of disease transmission should be carefully monitored to limit recurrent outbreaks ultimately adherence to social distancing appears to be the driving force behind these policies as states with stay-at-home orders but poor adherence were found to experience similar outcomes to those without such policies by more rigorously characterizing the state-level strategies that have proved most effective at reducing disease burden this study aims to provide stakeholders with a more standardized data-driven framework to guide future policy decisions  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv

model study yuzhen zhang bin jiang jiamin yuan yanyun tao  the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 which originated in wuhan china constitutes a public health emergency of international concern with a very high risk of spread and impact at the global level we developed data-driven susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantine-recovered seiqr models to simulate the epidemic with the interventions of social distancing and epicenter lockdown population migration data combined with officially reported data were used to estimate model parameters and then calculated the daily exported infected individuals by estimating the daily infected ratio and daily susceptible population size as of jan 01 2020 the estimated initial number of latently infected individuals was 3801 95-ci 37983810 with 30 days of substantial social distancing the reproductive number in wuhan and hubei was reduced from 22 95-ci 1439 to 158 95-ci 134207 and in other provinces from 256 95-ci 243263 to 165 95-ci 156176 we found that earlier intervention of social distancing could significantly limit the epidemic in mainland china the number of infections could be reduced up to 989 and the number of deaths could be reduced by up to 993 as of feb 23 2020 however earlier epicenter lockdown would partially neutralize this favorable effect because it would cause in situ deteriorating which overwhelms the improvement out of the epicenter to minimize the epidemic size and death stepwise implementation of social distancing in the epicenter city first then in the province and later the whole nation without the epicenter lockdown would be practical and cost-effective  the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 initially taken as pneumonia of unknown etiology emerged in december 2019 wuhan hubei province china the causative pathogen was announced by the chinese center for disease control and prevention china cdc on jan 08 2020 to be a novel coronavirus 1  lately named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 2  covid-19 broke out in wuhan in january 2020 and spread to the whole hubei province the rest of china and abroad with astonishing speed on jan 31 2020 the world health organization who announced that covid-19 constitutes a public health emergency of international concern as of feb 28 there were 78961 cases confirmed in china and 4691 cases confirmed in 51 other countries on that day who increased the assessment of the risk of spread and risk of impact of covid-19 to very high at the global level 3  apart from the intrinsic infectivity of the virus population mobility and epidemic prevention and control measures could affect the prevalence scale unfortunately the prevalence of covid-19 encountered the spring festival migration of china the worlds largest annual human migration as hundreds of millions of people rush home for family reunions in addition the epicenter wuhan is the capital of hubei province of china it has a population of more than 15 million including resident and floating population and it situates at the transportation hub in the central china area as of jan 23 2020 more than 5 million people were migrating out of wuhan according to official accounts 3  emergency monitoring and close contact management in wuhan was carried out since jan 03 2020 china cdc level 2 emergency response activated on jan 06 and level 1 emergency response activated on jan 15 1  on jan 20 2020 covid-19 was included in the statutory report of class b infectious diseases managed as class a infectious diseases by the national health commission of china the chinese government locked down the wuhan city on jan 23 and then locked down other cities of hubei province immediately after by jan 25 30 provincial governments in china activated first-level public health emergency response hence in addition to strict quarantine management substantial social distancing measures to limit population mobility and to reduce within-population contact rates were executed almost in the whole country for example public activities were canceled communities adopted enclosed management the national holiday of spring festival and the winter vacation were extended so that work resumption and school re-opening could be extensively postponed in addition people were required to wear facemasks in public however with all those efforts the prevalence of covid-19 was escalating epidemic prevention and control strategies need to be re-examined vaccine and antiviral drug development is the ultimate way to defeat a virus but it is time-consuming non-pharmaceutical interventions to interrupt transmission could be implemented immediately gaining time for pharmaceutical development briefly there were three steps of non-pharmaceutical interventions for reducing contact rates between susceptible individuals and infected individuals first quarantine management ie quarantining the infected the suspicious and their close contacts second social distancing to confine within-population contact third locking down the epicenter to prevent further exportation of infected and latently infected individuals to other regions quarantine management is a fundamental measure ought to be taken once the human-human transmission is confirmed theoretically if substantial social distancing andor epicenter lockdown were implemented early enough there would be no prevalence or no spreading but realistically it takes time for preliminary investigation besides rigorous measures would bring about deep social influences and economic consequences so it is challenging to choose the right response at the right scale in the right area at the right time 4  especially when the transmission pattern and clinical characteristics were not fully understood the importance of non-pharmaceutical control measures requires further research to quantify their impact 3  mathematical models are useful to evaluate the possible effects on epidemic dynamics of preventive measures and to improve decision-making in global health 5 6  in this study we developed data-driven susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantine-recovered seiqr models to simulate the epidemic under the interventions of social distancing and epicenter lockdown and to evaluate the impact of earlier interventions on the epidemic size and death number totally and respectively in wuhan hubei province and 12 other provinces and municipalities population migration data combined with officially reported data were used to estimate model parameters the number of the latently infected individuals and daily exportation of the infected and latently infected from wuhan our work provided evidence for the decision-making concerning prevention and control of the ongoing covid-19 epidemic in other countries and future infectious disease epidemic in this study seiqr models were developed to simulate the covid-19 epidemic in china we built three seiqr models to simulate the epidemic in wuhan the rest of hubei province and other provinces and municipalities in china respectively other provinces and municipalities studied here include nine provinces ie zhejiang guangdong henan hunan anhui jiangxi jiangsu shangdong and sichuan and three municipalities ie chongqing beijing and shanghai in china which covered 90 infections in mainland china for convenience hubei represents the rest of hubei province excluding wuhan and other provinces represents the above-mentioned provinces and municipalities in the text daily latent infected ratio the daily exposed individuals exported from wuhan to hubei the daily exposed individuals exported from wuhan to other provinces lockdown social distancing estimated latent infected individuals figure 1  the framework of building models for wuhan hubei and other provinces we added the intervention measures ie social distancing and epicenter lockdown to models these models were able to simulate the covid-19 epidemic with interventions activated on different dates figure 1 describes the framework of building estimation models the reported confirmed recovered and death cases were used to build initial models for wuhan hubei and other provinces since there could be considerable under-reporting bias in the epicenter for lots of reasons we assumed that the cases reported by other provinces were more accurate therefore the model built on the cases reported by other provinces could estimate more accurately the number of infections the reproductive number infectious period and mean latent of models built for wuhan and hubei should be revised based on the latently infected individuals the number of latently infected individuals in wuhan before jan 23 was estimated by the latently infected ratio and the daily population migration data from wuhan to the rest of china in the revised models of wuhan and hubei parameters involving social distancing measures such as the removed rate the decline factor of the reproductive number and the isolating ratio of susceptible individuals inherited from the initial models the daily latent infected ratio is calculated based on the daily number of exposed individuals in wuhan and the daily susceptible population size through the daily latent infected ratio and the daily number of individuals leaving wuhan the daily number of exposed individuals exported to hubei and other provinces can be estimated wuhan has a population of around 1539 million including a resident population of 9 million and nearly 639 million floating population exported before jan 23 7  the population exported from wuhan is the main source of imported cases in the rest of china the travelers flowed from the rest of hubei to other provinces between two of the other provinces and heading to wuhan were not considered in this study we assumed that the population exported from wuhan was susceptible and exposed population during the period of time from jan 01 to jan 22 2020 the number of exported population from wuhan was derived from two sources a domestic passenger number by air train and road provided by cao z et al 7  and b international outbound passenger number by air departed from tianhe airport wuhan china provided by a commercial app named flight steward officially reported case data by the national health commission were used to estimate the parameters of seiqr models as of dec 31 2019 there were 47 confirmed covid-19 cases in wuhan 1  we took that 47 cases as the initial number of infected individuals in the model from jan 1 to 23 2020 the estimated latent infected ratio in wuhan is 012 7  as of jan 23 the accumulated number of latently infected individuals in wuhan and exported infected individuals estimated by the latently infected ratio were 10800 and 76776 respectively the estimated number of latently infected individuals by jan 01 2020 in wuhan was 3809 95-ci 37983810 the estimated base population size of daily susceptible individuals was 2106 the base reproductive number r0 of wuhan and hubei was set to 22 95-ci 1439 referring to the study of liu q et al 1  when the interventions continue for 30 days r0 was reduced to 158 95-ci 134207 in other provinces the estimated average base reproductive number r0 was 252 95-ci 243263 and with 30-day interventions r0 was reduced to 165 95-ci 163169 the estimated infectious period ti was 226 days 95-ci 214239 in wuhan and hubei and was 375 days 95-ci 343413 in other provinces the estimated mean latent was 101 days 95-ci 8821178 in wuhan and hubei and was 1101 days 95-ci 9511306 in other provinces the estimated removed rate was 00125 95-ci 00080017 in wuhan 00175 95-ci

preprint in perpetuity the results of virtual experiments vary some research suggested social distancing is effective under the condition of early activation and long-lasting implement of combined measures 8  strict implement 6 9  and spontaneously adopted 10  some concluded the effectiveness was mild 11  some argued that moderate social distancing can worsen the disease outcome 6 9 but real-world studies are rare here we quantified the impact of social distancing on the epidemic size in the real world providing evidence that social distancing is effective to interrupt the transmission of the respiratory pathogen especially with early implementation and to a substantial extent activating social distancing at the possible earliest time in the epicenter could gain time for the preparation of regions out of epicenter and reduce wide range socioeconomic impact the third question is the necessity and the timing of the epicenter lockdown unexpectedly our results showed that the significant decrease of the epidemic size by earlier social distancing would be partially neutralized by earlier epicenter lockdown further investigation suggested that the influences of epicenter lockdown on epidemic size and death differed between wuhan and non-wuhan regions earlier lockdown of wuhan would deteriorate the situation in situ but would largely lower the infection number in the rest of hubei province and other provinces the reasons may be as follows after lockdown a portion of the infected and the latently infected the exposed in the model would accumulate in wuhan instead of exporting outside theoretically it would not change the total infection or death number but we found the conversion rate from the close contacts to the exposed is much higher in wuhan than in other provinces as listed in table s1 of supplement material so is the death rate quickly surging infected patients in wuhan exerted extraordinary pressure on local healthcare systems resulting in an acute shortage of medical resources and healthcare workers then the fast-growing infection and resource shortage fueled each other in a vicious cycle numerous close contacts could not be quarantined for medical observation plentiful infected patients could not be hospitalized or quarantined for treatment then they would contact more susceptible persons and infect more people besides unhospitalised and under-treated patients suffered a higher death rate taken together the accumulation of several issues to be noted when interpreting our work one is about the comprehensiveness of the interventions in addition to the mainly discussed strategies of social distancing and epidemic lockdown measures implemented in china also included forceful medical supports to wuhan reinforced quarantine management and public health measures eg requiring people to wear masks in public raising public awareness for hand hygiene although these measures were not specifically discussed their effectiveness has been illustrated by the adjustment of daily removed rate and the decline of the base productive number r0 in our model another is about the time range of the interventions evaluated in this paper we choose jan 3 2020 as the earliest available time point to implement interventions of social distancing andor epicenter lockdown for two reasons practically it is the date wuhan started close contact management 1  a kind of preliminary quarantine management taking the move before this date could be better but scarcely possible so beyond the scope of our discussion technically the available population migration data 7 covers the period from jan 01 to jan 22 so the timing of wuhan lockdown investigated in this study is confined within this period the effect of abolishing the epicenter lockdown was estimated under the assumption that the scale of the population migrated out of wuhan would keep stable normally the great migration departing big cities like wuhan would pause around jan 25 the day of spring festival then the migration would continue with a reverse direction back to cities however under the circumstances of the epidemic prevailing if the lockdown was abolished individuals trying to get away from wuhan might increase leading to more imported cases in other regions than expected in addition the application of our results should be tailored in a different situation the non-hubei provinces we studied were the ten provinces with most infections besides hubei plus the two municipalities of most importance in mainland china these provincial regions had a large inflow of people from wuhan and had a high local population density so there were more imported cases and easy to trigger widespread local transmission for those regions with little people flow from the epicenter and with a population of low density it could be possible that reinforced quarantine management without stringent social distancing could be effective enough to interrupt local transmission an extreme example is that there was only one covid-19 case in tibet autonomous region of china and the one was an imported case from wuhan he was timely quarantined for treatment and discharged after recovery 23 close contacts were quickly traced and quarantined for medical observation and then ruled out of infection for other regions in and out of china the specific measures may be adjusted to the different social-political-economic environment based on the epidemic of covid-19 in mainland china we developed data-driven seiqr models to investigate the impact of social distancing and epicenter lockdown on the epidemic dynamics activating social distancing at the possible earliest time with comprehensive and rigorous measures could significantly reduce the epidemic size of covid-19 a stepwise implementation of social distancing in the epicenter city first then in the province and later the whole nation could be more practical and cost-effective the  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity

several countries ie korea italy iran and japan etc are confronted with an ongoing epidemic outbreak with caution the covid-19 epidemic may even evolve into a global pandemic besides other virulent infectious diseases may attack humans again in the future we sincerely hope that our work could help the decision-making of epidemic prevention and control strategy for other countries in this

number confining epidemic regions and maintaining socioeconomic vitality   mathematical assessment of the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on curtailing the 2019 novel coronavirus calistus ngonghala n enahoro iboi steffen eikenberry matthew scotch raina chandini  macintyre matthew bonds h abba gumel b  a pandemic of a novel coronavirus emerged in december of 2019  causing devastating public health impact across the world in the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or antivirals strategies for controlling and mitigating the burden of the pandemic are focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social-distancing contact-tracing quarantine isolation and the use of face-masks in public we develop a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of the aforementioned control and mitigation strategies rigorous analysis of the model shows that the disease-free equilibrium is locally-asymptotically stable if a certain epidemiological threshold known as the reproduction number denoted by r c  is less than unity this equilibrium is globally-asymptotically stable for a special case of the model where quarantined-susceptible individuals do not acquire covid-19 infection during quarantine when r c is less than unity the epidemiological consequence of this theoretical result is that the community-wide implementation of control interventions that can bring and maintain r c to a value less than unity will lead to the effective control or elimination of covid-19 in the community simulations of the model using data relevant to covid-19 transmission dynamics in the us state of new york and the entire us show that the pandemic burden will peak in mid and late april respectively the worst-case scenario projections for cumulative mortality based on baseline levels of interventions are 105 100 for new york state and 164 000 for the entire us by the end of the pandemic these numbers dramatically decreased by 80 and 64 respectively if adherence to strict social-distancing measures is improved and maintained until the end of may or june the duration and timing of the relaxation or termination of the strict social-distancing measures are crucially-important in determining the future trajectory of the covid-19 pandemic this study shows that early termination of the strict social-distancing measures could trigger a devastating second wave with burden similar to those projected before the onset of the strict social-distance measures were implemented the use of efficacious face-masks such as surgical masks with estimated efficacy  70 in public could lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least 70 of the residents of new york state use such masks in public consistently nationwide a compliance of at least 80 will be required using such masks the use of low efficacy masks such as cloth masks of estimated efficacy less than 30 could also lead to significant reduction of covid-19 burden albeit they are not able to lead to elimination combining low efficacy masks with improved levels of the other anti-covid-19 intervention strategies  the world is currently facing a pandemic of a novel coronavirus covid- 19  which started as an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause in wuhan city of china in december of 2019 1 2 3  as of april 14 2020 covid-19 caused by the novel sars-cov-2 coronavirus has spread to over 210 countries and territories causing about 19 million infections and 125000 deaths 4 5 6 7  the united states is now the epicenter of the covid-19 pandemic recording over 613800 confirmed cases and 26000 deaths within a short time with new york state bearing the brunt of the us burden over 203000 confirmed cases and 10800 deaths 4 5 6 7  the first documented confirmed case of the novel coronavirus in the us a resident who had recently visited wuhan city in china was reported on january 20 2020 8  while the first confirmed case in the state of new york was reported on march 1 2020 most of the covid-19 related deaths and severe cases occur in the elderly 65 years of age and older and people with underlying medical conditions 9  younger people and frontline healthcare workers are also at high risk of acquiring covid-19 infection as with two other coronaviruses that caused major outbreaks in humans in recent years namely the severe acute respiratory syndrome and the middle eastern respiratory syndrome 2 10  covid-19 is transmitted from human-to-human through direct contact with contaminated objects or surfaces and through inhalation of respiratory droplets from both symptomatic and asymptomatically-infectious humans 11  there is also limited evidence that the virus can be exhaled through normal breathing 12  the incubation period of the disease ranges from 2-14 days with about 975 of infected people developing disease symptoms within 115 days of infection 3 13 14 15  most infections over 80 show mild or no symptoms 16  common symptoms of the disease include fever coughing and shortness of breath for mild cases and pneumonia for severe cases 1 2 7  in the absence of pharmaceutical interventions such as a safe and effective vaccine for use in humans and a covid-19 anti-viral efforts aimed at containing covid-19 are focused on the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social-distancing using face-masks quarantine of suspected cases isolation and hospitalization of confirmed cases contact-tracing and quarantine mass testing etc in particular since the novel coronavirus is transmitted among people who come in close contact with each other the implementation of strict social-distancing measures has been the primary tool for curbing the spread of the pandemic as of april 7 2020 stringent social-distancing mechanisms mandatory lockdowns stay-at-home orders have been imposed in over 42 states of the united states together with washington dc guam and puerto rico representing over 95 of the us population involving approximately 316 million americans 17  the state of new york the current epicenter for covid-19 has even imposed a fine against people who fail to comply with its stringent social-distancing measures that took effect march 22 2020  common social-distancing measures or guidelines being employed in the us include temporary closures of schools and non-essential businesses avoiding crowded events and mass gatherings moving in-person meetings online etc the city of wuhan lifted its 76-day strict lockdown on april 8 2020 this was done in a phased way with the first relaxation of measures on february 9 2020 contact-tracing is another major public health strategy for combating the spread of covid-19 contact-tracing involves searching for or identifying individuals with whom the confirmed case has closely interacted within a certain time frame eg two days prior to the onset of symptoms 18  interviewing testing and isolating or hospitalizing them if they have the disease 19 20  the use of face-masks in public by members of the general population has historically been a common practice to try to limit or combat the spread of respiratory diseases dating back to at least the 1918 h1n1 pandemic of influenza 21 22 23 24 25 26  face masks may have been instrumental in limiting the community spread of the 20022003 sars epidemic in asia particularly in china singapore hong kong and taiwan 27 28 as well as the containment of the covid-19 pandemic in taiwan 29  face-masks have dual purposes if worn by a susceptible individual the mask offers efficacy against the acquisition of infection on the other hand if the wearer is already infected but is asymptomatic or mildly-symptomatic and unaware heshe ill the face-mask offers efficacy against their ability to transmit infection to susceptible individuals 12 30 31 32 33  predicting the course or severity of a pandemic such as covid-19 as well as the realistic assessment of proposed public health intervention strategies for combating them in real time is a major challenge to both the public health and the scientific community a number of models have been developed and used to study covid-19 dynamics ferguson et al 34 used an agent-based model to investigate the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on human deaths from covid-19 and in reducing burden on healthcare facilities and equipment they projected that in the absence of control measures over 81 of the populations of the us and great britain might become infected and covid-19 may cause up to 22 million deaths in the us mizumoto and chowell 35 used a mathematical model and incidence data to study changes in covid-19 transmission potential as the outbreak progressed through the diamond princess they obtained a higher reproduction number and noticed a substantial decrease in the effective reproduction number after improved quarantine was instituted hellewell et al 36 used a stochastic model with covid-19 data to examine the impact of contact-tracing and isolation on disease control and suggested that for most instances covid-19 spread can be contained in 3 months if these measures are highly effective using a stochastic model kucharski et al 37 examined the covid-19 trajectory in wuhan from january-february 2020 showing a reduction in transmission a 13 reduction in the associated effective reproduction number of the model when travel restrictions were implemented consequently there is a need to examine the combined impact of multiple non-pharmaceutical interventions applied together or in sequence the present study is based on the development of a new mathematical model for studying the transmission dynamics and control of the covid-19 pandemic in the us particularly in the state of new york the epicenter of covid-19 the model takes the form of a kermack-mckendrick compartmental deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations it incorporates features pertinent to covid-19 transmission dynamics and control such as the quarantine of suspected cases and the isolationhospitalization of confirmed covid-19 cases similar to the models developed in 38 39 40  the model parameterized using available covid-19 mortality data more reliable than case data provides a realistic real-time assessment and estimate of the burden of the pandemic in the us state of new york in addition to assessing some of the main intervention strategies being implemented in the state in particular quarantine isolation contact-tracing social-distancing and the use of face-masks in public we designed and analyzed a novel kermack-mckendrick-type mathematical model for the transmission dynamics and control of covid-19 in a population the model which incorporates the main non-pharmaceutical interventions being implemented to curtail covid-19 transmission in a community such as social-distancing quarantine of suspected cases isolation of confirmed cases contact-tracing testing and use of face-masks in public is formulated based on stratifying the total human population at time t denoted by n t into the mutually-exclusive compartments of non-quarantined susceptible s u t quarantined susceptible s q t non-quarantined exposed ie newly-infected individuals who do not yet show symptoms of the disease and cannot transmit infection e u t quarantined exposed e q t symptomatically-infectious i u t asymptomatically-infectious i a t hospitalizedisolated i h t intensive care patients i icu t and recovered rt so that quarantine and isolation can either be at home self-quarantine and self-isolation or at designated healthcare facilities furthermore hospitalization in the context of this study includes self-isolation at home and isolation at the hospital hence hospitalization and isolation will be used interchangeably in this study the model is given by the following deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations where a dot represents differentiation with respect to time where the force of infection  is defined as where  is the effective contact rate ie contacts capable of leading to covid-19 transmission 0  c m  1 is the proportion of members of the public who wear face-masks correctly and consistently in public and 0  m  1 is the efficacy of the face-masks low values of c m imply limited use of face-masks by members of the public while values of c m that are closer to unity imply widespreaduniversal use of face-masks in the community furthermore values of m that are closer to zero imply that the face-masks are not very effective in preventing acquisition if worn by a susceptible human or transmitting infection if worn by a symptomatic or asymptomatically-infectious human while m close or equal to unity implies that the face-masks used by the members of the public are of near or perfect efficacy against the acquisition or transmission of infection reduction in the contact rate parameter  can be thought of a measure of effectiveness of strategies that limit contacts between people to avoid community transmission notably social or physical distancing the parameter 0   a  1 measures the relative infectiousness of asymptomatically-infectious humans in the i a class in relation to symptomatic individuals in the i u class similarly 0   h  1 is a modification parameter accounting for the relative infectiousness of hospitalizedisolated infectious humans in the i h class in relation to individuals in the i u class the parameter 0   q  1 is a measure of the effectiveness of quarantine hospitalizationisolation and icu admission to prevent infected quarantined hospitalizedisolated individuals and icu patients from transmitting infection in particular  q  0 implies that infected quarantined hospitalizedisolated individuals and icu patients mix freely with the rest of population and can transmit at the same rate as other infectious individuals on the other hand  q  1 implies that the efficacy of quarantine hospitalizationisolation and icu admission in preventing infected quarantined hospitalizedisolated individuals and icu patients from transmitting infection is perfect in other words  q  1 means infected quarantined hospitalizedisolated infectious humans and icu patients are no longer part of the actively-mixing population hence do not contribute to disease transmission in the model 21 the parameter 0  p  1 is the probability of infection per contact while q is the proportion of non-quarantined individuals that are infected at the time of quarantine the parameter  q measures the rate at which quarantined-susceptible individuals revert to the wholly-susceptible non-quarantined class s u  at the end of the quarantine period the modification parameter 0   j  1 is a measure of the efficacy of quarantine to prevent the acquisition of infection by quarantined-susceptible individuals during quarantine the parameters  u  q  is the rate at which exposed non-quarantined quarantined individuals progress to the symptomatic hospitalized class ie 1 u and 1 q is the intrinsic incubation period of non-quarantined and quarantined exposed individuals respectively a proportion f 1  of exposed individuals move to the i u class at the end of the incubation period at the rate f 1  u  similarly another proportion f 2  moves to i h class at the rate f 2  u  and the remaining proportion 1f 1 f 2  moves to the i a class at the rate 1f 1 f 2  u  noting that f 1 f 2  1 the parameter  a represents the rate at which asymptomatically-infectious humans are detected via contact-tracing and hospitalized the parameter  a represents the rate at which asymptomatically-infectious humans are detected via contact-tracing and hospitalized a proportion r of exposed quarantined individuals move to the i h class at the end of the incubation period at a rate r q  while the remaining proportion 1  r moves to the i a class at a rate 1  r q  the parameter  u represents the rate at which exposed non-quarantined individuals are detected by contacttracing and placed in quarantine the parameter  u  a  h  icu  is the recovery rate for individuals in the i u i a i h i icu  class while  h is the rate at which hospitalized individuals are placed into icu furthermore the parameter  u  a  h  icu  represents the covid-induced mortality for individuals in the i u i a i h i icu  class the model 21 is an extension of the quarantine model for ebola viral disease developed by denes and gumel 38 by adding epidemiological compartments for asymptomatically-infectious humans and hospitalized individuals in icu as well as incorporating contact-tracing of suspected cases and the use of face-masks by members of the general public to the authors knowledge this may be the first deterministic model for covid-19 that incorporates five non-pharmaceutical interventions quarantine isolation contact-tracing use of public masks and social-distancing in addition to allowing for the assessment of the impact of asymptomatic transmission on the trajectory and burden of covid-19 by adding a compartment for asymptomatic-infectious humans a flow diagram of the model is depicted in figure 1  and the state variables and parameters of the model are tabulated in tables 1 and 2  to keep track of covid-19 related deaths required for calibrating our model with cumulative death data for covid-19 and for quantifying and predicting the public health impactburden of disease we define the bookkeeping state variable dt to measure the number of covid-deceased individuals it then follows from some of the equations of the model 21 that the rate of change of the population of deceased-individuals is given by 22 we estimated the baseline epidemiological parameters of the model from available covid-19 data and sources from the published literature since the generally recommended period for quarantine of people suspected of being exposed to covid-19 is 14 days 6 16  we set the rate at which quarantined susceptible individuals revert to the non-quarantined susceptible class  q  to be  q  114 per day further whiel some studies have estimated the incubation period for covid-19 to range from 2-14 days with about 975 of infected people developing disease symptoms within 115 days of infection 13 14 15  other studies have estimated the incubation period to be 5-6 days 3  we consider an average incubation period taken from these ranges of 51 days so that  u   q  151 per day 13  similarly we set the progression rate from the asymptomatically-infectious class i a  to the isolatedhospitalized class i h to be  a  14 per day following 34 41  we consider an infectious period of about 10 days so that the recovery rate from covid-19 infection  is set to  u   icu  110 per day ferguson et al 34 estimated the average time covid-19 patients spent in hospital for infections that do not lead to complications requiring icu admission to be about 8 days therefore we set  h  18 per day furthermore 34  it is assumed that there is a short time lag of about 5 days between the onset of disease symptoms in non-quarantined humans and hospitalization hence we set the hospitalization rate  u  to be  u  15 per day some studies have suggested that most covid-19 infections over 80 show mild or no symptoms about 14 show severe symptoms but without requiring icu admission and 6 show criticallysevere symptoms requiring icu admission 16 42 43  consequently we set f 2  02 and assume that half of the 80 of cases that show no or mild symptoms are asymptomatic hence we set the modification parameter for the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic people  a  was estimated from 34 44 to be 05 further li et al 44 estimated this parameter to be between 042 and 055 hence we set  a   h  05 since about 15 of covid-19 patients die 34  we estimated  u   h  0015 per day to obtain estimates for  a and  icu  we assume that  a  05 u so that  a  00075 per day and  icu  15 u so that  icu  00225 per day 45  the parameter for the efficacy of quarantine to prevent acquisition of infection during quarantine  j  is estimated to be  j  05 we estimated the efficacy of face-masks  m  based on the results of a number of clinical trials for instance data from driessche et al 46 shows that surgical masks reduced p aeruginosa infected aerosols produced by coughing by over 80 in cystic fibrosis patients a similar study by stockwell et al 47 shows that surgical masks reduced colony-forming unit cfu count by over 90 these two studies in 46 47 show that the n95 masks respirators were more effective similarly van der sande et al 48 show that home-made tea-cloth masks had an inward efficiency between 58 and 77 over a 3-hour duration of wear while inward efficiency ranged 6  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a

icu from transmitting infection 0   q  1 72-85 and 98-99 for surgical and n95-equivalent masks consequently following eikenberry et al 45  we estimate inward mask efficacy to range widely between 20-80 for cloth masks and at least 50 for well-made tightly fitting masks made of optimal materials and 70-90 for surgical masks and over 95 typical for p in the range of properly worn n95 masks based on this we set m  05 we set the proportion of quarantined exposed individuals who are hospitalized r to be r  07 there is no good data for the efficacy of isolationhospitalization to prevent disease transmission by symptomatic individuals in isolationhospital nonetheless it seems plausible to assume that at the later stage of the pandemic such as at the present moment the public health system capacity has been greatly improved to the extent that such transmission do not occur hence we set  q  1 the parameter  h  for the rate of icu admission is estimated to be  h  0083 per day based on data from 49 it is in the range of 6  12 the remaining parameters of the model 21  c m   a and  u  were estimated from the mortality data for the state of new york and the entire us 4 5 6 7 based on the fitting of the state of new york data in figure 2 a and data for the entire us in figure 2 b the estimating process involved minimizing the sum of the squares of the difference between the predictions of model 21 cumulative deaths and the observed covid-19 cumulative deaths data from new york state for the period from march 1 2020 to april 7 2020 in particular the fitted values obtained using the state of new york mortality data were   08648 per day p  08073 per day c m  00546  a  02435 per day and  u  01168 per day while the fitted values obtained using mortality data for the entire us were   10966 per day p  07163 per day c m  01598  a  03090 per day and  u  01065 per day 7  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a

disease-free equilibrium of the model 21 given by  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 will be analysed using the next generation operator method 50 51  using the notation in 50  it follows that the next generation operator matrices f and v for the new infection terms and the transition terms are given respectively by it is convenient to define r c by where  now represents the spectral radius of the next generation matrix f v 1  the result below follows from theorem 2 of 50  the quantity r c is the control reproduction number of the model 21 it measures the average number of new covid-19 infections generated by an average infected individual introduced into a population where basic public health interventions quarantine isolation social-distancing testing etc are implemented the quantity r c is the sum of the constituent reproduction numbers associated with the number of new covid-19 cases generated by symptomatically-infectious humans r ciu  hospitalizedisolated individuals r h  and asymptomaticallyinfectious humans r a  the epidemiological implication of theorem 31 is that a small influx of covid-19 cases will not generate a covid-19 outbreak if the control reproduction number r c  is less than unity for effective control of covid-19 to be independent of the initial sizes of the infected compartments of the model 21 a global asymptotic stability result must be established for the dfe this is done below for a special case we claim the following result theorem 32 the disease-free equilibrium of the special case of the model 21 with  j  0 ie infected individuals in quarantine hospital or icu do not transmit infection is globally-asymptotically stable if r c  1 the proof of theorem 32 based on using lyapunov function theory is given in appendix a the epidemiological implication of theorem 32 is that for the special case of the model 21 with  j  0 bringing and maintaining r c to a value less than unity is necessary and sufficient for the effective control of the disease it should be mentioned that if the assumption of  j  0 is relaxed in theorem 32 the proof will not work since the model will then undergo the phenomenon of backward bifurcation 52 53  the baseline values of the parameters of the model are tabulated in table 3  we simulated the model 21 using the baseline parameter values tabulated in table 3 unless otherwise stated to assess the population-level impact of the various control and mitigation strategies against the spread of covid-19 in the us state of new york discussed in section 21 we also simulated the model using the calibrated parameters in table 4  together with the other estimated parameters in table 3  to assess the population-level impact of various control measures in the entire us it should be mentioned that in all the simulations carried out the various nonpharmaceutical interventions are maintained at their baseline values unless otherwise stated we simulated the model to first of all assess the impact of social-distancing which in our study extends beyond individuals staying 2 meters or 6 feet apart to include school and non-essential business closures staying at home avoiding large gatherings etc further in our study we measured the effect of social-distancing by the overall reduction in the baseline value of the community contact rate parameter  the simulation results 9

not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  obtained depicted in figure 3  show a projected 66 300 patients in hospital or in self isolation at the pandemic peak expected to be attained on may 5 2020 figure 3 a  and 105 100 cumulative number of deaths figure 3 c  for the state of new york under the baseline scenario ie for the baseline level of social-distancing similarly the projections for the entire us under the baseline nation-wide social-distancing scenario are 115 000 daily hospitalizations at the pandemic peak figure 3 b  and 164 000 cumulative number of deaths figure 3 d  it is noteworthy that our projection for the cumulative mortality for the entire us of 164 000 falls markedly below the 22 million mortality projected by ferguson et al 34  our us-wide mortality projection however falls within the range of 38243 162106 estimated by murray et al 56  when social-distancing is improved above the baseline effectiveness levels ie increase in efficacy and adherencecoverage of social-distancing figure 3 shows a dramatic reduction of covid-19 burden for both new york state and the entire us in particular for a social-distancing regimen that reduces the contact rate parameter  by 10 from its baseline value the expected number of daily hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases at the peak of the pandemic decreases to 50 380 corresponding to a 24 decrease in hospitalizationsisolation from baseline for the state of new york similarly nation-wide hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases at the peak of the pandemic decreases by 21 to 89 930 furthermore for a highly-effective social-distancing strategy such as a social-distancing strategy that results in at least 40 reduction in the baseline value of  the peak hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases for new york state and the entire us dramatically reduce to 5 000 and 14 000 respectively similarly for this scenario the cumulative mortality for new york state and the entire us reduce respectively to 20 700 and 59 600 thus implementing a highly-effective social-distancing strategy which can reduce the baseline community contact rate  by at least 40 will avert over 80 and 64 of the predicted baseline deaths in new york state and nationwide respectively the effectiveness levels and coverage of social-distancing in new york state and the entire us has greatly improved by april 2 2020 57 58 59 60  to the extent that it is plausible to assume that 40 reduction in the baseline value of  has already been achieved in both the state of new york and nationwide therefore this study shows that the state of new york and the entire us could have recorded catastrophic covid-induced mortality between 100 000 to 200 000 if not for the high effectiveness levels and coverage of the strict social-distancing measures implemented in the state and nationwide our study suggests that if the current level of social-distancing effectiveness and coverage is maintained through may or june 2020 in the state of new york and nationwide covid-19 can be eliminated from both the state and the entire nation extending the simulations for figure 3 shows that the current level of the social-distancing regimen in the state of new york should be extended until late september 2021 to guarantee the elimination of covid-19 in the context of figure 3  covid-19 elimination is measured in terms of when the cumulative mortality stabilizes similarly for the entire us social-distancing needs to be maintained until march 2021 additional simulations were carried out to assess the population-level impact of the duration and timing of when to terminate the current strict social-distancing protocols for the best-case scenario where the current strict socialdistancing protocols were assumed to be implemented right from the very beginning of the covid-19 pandemic in new york state march 1 2020 and the entire us january 20 2020 and maintained until early december 2020 the results obtained for the cumulative mortality recorded for new york state and the entire us are 25 000 and 60 000 respectively blue curves in figure 4 a-f furthermore if the social-distancing regimens were implemented on the days they were officially implemented in new york state march 22 2020 and the entire us march 16 2020 but maintained until early december 2020 the cumulative mortality to be recorded will be 55 000 and 75 500 respectively magenta curves in figure 4 a-f the effect of the timing of when to terminate the current strict social-distancing protocols was also monitored our simulations show that terminating the current strict social-distancing by the end of april 2020 ie the 40 reduction in the baseline value of  is now lost due to the termination of the social-distancing measures a significant rebound of covid-19 burden will be recorded in as early as july 2020 in particular new york state will record 144 000 deaths 4 a while the entire us will record up to 156 000 deaths  4 d in other words the early termination of the current strict social-distancing measures by the end of april 2020 will result in catastrophic covid-19 burden similar to the dire projections made for the pre-social-distancing period ie all the gains of the social-distancing and other control and mitigation measures will essentially be lost if the strict-distancing measures were to be terminated by the end of may 2020 the cumulative mortality figures are projected to be 91 800 for new york state and 118 300 for the entire us 4  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international

httpsdoiorg1011012020041520066480 doi medrxiv preprint b and e finally if the social-distancing measures are terminated at the end of june 2020 the projection for the mortality figures are 33 200 for new york state and 50 240 for the entire us 4 c and f these projected mortality numbers for the early termination of social-distancing fall within the range given by murphy et al 56  our study clearly shows that the clamor to relax or terminate the social-distancing measures that have proven to be hugely successful in both the state of new york and the entire us as part of the move to re-open the state and the country would undoubtedly trigger a devastating rebound of covid-19 in both new york state and the entire us data has already shown that certain countries that have relaxed the successfully-implemented social-distancing measures such as taiwan hong kong and south korea are now witnessing a rebound of covid-19 61  in particular hong kong announced 84 newly-confirmed cases on march 28 followed by over 70 new daily cases in the next three days further taiwan reported more than 20 newly-confirmed cases per day in mid-march up from barely 5 cases per day late in january south korea reported 83 newly-confirmed cases on april 3 2020 61  it is worth mentioning that the aforementioned simulations for the effect of social-distancing were carried out for the case where other interventions contact-tracing quarantine face-mask usage etc are also implemented at their baseline values in tables 3 and 4  if face-masks are not used then the above cumulative numbers will be even more catastrophic for instance if the strict social-distancing protocol is terminated in new york state by april 30 2020 and no face-mask-based intervention is implemented about 150 800 deaths will be recorded by july 2020 furthermore terminating the social-distancing protocols by end of may 2020 or end of june 2020 will result in projected 108 500 and 44 300 deaths respectively in the state the corresponding numbers for the entire us for the case where mask-based intervention is not implemented are projected to be 167 000 148 000 and 91 900 respectively thus this study strongly suggest that utmost caution should be exercised before terminating the current strict social-distancing protocols being implemented in the state of new york and nationwide at the very least a careful state-by-state or county-by-county phase withdrawal based on the updated covid-19 incidence mass testing data and proximity to covid-19 hot spots should be carried out the effect of quarantine of individuals suspected of being exposed to covid-19 is monitored by simulating the model 21 using the baseline parameter values and various levels of effectiveness of quarantine to prevent the acquisition of infection during quarantine  j  the results obtained depicted in figure 5  show that quarantine of susceptible individuals has only marginal impact in reducing covid-related hospitalizations for both new york state  figure 5 a  and the entire us  figure 5 b  in particular at the baseline quarantine efficacy  j  05 the state of new york will record 66 000 daily hospitalizations the implementation of a perfect quarantine in the state ie  j  0 reduces the number of hospitalizations marginally to 60 000 the numbers for the entire us for the baseline and perfect quarantine are 115 000 and 97 000 respectively the marginal effect of quarantine in minimizing covid-related hospitalizations is even more pronounced when the isolation strategy is perfect  figures  5 c and d  that is for the epidemiological scenario where the isolation or hospitalization of confirmed cases is perfect that is individuals in isolation at home or in hospital are not part of the actively-mixing population so that  q  1 the community-wide implementation of mass quarantine of individuals suspected of being exposed to covid-19 will have very marginal impact on covid-19 burden measured in terms of reductions in covid-19 hospitalizations this result is consistent with that reported in 62  thus this study suggests that since selfisolation and isolation in hospitals have been implemented at high effectiveness levels in both the state of new york and in the entire us the mass quarantine of suspected cases may not be a cost-effective public health strategy for combating the spread of covid-19 in both new york state and the entire us figures 5 c and d illustrate the dynamics of the model 21 for various effectiveness levels of quarantine and isolation for both new york state and the us further emphasizing the marginal nature of quarantine even for the cases where isolation was not implemented at a perfect level in minimizing covid-19 hospitalizations the effect of contact-tracing on the transmission dynamics and control of the covid-19 pandemic is also monitored by simulating the model 21 using the baseline parameter values in table 3 and various values of the contact-tracing parameters  u and  a  in particular the simulations are run by increasing the values of  u and  a  simultaneously and by the same amount from their respective baseline values figure 6 depicts the solution profiles obtained showing the worst case scenario of 49 400 cases in the state of new york and 64 600 cases nationwide on the day the pandemic peaks on april 26 2020 if no contact tracing is implemented if implemented at its baseline rate contact tracing reduces the size of the pandemic peak number of new covid-19 cases by 27 12  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  for the state of new york and by 22 nationwide while a 75 improvement in contact-tracing will reduce the predicted number of confirmed cases to approximately 31 300 for the state of new york and 41 200 nationwide this represents 13 and 10 reduction from baseline and shows that while contact-tracing implemented even only at baseline is important in reducing the size of the pandemic peak number of new covid-19 cases investing much resources towards contact-tracing beyond the baseline rate might not be cost-effective simulations were further carried out to assess the population-level impact of the widespread use of masks in public by running the model 21 with various values of mask efficacy  m  and coverage c m  the results obtained depicted in figure 7  show a marked decrease in the number of hospitalizations for both new york state figures 7 a b and c  and the entire us figures 7 d  e and f with increasing values of the mask efficacy and coverage further using an efficacious mask such as a mask of efficacy 50 can greatly flatten the pandemic curve in addition to significantly reducing the burden of the pandemic measured in this case in terms of hospitalizations however such a mask will fail to lead to the elimination of the disease figure 7 b  it is worth emphasizing that although the use of masks with low efficacy may not lead to disease elimination they still are highly useful by causing a significant decrease in the burden of the pandemic ie significantly reduce hospitalizations if a significant proportion of the populace wear them for instance if 75 of the populace in new york or the entire us wear masks with efficacy as low as 25 ie cloths masks the number of hospitalizations will be reduced by 63 and 64 respectively compared to the scenario were masks were not used figures 7  a and d a contour plot of the reproduction number of the model r c  as a function of masks efficacy  m  and compliance c m  for the special case of the model with  j  0 is depicted in figure 8  it should be noted from theorem 32 that for the special case of the model with perfect quarantine ie  j  0 the disease-free equilibrium is globally-asymptotically stable whenever r c  1 ie the disease can be eliminated from new york state if r c  1 this result is further illustrated in the contours plot depicted in figure 8 a and b  however if masks of higher efficacy such as surgical masks with estimated efficacy  70 are used in the state disease elimination is indeed feasible if at least 70 of the populace wear the masks figures 8 a and b  similar results were obtained for the entire us figures 8 c and d  additional simulations were carried out to assess the combined impact of public face-masks use strategy and strict social-distancing strategy which reduces the baseline value of the community transmission parameter  by 40 on the control of covid-19 in new york state and the entire us the results obtained depicted in figure  9  show that combining the strict social-distancing strategy with a strategy based on using moderately-effective face-masks with efficacy m  05 in public will lead to the elimination of the disease in new york state if only 30 of the population use face-masks in public figure 9 a  this clearly shows that disease elimination in new york state is more feasible if the face-masks-based strategy is combined with the strict social-distancing strategy similar results were obtained for the entire us figure 9 b where in this case only 10 compliance in mask usage in public will be needed for covid-19 elimination in summary the above simulations show that the use of face-masks even those with low efficacy but with high coverage in public offers significant community-wide impact in reducing and mitigating the burden of covid-19 in both new york state and the entire us in other words the use of low efficacy face masks with high coverage is always useful further combining the face-masks use strategy with a strategy based on the implementation of strict social-distancing is more effective in curtailing and eliminating covid-19 in comparison to the singular implementation of either strategy  cc-by-nc-nd 40

license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint   the world is currently experiencing a devastating pandemic of a novel coronavirus caused by sars-cov2 that emerged in wuhan city of china in december of 2019 the deadly covid-19 pandemic has spread to over 210 countries causing over 19 million cases and 125000 deaths worldwide with some parts of asia europe and now the us suffering the brunt of the burden there is currently no safe and effective vaccine for use in humans against covid-19 there is also no safe and effective antiviral consequently control and mitigation efforts against covid-19 are limited to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social-distancing which involves keeping a physical distance of at least 6 feet from other humans in public lockdowns of communities closure of schools malls places of worships and other gathering places quarantine of suspected cases contact-tracing isolation at home or in hospital of confirmed cases and the use of face masks both low quality cloth masks and the higher quality surgical masks in public this study is based on the design analysis and simulations of a new mathematical model for providing deeper insights into the transmission dynamics and control of covid-19 in a community specifically the model designed in this study was parametrized using covid-19 data from the us state of new york and the entire us population the model was used to assess the population-impact of the aforementioned control and mitigation interventions the model was rigorously analysed to gain insight into its dynamical features it was shown that the diseasefree equilibrium of the model is locally-asymptotically stable when a certain epidemiological threshold known as the reproduction number and denoted by r c  is less than unity the epidemiological implication of this result is that a small influx of covid-19 cases will not generate a large outbreak in the community if r c is less than unity and the disease can be effectively controlled in this case for such effective control or elimination of the disease to be independent of the initial sizes of the infected population a global asymptotic stability must be established for the disease-free equilibrium this was done for the special case of the model where quarantine is perfect ie the special case of the model where quarantined-susceptible individuals do not acquire infection during quarantine the implication of this theoretical result is that for the case where quarantine of susceptible individuals is perfectly implemented in the community the aforementioned control and mitigation strategies can lead to the elimination of the covid-19 pandemic if their effectiveness levels measured in terms of their efficacy and coverage are high enough to bring and maintain the associated reproduction number of the model to a value less than unity the epidemiological meaning of elimination is the cessation of community transmission our study shows that covid-19 elimination in the state of new york and the entire us is feasible using the basic non-pharmaceutical 20  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  interventions discussed in this study notably social-distancing use of face-masks in public and contact-tracing and quarantine if implemented at the required level of effectiveness and complianceadherence thus this study shows that covid-19 elimination can be considered a realistic goal in the us if achieved sustaining such elimination would require taking further measures to minimize the possibility of a rebound such as more consistent surveillance for covid-19 the potential use of a vaccine and expanded testing we parameterized the model using covid-19 data from new york state and the entire us and extensive numerical simulations were carried out using the parametrized model to assess the population-level impact of the various intervention strategies with the baseline levels of the four main intervention strategies considered socialdistancing quarantineisolation contact-tracing and the use of face-masks the state of new york is projected to see a peak of the pandemic around mid april 2020 with 66 300 number of hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases and 105 100 deaths at the peak while the entire us will see its peak around end of april 2020 with 115 000 hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases and 164 000 deaths at the peak our projections for baseline worst-case mortality for the us are much lower than the 22 million deaths suggested by ferguson et al in the absence of interventions 34  but fall within the range estimated in 56  our projected numbers for covid-19 burden morbidity and mortality dramatically decreases if strict social-distancing measures are implemented at high adherence levels for instance it was shown that strict compliance to the statewide lock-down in new york state which corresponds to reducing the baseline contact rate in our model by at least 40 will reduce the peak values for hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases and mortality to 5 000 and 20 700 respectively similarly the peak values for cases and mortality in the entire us if a nation-wide lockdown capable of reducing baseline contact rate by at least 40 will decrease to 14 000 and 59 600 respectively the duration and timing of the termination of strict social-distancing measures are critically-important in the battle to effectively combat pandemics of respiratory diseases such as the devastating covid-19 pandemic while the rapid implementation of strict social-distancing measures during the early stage of the pandemic maintained over a relatively long period of time eg until the summer will undoubtedly effectively combat the burden of the pandemic early termination of these measures will cause catastrophic outcomes for instance our study shows that relaxing or terminating the strict social-distancing measures in the state of new york and the us as a whole by end of april 2020 will trigger a devastating second wave generating covid-19 burden similar to those obtained during the pre-strict-social-distancing time in the state and in the entire nation by the end of july 2020 with cumulative mortality numbers in the range reported in 56 for both new york state and the entire us in particular up to 144 000 and 156 000 cumulative deaths will have been recorded in the state of new york and the entire us if the social-distancing measures are shut down by the end of april 2020 extending the termination of social-distancing such as to end of june 2020 significantly reduces the likelihood of a second wave in addition to significantly reducing the associated burden of the pandemic consequently a great deal of caution must be exercised before decisions are made to relax or terminate the existing highly-successful social-distancing protocols in both the state of new york and the entire us it is noteworthy that countries that have recently relaxed these measures such as taiwan hong kong and south korea have already started seeing a rebound of covid-19 our study suggests that the decision to relax or terminate the social-distancing measures should by on a case-bycase ie state-by-state or county-by-county basis and should be informed by updated covid-19 incidence and mortality data number of covid-19 tests both antibody and surveillance tests and proximity of a locality to covid-19 hot spots in particular our study shows that strict social-distancing should be maintained until the year 2021 up to late september 2021 for new york state and early march 2021 for the entire us to eliminate covid-19 quarantine of people suspected of being exposed to a respiratory disease is perhaps the oldest public health control measure in human history our study shows that widescale implementation of quarantine intervention may not be very effective in minimizing the burden of covid-19 if the strategy of isolating confirmed cases is effective in other words our study suggests that if isolation can be implemented effectively high efficacy and coverage then quarantine of people suspected of contracting covid-19 may not be necessary this result is consistent with what was reported by day et al 62  tracing the contacts of confirmed cases known as contacttracing was also shown to only be marginally-effective in minimizing the burden of the pandemic in particular even if contact-tracing is implemented at the highest possible level represented in our study based on increases in the contact-tracing parameters by 75 the decrease in the burden of the pandemic recorded was only marginal 13 and 10 for cases in new york state and nationwide respectively and 5 and 3 for mortality for new york state and nationwide respectively the use of face-masks in public in times of outbreaks of respiratory diseases has a rich history although quite popular in some parts of the world notably asia the use of face-masks in public is somewhat controversial this was more evident in the us during the covid-19 leading ultimately to the recommendation to use face-masks home-made cloths masks in public by the the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc on april 2 2020 our study shows that the use of high efficacy masks such as surgical masks with estimated efficacy of at least 70 will lead to a dramatic reduction of covid-19 burden if its coverage is high enough at least 70 in fact our study shows that even face-masks of low efficacy home-made cloths masks will lead to a dramatic reduction of disease burden albeit this will not lead to the elimination of the disease for example even face-mask efficacy of 25 can lead to a 63 and 64 reduction in the number of hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases at the pandemic peak in new york state and nationwide if 75 of the population wear face-masks in public these results are consistent with those reported by eikenberry et al 45  furthermore by generating contour plots for the control reproduction number of the model 21 r c  as a function of mask efficiency  m  and coverage c m  our study shows that the use of high efficacy masks such as surgical masks with estimated efficacy of  75 will indeed lead to the elimination of covid-19 in both the state of new york and in the entire us nation if the coverage is high enough about 80 this study shows that the use of face-masks in public is always useful and their population-level impact increases will increases efficacy and coverage in particular even the use of low efficacy masks will greatly reduce the burden of the pandemic if the coverage in their usage in the community is high enough furthermore our study shows that combining the masks-based strategy with the strict social-distancing strategy is more effective than the singular implementation of either strategy for instance our study shows that covid-19 can be eliminated from the state of new york if the strict social-distancing measures implemented are combined with a face-masks strategy using a moderately-effective mask with efficacy of about 50 if only 30 of the residents of the state wear the masks the masks use compliance needed to eliminate the disease nationwide under this scenario with strict social-distancing nationwide is a mere 10 in summary our study suggests that like in the case of the other coronaviruses we have seen in the past namely sars and mers 10  covid-19 is a disease that appears to be controllable using basic non-pharmaceutical interventions particularly social-distancing and the use of face-masks in public especially when implemented in combinations the factors that are obviously critically-important to the success of the anti-covid-19 control efforts are the early implementation and enhancement of effectiveness of these intervention measures and ensuring their high adherencecoverage in the community  cc-by-nc-nd 40

preprint   echoes of 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic in the covid pandemic ravi jhaveri   the global outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus-2 sars-cov2 and associated coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has crippled major health care systems and economies in a way that no one could have imagined1 at the time of this writing waves of infected people are being identified across north america and europe with concerns about explosive growth in developing countries such as india2

3 moving quickly from the containment phase in which widespread testing and isolation of infected people was attempted countries around the world implemented unprecedented school closures and social distancing4 after china was the epicenter of the outbreak these measures appear to have helped china slow the spread of covid-19 infections5 there is evidence that social distancing and school and group facility closings seem to also be working in parts of the united states that were impacted earliest by covid and that responded with early implementation and enforcement6 it is important to highlight the ripple effects that school closures have on a community children at home means parents missing work after-school programs are closed sports and recreational activities are canceled teachers and educational staff are out of work school-based lunch and food programs are impacted it is also important to note that school closures without simultaneous social distancing means that children gather in parks libraries and other facilities and could still transmit to each other and fuel spread in the community at the time of this writing much of the debate around social distancing has focused on how long these measures need to be implemented and what should be expected in terms of new cases once social distancing recommendations are lifted4

7 many of these questions were posed back in 2009 when the pandemic of infection with the hemagglutinin type 1 and neuraminidase type 1 h1n1 influenza strain emerged to cause similar global disruption albeit with less severe clinical illness8 the purposes of this commentary were to review the events of the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic emergence to examine how only limited school closures with minimal social distancing were implemented and to offer a discussion about the likelihood of subsequent waves of covid cases once these measures lapse beyond its rapid global spread and disproportionate impact on children young adults and pregnant women the timing of the emergence of the 2009 h1n1 influenza virus pandemic created significant challenges to the response during a typical influenza season eg 20152016 activity starts in late november and december peaks in january and february and tapers off by march and april fig 1
 part a9 in sharp contrast the onset of the 2009 h1n1 pandemic came in late march with many respiratory illnesses being reported in mexico and then spreading to the united states and other parts of the world over the next several weeks fig 1 part b9 10 11 the onset of infections in early spring caused several school-based outbreaks in new york city and other areas12 individual schools did close but early cases never matched the explosive spread of the current covid-19 pandemic because of the focused geographic activity of 2009 h1n1 and because schools would be adjourning for summer break national school closures were never seriously considered while social distancing was discussed as part of a general public health strategy for managing a pandemic no specific measures were put into place8
 the other issue with emerging in late march was that the pandemic occurred almost 2 months after global decisions about strain selection for the 20092010 seasonal influenza vaccines were made a pandemic vaccine would need to have been prepared in parallel to the seasonal vaccine with a lag of about 2 months assuming no delays no other community-based preventive measures were put into place beyond the accelerated pace of trying to produce a pandemic vaccine over the summer of 2009 h1n1 cases continued to be identified in the united states but spread was more modest the southern hemisphere did experience an influenza season within their conventional months that was dominated by 2009 pandemic h1n1 activity13 in the united states when schools reopened in late august and early september there was a surge of new infections fig 1 part b9 as one can see in the fig 1 with the timing of school reopenings and frequent close contact of children as vectors for influenza transmission the second wave of cases peaked at a level far beyond the initial spring peak a study showed that school closures instituted in the fall had no impact on transmission14 new infections continued until november and early december before tapering off the irony of the situation was that the massive efforts were put forth to create an h1n1 vaccine but the initial strains did not grow well and vaccine production was delayed by several weeks15 by the time a vaccine was available in november and early december the pool of susceptible children had likely been depleted and peak activity had long since passed it is important to acknowledge major differences between the circumstances of the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic and the current covid-19 pandemic first a global influenza pandemic was a known commodity something the international community had experienced in the past and expected to return in the future while the initial sars-cov outbreak in 2003 temporarily grabbed the worlds attention it petered out within a few months never to return16 therefore this sars-cov2 virus was not an outbreak that the world had anticipated which has hampered the rapid response required for better containment second because influenza is a global and consistent seasonal health problem there is an established infrastructure for surveillance prevention and treatment that can be applied to any new pandemic strain public health officials know they can collaborate with industry partners to create a vaccine within a few months and indeed this did happen in 2009 albeit too late to impact the second wave of cases there is no existing vaccine or treatment infrastructure for coronavirus so all candidates must start with phase i studies or the rapidly conducted but highly flawed open-label treatment studies that are being rapidly published and disseminated17

18 assuming no major adverse events good efficacy and easy phase i and ii testing it will be at least a year before a vaccine candidate would be ready for use in the general population last varying levels of influenza immunity exist in the community and help to limit the spread and severity of circulating strains for example in the 2009 h1n1 pandemic the elderly were relatively protected because they had archived immunity to h1n1 epitopes after having been exposed to the similar 1918 strain earlier in life19 aside from those already infected with sars-cov2 the entire population is nave and at risk for infection while it is possible that there may be some degree of cross-protection with other coronaviruses the rapid spread of sars-cov2 suggests otherwise with all that being said there are still important lessons that can be drawn from the 2009 h1n1 pandemic experience the first are the expected effects of social distancing and a potential second wave of cases schools did not close initially in 2009 due to summer being near at hand the influenza surveillance data from the centers for disease control and prevention fig 1 part b demonstrated that there was ongoing person-to-person transmission during the summer when typically there is no detectable activity once widespread close contact in schools was reestablished children with h1n1 infected other children who subsequently spread influenza to adult contacts and influenza cases surged once the fall peak of cases was underway school closures implemented at that time had no impact on transmission or total flu cases14 data from the 1918 pandemic suggest that us cities that instituted social distancing and school closures earlier and for a longer period of time had fewer overall cases and better economic outcomes in the long term20

21 it is very likely that once social distancing measures are lifted for covid-19 and school or summer activities resume there will be a second wave of cases this second wave has already been seen in hong kong5 given how immune-nave the population is to this virus and given how sars-cov2 has proven to be much more contagious than seasonal influenza a second wave of cases is a virtual certainty22

23 the goal of social distancing is to blunt the first wave and allow the medical system time to manage cases without being overwhelmed over time with widespread testing and prompt diagnosis social distancing could transition to a more targeted cohorting of infected persons and cocooning isolation of highly susceptible people such as the elderly and those with chronic respiratory andor cardiovascular conditions sadly it appears that the social distancing and school closures were implemented too late and in too regional a fashion to allow for optimal containment24
 the 2009 h1n1 pandemic experience offers a detailed example of what is likely to happen if social distancing or school closures are lifted too soon in the current covid-19 epidemic these actions would likely invite a severe second wave of infections the lessons are there for those who wish to heed them the author has indicated that he has no conflicts of interest with regard to the content of

role in containing the outbreak among various non-pharmacological interventions community infection control is considered to be a quite promising approach however there is a lack of research on improving community-level interventions based on a communitys real conditions and characteristics using real-world observations our paper aims to investigate the different responses to mobility interventions between communities in the united states with a specific focus on different income levels we produced six daily mobility metrics for all communities using the mobility location data from over 100 million anonymous devices on a monthly basis each metric is tabulated by three performance indicators best performance effort and consistency we found that being high-income improves social distancing behavior after controlling multiple confounding variables in each of the eighteen scenarios in addition to the reality that it is more difficult for low-income communities to comply with social distancing the comparisons between scenarios raise concerns on the employment status working condition accessibility to life supplies and exposure to the virus of low-income communities  in december 2019 a novel coronavirus called covid-19 began spreading across the globe to fight this pandemic the us government issued a national emergency on march 13 and launched the coronavirus guidelines for america on march 16 in which a social distancing intervention was strongly suggested 12  accordingly statewide mobility restrictions were successively announced upon the arrival of pandemic the first stay-at-home order in the us began in california on march 19 and quickly swept the nation by mid-april stay-at-home orders were instituted across all but eight states yet despite the fact that it has been two months since the us declared the nationwide national emergency covid-19 cases are still increasing at an alarming speed this indicates that more effort on reinforced interventions is needed to help stop the spread of this pandemic particularly with a nationwide partial reopening of society decision makers and social practitioners need research basics to make better plans and adjust measures according to local social and economic features as revealed in earlier studies the transmission of covid-19 is positively associated with various social and economic factors such as gross domestic product gdp and human development index 34  some studies have investigated different income groups during the pandemic and presented a consistently obvious mobility gap 3 4 5 6 7  it is noteworthy that disadvantaged people encounter even more challenges under this pandemic research reveals that low-income individuals are under increased pressure due to the threat of unemployment poor working conditions limited health insurance etc as well as the stringent choice between health and income which are both significant to household subsistence 5  such a dilemma not only poses a threat to public health it also makes it more difficult to contain the pandemic in this paper we specifically investigate low-income communities in terms of social distancing behavior multifaceted social distancing performance metrics are compared between different income groups including percentage of staying home miles traveled per person trips per person work trips per person non-work trips per person and social distancing index we aim to answer the following questions are there any significant differences in these metrics between different income communities which aspects of social distancing behavior indicate these differences does income really have an impact on the communities after addressing the effects of various confounding factors if yes how is the income influencing each aspect of behavior in terms of significance level degree and direction what are the differences between communities of different income levels in their best performance of being social distancing which income level communities made more efforts to achieve the best social distancing performance which income group performs more consistent and long-lasting social distancing behavior and which mobility metric is most influenced by income mobile device location data an emerging data source for analyzing mobility behaviors has been actively utilized to investigate public mobility during the pandemic 8 9 10 11 12 13  with access to a high frequency and large coverage of real-world mobile device location data the authors were able to quickly develop an analysis at census tract level various mobility metrics were produced at census tract level using the previously developed algorithm we investigated the response of different income group communities regarding social distancing performance ie best performance effort and consistency the temporal mobility patterns for different income groups are first analyzed through repeated measures anova and post-hoc analysis which statistically indicates the significant differences for pairwise comparison between days 14 15 16  based on the temporal analysis we then proposed the hypothesis that high-income communities outperformed lowincome communities in social distancing performance this hypothesis is confirmed through welchs t-test and propensity score modelling 17 18 19  our study enhances the awareness of discrepancies between high-and low-income communities and provides evidence to policymakers regarding interventions on the pandemic with partial reopening underway in all 50 states our paper can also guide the implementation of partial reopening policies according to the us internal revenue code section 45de1 we classified any census tract with at least 20 poverty rate or median household income no more than 80 of the metropolitan area or statewide median income as a low-income community in this section we primarily explore the temporal patterns of the six mobility metrics of both low-and high-income groups fig 1 shows the temporal changes from march 2 to april 17 it is obvious that both income groups experienced two critical changing points eg march 13 and april 13 the finding is in line with our previous studies at the state and national level which suggested that march 13 the national emergency declaration date and april 13 one month after the declaration are two critical timepoints for mobility metrics changes 7 13  the week before march 13 is called an inertia period meaning the mobility change gradually bottoms out the week of march 13 is called fatigue period meaning relaxed efforts of social distancing and mobility begin to rebound despite ongoing mobility restriction orders in addition there exists notable differences between the two income groups in all mobility metrics interestingly the status between the two income groups exchanged during the pandemic with regards to the social distancing index percentage of staying home and miles traveled per person fig 1a b c  the difference between the two income groups gradually enlarges during the pandemic with regards to the three other metrics trip rate work trip rate and non-work trip rate fig 1d  e f during the two weeks before the national emergency declaration there was already a difference between the two income groups regarding trip rate and non-work trip rate and this difference was shrinking on the other hand after the declaration the difference gradually grows and the two income groups once again become quite different from each other putting work trip rate into context before the pandemic the two income groups are very similar to each other while there is a disparity between them during the pandemic fig 1 also indicates that on average the percentage change for high-income communities is bigger than low-income communities although high-income communities have a smaller average value of social distancing index and percentage of staying home before the pandemic they made more effort to follow social distancing and therefore they have a larger average value for these two metrics afterwards similarly high-income communities percentage reduction in miles traveled per person and the three trip rate-related metrics are obviously larger than those of low-income communities under the pandemic high-income communities seem to be at a lower risk of exposure to the virus according to those six aspects of social distancing performance results of three metrics for both groups are presented in the significance plots fig 2  which reveal the following findings first significant change of means at a 999 confidence interval denoted by the dark green cells are observed earlier in high-income communities regarding the three metrics this indicates that high-income communities responded earlier to the mobility interventions among these three metrics high-income communities responded 10 days earlier in terms of work trips per person and miles travelled per person compared with low-income communities fig 2a e  second the behavior change took place more quickly and more clearly in high-income communities while the low-income communities reacted inconsistently in stay-athome percentage and miles travelled per person metrics this is supported by the cleared pink square observed in the significance plots of the high-income group fig 2c  e another interesting finding is that the social distancing behavior of high-income communities is more consistent regarding all the metrics after the behavior change stage high-income people keep following social distancing however low-income communities show more fluctuations in mobility patterns  based on the preliminary results from the section above we proposed the hypothesis that highincome communities perform better than low-income communities in three aspects 1 highincome communities have greater best performance 2 high-income communities made more effort in social distancing and 3 high-income communities have a higher social distancing consistency best performance means the best experienced value during the five weeks after march 13 in each mobility metric for example the maximum value of social distancing index and percentage of staying home the minimum value of miles traveled per person trip rate work trip rate and non-work trip rate are referred to as best performance effort means the percentage change in each metric by comparing best performance with the baseline which is the weekday average for the two weeks before march 13 consistency refers to the stability of the status of following social distancing in the late stage of the quarantine which is the fourth and fifth week after the pandemic the fourth week is the week before april 13 during which each mobility metric gradually stabilized as shown in fig 1  then during the week after april 13 each metric shows a rebounding trend we use the standard deviation of each mobility metric during these two weeks as the indicator of social distancing consistency based on those three aspects and the six mobility metrics we have eighteen scenarios in total to compare the high-and low-income communities the previous section gave us some insight into the difference between income groups at the average level here we examined in more detail through the corresponding distribution by income groups fig 3  generally the distributions of both income groups are close to normal distribution and high-income communities tend to perform better based on the distribution as for the best performance the mean of social distancing index and percentage of staying home for high-income communities is larger than that of low-income communities while the mean of other metrics for high-income communities is smaller this is consistent with fig 1  as for effort percentage change we can see that on average high-income communities made more effort since the mean value of the percentage increase in social distancing index and staying home of high-income communities and the percentage reduction in miles traveled per person and the three trip related metrics of the high-income group are larger than the low-income communities as for the variation the high-income communities tend to have a smaller standard deviation meaning that they are more stable during the late stage of the quarantine period behavior is tabulated by three types of indicators best performance percentage change and variation and six mobility metrics for each community therefore there are 18 scenarios each subplot presents the corresponding distribution by high-and low-income groups in addition the mean value and coefficient of variation cv by income groups are annotated a major finding is that in each scenario high-income communities perform better than low-income communities based on current analysis we applied one-sided welch t-tests to eighteen scenarios to test the common hypothesis that high-income communities outperform low-income communities when comparing the best performance and efforts the alternative hypothesis used for the percentage of staying home and social distancing index is that high-income communities mean is greater than low-income communities mean while for the other mobility metrics vice versa when comparing the consistency the alternative hypothesis used for all mobility metrics is that high-income communities mean is smaller than low-income communities the results for all scenarios are summarized in table 1 which indicates the alternative hypothesis of sixteen scenarios are supported at 99 confidence level as for the comparison of best performance it seems that the means of high-and low-income communities are quite close however the two income groups are significantly different for four metrics including social distancing index and the three trip rate related metrics on average highincome communities achieve a higher social distancing index while low-income communities have a higher trip rate work trip rate and non-work trip rate communities in high-and low-income groups do not differ significantly with regards to percentage of staying home and miles traveled per person as for the effort percentage change of following social distancing an obvious difference in mean can be seen for metrics like percentage of staying home high-income 138 vs low-income 117 and social distancing index high-income 182 vs low-income 153 and such difference is significant at 99 confidence level although the two income groups show very close percentage change in the other four metrics high-income communities still significantly perform better than low-income communities at 999 confidence level according to the 95 confidence interval high-income communities are expected to have 21 more percentage increase in the percentage of staying home and 285 more percentage increase in the social distancing index on average among the four trip-related metrics the largest difference is observed in the miles traveled per person  -43 in addition the difference in work trip rate  -20 is more obvious than in non-work trip rate  -13 teleworking might result in a more obvious reduction of work trip rate in high-income communities than in low-income communities since non-work trips account for a larger proportion of total trips the difference between the two income groups regarding the best performance of work trip rate -002 is smaller than that of non-work trip rate -006 although we see a more obvious difference in the percentage change of work trip rate -20 vs -13 overall high-income communities made more effort to achieve social distancing furthermore we compared the two groups regarding their consistency of social distancing during quarantine inertia and fatigue period the fourth and the fifth week after national emergency declaration during the fourth week peoples behavior change to achieve quarantine slowed down then during the fifth week those efforts of being social distancing were relaxed and less attention was paid to quarantine which is indicated by the bouncing back phenomenon in fig   1  the standard deviation during these two weeks for each mobility metric and each performance indicator informs us the consistency performance the one-sided welch t-test shows that the mean value of variation of high-income communities is lower than that of low-income communities for all six mobility metrics moreover each difference is statistically significant at 99 confidence level after a period of mobility change due to social distancing orders high-income communities present a more stable and consistent status of social distancing table 1  one-sided welch t-test results for eighteen scenarios considering three types of indicators and six mobility metrics the alternative hypothesis of each scenario is that highincome communities perform better than low-income communities for instance the best performance on social distancing index of the high-income group is hypothesized to be higher than the low-income group the percentage change of trip rate for the high-income group is hypothesized to be smaller than the low-income group since the percentage change is negative the smaller it is the better the variation during the inertia and fatigue period of high-income communities regarding any mobility metric is smaller than that of low-income communities the null hypothesis for all scenarios is rejected that is high-income communities perform better in all eighteen scenarios furthermore the statistical difference between the two groups at 95 confidence level for each scenario is presented mobility  previous analysis is based on the average behavior of both income groups simply comparing the average is not adequate to draw a conclusion in this section we additionally conducted a causal inference of income on human mobility change since there might be some systematic biases between the two income groups caused by the confounding variables we specifically addressed those covariates to strengthen the analysis on the income effect using propensity score matching the results above present the impact of high-income for each scenario in order to compare different scenarios the dataset of each mobility metric regarding best performance and consistency were standardized rescaling the data to a have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1 because of different units the same psm modeling procedure was applied again the results in table 3 show that high-income has a significant causal effect at 99 confidence level and this causal effect improves the social distancing performance in each scenario furthermore different degree of such impact is observed when comparing the scenarios as for the best performance high-income has the largest influence on the maximum of social distance index the second largest influence on the minimum of trips per person and the third largest influence on the minimum of non-work trip rate during the quarantine period high-income has a larger impact on the best performance of non-work trip rate ate -0369 atet -0350 than on that of work trip rate ate -0198 atet -0200 being high-income is more promising to furthermore reduce the extremum of non-work trip rate than to reduce the extremum of work trip rate regarding the consistency the income has a more obvious impact on the variation of the three trip-related metrics and the largest impact is observed on reducing the variation of work trip rate ate -0314 atet 0291 during the quarantine inertia and fatigue period then the income has the forth impact on the social distancing index which is followed by miles traveled per person the least causal impact of income is observed on the consistency of percentage of staying home the difference between communities of the two income levels in the variation of percentage of staying home is not as notable as that in other metrics  this paper investigates the disparities between income groups under the covid-19 due to the rapid human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus travel restrictions became a particularly important way to help contain the outbreak of the pandemic although state and local governments issued various mobility interventions such as school closings cancelling public events and stay-at-home orders seldom are interventions customized for communities of different income levels however community infection control is of great importance to help contain covid-19 in order to assist policymakers with improving community-targeted interventions our paper investigated the mobility gap between communities by income level the nationwide highfrequency mobility location data integrated from over 100 million anonymous devices on a monthly basis serves as valuable data support for our paper this enables us to detect the differences between communities through real-world observations we made the best use of this dataset and produced multiple mobility metrics to conduct a multi-level analysis we conducted the analysis in eighteen scenarios featured by six derived mobility metrics and three indicators of social distancing performance a major finding is that high-income communities perform better than low-income communities in each of the eighteen scenarios being high-income improves the best status of complying with social distancing improves the efforts made to achieve the best performance and makes the social distancing behavior more consistent and stable during the quarantine inertia and fatigue period this informs us of the reality that low-income communities face under the pandemic with regard to social distancing behavior when implementing mobility restrictions low-income communities should be given more attention they need additional assistance to fight against the pandemic furthermore income has a larger influence on reducing work trip rate than on reducing non-work trip rate high-income individuals have more opportunity to work from home while low-income individuals probably need to go to an essential frontline job this might also be the reason why high-income communities have a more stable and consistent status of keeping social distancing during the quarantine inertia and fatigue period by comparing the causal impact of income on the percentage reduction of travel distance and trip rate we infer that the travel distance of non-work trips in high-income communities reduced more than in low-income communities due to the pandemic different accessibility to life supplies during the pandemic probably can explain this it might be easier for the residents living in high-income communities to satisfy their life needs without traveling so far away as low-income people do for example low-income people may not be that capable of paying daily food delivery and hence they have to go outside frequently to buy food regarding the consistency of being social distancing being high-income reduces the daily fluctuation of all six mobility metrics during the quarantine inertia and fatigue period high-income communities present a more stable social distancing behavior additionally among the five basic mobility metrics the others except social distancing index being high-income has the largest causal impact on reducing the variation of the three trip rate related metrics which is followed by the travel distance and the percentage of staying home this indicates that being high-income is more likely to influence those people going out regarding trips and travel distance while is less likely to change the proportion of people staying home in addition to stay-in-home orders policies that specifically target low-income peoples daily travel demands are also needed to help contain the pandemic in a causal effect analysis the two measures average treatment effect ate and average treatment effect on the treated atet are ideally used in randomized experiments however in practice many observational studies do not have a randomization process in this case the systematic differences between treated and untreated subjects must be addressed to reduce the effect of confounding factors 21 22  propensity score matching psm has been popularly applied to estimating the treatment effect in various observational studies such as policy analysis pharmacoepidemiologic research education econometric studies and accounting research 1923-24  in this study a causal modeling is built using psm to measure the causal effect of income on social distancing behavior to strengthen the impact analysis of income a comprehensive set of control variables is involved from aspects of age race gender education and population density those control variables are believed to potentially influence social distancing performance and are correlated with the income level of a community based on current studies 10 25 26  all sociodemographic data used in this paper is the american community survey data from us census bureau the first step of propensity score matching is to address the systematic biases between the two treatment groups high-and low-income groups by controlling the effect of confounding variables using a multivariate binomial logistic regression model with all control variables being the independent variables the model predicts the probability of a community to perform as a highincome community the propensity score the probability of being treated the estimated propensity score for all communities would be used as reference to pair each highincome community with its corresponding low-income community the nearest neighbor method is applied to carry out this pairing process given a high-income community the community from the low-income group with the closest propensity score value to that of this high-income community will be selected as the counterpart after the matching process we have a set of highand low-income community pairs and hence the counterfactual values are provided by each pair then the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect on the treated can be measured using the equations below  to calculate the mobility metrics the research team utilized a data panel created by integrating several mobile device data sources that represent movements of both person and vehicle the data has been obtained through various data providers that collect anonymized movement data first hand as the next step we conducted thorough data cleaning procedures to ensure consistency completeness accuracy and timeliness of all observations after data cleaning activity locations are determined based on spatial and temporal clustering of location sightings to identify home and work locations at the census block group level furthermore we applied our previously developed recursive algorithm to extract trips from raw location points and produce trip information including trip origin trip destination departure time arrival time and travel distance 12 27  all anonymized devices that did not make any trip longer than one mile from home on a calendar day were considered as people staying home finally a robust multi-level weighting algorithm was applied to expand the observed sample to the entire population at the national state and county levels the final results were extensively validated based on several independent data sources such as american community survey national household travel survey and also peer-reviewed by an external expert panel 27  a more detailed description of the methodology used for deriving the basic mobility metrics can be found in our previous work 12  in addition to the basic metrics produced using the aforementioned methodology the research team introduced a social distancing index sdi to better portray the different aspects of human mobility patterns using a single metric sdi has been calculated to measure the extent of social distancing practices by both residents and visitors of a geographical area as a score-based index for each region a score between 0 and 100 is assigned by considering the temporal changes in five basic mobility metrics including percent of staying at home daily work trips daily non-work trips trip distance and percent of out-of-county trips in comparison to baseline days before the covid-19 outbreak the weighting schemes for incorporating these five metrics were designed to consider the importance of each metric based on both real-world observations and conceptual guidelines the theoretical basics of the formulation of the sdi metric has been described in detail in our earlier work 11  where is the percentage of people staying at home is the percentage reduction in the number of total trips in comparison with the pre-pandemic benchmark is the percentage reduction in the number of work trips in comparison with the pre-pandemic benchmark is the percentage reduction in the number of non-work trips in comparison with the pre-pandemic benchmark is the percentage reduction in the total daily distance traveled in comparison with the pre-pandemic benchmark is the percentage reduction in the number of out-of-county in comparison with the pre-pandemic benchmark  modelling the sars-cov-2 first epidemic wave in greece social contact patterns for impact assessment

of preventive measures in mitigating transmission a consequence of this low attack rate is the possibility of continuing transmission if measures are lifted as this is the case even for countries that were more severely hit according to our estimates the number of infectious cases has subsided considerably towards the end of april and social distancing measures can be lifted gradually however even in this period with low transmission levels two local outbreaks were identified the first in a refugee camp and the second in a private health care unit thus increasing the number of diagnosed cases

france 84 23 24 in our analysis we assumed lower susceptibility to infection among children as there is growing body of evidence supporting this 18 25 26 27 28 we further attempted to disentangle the impact of each measure school closures for example were deployed early in china hong kong singapore and many countries had instituted large-scale or national closure of schools including greece 29 based on our findings only lockdown may reduce rt below 10 for an initial r0 at the levels observed in greece around 24 each measure -when implemented at the levels observed during lockdown in greece -can reduce rt to levels below 10 for initial r0 around 12 we should note that there is an interrelation between the different measures and the approach we have used might be an approximation for example school closure might result in increases in leisure contacts or decline in work contacts as parents need to attend younger children however it provides some information about the individual impact of each measure combinations of measures such as reductions in contacts at work and school would be successful for higher initial r0 near 18 we also assessed a scenario with less disruptive social distancing measures that could reduce rt below 10 for initial levels as high as 133 concerning the course of the epidemic postlockdown the effectiveness of infection control measures in reducing transmission is not known we considered scenarios with levels varying between 5-30 it seems that an effectiveness of infection control measures higher than 15 in combination with less disruptive social distancing may keep rt below 10 our analysis has some limitations first the lack of baseline pre-epidemic data since this was the first social contacts survey implemented in greece we asked respondents to report their contacts approximately two months earlier than the survey to make sure that these contacts were not affected by increased awareness of the pandemic there might be recall bias although it is not clear to what direction our analysis has focused on the number of contacts their ages using wide age groups and the place of the contact and not in the duration or the type of contact physical or not where the bias might be higher second the survey was conducted in a sample from athens metropolitan area and not from the whole of greece however no relationship has been found between social contacts and urbanization 30 in addition the majority of the population lives in urban areas athens and other cities account for 35 and 79 of the greek population respectively and the observed reduction of social contacts during lockdown was similar to other surveys conducted in china and uk 24 31 third  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available

that the denominator reflects the total number of patients infected at the same time as those who died 45 to validate our findings we used a reverse approach we applied a published estimate of the ifr

of social distancing interventions petrnio silva cl paulo batista vc hlder lima s marcos alves a frederico guimares g rodrigo silva cp   the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic is an ongoing outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 so-called sars-cov-2 the outbreak was identified in wuhan china in december 2019 1 the world health organization who declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on january 30th 2020 and a pandemic on march 11th in brazil the first confirmed case was on february 25th 2020 when a man from so paulo tested positive for the virus since then brazil has been severely affected as of june 26th 2020 the country reached more than 1220000 confirmed cases and more than 55000 deaths by covid-19 according to official data by the brazilian ministry of health in addition to the public health crisis the coronavirus has impacted all aspects of life politics education economy social environment and climate it is also having an unprecedented impact on global supply chains and production the only known effective course of action to fight the disease outbreak is to implement highly restrictive social distancing measures on the population as reported by a number of studies and systematic reviews 2 3 4 many countries are implementing such interventions with different degrees of success given the complexity of the societies it is hard to predict the implications of such actions in the short and medium terms 5 therefore modeling and simulating the covid-19 epidemic is a relevant and helpful way to understand the spread of the disease and the epidemiological effects of social distancing interventions for this purpose many studies in the literature have developed or adapted equation-based models to simulate the covid-19 epidemic using the susceptible-infected-recovered sir model or the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered seir model to characterize the dynamics see references in section 2 nonetheless agent-based models have also been proposed for this goal see for instance 6 7 and other studies discussed with more detail in section 2 in this paper we develop an agent-based model abm to simulate the dynamics of the covid-19 epidemic and the epidemiological and economic effects of social distancing interventions the proposed abm aims to emulate a closed society living on a shared environment consisting of agents that represent people houses businesses the government and the healthcare system each one with specific attributes and behaviors a society living over a territory is a complex and dynamic system such systems have many interacting variables present nonlinear behavior and their properties evolve over time their behavior is generally stochastic and may depend on the initial conditions it can be affected by neighbor societies with different policies and dynamics and it can show emergence of complex behaviors and patterns agent-based simulations abs are a good choice to simulate such systems due to their simplicity of implementation and accurate results when compared with real data 8 the main goal of abs is to simulate the temporal evolution of the system storing statistics derived from the internal states of the agents in each iteration and the global behaviors that emerge due to the interactions between the agents over the iterations this approach allows the simulation of systems with intricate nonlinear relationships complex conditions and restrictions that may be hard to describe mathematically since in this paper we are interested in simulating the effects of different social-distancing interventions and other control measures that affect the behaviors of agents and groups of agents it is much easier to simulate these scenarios with an agent-based model the epidemiological and economic effects are observed as emerging from the interactions of the agents in the simulation the abm proposed here not only simulates the epidemic dynamics but also models the economy in this society of agents which can help us estimate the economic impact under different types of interventions the model described in section 3 allows the design of scenarios that correspond to different types of interventions performed in the society by changing the simulation environmental variables and measuring their effects therefore the proposed abm becomes a useful tool to assist politicians and health authorities in planning their actions against the covid-19 epidemic the model was implemented in python version 36 programming language and encapsulated in the covidabs package whose source code is available at httpsbitlycovid19abssystem the source code of all the experiments reported herein is available at httpsbitlycovidabsexperiments the main contributions and findings are listed belowa new seir agent-based model to simulate the covid-19 epidemic using a society of agentsassessment of the economic effects of seven different scenarios with specific social-distancing interventions via simulation of covid-abs 1 do nothing 2 lockdown 3 conditional lockdown 4 vertical isolation 5 partial isolation 6 use of face masks and 7 use of face masks together with 50 of adhesion to social isolation these scenarios and their simulated results are described in section 5the simulations support the notion that lockdown and conditional lockdown are the best scenarios in terms of controlling the number of infected and deaths which is primary goal economical countermeasures and subsidies are required by the government since this scenario presents the worst economic losses to the industry with potential unemployment and recession can be observed during the lockdown period also to be effective these scenarios depend on the ability of the government to enforce the social isolationour simulations present additional evidence that the so-called vertical isolation simply does not work although it is the policy advocated by some governments like the brazilian one1
the scenario combining the use of masks and partial isolation of the population could be a good compromise and it is more realistic for implementation in terms of social cooperation the infection curve is flattened and the economy has smoother effects than the scenarios with lockdown
 the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a brief review of related work with focus on the mathematical modeling for epidemics and some recent papers related to the sars-cov-2 section 3 details the proposed agent-based system modeling section 4 describes the experimental methodology and section 5 shows the simulations results and some discussions related to the pandemic section 6 concludes the paper and gives future directions since who announced the coronavirus disease 2019 the scientific community has been working hard to investigate sars-cov-2 epidemiological dynamics some works used the sir model to characterize the covid-19 dynamics 9 10 11 12 however more precise simulations usually used an approach based on the seir model 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 given that this disease has a known incubation period 31 some authors added new states to refine the model for instance super-spreaders 32 or isolated 13 14 16 18 19 20 23 24 26 27 hospitalized 13 14 19 20 23 27 and asymptomatic infected 18 20 21 23 28 we note that equation-based models to simulate the epidemic represent the majority among those proposed in the literature nonetheless some papers with agent-based models have also been proposed for it for a discussion about abm and its advantages over equation-based models we refer the reader to 8 33 in the report released by ferguson et al 6 an individual-based simulation model was used to explore scenarios for covid-19 in gb and usa and the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the healthcare demand bossert et al 7 developed an agent-based model combining socio-economic and traffic data to analyze covid-19 spreading in a south africa city under social isolation scenarios the prediction suggests that lockdown strategy is useful to mitigate the disease another study using an abm also analyzed several scenarios and highlighted that with 90 of the population in isolation it is possible to control the disease within 13 weeks when joined with effective case isolation and international travel restrictions considering the australian context 34 an appealing characteristic of agent-based modeling is the easiness to simulate different scenarios for instance the scenario that considers universal use of masks integrated with social distance is the recommended one to control the pandemic according to braun et al 35 and kai et al 36 given the flexibility of the agent-based approach previous works have employed this method to simulate specific topics in the covid-19 context such as testing policies 37 strategies for reopening public buildings 38 hypothetical effective treatments 39 and a spatio-temporal strategy for vaccination 40 few works in the literature used agent-based models to simulate the economic impacts of the covid-19 for instance inoue and todo 41 quantified that a possible one month lockdown in tokyo would lead to a total production loss of 53 in japanese annual gross domestic product gdp dignum et al 42 proposed a tool to analyze the health social and economic impacts of the pandemic when the government implements a number of interventions such as closing schools requiring that employees work at home and providing subsidy for the population in this work we use a seir agent-based model to simulate the health and economic impacts of the covid-19 epidemic we perform analysis to seven possible scenarios 1 do nothing 2 lockdown 3 conditional lockdown 4 vertical isolation 5 partial isolation 6 use of face masks and 7 use of face masks together with 50 of social isolation we use data from brazil for all scenarios considered but the proposed agent-based model is fully parameterized and can be easily transferred to other contexts given that corresponding data is provided some parameters in table 2 were empirically estimated in a way that the epidemiological response variables present in table 3

6 after the creation of all agents the simulation model starts its iteration loop which represents the time dynamics explained in the next section the distribution of a1 agents work rest and leisure hours is shown in table 5
and it is based on the universal declaration of human rights 57 basically it is the standard deviation of a gaussian distribution with average 0 representing the variability of the movement amplitude of a1 in its free time or in other words how far the agent can walk from its actual position the actions go home go to work and walk freely occur according to the equations 5 6 and 7 besides these ordinary actions all the agents that are infected and have infection severity equal to hospitalization or severe execute the go to hospital action according to the equation 8 all the dead agents have their positions set to zero5a1posa2posn0k

9 and 
10 respectively and the remaining population consists of susceptible individuals there is also a dead status since part of the population dies due to the disease and its complications 59 the possibility of contagion happens by the interaction of the agents by proximity or contact hence the higher the mobility of a person the greater the probability that heshe approaches an infected person and gets infected each simulation considers a contagion distance threshold 
1 which is the minimal distance that two agents have to be to occur the viral transmission and a probability of contagion 
2 in case of contact the model of the medical condition evolution of the infected agents follows 60 61 once an agent is infected it can be in one of these sub-states a asymptomatic which includes mild symptoms without hospitalization b hospitalization and c severe used in cases of hospitalization in intensive care unit icu these states and their transitions are illustrated in figure 2
 the evolution of the medical condition is stochastic and follows the probabilities summarized in table 6
 represented by the parameters 
6 
7 and 
8 respectively the hospitalization cases require medical infrastructure which is limited it varies from country to country but is always less than the total population in each simulation a critical limit 
11 is considered it represents the percentage of the population that the healthcare system is capable to handle simultaneously as a consequence if the number of hospitalizations and severe cases increase above this limit there are no beds in hospitals to manage the demand the secondary goal of this study is to simulate the impact caused in the economy by the different types of mobility restrictions 62 63 64 65 imposed by the authorities 
figure 3
shows the transactions by which agents exchange wealth in the simulation the economic dynamics follows seasonal routines that also depend on the type of the agent the business contact action happens hourly when an a1 agent in its free time gets in contact with an a3 and occurs the transference of wealth from a1 to a3 these economic transactions are the most sensitive to the a1 agents mobility the more the agents move the more they spend and affects the a3 agent income in pandemic times that can happen in almost all scenarios since the population tends to leave their houses just to buy essential items or to solve a problem which could not have been solved over the internet the values exchanged in business contact depend on the social stratum of the a1 agents and the higher the quintile the higher the spending following the wealth distribution 
1 in each day the wealth of a2 and a3 agents is decreased by its minimal fixed expenses proportional to the sum of the expenses of housemates and employees respectively the accounting actions happen monthly for a2 a3 and a4 agents accounting is the payment of taxes from a2 and a3 agents to a4 and it represents the major income of a4 during accounting a3 agents also pay salaries to their a1 employees determined in the initialization by the social stratum finally a2 agents transfer money to a random a3 agent representing supplier payments the accounting of the government agent a4 transfers funds to a5 agent equivalent to its fixed expenses and the daily expenses of the hospitalized agents eventually the a4 agent pays aids for unemployed and homeless a1 agents considering the periodicity of the economic transactions it is necessary to execute at least one complete cycle 720 iterations in order to execute all economic transactions at least once the proposed model tries to apprehend the complexity of the social epidemiological and economical relationships but without being simplistic then the complexity of the model reflects the complexity of the system being modelled although on a smaller scale previous versions of the model did not consider social constraints and routines and despite the good performance of the epidemiological response variables it could not accurately represent the economic dynamics the introduction of social constructs as families and businesses and periodical routines such as working hours free time and bed time brought more feasibility to the simulation and improved the performance of the economic response variables when compared with the real world values these social constructs and periodic routines are hard-coded although they can be adapted by users major flexibility is provided by the parameter set that can be adjusted to represent from a single community to a complete country in the next section the experimental methodology is discussed as well as the performance metrics and their evaluation to evaluate the proposed approach seven different scenarios that reflect adopted andor hypothetical social distancing interventions have been formulated the proposed abs model was implemented in python version 36 programming language and encapsulated in the covidabs package whose source code is available at httpsbitlycovidabsexperiments and httpsbitlycovid19abssystem each scenario simulates the impact of a given social distancing policy considering the values of the parameters in table 2 on the response variables summarized in table 3 for each scenario 35 executions were performed each one with t1440 iterations since each iteration corresponds to one hour each execution covers exactly 2 months and one complete accounting cycle for houses government and business with one salary and tax payment which occur in the 30th day of the month the monthly accounting event is important for a2 a3 and a4 agents due to its severe cash impact and wealth transfers among agents the main goal of social interventions is to minimize the death curve dt it is directly related to flattening the infection curve it in order to keep the hospitalization ith and severe its cases below the critical limit of the healthcare system 
11 flattening the it curve means minimizing the infection peak ip defined in equation 9 and extending the time tip spent to reach this peak defined in equation 109ipmaxitt1t

 to compare the scenarios the response variables dt it will be considered condensed in the metrics ip and tip the economical analysis aims to assess the evolution of wealth represented by the wst response variables to allow the economic comparison among scenarios with respect to the same reference a baseline scenario b without a pandemic was designed it is meant to isolate the economic dynamic and can be used to assess the impacts of the different interventions in the economy for comparison among scenarios the increase in wealth wsi for the group of agents i  a1 a3 a4 in scenario s is computed as follows11wsiwstiwbtiwbtiwhere wbti is the wealth of the group of agents i at the final simulation time step t of b in the following section the scenarios are defined their simulation results are presented and compared and the main findings discussed this scenario simulates the economic behavior without a pandemic it is used as baseline for comparison with all the other scenarios to generate this scenario set parameters to 
9  0 and 
10  1 despite the economic result of this simulation it is artificial data and consequently it does not represent the reality of any country nonetheless we argue that it is based on projections before the pandemic outbreak see for instance the references regarding each parameter listed in table 2 the evolution of gdp is illustrated in figure 4
 the gdp indicates a recession chart where the population a1 and government a4 is losing wealth and the businesses a3 are floating at the equilibrium point when the incomes and expenses are equal initially the a3 are profiting but in the accounting day the profits are settled by the labor and tax expenses the baseline scenario is consistent with the economic predictions of stagnation in brazil this scenario represents what could happen if politicians decided not to take any actions to avoid the increase of the number of people infected by the sars-cov-2 virus usually this decision only targets the economic point of view figure 5
shows the epidemiological and economical average curves of this scenario and their variances it can be seen that the economic curves look closer to the ones of the baseline confirming the economic motivation of keeping the environment without interventions however when the contagion curve it is considered it is possible to note how the healthcare system critical limit 
11 was trespassed pushing the death curve dt up the high number of lost lives makes this the most catastrophic scenario despite its economic resemblance with b this scenario represents the complete social isolation following the who recommendations during a well defined date range in this scenario all a1 agents are kept in their houses and the walk freely and go to work routines are suppressed also 
6  1 reducing the mobility amplitude of all a1 even the homeless as discussed in section 331 the lockdown is unconditional meaning that from t0 to t all the restrictions are applied this scenario is highly conservative in healthcare terms and the main goal is to save as many lives as possible by minimizing viral spreading in the impossibility of effective testing the entire population stays in lockdown for a predefined period of time broadly speaking the infected agents only have contact with their housemates and the it and especially its stays below the healthcare critical limit 
11 and the deaths dt  0 meaning that the healthcare system could handle effectively all cases using its available resources3
 considering the economic point of view see figure 6
 this scenario is the worst for the industry because the a1 agents cannot generate wealth but keep receiving their labor incomes4
 a3 does not have income but keeps paying taxes to a4 and labor expenses to a1 in this scenario after two months the businesses lost 20 of its gdp share see wsta3 in figure 6 the key point for the success of lockdown policy is staying at home voluntarily or under laws economical countermeasures to its harm can also be adopted by a4 as tax exemptions and universal income in order to minimize the wealth losses in the impossibility of implementing this scenario another one that considers protective and distance measures should be evaluated this scenario imposes the same restrictions on a1 mobility presented in scenario 2 but conditionally in the system when the infection curve grows above a certain threshold it  005 the lockdown restrictions are activated being released when it  005 as we can see in figure 7
 the viral spreading represented by the infection curve it is controlled not allowing the explosion of dt curve economically recession can be observed during the lockdown period w3ti lower than wbtii but as soon as the restrictions are released the business performance is recovered w3ta3 remains below wbta3 but above the complete lockdown curve w2ti less conservative than scenario 2 and also less efficient in terms of dt this scenario was implemented in new zealand 66 and it depends on an effective healthcare system that is capable of carrying out the necessary tests in the population granting reliability in it estimates and as in scenario 2 the governmental ability to enforce the social isolation vertical isolation is the name given to the social intervention policy where the known infected people and the known risk groups  elderly and people with pre-existent diseases  are kept in social isolation whereas young people and adults are allowed to work regularly this policy has for instance been advocated by the brazilian president5
 in terms of the proposed model over 65 below 18 years old and symptomatic regardless of the age stay at home the assumption of this policy is that all the people outside the risk groups would not develop the severe cases of the disease this assumption was proved to be fragile and this policy showed to be ineffective by 67 the results shown in figure 8
are in accordance with the literature 67 and produced almost the same epidemiological and economical results of scenario 1 ie the same results of doing nothing in the scenarios with lockdown 2 and 3 the mobility of all agents must be restricted requiring restrictive public policies enforced by the government when these policies are non-existent or are not taken seriously by the entire population partial isolation levels are reached the partial isolation level il  0 1 means the percentage of the population that is fulfilling the isolation while the remaining 1il is not then it is possible to define that in the lockdown il  09 considering that essential services and a few industries can not stop in order to avoid supply breakdown on the other hand the scenarios 0 and 1 have il  01 and the scenario 4 has il  02 because of the age distribution and the definition of risk groups this scenario aims to assess the effects of intermediate ils it was simulated by randomly choosing agents a1 with probability il  05 to stay at home observing the results in figure 9
 although the it curve is flattened when compared with scenarios b and 4 it is still less efficient than scenarios 2 and 3 notice the dt still grows exponentially before reaching the peak for the economic perspective this scenario behaves similarly to the baseline these metrics offer evidence that il  05 is not enough for effective epidemiological control and a level of isolation greater than that is recommended the impact of different isolation levels can be seen in figures 10
and 11
 for il  03 09 which represents the response of epidemiological and economical curves for increasing il in figure 10 it is possible to see how the infection curve it flattens as the isolation level increases from no isolation towards lockdown figure 11 shows that as the value of il increases wealth loss of the a3 agents is higher represented by wsta3 curve showing the importance of agents mobility in the economy evidence was found about the use of masks and gloves as measures against viral spreading 68 this scenario represents the policy of mandatory usage of face masks and physical distancing but without imposing restrictions on the mobility of agents this scenario was implemented by reducing the contagion distance 105 and the contagion rate 203 as the effect of using masks and physical distancing figure 12
shows a flatter it curve when compared to scenario 5 while still keeping economic performance close to b notice however that dt is significantly higher when compared with scenarios 2 and 3 this scenario combines the policies used in the scenarios 5 and 6 granting the necessary use of face masks plus partial isolation of the population this scenario was implemented by using 105
203 and il05 
figure 13
shows the dynamics of this scenario although the dt is still above the values of scenarios 2 and 3 it presents less resistance from the general population the it is flattened and the economy despite the downturn suffers less than it would in scenarios with lockdown this scenario has already been discussed in 68 with similar results the it curves averages of each scenario are shown in figure 14
 there the effects of each intervention policy in flattening the curve can be observed and contrasted the epidemiological effectiveness of the scenarios are shown in figure 15
 which compares the infection peak ip reached in each case the number of days tip to reach the peak ip and the max number of deaths dt as a proportion of the population as expected scenarios 2 and 3 have the best epidemiological values followed by scenario 7 
figure 16
shows the economic result of each scenario for the agent types a1 a3 and a4 assuming that businesses are not firing anyone from the point of view of the citizen scenarios 2 and 3 are not economically damaging on the other hand the same scenarios are the worst from the business perspective at this point it is important to explain that the expenses of government in our simulation are related with the costs of the healthcare system thus in scenarios with a high number of deaths such as scenarios 1 and 4 the cost of maintaining the healthcare system is increased which demands an increase of public expenses

shows the scatter plots of the wealth increase with respect to the baseline of each type of agent by the percentage of deaths in the populations it can be seen that from a life preservation perspective there is no better policy than the lockdown scenario 2 furthermore in the simulated model scenario 2 pareto dominates6
all the scenarios for both people an government on the other hand it represents the worst case financially for businesses in the impossibility of enforcing a lockdown discarding scenarios 2 and 3 which may happen in underdeveloped countries the best solution is represented by scenario 7 from the remaining pareto optimal solutions for businesses it is the one with lowest number of deaths it also becomes the best solution for government and people in both wealth and number of deaths the covid-19 pandemic brought to humankind many challenges including the demand for new medical treatments social policies and economical approaches the fast response of the scientific community to deal with coronavirus was divided into studies of the epidemiological aspects proposals of new treatments and diagnostic tools and new models to forecast the viral spreading including sir and seir models among others nonetheless few studies focused on looking at the pandemics as a governmental policy-making problem with this viewpoint although the epidemiological aspects are priority the social and economical aspects can not be neglected the present work proposed an agent-based model abm that simulates the epidemiological and economical effects of covid-19 pandemic in a closed society whose results can be generalized for wider contexts and used by governmental rulers to prospect social policies and assess its potential effectiveness in real scenarios the model was encapsulated in the free and open source software library covid-abs which contains 29 epidemiological social demographic and economic input parameters and 10 output response variables new features can be designed and the library can be easily extended to other scenarios in a wider perspective the proposed approach can be used as a decision-support system for the governments and scientific community policy-makers can design scenarios and evaluate the effectiveness of social interventions through different simulations and analyse how the p parameters in the time horizon of t can affect the response variables t seven different scenarios were elaborated to reflect specific social interventions lockdown and conditional lockdown were the best evaluated scenarios in preserving lives these scenarios present a slower evolution of the epidemic a smaller number of infections and deaths given the impossibility of implementing lockdown policies the scenario with 50 of social isolation with using masks and physical distancing was the best approach in the preservation of lives on the other hand the vertical isolation scenario is totally ineffective and resembles the do nothing scenario the results showed that covid-abs approach was capable to effectively simulate social intervention scenarios in line with the results presented in the literature also the results showed that policies adopted by some countries for instance us sweden and brazil are ineffective when the objective is to preserve lives governments that chose to preserve the economy by not using severe isolation policies fatally reached a situation with a high cost in human lives and still embittered economic losses the evidence provided by the simulation model shows that there is a false dichotomy between healthcare and the economy in the scenarios where it was tried to save the economy by not taking hard social isolation policies consequently the social costs ended up impacting negatively into the economy covid-abs is an open software and can be easily extended and customized also new scenarios can be designed taking into consideration the specificities of each region under study future research aims to improve the model by implementing mechanisms to close and open companies as well as allowing people to get fired in addition it will be integrated with optimization libraries for automatic scenario creation and multi-criteria decision making tools that could help governmental crisis committees to plan and manage the social policies to mitigate the covid-19 effects

million confirmed cases and 115000 confirmed deaths as of june 15 46 2020 however impact of the disease across the us has been unequal with documented 47 geographic heterogeneities in cases and deaths and excess burden in certain subgroups of the 48 population clinical reports have noted the increased incidence and severity of covid-19 49 among individuals with diabetes obesity and chronic lung conditions 1 2  other influential 50 community factors include social and economic vulnerabilities 3 4 referred to in the 51 epidemiologic literature as social determinants of health 5 for example social distancing policies have been adopted by state and local governments at 60 different points during the outbreak and have also been shown to impact covid-19 growth 61 rates 8 however there is evidence to suggest that some communities initiated social 62 distancing before formal implementation of policies 9 and may have relaxed prior to the official 63 releases 10 aggregated mobility data can capture these changes over time and offer a richer 64 resolution for the continuum of community-level behavioral modifications 11 with economic 65 and political pressures to release restrictions it is critically important to assess how community-66 level sociodemographics and mobility play a role in covid-19 mortality in order to develop 67 effective response strategies 68 69 our study combines both community context and social distancing effects and evaluate covid-70 19 mortality rates over time across us counties by simultaneously incorporating population-71 level comorbidities sociodemographic makeup and social distancing over time our approach 72 identifies vulnerable communities at higher risk of mortality our study also quantifies the 73 independent associations between declining mobility and subsequent reductions in mortality 74 rates as well as mortality from community-level factors 75 76 we investigated 24 counties surrounding 7 major metropolitan areas in the us that exhibit 77 heterogeneities in sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidities  figure 1a  as well as 78 differences in timing of the adoption of social distancing over the course of the outbreak  figure  79 1b the metropolitan areas -chicago detroit los angeles new orleans new york city san 80 francisco and seattle -are similar to those examined in the cdc mmwr on covid-19 and 81

generated in this data pre-processing step were then used as predictors in a model for covid-92 19 mortality 93 94 we used a generalized additive model gam a flexible modeling approach 13 which 95 uniquely and simultaneously addresses three key challenges not fully addressed in current 96 literature first it allows for the quantification of a nonlinear relationship in covid-19 mortality 97 rates over time while accounting for county-specific temporal evolution of covid-19 deaths in 98 these 24 counties second it allows for quantification of the effect of the four pc county-level 99 sociodemographic constructs third it allows for quantification of the lagged relationship of 100 social distancing over time using a penalized distributed lag framework which can account for 101 the time delay that occurs between infection and mortality 14 here we discuss the two major 102 elements of the gam model 1 county-level sociodemographics and 2 social distancing as 103 measured by changes in county-level mobility 104 105 economic vulnerabilities and poor baseline health indicators health and wealth had the 106 strongest associations with covid-19 mortality rates across counties contributing nearly 10 107 times as much explanatory power to the model compared to the next pc predictor housing 108 inequality f-statistic 317 for health and wealth compared to 33 for housing inequality 109 higher prevalence of comorbidities was collectively associated with higher covid-19 daily 110 mortality rates including diabetes obesity and adult smoking  figure 2  figure s3  in contrast 111 higher median household income higher levels of college education and lower unemployment 112 rates were collectively associated with lower covid-19 daily mortality rates  figure 2  figure  113 s3 these effect estimates also incorporate any changes in social mobility over time 114 115 mortality rates associated with health and wealth were between 5 to 35 times higher in new 116 orleans-surrounding counties st bernard jefferson st tammany and plaquemines 117 parishes compared to california bay area counties san francisco san mateo santa clara 118 and alameda counties after accounting for mobility though st bernard a smaller parish near 119 new orleans experienced highly fluctuating numbers of deaths resulting in wider uncertainty at 120 the tails of mortality rate estimates  figure 2  121 122 it is important to note raceethnicity was not implicitly included as an independent variable in 123 county-level sociodemographic constructs rather we included measures such as racial 124 segregation proportion non-native english speakers income and housing quality measures 125 table s2  which represent the underlying community influences that contribute to vulnerable 126 racial and ethnic minority groups communities that scored high on variables contributing to 127 racial and ethnic subgroup vulnerabilities were at exceptionally high risk of covid-19 mortality 128 in this analysis such as detroit and new orleans-area counties figure 2  figure s3  our 129 results are complementary to current case and clinical reports that document a disproportionate 130  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted june 20 2020  amount of severe cases and deaths in disadvantaged populations primarily african american 131 and hispanic communities 4 15-17 and those populations with chronic underlying health 132 conditions 18 including diabetes hypertension and obesity 133 134 there has been considerable debate on the second component of our model namely the 135 impact and effectiveness of social distancing on the covid-19 outbreak we used googles 136 human mobility data 19 as a proxy for social distancing as it objectively reflects the localized 137 changes in movement early on in the outbreak before state and local social distancing policies 138 were put into place because social distancing policies were issued in response to exponential 139 growth in the epidemic we observed a paradoxical relationship between the declining trajectory 140 of mobility against a rising trajectory of covid-19 deaths  figure 1b  also observed in other 141 populations 20 in this analysis we controlled for the time evolution of the outbreak and 142 modeled mobility as multiple distributed lags of 0 to 30 days to account for this real-time trend 143 this framework allows for a sufficient number of lag days without over-parameterizing the 144 model 145 146 our model shows that reduced mobility in all study counties was associated with steady linear 147 declines in mortality rates over a 30-day period after controlling for county-level principal 148 components moreover we found that it may take approximately 25 to 30 days to observe 149 reductions in mortality rates following declines in mobility from baseline reference point 0 150 change in mobility figure 3  in the beginning of the observed epidemic declines in mobility 151 occur concurrently with a rise in mortality rates  figure 1b  which is why studying the delayed 152 lagged effect of mobility is critical to capture associations over time the largest reductions in 153 mortality rates were observed at the highest levels of social distancing ie the highest 154 reductions in mobility for example mortality rate reductions of 13 95 ci 7 17 and 155 15 95 ci 9 24 after 30 days were associated with decreases in mobility of 50 and 156 80 respectively compared to more modest mortality rate reductions after 30 days associated 157 with decreases in mobility of 25 and 10  figure 3  conversely increasing mobility by 10 158 was associated with a small but steady increase in mortality rate over the 30-day lag period 159 160 it is possible that these relationships will change or strengthen over time as the outbreak 161 persists providing longer time periods in which to observe changes in mobility and lagged 162 effects however these findings suggest that the relationships between mobility and mortality 163 rates are complex and it can take at least four weeks to observe notable reductions in deaths 164 these findings are consistent with our hypothesis that as communities in the us return to pre-165 social distancing levels of mobility increases in mortality rates will likely be observed around 166 four weeks later most importantly these findings suggest that mortality rates in the initial days 167 following social policy implementations may appear paradoxically higher compared to rates pre-168 social distancing and take time to decline 169 170 sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of findings around the principal 171 components and lagged mobility results were similar when we 1 conducted our statistical 172 analysis using two different lagged modeling approaches for mobility 2 excluded new york 173  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the

period of observation time figures s4-s8  175 176 our results demonstrate it is critical to study covid-19 in a broader context by combining 177 community-level variables and mobility data we are able to understand their relative impact at a 178 population level as more data on covid-19 emerge evidence continues to mount on the 179 sociodemographic disparities of the covid-19 outbreak in the us and globally 4 15 21 as 180 observed by chung and colleagues 16 the scientific community is witnessing a 181 socioeconomic gradient in the covid-19 outbreak in which disadvantaged communities are 182 at higher vulnerability to covid-19 infection and death these social determinants of health are 183 well described in the broader health literature 22 this analysis also adds to the growing body of evidence on the relationship between mobility 192 and covid-19 20 24 25 but takes a step further to contextualize the evolution of the 193 outbreak at the county-level in the us we show that social distancing was associated with 194 reductions in covid-19 mortality rates of up to 15 after 25-30 days relative to baseline 195  figure 3  lagged effects of mobility additional lagged terms at the

has dramatically changed travel behavior in affected cities the c2smart research team has been investigating the impact of covid-19 on mobility and sociability new york city nyc and seattle two of the cities most affected by covid-19 in the us were included in our initial study an all-inone dashboard with data mining and cloud computing capabilities was developed for interactive data analytics and visualization to facilitate the understanding of the impact of the outbreak and corresponding policies such as social distancing on transportation systems this platform is updated regularly and continues to evolve with the addition of new data impact metrics and visualizations to assist public and decision-makers to make informed decisions this paper presents the architecture of the covid related mobility data dashboard and preliminary mobility and sociability metrics for nyc and seattle  human-centered computing  visualization  software and its engineering  software creation and management  the novel coronavirus covid-19 spreading rapidly throughout the world was recognized by the world health organization who as a pandemic on march 11 2020 15  as of may 17 confirmed coronavirus cases in the us surpassed 1400000 and new york has the highest number of confirmed cases 348232 confirmed cases as of may 15 in the country 13  the covid-19 pandemic and ensuing social distancing orders have had dramatic impacts on the use of every mode of transportation with little information on similar historic pandemics collection of perishable mobility safety and behavior data related to covid-19 and learning from the collected data becomes the key for decision-makers c2smart researchers have developed an interactive data dashboard httpc2smartengineeringnyueducovid-19-dashboard that consolidates multiple public data sources listed in table 1  to investigate changes in mobility and sociability patterns the main objective of this paper is to introduce the developed platform based on the analysis of data obtained in nyc and seattle time lag between different cities may offer some insights into how travel patterns evolve in the context of covid-19 figure 1 illustrates the architecture of the tool the core of the platform resides on cloud computing that provides a reliable infrastructure for solid performance on large scale data processing and analysis the ingestion instances inside the platform consume the raw data stream and evaluate it based on data accuracy timeliness validity and granularity once the evaluation is completed the outcome data will be dispatched to the internal data warehouse for further analysis the data dashboard is capable of performing real-time data analytics and visualization the dashboard contains two main sub-boards a mobility board and b sociability board the mobility board presents multi-data views in terms of vehicular traffic volume corridor travel time transit ridership freight traffic by gross vehicle weight gvw as well as risk indicators in terms of reported crashes pedestrian and cyclist fatalities and speeding tickets scenario analysis can be performed directly to these metrics in time series or with spatiotemporal aggregations the sociability board presents average and maximum intersection crowd density bike and pedestrian counts related to open streets and pedestrian social distancing compliance rates based on information extracted from real-time traffic cameras the tool also connects to c2smarts matsim agent-based simulation virtual testbed 4 that provides network performance and emission evaluation for reopening phases the section illustrates some results offered by the mobility board the closing of essential businesses and stay-at-home policies caused an immediate direct impact on transportation data shows steep declines in both transit ridership and vehicular traffic travel time on corridor 495 that connects long island and new jersey nj via queens and manhattan in nyc was analyzed in figure 2 12 8  a flatter travel time pattern of near free-flow speeds was observed following the stay-at-home orders instead of typical spikes of commuter peaks increased traffic volume and travel time were observed in the week of may 4 indicating the start of the recovery period for nyc an increase in traffic speed and school zone speeding tickets was observed with some city streets operating at or near free-flow speed during the pandemic for example on april 15 during the traditional morning peak hour 83 of the 145 local road segments where data is available had an average traffic speed over the city speed limit of 25 mph in morning peak hour 28 of them were over 20mph while only 34 had an average traffic speed over 20mph in february prior to the pandemic more mobility metrics for nyc are summarized in table 2 and notable changes have been seen for example crashes remain low but the severity of crashes measured by fatalities is up this may possibly be due to higher vehicular speeds but more data is needed for further investigation bikeshare ridership remains down with the exception of the first 12 days of march ridership patterns did change with 15 fewer friday and saturday trips and a 20 increase in average trip duration in march 2020 compared to the same month last year if not specified the percentage shown in the table compares the data in 2020 with 2019 the greater seattle area is the first epicenter of the covid-19 outbreak in us as it reported the first confirmed case in late january washington state in particular the greater seattle area therefore responded very early to set up guidelines and executive orders of social distancing to slow down the spread of the novel coronavirus travel time data for a segment on interstate-5 were collected via google directions api 6 and analyzed to investigate the trends on corridor travel time travel time started to decrease since early march and reached the lowest level near free-flow travel time since early april it remained low for the entire april and began to increase in early may the critical date analysis in figure 3 demonstrated that the typical spikes of commute peaks disappeared since the release of stayat-home order on march 23 2020 indicating most people reacted immediately to the order due to less traffic the reliability of travel time became higher the standard deviation of daytime travel time of the corridor reduced to 067 minutes in late april compared with 643 minutes in late february traffic volumes at three freeways locations i-5 downtown seattle near freeway park i-5 ne of green lake park and sr-520 toll bridge showed a consistent drop in traffic volume in march followed by a gradual slow increase in april using the same week of previous year as a baseline traffic volume at the i-5 downtown seattle station dropped to its lowest level -4691 in the week of march 30 and gradually increased to -4195 -3550 and -2631 in the weeks of april 13 27 and may 11 respectively similar trends have been observed for the other two stations the continuous increasing trend of traffic volume indicates that the impact of traffic in seattle is slowly returning to pre-pandemic despite stay-at-home restrictions remaining in place on the other hand public transit demand 2 remained low since late march and has not started to recover yet mobility metrics for seattle are shown in table 3  although social distancing orders are announced it remains unclear how people are responding to these policies understanding the actual reduction in social contact and actual compliance rate is important to measuring the effectiveness of the policy therefore 311 complaints and real-time camera videos are used to examine the compliance of social distancing policies an increase in social distancing complaints has made the non-emergency police matter category the 2nd most common complaint among nyc311 reports in addition the real-time social distancing behavior has been exampled with the analysis of video data figure 4 presents the video processing and data analysis process applying object detection to real-time traffic camera videos 16 17 with a frame rate of 30 seconds at multiple key locations in different zones within the city provides additional information about crowd density 9  one of the state-of-the-art algorithms retinanet 10  and resnet-50 7 are used as the backbone network architecture the model was pre-trained using the coco data set 11  the open-source platforms tensorflow 1 and keras 5 are utilized as the machine learning librarys support along with opencv 3 for basic video processing to calculate the social distancing compliance rate the centroids of detected pedestrians bounding box are identified and the distance between the centroids are calculated 14  next the ratio of real height and pixel height r-p ratio are computed to project the real distance by assuming every person has the same heights 170 meters558 feet is used in this study traffic-related objects person car truck bicycle bus and the total number of violated social distancing pairs are reported for each frame figure 5 presents an example of the video processing output the program was run on an instance which was configured with intel xeon processors up to 31ghz and 16gib of memory the gpu is nvidia tesla m60 the running time is around 094 secframe without real-time visualization and 106 secondframe with visualization the sociability metrics for nyc is summarized in table 4  biking and walking for recreational purposes become more popular than ever in seattle during the pandemic data from sdot bike and pedestrian counters show that these activities dramatically changed during the covid-19 outbreak period at fremont bridge a critical commuting connector between north seattle and downtown seattle higher bike counts 3500 were observed on weekdays while fewer counts  1000 on weekends in february bike counts reduced to the lowest level in mid-march but grew back to nearly 2500 without a the daily pedestrian pattern of burke gilman trail a 27-mile multi-use trail was also investigated from mid-march the daily pedestrian counts almost doubled compared with the period of prepandemic and such immediate shift reflected the impact of social distancing rules announced in mid-march since small businesses recreational and commercial facilities were closed people switched to public or community trails for recreational purposes the statistics for bikepedestrian counts are summarized in table 5  the pedestrian counts increased over 50 in april compared with the same period in 2019 similar to nyc the social distancing violation detection algorithm was implemented for a local street intersection broadway  e pike st ew in seattle with a frame rate of 30 seconds results on may 18 show an average pedestrian density of 32 peopleframe a maximum pedestrian density of 12 peopleframe and a pedestrian social distancing compliance rate of 89 more camera data will be collected and enlarge the coverage of social distancing compliance detection  this paper introduces an interactive data dashboard developed by c2smart researchers for covid-19 analysis an integrated database that fuses information from multiple data sources including traditional traffic detectors crowdsourcing applications probe vehicles real-time traffic cameras and police and hotline reports for nyc and seattle was build the platform is based on cloud computing and data mining techniques for data acquisition and processing and supports interactive data visualization and data analytics for quantifying multiple mobility and sociability metrics it serves as an all-in-one data fusion tool for open data that is not easy to find in a single place and is highly scalable that can be extended to other cities as of the first week of may data from both nyc and seattle shows that auto traffic volumes began to rise even when the stayat-home restrictions were still in place moreover while vehicular traffic volume has started to increase transit usage remains low indicating a potential shift in mode choice and increased preference for non-public modes of travel at least in the near future the crowd density and social distancing compliance for pedestrians based on data obtained from publicly available dot cameras using state-ofthe-art video processing techniques can provide useful insights into daily pedestrian and cyclist demands and their behavior in terms of maintaining social distance through this interactive data dashboard we are hoping to provide researchers transportation authorities and the general public with information they can use to track the impact of the outbreak on our transportation systems and thus to support them to make more effective data-driven decisions the current dashboard contains data from nyc seattle chicago and six cities from china and will eventually expand to cover more cities worldwide as the world continues to adjust to the new reality of covid-19 c2smart researchers are continuing to collect data including perishable mobility safety and behavior data and will continue to monitor these trends and regularly update findings for different reopening stages in the future the integrated database will be further utilized for predictive analysis to assist developing effective actionable strategies to plan for potential future scenarios  impact of coronavirus pandemic in appointments and anxietyconcerns of patients

patients willing to attend an orthodontic appointment presented significantly lower level of anxiety than patients that would not go or would go only in urgencyemergency females were more anxious than males about coronavirus pandemic quarantine and impact on their orthodontic treatments delay in treatment was the greatest concern of patients undergoing orthodontic treatment  in december 2019 the chinese city of wuhan reported an outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus cases were exported to other chinese cities as well as internationally triggering a global outbreak in january 30th 2020 the world health organization who labeled it as a pandemic globally as of may 10 th  2020 there were 3917366 confirmed cases of covid-19 including 274361 deaths reported by who 1 this scenario is compelling countries around the world to have preparedness plans and mitigation interventions for quick deployment globally 2 the unpredictable and inevitable character of new infectious diseases has been recognized along the millennia this kind of disease causes global and social economic impact related to unexpected illnesses and deaths as well as interference in travel plans business and normal life activities 3 dubious or even false information about the disease behavior geographic range number of infected and actual mortality rate has led to insecurity and fear in the population 4 from the first impressions about epidemiological data about the covid-19 pandemic 5 6 studies about how this can impact the mental health are recommended 7 the covid-19 is a viral infection caused by the novel coronavirus interpersonal transmission occurs mainly via respiratory droplets and contact transmission in addition to these characteristics asymptomatic subjects and patients in the incubation period are also carriers of the novel coronavirus 8 9 a recent study 10 showed that coronavirus previously known as sars-cov-2 aerosol transmission is plausible since the virus can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours and on surfaces up to days besides that aerosols from infected people may pose an inhalation threat even at considerable distances and in enclosed spaces particularly if there is poor ventilation 11 the covid-19 pandemic has other implications family organization closure of schools companies and public places changes in work routines leading to a great fear of the unknown 4 the media and public health generally focus on the biological and health consequences of the virus and the pandemic mental health issues that coincide with emerging diseases and epidemic are rarely examined 12 furthermore little is known about the feeling and anxiety of orthodontic patients related to the impact of the pandemic and the social distancing since it is known that missed appointments are associated to a prolonged treatment time 13 14 in many countries recommendations of the national councils of dentistry are to interrupt elective dental treatments and only emergency or urgency cares are allowed in this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved other places social distancing is recommended but dental offices are still able to remain opened with usual dental care providing the necessary biosafety measures according to the recommendations of the national dental associations 15 however many patients are not aware whether or not to attend their appointments with the orthodontist this way the objective of the present study was to evaluate the level of anxiety and concerns of orthodontic patients regarding the coronavirus pandemic and the impact of the quarantine in appointments and in their orthodontic treatment this study was approved by the research ethics committee of the  sample inclusion criteria were patients undergoing active orthodontic treatment on the private clinics of two orthodontists kmsf and fpv age over 12 years agree to participate in the survey a google forms questionnaire was sent to patients of private dental clinics from two orthodontists fpv and kmsf in two metropolitan cities of two different regions of brazil bauru-sp-southeast and porto velho-ro-north by whatsapp messenger app whatsapp inc california usa patients and the respective orthodontists were not identified and the patients agreed to participate in the study patients answered several questions about personal information age gender citystate and regarding the quarantine and their anxiety the levels of anxiety about the coronavirus pandemic and the impact of quarantine in the orthodontic treatment were evaluated by a numerical rating scale nrs 16 being 0 no anxiety and 10 extreme anxiety the questionnaire that is described in table 1  was available for responses only for 72 hours responses were obtained and tabulated in excel for statistical analysis descriptive statistics was performed comparison between males and females was performed with independent t tests to evaluate association of the feeling and level of anxiety regarding quarantinecoronavirus pandemic and the willingness to attend an orthodontic appointment the chi-square one-way anova and tukey tests were used comparison of the observance of quarantine measures and the anxiety about the coronavirus pandemic and impact on orthodontic treatment was performed by one-way anova and tukey tests correlations between age of the patients and the levels of anxiety this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved about the coronavirus pandemic and impact on orthodontic treatment were performed with pearsons correlation coefficient statistical analysis was performed with statistica software version 100 statsoft tulsa usa and results were considered significant for p005 four hundred and seventy-one questionnaires were sent and 354 patients answered most patients 602 would go to an appointment 251 would go only in case of urgencyemergency and 147 would not go q8 the greatest concern of the patients about the impact of quarantine in their respective orthodontic treatment is the delay in the end of treatment 483 followed by breakage of brackets worsening the malocclusion 133 only 2 are worried with the breakage of the accessories causing discomfort or injuries and 17 are concerned with the impairment in the final result besides 347 have no concern q9 the mean level of anxiety related to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and quarantine in orthodontic treatment was 404 more males related to be calm than females which were feeling more anxious afraid and in panic in relation to quarantine and the coronavirus pandemic than males  table 2  the level of anxiety about the coronavirus pandemic was significantly greater for females than for males males were more willing to go a dental appointment than females females were more concerned on how quarantine can affect their orthodontic treatment than males males were more concerned about the delay in treatment and worsens in malocclusion than females the this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved level of anxiety about the impact of coronavirus pandemic on orthodontic treatment was significantly greater for females than for males  table 2  patients that reported to be calm and indifferent were more willing to attend an appointment than patients that were anxious afraid fear or in panic patients willing to go to an orthodontic appointment presented significantly lower score of anxiety than patients that would not go or would go only in case of emergency  table 3  patients that are not respecting the quarantine showed significantly lower levels of anxiety about the coronavirus pandemic and the impact on orthodontic treatment table 4  there was no significant correlation between the age of the patients and the levels of anxiety about the coronavirus pandemic and impact on orthodontic treatment table 5  in relation to the precautionary measures to avoid contamination in dental offices most patients reported as important all the disposable ppes surgical masks 887 medical head cap 811 lab coat 559 and also the use of face shield 551 avoid crossing other patients at reception was considered important for 780 of the subjects and ppe for patients for only 35 alcohol gel available at reception was the most indicated measure by the patients 918q11 when the questionnaire was sent for patients quarantine and social distancing had been recommended in brazil for about 1 month and the coronavirus pandemic was at the beginning of the outbreaks rising curve according to experts 17 with just over a thousand deaths due to covid-19 and about 25 thousand cases confirmed 18 but in other countries like italy spain united kingdom and united states the situation was worse and due to electronic and digital media everyone is informed of the global situation and the risk of a major outbreak with many deaths in our country it is known that there is association between the use of social medias and anxiety 19 some impacts as stress that can lead to depression due to social distancing and isolation are related to increased vulnerability of mental health 7 so the primary objective of this survey was to evaluate the preliminary effects of quarantine on orthodontic treatments besides to assess the level of anxiety awareness concerns and attitude of patients facing this pandemic studies like this are useful because they raise clinically important information and more nuanced understanding regarding the present situation helping the clinicians to provide besides the needed dental care also necessary hosting and attention this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved despite the limitation of a non-probabilistic sample that does not allow population inferences or generalizations the online survey methodology allows a quick problem overview concerning so many doubts and uncertainties even so the methodology expanded the sample to two different and distant brazilian regions it seems that patients are respecting the social distancing recommendation since 782 are leaving their homes only when necessary and most patients are workingstudying at home patients that are respecting the quarantine not leaving home or going out only when necessary showed significantly higher levels of anxiety about the coronavirus pandemic and the impact on orthodontic treatment table 4  however even in this coronavirus outbreak situation 447 related to be calm and 56 indifferent however 463 answered that is afraid or anxious with the pandemic it indicates that most patients are aware of the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic although the study was conducted preliminarily males related to be calmer than females and the level of anxiety was significantly greater for females regarding the pandemic this result is in accordance with a nationwide survey of psychological distress among chinese people in the covid-19 epidemic where female respondents showed significantly higher psychological distress than their males counterparts 21 females were also feeling more anxious about the impact of the quarantine in orthodontic treatment males were more willing to attend an orthodontic appointment and women were less worried about delay in treatment than men  table 2  this result is probably because women feel safer staying at home or going to the orthodontist only in case of urgencyemergency a previous study on the distress during a disease epidemic also showed that women has a higher risk for psychological distress during quarantine than men 22 there was no correlation between the age of the patients and level of anxiety table   5  a recent research showed that younger people reported a significantly higher prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms during pandemic than older people 20 the absence of this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved correlation in our study is probably because the questionnaire was sent in early quarantine period when subjects were not yet showing much signs of stress and anxiety most patients 602 reported that would go to an appointment if the dentiststaff called to schedule patients were more concerned about the delay in finishing treatment because they expect the duration of treatment to be as short as possible 23 a previous research indicated that missed appointments increase orthodontic treatment time 14 the american association of orthodontists aao provides weekly updates on how orthodontists should act during the pandemic when the survey was sent recommendation was to follow all applicable federal provincial state and local authorities guidance concerning closure recommendations for non-emergency care 24 so taking into account that in some locations the dental services may be suspended for long periods and added to the concern of patients with delayed treatment the orthodontist should consider possible ways to minimize the delay of treatments such as types of orthodontic archwires and appliances that allow spaced appointments without losing treatment efficiency 25 orthodontic patients are aware of the need for compliance and attendance to the appointments and care with the appliance in order to obtain a good final result within the period stipulated by the clinician some patients 347 had no concern with the impact of the quarantine in their orthodontic treatment this indicates confidence in the orthodontist communication between the orthodontist and the patient and reassurance by the orthodontist is the mainly reason in predicting patient satisfaction good dentist-patient relationship and patient cooperation in following the prescribed instructions 26 the feelings and level of anxiety about the coronavirus pandemic and impact of quarantine in orthodontic treatment were significantly associated to the willingness to attend an appointment since patients that were willing to go to the dental office were more calm or indifferent and reported significantly lower scores of anxiety than patients that would not go or would go only in case of emergency table 3  regarding the precautionary measures to avoid contamination the great majority of patients indicated alcohol gel available for patients at reception avoid crossing other patients use of disposable surgical masks medical head caps and lab coats face shields were also considered important this indicates that patients are conscious that these recommendations are important and to follow them will improve the patientorthodontist confidence and relationship orthodontists and dental staff must be attentive to establish an effective communication with patients to increase mutual trust provide information and some type of this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved care remotely in this context the use of telehealth and other technologies to support long distance health care has stood out as a good option for face-to-face service especially in disasters and public health emergencies 27 common modalities include phone calls live videoteleconferencing texting messages via whatsapp or social medias and e-mails allowing orthodontists and dental staff to communicate 247 with patients 28 certainly this care and contact with patients will bring greater confidence in the orthodontist and staff and will relieve stress and anxiety regarding patients ongoing orthodontic treatments moreover it is knows that the most important contributing factor to patient satisfaction is the doctorpatient relationship 29 it is clear that face-to-face interactions will certainly always have a central role in health care and many patients will need to visit the dental office but a system focused on highquality non-visit care would work better for many others -and quite possibly for orthodontists as well 30 the future is now and orthodontics has its space within telemedicine and teledentistry the limitations of this study are the cross-sectional design and the reliance on selfreported questionnaires however as far as we known these data were not yet reported in the literature and it is strongly recommended 7 due to the particularities of the current situation the quarantine recommended due to the coronavirus pandemic showed to have impact on orthodontic appointments and anxiety of patients patients that were willing to attend an orthodontic appointment presented a significantly lower level of anxiety than patients that would not go or would go only in case of urgencyemergency females were more anxious than males about coronavirus pandemic quarantine and impact on their orthodontic treatments delay in treatment was the greatest concern of patients undergoing orthodontic treatment alcohol gel available at reception use of surgical masks medical caps and to avoid crossing other patients at reception were the most important precautionary measures considered by patients

and inequalities reflecting on the impacts of the influenza and coronavirus pandemics in the united states jennifer roberts d shadi tehrani o   across millennia disease outbreaks have impacted societies and reinforced the human perception of frailty and mortality 2 dramatic demographic shifts in the past century have escalated the difficulty in containing a pandemic and the rise of globalization and urbanization have facilitated the rapid spread of pathogens from one continent to another in a flight of just a few hours yet when a comparison is drawn between the 2019 coronavirus pandemic and the 1918 influenza pandemic the most widely available tools to respond to these disease outbreaks have remained nearly the same public health interventions have been and are still the first line of defense against a pandemic in the absence of a vaccine 3 understanding that the environment plays a significant role in disease dynamics and in determining the health of individuals has always been an essential aspect to controlling and managing infectious diseases for example the history of urban planning in the past century has highlighted how built environments can have an effect on preventing both chronic and infectious diseases 4 however the function of human behaviors and social ideologies stemmed from the darker side of humanity must also be acknowledged as an important component to determining who lives and who survives during the deadliest periods of disease pandemics in the midst of world war i the influenza pandemic spread worldwide during 1918-1919 and was outstanding in its lethality 5 while there is not a universal consensus on the pandemics origin it is understood to have been was caused by a h1n1 subtype of an influenza a virus with avian and swine genetic origins 678 over the course of the pandemic an estimated one third of the worlds population approximately 500 million persons became infected and the total deaths were estimated at 50 million or arguably as high as 100 million 7 historically the curve of influenza deaths in humans has been u-shaped with peaks among infants and the elderly nevertheless this 1918 influenza pandemic exhibited a w-shape age-related fatality with the addition of a third peak among young adults 79 as such death rates for individuals 15 to 34 years of age were 20 times higher than in previous years 710 the influenza pandemic occurred in three distinctive waves over a 12-month period in europe asia and north america the first wave of the pandemic which began in spring 1918 and lasted approximately six months was not particularly virulent and mimicked typical seasonal flu symptomology and mortality 7811 however due to a possible viral mutation over the course of the summer and wartime troop movements this first wave was then followed by a rapid succession of more fatal second and third waves in the autumn of 1918 septembernovember and the winter and spring of 1919 january-may respectively 712131415 in the united states the first outbreak of flu-like illnesses was detected in march 1918 with more than 100 cases at camp funston in fort riley kansas 1617 within a week the number of influenza cases quintupled throughout the army installation 16 by the end of the month approximately 1100 soldiers were hospitalized and 38 had died after developing pneumonia 18 nevertheless thousands of soldiers were continually deployed for world war i and traveled across the atlantic ocean in europe the disease first appeared in april 1918 among american soldiers in a military camp near bordeaux france 517 the influenza presentation was in the form of a benign fever accompanied by cold-like symptoms and the attending american doctors believed the underlying cause was haemophilus influenzae a pathogenic bacterium formally called pfeiffers bacillus 19 the spring 1918 wave of influenza affected nearly 15000 soldiers from april to july but only five american soldiers died 19 although the mortality of this first pandemic wave was minor in comparison to the waves to come spain was the first european country in which the disease spread to wide sectors of the population thus causing a significant level of mortality in may and june 1918 there were 276 influenza deaths in madrid which represented a mortality rate of 042 deaths per 1000 people 19 during this same period another 852 unconfirmed influenza deaths were attributed to different respiratory system pathologies if these unconfirmed deaths were combined with the confirmed influenza deaths the mortality rate would have been 131 per 1000 people the highest mortality figure traceable to this pandemic 19 up until this point very little was written or documented about the strain of the outbreak or its epidemiologic indications due to wartime censorship however this mortality rate from one single etiological agent could not be overlooked in may 1918 the spanish newspaper el sol first published a report about a sickness which had not yet been diagnosed by doctors and headlines around the world labeled this as one of the worst pandemics in human history 1920 thus the derivation of spanish influenza was conceived 5 in september 1918 the second and most deadly wave of the pandemic emerged within the united states 21 soldiers at camp devens an army training camp just outside of boston massachusetts and sailors aboard the receiving ship at commonwealth pier in boston began reporting flu-like symptoms 1622 by months end more than 14000 cases were reported at camp devens approximately one-quarter of the total camp and 757 soldiers succumbed to influenza 16 the massachusetts department of health informed local newspapers of the epidemic and stated that unless precautions are taken the disease in all probability will spread to the civilian population of the city 22 at the nearby navy radio school within harvard university in cambridge massachusetts cases of influenza were reported among the group of 5000 young men studying radio communications as 1918 concluded cambridge experienced 3014 cases of influenza among its meager population of 109000 residents ultimately leading to a mortality rate of 541 per 100000 23 during this time in new york state the board of health in new york city added influenza to the list of reportable diseases and required all cases to be isolated at home or in a city hospital 16 moreover in a document entitled fighting influenza with transit systems the board of health adopted a plan to set operation schedules for many business which would then elongate the time window for transit service and reduce congestion 2425 in lieu of subway suspension royal copeland the city health commissioner staggered workdays by industry so that instead of everyone arriving at work at 900 am some were to come in later or earlier 26 other cities such as seattle washington followed suit in controlling the transmission of influenza within public transit environments by requiring passengers to wear face masks before boarding streetcars figure 1 27 interestingly commissioner copeland did not issue an order to close schools or the prohibition of public gatherings at theaters in new york city he stated that his rational to not issue general closing orders and making a public flurry over the situation was to keep down the danger of panic and that he wanted people to go about their business without constant fear and hysterical sense of calamity 29 unlike new york city public gatherings were prohibited and social distancing was encouraged with the closure of theaters movie houses and night schools in other cities namely chicago illinois reno nevada and madison wisconsin 3031 there was also a call for volunteers to help nurse the infirmed in chicago and other cities throughout the united states due to the severe deficit of professional nurses a shortage resulting from the deployment of nurses to military camps and the failure to use trained african american nurses 16 despite the social distancing efforts employed in new york city and chicago philadelphia pennsylvania choose to ignore these initiatives on september 28 1918 the city held its fourth liberty loan drive a parade that gathered over 200000 philadelphians within days after the parade over 1000 people were dead another 200000 cases of influenza were reported every bed in the citys 31 hospitals was filled and the city was forced to close churches schools theaters and all other places of public amusement 223233 a week after the parade 2600 philadelphians had died 34 with the pile up of corpses in philadelphia cold-storage plants were used as temporary morgues and a trolley car manufacturer donated 200 packing crates to be used as coffins 16 by early october single day influenza deaths reached record numbers in philadelphia 289 deathsoctober 6 1918 and new york city 851 deathsoctober 15 1918 22 the virus continued to journey westward to louisiana texas new mexico utah california and washington the wearing of six-ply gauze masks became mandatory in washington and parts of california 1622 for example in san francisco california individuals were fined 5 us dollars usd an equivalent of approximately 85 usd today if they were seized in public without face masks 33 in salt lake city utah officials placed quarantine signs on the doors of 2000 homes where occupants had been infected with influenza 16 the end of the second wave which left its mark as being the deadliest of all three waves coincided with the end of world war i on november 11 1918 1121 as people celebrated armistice day with parades and large gatherings a public health calamity was lurking with an influenza resurgence in some cities 1622 by december 1918 the second wave of the pandemic had passed but the health threat was far from over in australia a third wave erupted in january 1919 and eventually drifted back to europe and the united states 18 there were 1800 cases and 101 deaths reported in the first five days of january in san francisco and on the other side of the country in new york city 706 cases and 67 deaths were reported 16 even though eradication of influenza appeared in louisiana and washington many residents in san antonia texas began complaining that a new surge of influenza cases were not being reported 1622 as a precautionary measure states like massachusetts and illinois began to request special appropriations for the study of influenza treatment and to train women as practical nurses in response to the nursing shortage 16 the nursing shortage was so dire in some areas of the country that the american red cross asked local businesses to grant workers a day off if they volunteered in the hospitals at night 35 the mortality rate of the third wave was just as high as the second wave but the end of the war eliminated the conditions that enabled the rapid and widespread transmission of the virus deaths from the third wave paled in comparison to the annihilation during the second wave 18 with one-quarter of the american population infected with influenza the pandemic was affecting everyone it was believed that president woodrow wilson contracted the virus in april 1919 while negotiating the treaty of versailles to end world war i 18 the pandemic finally came to an end during the summer of 1919 although a very minor fourth wave appeared in spring 1920 throughout isolated areas of new york city the pandemic ended simply because individuals who were infected either died or developed immunity with an estimated death toll of 675000 people in the united states the pandemic lowered the average life expectancy by more than 12 years 10 during world war i the worst cases of the influenza pandemic came from overcrowded military barracks and ships with poor ventilation 36 it was quickly found that one way to heal infected wounds was to expose patients to sunlight and open-air in june 1915 sir arthur everett shipley an eminent scientist of the time determined that open-air treatment of infirmed and wounded soldiers at the first eastern general hospital was a success particularly for those with influenza related pneumonia 3738 when the pandemic clinched the united states health officials converted schools halls and large private houses to emergency and open-air hospitals 37 as such open-air hospitals became a common practice by the time of the 1918 pandemic 3940 a combination of outdoor air and sunlight reduced the number of infections and deaths reported at open-air hospitals specifically medics found that regular meals warmth and plenty of fresh air and sunlight helped severely ill patients recover better than indoor nursed patients 41 researchers also revealed that healthcare facilities designed with high ceilings and large windows had the same effect as open-air hospitals 42 accordingly natural ventilation and fresh air was the best way to prevent the transmission of influenza as well as other infectious diseases 43 open-air therapy was one of the popular techniques in dealing with common and often deadly respiratory infections of the time until antibiotics replaced it in the 1950s 44 in the absence of a vaccine for novel pathogens and antibiotics to protect against influenza secondary bacterial infections many authorities suggested non-pharmaceutical interventions for the control of a pandemic 4546 social distancing had become the most well-established non-pharmaceutical public health measure to slow the spread of communicable diseases social distancing measures were implemented through the closing of schools restaurants and theaters as well as the banning and restriction of public gatherings and transportation among cities in the united states during the 1918 pandemic 3 the point of initiation duration and decision to relax social distancing measures profoundly impacted mortality rates during this period 47 for example cities such as philadelphia 748 deaths per 100000 at 24 weeks that initiated social distancing measures later and for shorter periods tended to have spikes in deaths and overall higher death rates figure 2 348 in philadelphia the first cases of the influenza appeared on september 17 1918 47 however the philadelphia public health director dr wilmer krusen understated the risk of disease transmission dr krusen assured people that sick soldiers were suffering from casual seasonal influenza which could be avoided by staying warm he allowed large public gatherings notably the fourth liberty loan drive parade on september 28 1918 as mentioned previously as a result philadelphia experienced a mortality acceleration that was 360 higher than the average american city 49 in comparison cities such as minneapolis minnesota 267 deaths per 100000 at 24 weeks that ordered social distancing measures sooner and for longer periods slowed the transmission rate and lowered overall death rates 348 furthermore cities that relaxed social distancing measures prematurely experienced multiple spikes in deaths this was observed in st louis missouri due to its low death rate the city lifted restrictions on public gatherings less than two months after the influenza outbreak began however a sharp and higher spike of new cases soon followed 348 research comparing 17 american cities has suggested that the implementation of early interventions to control the spread of influenza may have significantly decreased the rate of transmission and mortality observed 47 cities across the united states including milwaukee wisconsin and indianapolis indiana had the most effective interventions and reduced transmission rates by up to 3050 50 the lower level of mortality was due to the quick public health response in the first days of the epidemic and the introduction of broad measures designed to promote social distancing 4750 initially the american medical community minimized the scale and scope of the influenza pandemic to create a false sense of security in the countrys largest cities including philadelphia 11 yet this was an issue beyond the medical community this was a public health crisis that brought to light urban environment deficiencies namely the proliferation of municipal waste and unsanitary living conditions 51 while not always well understood the presence and threat of infectious diseases has shaped urban planning in the united states during this early 20th century pandemic urban environments in new york city chicago and other american cities were densely populated and characterized by crowded tenement housing in proximity to factories animal yards and slaughterhouses with little airflow or light 452 even before the 1918 influenza outbreak cities were plagued with cholera tuberculosis and typhoid epidemics 4 medical models specifically the miasma theory an idea that diseases were caused by a noxious form of bad air prevailed but there was also a sense that the congestion pollution lack of sunshine and poor airflow contributed to illness 452 in response urban planning efforts introduced zoning to spatially segregate residential commercial and industrial uses and housing regulations to require light and airflow in order to improve overcrowding and unsanitary urban living conditions 452 during the 1918 pandemic urban reformers and engineers again tried to prevent infection by improving waste removal and housing quality and creating technological enhancements to control environmental nuisances and hazards but trivial cooperation from municipal government leadership and interference of the private interest sector often blocked immediate and effective action 51 as a result the schism in the public health community ultimately impacted the lives of millions 53 epidemic diseases have not been random events that afflicted societies capriciously and without warning they typically unfold across a wide spectrum of communities that are diverse by race age gender and socioeconomic status 5455 the 1918 pandemic affected the youngest and wealthiest people without any boundaries racially the composition of the country during this time was predominately black and white and up until this point medical and public health reports had documented that african americans suffered higher morbidity and mortality rates for several diseases in comparison to white americans 56 specifically web du bois a prominent sociologist and civil rights activist found through an analysis of the 1900 us census that the african american mortality rates were two to three times higher for several diseases including tuberculosis pneumonia and diarrheal disease in comparison to the white american mortality rates 57 dubois argued that these disparities reflected social conditions and not racial susceptibilities 57 in poor and working-class urban neighborhoods social conditions like overcrowded housing poor sanitation service and unsafe drinking increased the vulnerability of influenza 51 in 1910 the us census set 2500 as the minimum population threshold for the urban category and by the 1920 us census over 50 of the american population was defined as urban 58 before the onset of the pandemic urban environments within american cities were composed of a predominantly 9345 white population 59 during this period more than 90 of the african american population lived in southern parts of the united states but millions began migrating to the north in search of better job opportunities and living conditions 60 with this first great migration from the rural south to northern cities starting in 1910 a larger share of african americans lived in urban areas during the 1918 pandemic 61 still on average and in comparison to white americans fewer african americans less than 5 lived in high population density urban areas which were the epicenters of the outbreak 62 hence the norms of disease morbidity and mortality for african americans changed during the pandemic during the second wave in fall 1918 african americans had lower influenza morbidity and mortality rates but a higher case fatality rate in comparison to the white population 63 this was an unexpected phenomenon as african americans were expected to have higher influenza morbidity and mortality explanations for this 1918 pandemic norm crossover have included 1 an unequal exposure based on where african americans lived eg urban vs rural environments 2 a higher exposure to the less virulent spring wave which provided some african americans with immunity 3 a military segregation which allowed for less crowding among african american soldiers and 4 an underreporting of influenza cases and deaths for african americans 63 while there has been no evidence that the first spring wave was especially rampant in the south to induce a higher influenza exposure among the majority of african americans living in rural southern areas there has been a clear understanding that the first great migration left a large portion of african americans in cramped dilapidated impoverished and segregated conditions with less access to sanitation and urban social programs in northern cities the segregated african american neighborhoods may have functioned as a makeshift quarantine yet in cities such as baltimore maryland and detroit michigan the segregation created crowded urban ghettoes where tuberculosis became one of the top three causes of death among urban african americans 64 individuals with tuberculosis lung damage were more susceptible to influenza which would explain why a higher proportion of african american influenza cases developed pneumonia and also had higher case fatality rates during the second wave 63 the entrenched racial and economic discrimination within the united states seemed to have both protected and endangered african americans to the 1918 pandemic throughout world war i many doctors had been called into military service and the shortage of the doctors nurses and medical staff caused hospitals to reject patients particularly african americans 56 the american red cross served as the recruiter of nurses for the army with the racial discriminatory practices of the american red cross african american women who tried to gain entry as nurses were rebuffed while the devastation of the pandemic forced the army to drop its ban on african american nurses the racial discrimination still surpassed the need for healthcare in some areas the november 2 1918 edition of the chicago defender reported that the dean of ohios hiram college refused to allow an african american nurse named olive walker to care for influenza patients at the college 5665 african american doctors also found the color line to be rigid in trying to care for white americans during this time 66 racism and legalized segregation restricted african americans and other non-white americans access to healthcare professionals and facilities in cities across the nation african americans received substandard care in segregated hospitals or in confined hospitals that served only african americans many infected people died without seeing a doctor due to the sheer number of bodies that overwhelmed the capacity of hospitals and the heavy burden of the medical staff 67 african american influenza patients exceeded the limit of the frederick douglass memorial hospital one of philadelphias two african american hospitals and pushed the medical director to establish an emergency annex in an african american parochial school 56 in richmond virginia african american patients received care in a hospital basement until the city opened a separate hospital staffed by african americans at an elementary school 5668 the baltimore afro-american newspaper criticized provident hospital the only african american facility in the city for turning patients away 5669 a prohibition on public gatherings that included funerals and wakes prevented families from properly grieving many victims were buried without coffins or were thrown into unmarked burial grounds native americans who practiced different burial practices became exposed to the virus at alarming rates in september 1918 more than 2000 navajos died of influenza in apache county new mexico 22 across the country mass graves were dug to accommodate the pile of corpses 36 african american bodies in particular were neglected by the general public infrastructure in baltimore sanitation department employees refused to dig graves for african american influenza victims after the citys only african american cemetery could not accommodate any more graves 65 the 1918 pandemic took a heavy human toll on entire families and communities with the devastation and bereavement violence erupted in some areas people were shot for not wearing masks and rates of homicides and suicides skyrocketed 22 white supremacist ideologies and racist scientific theories advanced bigoted and false notions of the biological physiological and moral inferiority of african americans when they were blamed for the pandemic 56 throughout the first great migration period african americans were highly visible and thought of as diseases the 1918 pandemic heightened these existing prejudices which were further reinforced by contemporary newspaper headlines such as rush of negroes to city starts health inquiry negros arrive by thousandsperil to health or negro influx brings disease 70 the memory of the 1918 pandemic left a lasting blemish on public health planning and practice and reflected the moral relationships and deterioration of humanity during that period the magnitude of events and death with the influenza pandemic have served as a reference point and hopefully as a severe if not worst-case scenario in december 2019 the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was detected in the wuhan hubei province of the peoples republic of china 71 in the following weeks infections spread across china and other countries around the world 7273 covid-19 was first confirmed to have spread to the united states in january 2020 when a 35-year-old man returned to washington state on january 15 2020 after traveling to visit family in wuhan china was diagnosed 74 on january 30 2020 the first case of person-to-person covid-19 transmission was confirmed in the united states between a married couple after a 60-year-old wife returned from china 75 she subsequently became symptomatic and transmitted the infection to her husband by march 11 2020 there were over 125000 cases and 4500 deaths worldwide 76 as such the world health organization classified the covid-19 outbreak a pandemic as of june 21 2020 there were over two million confirmed cases and 119810 deaths in the united states 77 these numbers however to do include the thousands of americans such as an estimated 5200 people in new york city who died without being tested for covid-19 the coronavirus pandemic in the united states which has the highest number of known cases in the world exploded over the course of march and april 2020 at the start of march most of the cases were tied to overseas travel and there was extremely limited testing available in many parts of the country such as in new york maryland indiana north carolina and louisiana there was a period when the number of cases was doubling every 7 to 14 days 77 one precipitating source of community transmission unique to covid-19 has been cruise ships cruise ships have previously been settings for infectious diseases outbreaks because of their compact closed environments contact with travelers from many countries and crew transfers between ships more than 800 confirmed covid-19 cases occurred on the diamond princess and grand princess cruise ship voyages the latter of which sailed roundtrip departing san francisco from february 11 to 7 march 2020 78 four stops were made in mexico voyage a and most of the 1111 crew and 68 passengers from voyage a remained on board for a second voyage that departed san francisco on 21 february 2020 voyage b with a planned return on 7 march 2020 78 a healthcare provider in california reported two patients who had traveled on voyage a with covid-19 symptoms and one of whom with a confirmed positive covid-19 test subsequently more than 20 additional covid-19 cases among voyage a passengers were confirmed in california on 5 march 2020 a centers for disease control and prevention cdc response team was transported by helicopter to the grand princess cruise ship to collect specimens from 45 passengers and crew with covid-19 respiratory symptoms among these 45 individuals 21 467 had positive covid-19 test results which included two passengers and 19 crew members this high attack rate among passengers and crew has been partially attributed to a high proportion of asymptomatic infections until disembarkation passengers and symptomatic crew members were asked to self-quarantine in their cabins and room service replaced public dining when the grand princess cruise ship docked in oakland california on 8 march 2020 everyone was transferred to land-based sites for a 14-day quarantine period as of 21 march 2020 78 166 of 469 persons with available test had positive covid-19 test results additional covid-19 cases linked to several additional cruises were also reported across the united states 78 by 17 march 2020 the cruise lines international association announced a 30-day voluntary suspension of cruise operations in the united states and the cdc issued a level 3 travel warning for all cruise travel to be deferred worldwide the first preliminary description of outcomes among covid-19 patients in the united states was reported in march 2020 by the cdc this report indicated that fatality was highest in persons aged 85 ranging from 10 to 27 this was then followed by persons aged 6584 years 3 to 11 aged 55-64 years 1 to 3 aged 2054 years 1 and aged 19 years 0 79 pediatric 18 years covid-19 cases less than 2 of the total cases in the united states have demonstrated much milder symptoms and may not even have a cough or fever 80 although severe covid-19 illness leading to hospitalization including intensive care unit icu admission and death can occur in adults of any age 31 of cases 45 of hospitalizations 53 of icu admissions and 80 of deaths have occurred among adults aged 65 years 79 likewise long-term residential care facilities were particularly at risk for covid-19 in washington a female resident of a long-term care skilled nursing facility contracted covid-19 an epidemiologic investigation determined that 129 cases of covid-19 were associated with this facility including 81 residents 34 staff members and 14 visitors the majority of covid-19 cases were women 651 and the median age was 81 years range  54100 years among facility residents 425 years range  2279 years among staff members and 625 years range  5288 years among visitors out of the total 129 covid-19 cases associated with this nursing facility 568 of residents 357 of visitors and 59 of staff members were hospitalized ultimately 23 persons 22 residents and 1 visitor died as a result of covid-19 81 while it is believed that limitations in effective infection control and prevention and staff members working in multiple facilities contributed to the spread within and between facilities the existence of underlying medical conditions has been found to be a very important risk factor among these facility residents the most common chronic underlying conditions were hypertension 691 cardiac disease 568 renal disease 432 diabetes mellitus 370 obesity 333 and pulmonary disease 321 81 by mid-march 2020 the entire united states including four territories had reported cases of covid-19 on 7 april 2020 nationwide case doubling time was approximately 65 days yet for areas such as louisiana the doubling time was 55 days 82 moreover during this time louisiana ranked 5th in the nation with approximately 16200 confirmed cases and nearly 700 deaths of which 70 were african american 7783 the explosion of cases in new orleans has been anecdotally linked to the influx of travelers for mardi gras yet this theory does not explain the situation of shreveport another louisiana hotspot for covid-19 cases 84 initially race and ethnicity data were not reported for covid-19 cases but then the covid-19associated hospitalization surveillance network covid-net was created using the existing infrastructure of the influenza hospitalization surveillance network flusurv-net and the respiratory syncytial virus hospitalization surveillance network rsv-net in order to conduct population-based surveillance 85 during the first month 130 march 2020 of surveillance in the united states 1482 patients hospitalized with covid-19 were surveilled among the covid-19 patients with underlying conditions data 893 had one or more underlying medical conditions the most common conditions were hypertension 497 obesity 483 chronic lung disease 346 diabetes mellitus 283 and cardiovascular disease 278 85 hence the majority of persons hospitalized with covid-19 had underlying medical conditions among patients with race and ethnicity data 450 were white 331 were african american 81 were hispanic 55 were asian and 79 were of other or unknown race 85 again considering that african americans only comprise 13 of the united states population the overrepresentation of african american covid-19 cases sheds light on issues that have often been overlooked dr frank m snowden a professor emeritus of history at yale university stated in an interview with the new yorker that epidemics reflect our relationships with the environmentthe built environment that we create and the natural environment that responds 86 communicable diseases have existed in humankind since the days of hunting and gathering but when the shift to a more agrarian life occurred thousands of years ago the formation of communities by way of built environments created ideal conditions for epidemics built environments the man-made settings constructed and operated for the purpose of human activity include the physical sites where humans live and work and range in scale from homes in neighborhoods to buildings in cities some evidence has shown that high occupant density built environments can encourage the transmission of airborne pathogens that can cause the common cold influenza chicken pox whooping cough tuberculosis and even covid-19 because of increased social interactions and direct contact between individuals 87 open interior spaces where there is a high degree of spatial connectivity and more opportunity for social encounters can facilitate the spread of these pathogens as well as others 88 therefore the coronavirus pandemic has put a spotlight on the relationship between built environments pathogenic infections and public health on march 15 2020 the cdc recommended social distancing also called physical distancing in modern society 798990 most states followed suit and issued stay-at-home orders with detailed directives such as every person is ordered to stay at his or her place of residence except as necessary to perform essential activities and essential activities included grocery shopping obtaining medical prescriptions or service providing care for others or outdoor physical activity 91 many states including maryland and massachusetts prohibited gatherings of more than 10 people and mandated that individuals stay at least six feet apart 91 states throughout the country had ordered most businesses to close banned all non-essential gatherings of any size and implemented telework policies when possible for instance in new york only pharmacies some retailers hospitals manufacturing plants and financial institutions were allowed to open 92 the closure of the schools businesses restaurants without a carry-out or delivery options and leisure activities including theaters and fitness facilities have in essence created an abandonment of many built environment structures many restaurants even with carry-out or delivery options have still needed to cut hours switch to mobile payment systems and create new protocols of operation to face the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic 93 some retailers namely grocery stores have implemented a daily senior shopping hour for this at-risk population and added six feet apart points at checkout lines to help customers maintain a physical distance 9495 amid the coronavirus pandemic companies have enabled work-from-home structures to keep businesses running and assist employees with social distancing compliance nonetheless working remotely has been a growing trend for a while and this pandemic essentially created millions of teleworkers overnight 96 the public transportation infrastructure another essential feature of built environments has also been impacted by the severity of the coronavirus pandemic in compliance with social distancing directives many cities significantly reduced public transit service eg subways buses thereby negatively affecting many individuals needing transit access new yorks metropolitan transit authority closed non-essential lines concentrating resources to transit routes that supported essential personnel and those with urgent personal business 97 new orleans regional transit authority has defined a set of essential destinations and eliminated routes that do not serve these locations 98 the list of essential destinations included only healthcare facilities pharmacies and grocery stores many agencies like the chicago transit authority have also imposed ad-hoc sanitation regimes to minimize the spread of the virus as well as the requirement of face masks for all riders 99 the necessity of these preventative measures were underscored when a detroit city bus driver vented on social media his anger over a coughing bus rider and then subsequently died 11 days later from covid-19 100 in addition to a reduction of public transit in various municipalities throughout the united states the service of commuter trains with amtrak was also disrupted throughout the coronavirus pandemic due to social distancing and shelter-in-place orders on 16 march 2020 amtrak announced a 40 reduction suspension or complete cancellation of various train lines throughout the northeast corridor of the country including the amtrak hartford and winter park express lines 101 amtrak has also required passengers to wear face masks 102 furthermore the department of homeland security dhs issued a notice of arrival restrictions in early march 2020 whereby all airline passengers arriving from china iran and certain european countries were required to travel through one of 13 airports where dhs had established enhanced entry screening capabilities 103 by march 31 2020 the department of state disseminated a global level 4 health advisorydo not travel and advised american citizens to avoid all international travel due to covid-19 104 airborne pathogens can be easily transmitted through indoor air and unfortunately indoor environments have not been designed to prevent the rapid dissemination of new diseases 105 ventilation and the pattern of airflow controls the direction of droplet distribution generated from the respiratory activities of building occupants thus it is essential that environments with high occupant density and mobility such as hospitals schools and offices are designed to minimize the spread of airborne infections 105 administrators and building operators have been searching for ways to promote good design and amenity of built environments even before the coronavirus pandemic new design and planning policies were trying to provide achievable guidance to environmental decision-makers building operators and all indoor occupants in an attempt to minimize infectious disease transmission particularly in dense urban environments 106 consequently the new sars-cov-2 virus has made a profound impact on planning environmental laws and urban infrastructures according to the university of oregons biology and the built environment center stringent social distancing measures and building cleaning efforts needed to be put in place to reduce exposure to sars-cov-2 88 moreover a more involved series of strategies including changes to ventilation systems eg increased outside air fractions to improve indoor air and window operations eg open windows to dilute indoor contaminants have also emerged from the research center 88 these modifications as well as architectural techniques combined with public health interventions can be used to efficiently disable diseases virulence and protect occupants in buildings from airborne pathogens 107108 classifications and guidelines have shown that filtration as part of the ventilation system is a proven way to block the penetration of the outside pathogens into buildings 109110 filtration can improve the indoor air quality and effectively reduce the pathogen loads released in the air 111112 natural light and ultraviolet lights following proper protocols may also have the ability to inactivate sars-cov-2 88 studies have shown that some viruses are susceptible to ultraviolet germicidal irradiation uvgi factors including humidity airflow patterns uvgi energy intensity and duration have been able to impact uvgi effectiveness in inactivating pathogens 113114115116 indoor humidity levels have also been discovered to be vital in the survivability of covid-19 a research team found that indoor humidity levels of 4060 may help minimize the spread and survival of sars-cov-2 and with little risk of indoor mold growth 88 while most designs of air-conditioning systems have not supported central humidification a targeted in-room humidification may be necessary during episodes of pathogen transmission risk 88 the coronavirus pandemic has exposed weaknesses in the american healthcare system specifically the consortium of hospitals there are more than 6000 hospitals with approximately 920000 beds in the united states but even before the pandemic there were fewer doctors and fewer beds per capita than most other developed countries 117118 according to data from the organization for economic cooperation and development the united states has approximately 3 beds per 1000 people 117 the higher rates of hospitalizations for chronic conditions that should not require hospitalization including diabetes mellitus and asthma has compounded the shortage of hospital beds during this pandemic furthermore hospital emergency departments in many areas including rural communities have not been well equipped for modern ailments or the pressures of the coronavirus pandemic 119 designing guidance can aid healthcare facilities and clinics to cope with the increasing volume of covid-19 cases and create small scale segregation rooms 120 the guidance for controlling covid-19 in healthcare settings indicated that patients should be isolated and placed in private rooms with a private bathroom moreover airborne infection isolation rooms should be used for patients who will be undergoing aerosol generating procedures such as intubation or chest compressions 121 to combat the ongoing covid-19 pandemic a dutch architecture firm suggested a studio prototype vital house constructed quickly from sustainable prefabricated wooden materials this vital house a temporary healthcare center could provide icus communication and a large green patio to enable faster patient recovery 122 building pop-up triage tents immediately outside of hospitals has been a solution employed by medical centers throughout the unites states a 14-tent 68-bed hospital in new york citys central park and a 19-feet by 35-feet tent for 40 patients in durham north carolina were constructed exclusively for covid-19 patients when the number of cases needing care exceeded the hospital capacity 123124 these standing tents in empty spaces under hospital overpasses and in proximity to emergency rooms have enabled healthcare workers to rapidly sequester crisis pandemic patients 125 another environmental issue that may have amplified covid-19 transmission was the infection of healthcare workers who may have inadvertently spread the disease to patients for example covid-19 was found to have spread across four buildings of life care center a consortium of skilled nursing facilities in washington 126127 the course of events points to inadequate infection prevention and control measures in hospitals and other healthcare facilities stated by the world health organization sars-cov-2 can survive on surfaces for a few hours up to several days for example sars-cov-2 rna was identified on a variety of surfaces in cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers up to 17 days after cabins were vacated on the diamond princess cruise ship but before disinfection procedures had been conducted 78 reducing the number of flat surfaces where germs can sit has been deemed another way to keep pathogens and viruses from transferring between patients and healthcare workers around the building 125 to control germs and bacteria on surfaces designers have often avoided difficult-to-reach areas or tight corners in buildings and overly-complicated designs in high-touch surfaces 128 according to markovitz hospital designers have attempted to find smart materials and infrastructure that can easily be disinfected and washed 125 also certain materials already standardized in healthcare may find application in other public spaces including antibacterial fabrics and finishes non-porous materials that already exist eg copper as well as those that will inevitably be developed to facilitate cleaning and sanitizing 128 moving forward it will also be important for architectures to immediately remove the high-touch design features of buildings 125 some large public spaces such as airports hotels hospitals gyms and offices have begun moving toward more automation to mitigate contagion this coronavirus pandemic has revealed that using technology to remotely control the most-touched surfaces and developing touch-less technology eg automatic doors voice-activated elevators cellphone-controlled hotel room entry hands-free light switches and temperature controls can significantly mitigate the spread of viruses 96 much of the united states with the exception of essential workers has undergone nearly three months of social distancing in addition to shelter-in-place orders during the coronavirus pandemic compared to others who are currently employed and working from home essential workers must work outside the home these workers including healthcare workers grocery store staff or transit operators have been more likely to be african american and approximately 70 did not have a college degree 129 furthermore one in four essential workers have said that they or someone in their family is a healthcare worker an employment classification that has been considered essential throughout the united states 129 essential workers have been putting themselves at risk in order to keep others alive and maintain a functioning society through the countrys shelter-in-place orders in addition to this risk many essential workers have also been designated as economically vulnerable one in three essential workers reported living in a household that made less than 40000 usd a year and one in seven lacked health insurance 129 moreover millions of essential workers rely on government assistance programs 130131132 with a lack of options many of these workers cannot afford to quit their jobs in spite of the heightened risk to sars-cov-2 exposure through their employment a polarization has emerged among essential workers as a result of the inherent inequalities that persist within the united states for example there has been a clear economic and social distinction between a salaried pulmonologist who treats the respiratory system of covid-19 patients and an hourly waged grocery store cashier who processes and bags customer purchases yet both are considered essential aside from the difference in wages the highly educated pulmonologist has been socially revered and showered with personal protective equipment campaigns while the grocery store cashier has been largely ignored undervalued and unsupplied with simple face masks it is clear that some essential positions require relatively few educational credentials or certifications and the skills necessary tend to be easy to learn and nontechnical therefore the pool of these particular workers is large and it has been easy for employers to hire and fire these workers at-will while simple economic concepts such as supply and demand can only partly account for the polarization of essential workers during the coronavirus pandemic the norms of inequality within the united states contributes to the bulk of the circumstance the jobs of essential workers have been more likely to be held by women people of color and immigrants by the end of april 2019 the cdc reported that there were 4913 essential workers diagnosed with covid-19 in 115 meat or poultry processing facilities throughout 19 states and that 20 people had died 133 it was also disclosed that these processing employees communicated through language and cultural barriers lived in crowded multigenerational housing and commuted to work together likewise workers were incentivized to work through illness thereby indicating a lack of appropriate healthcare options 133 many essential workers have been poorly compensated because they were members of marginalized and underrepresented groups who generally have less political and economic capital compared to the white american male in addition to poor compensation 13 of essential workers lack health insurance and over 30 of these workers would have to borrow money to pay for an unexpected 500 usd medical bill 129 within communities of color many of whom are essential workers as stated previously covid-19 testing inequities have been observed in several areas throughout the country there has been a lack of access to covid-19 walk-up testing as well as widespread testing 134 in some observations it has been reported that physicians may be less likely to refer african americans for covid-19 testing when they arrive with signs of infection 135136137 reasons for this have included the dismissiveness of african american health complaints and the inequitable race-based or income-based hierarchy of patients 138 pilot data have shown that in comparison to white patients african american patients with covid-19 symptoms were six times less likely to receive testing or treatment 138 institutional and structural inequalities fueled by racism sexism and other forms of discrimination have impeded the ability of people of color to secure employment with livable wages healthcare access and insurance and an opportunity for upward mobility plus given the societal expectation that these groups and women in particular provide service and care this type of work has often been undervalued 139 women of color stand at the intersection of multiple oppressive identities and experience the amalgamated effects of racial ethnic and gender biases deep-rooted cultural attitudes and stereotypes about women of color have often devalued their work and deprioritized their needs 139 this has been historically and contemporaneously shown through wage disparities as an example for every dollar earned by full-time year-round working white men hispanic women earn 54 cents and african american women earn 62 cents while white women earn 79 cents 139140 the social distancing industry disruptions have greatly exacerbated the preexisting economic fragility of these women as essential workers many women of color have employment in healthcare or the service industry that places them on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic table 1 139141 although an overwhelming percentage of these women work as housekeeping cleaners 60 nursing assistants 50 and personal care aids 46 women of color also disproportionately work in several industries that have also been hit hardest by pandemic related job losses 139141 women of color and all women comprise 24 54 and 30 80 of the accommodationsfood services and healthcaresocial assistance industries respectively the two hardest hit industries of unemployment as reported by the us department of labor 139142 the impact of social distancing is not just limited to economic and social inequalities geographic disparities of covid-19 cases and mortality have been just as alarming compared to other states the first case of covid-19 was not reported in louisiana until march 9 2020 yet as of june 21 2020 with more than 49497 confirmed cases and 3104 deaths louisiana ranked 7th in mortality rate 67 deaths per 100000 people 7783143 these geographic variations do not necessary function exclusively as regional or spatial imbalances but these variations are a manifestation of the residential segregation practices that have been and are still currently held in the united states 144 overwhelmingly at one point 70 of louisianas covid-19 deaths were african american despite this racial group comprising only 32 of the states population 7783145146 although african americans 54 still maintain the highest percentage of covid-19 deaths in louisiana the current racial breakdown of deaths are 44 white 62 of louisiana population 2 latinx 5 of louisiana population and 08 asian 16 of louisiana population 147 since the majority of deaths in louisiana are african americans the intersection of race or racism with this covid-19 epidemiological trend seems to be a strongly suggestive hypothesis of inequality especially since similar trends have been identified throughout the united states including illinois michigan north carolina wisconsin and even in the nations capital washington dc 148149150151 while the exact cause for this racial disproportionality in covid-19 cases and mortality has yet to be uncovered the effect of underlying racial health disparities namely kidney disease asthma diabetes mellitus and obesity that are also risk factors for covid-19 needs to be closely examined 152153154155 the notion that economic and social disparities create and perpetuate health disparities cannot be ignored as discussed previously institutional and structural inequalities have played a significant role in the social determinants of health or the conditions of birth growth living learning working playing and aging for african americans for example several african americans as well as other communities of color tend to live in food transit or recreational deserts more polluted and densely impoverished areas and have been raising children in single-parent households 156157158159160161 these social determinants of health have contributed to poorer covid-19 outcomes additionally many african americans reside in areas where people have been unable to effectively social distance such as prisons and homeless shelters 162 finally systemic racism as a barrier to healthcare treatment for african americans was present well before the coronavirus pandemic research has shown that african americans rate health-related information they receive from family members and churches more highly due to an overarching sense of medical establishment distrust stemming from historical injustices eg tuskegee syphilis experiment among this population 163164165166167 unfortunately this has impeded access to medical care and magnified existing health disparities the coronavirus pandemic has also endangered communities of color through other very recognizable routes of discrimination in early april 2020 the cdc took at 180 degree turn and instructed the use of cloth face coverings such as bandanas without considering the implications of gang affiliation violence or racial profiling 168169 this created a sense of anxiety among communities of color which was not unfounded specifically african american men have been racially profiled when wearing surgical masks in an effort to reduce their covid-19 risk or have expressed a level of psychological distress due to the fear of being racially profiled 170171 a released video showed two african american men with facemask being followed in a walmart store by a police officer in wood river illinois although this incident occurred in march 2020 prior to the cdc face covering recommendation all individuals throughout the country were well within their rights to use self-protecting efforts to reduce their covid-19 risk african americans have not been the only targeted community of color there has been an increase of anti-asian discrimination because of the origination of covid-19 in wuhan china 172 the federal bureau of investigation reported that asian americans were experiencing increased hate crimes due to the coronavirus global outbreak 173 in midland texas three asian american family members including a 2-year-old baby and 6-year-old child were stabbed at a sams club store and the suspect indicated that he attacked the family because he thought the family was chinese and infecting people with the coronavirus 174 also in new york city teenagers attacked a 51-year-old woman on a city bus spewed anti-asian statements and accused her of causing the coronavirus while another 13-year-old allegedly kicked a 59-year-old man for the same racist motives in a separate incident 174 even in the midst of these remarkable times hatred and bigotry have continued to reign in the united states epidemics are a category of disease that seem to hold up the mirror to human beings as to who we really are that is to say they obviously have everything to do with our relationship to our mortality to death to our lives they show the moral relationships that we have toward each other as people and were seeing that today 86 while there are distinct similarities and differences when comparing the 1918 and 2019 pandemics the historical accounts of the influenza pandemic and the current coronavirus pandemic have demonstrate that poverty inequality and social determinants of health create and support the conditions for disease transmission and the exacerbation of existing health conditions and disparities table 2 175 interestingly the public health response to both pandemics albeit tempered by varying levels of political resistance impacted human behavior through mandated social distancing or the use of face masks however unlike the influenza pandemic widespread daily protests and demonstrations within at least 140 american cities and throughout the world completely eclipsed and overshadowed public health orders for social distancing and public gathering prohibition during the coronavirus pandemic 176177 these protests rallied against the systemic police brutality of african americans specifically the killing of george floyd by minneapolis police and in support of the black lives matter movement 176177 this unique moment in history has illustrated the convergence of two public health crises 1 coronavirus pandemic 2 african american genocide both of which are impacted by the annihilation of institutional structural systematic and systemic racism within the united states as a new normal for post covid-19 is reimagined the fundamental dynamics and entrenched ideologies of acceptable living and equality for all need to be addressed and strongly reexamined in order for the country to move forward social distancing and shelter-in-place orders have been in place throughout the country since approximately the middle of march 2020 this has bought the country some time to curb the spread of the virus limit the number of covid-19 cases and deaths reduce the healthcare system strain and allow a reflection for the preparation of the next phase 178 following the pandemic containment and mitigation phases the third suppression phase which allows for a slow emergence from the quarantine status requires essential elements in order to prevent an ascent of covid-19 infections 178 the elements include measurable benchmarks with surveilling epidemiological trends eg decline in covid-19 deaths for 14 days fortifying the healthcare system eg sufficient personal protective equipment for all healthcare workers and transforming public health infrastructure eg demonstrated ability to convey social distancing recommendations that change behavior in most residents 178179 once these elements have been implemented aspects of social distancing can be relaxed yet the old normal of living still cannot return and most likely will not return during the initial reopening of establishments gatherings should still be capped at 10 people and restaurants will need to adopt social distancing seating to welcome patrons however it is recommended by governmental and public health officials that individuals over 60 years of age and those who are medically vulnerable continue to shelter-in-place until the final phase of reopening 180 a staggered or partial reopening approach with new environmental safeguards such as temperature and ventilation checks and mandatory handwashingsanitizing at every entry and periodically throughout the day may be used for schools and businesses 179 there also may need to be a quarantine of travelers from high prevalence covid-19 areas governmental regulations may institute proof of immunity documentation or spending fourteen days in isolation before entering a new country for travelers beyond a successful initial reopening and after at least four weeks of no significant increase in new covid-19 cases the six feet social distancing measure may be paused but there should still be a ban on gatherings which exceed 50 people until four months after the initial reopening 179 throughout these phase transitions it is critical for all public health leaders political administrators and the overall general public to work together in order to control mitigate and eradicate covid-19 as stated by secretary-general antnio guterres of the united nations the coronavirus pandemic is a public health emergency that became an economic social and human rights crisis specifically by working together and respecting human rights in this time of crisis more effective and inclusive solutions for the emergency of today and the recovery for tomorrow can be achieved 181 even with a new kind of normalcy everyone may still practice consistent and better hygiene with handwashing coughing and sneezing and greet and interact with each other differently 178 people may need to create new ways of meeting with friends and colleagues impressively within the past couple of decades the sharing economy has expanded and created environments with new components of how multiple people share the same spaces these shared spaces including co-work environments eg wework rooms in homes eg airbnb cars eg uber bikes eg capital bikeshare and other elements of the built environment which can increase the potential and opportunities for environmentally mediated pathways of pathogen exposure will need to be reexamined 182 the coronavirus pandemic also may accelerate the development of risk-mitigating efforts designed to reduce human-to-human interactions upgrade building ventilation and physical barriers and adopt automation technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence vision systems 183 given the severity of the pandemic and in compliance with social distancing directives many american cities significantly reduced public transit service as mentioned previously while agencies like the chicago transit authority implemented sanitation regimes to minimize the spread of the covid-19 many transit agencies may move to a new standard where face masks will always be required once anyone boards a train or bus 99 while social distancing measures prompted organizations to embrace videoconferencing virtual classrooms and telemedicine these types of interactions may become more of the norm moving forward with the fear of contagion companies have shifted their protocols of operation prior to the coronavirus pandemic many businesses were already abandoning cash payments and in the wake of the outbreak many more may permanently switch to digital only payments structural building modifications eg voice-activated elevators or environmental adjustments eg telework capabilities may be a much easier acclimatization for many americans in the wake of a post covid-19 existence yet changing perceptions attitudes and behaviors that have been deeply entrenched in the american way of living will be a much more challenging hill to climb issues surrounding injustices related to many social determinants of health are not new and this pandemic has just illuminated these issues the overwhelmingly disproportion covid-19 mortality rates of african americans only highlights the need to address longstanding inequalities racism in the united states has created inequality in access to healthcare housing wealth education and employment all of which are social determinants of health that can either promote or undermine ones health and longevity in order to move forward racism needs to be addressed and there needs to be new and tailored approaches to reach those who have been disadvantaged as well as the circumstances that have been generated through racist ideologies practices and politices for instance when louisiana initially launched drive-through testing an african american 90-year-old woman walked a mile in the heat to get tested 184 this demonstrated that this covid-19 testing site was not accessible to many individuals who do not have cars or who live in transit deserts or who cannot afford private transit upon learning this public health officials targeted zip codes with the highest rates of covid-19 reported deaths and deployed testing in those areas population-based testing and contact tracing during this pandemic has been vital in order to predict where to allocate resources control the spread of the virus and implement evidence-based interventions to high-risk areas however evidence-based interventions are only achievable when there are accurate data and evidence it was not until early april 2020 that the cdc began including race and ethnicity data in its morbidity and mortality weekly report 85 many states have yet to release demographic data on deaths while sars-cov-2 may be exploiting inequalities in the united states this virus similar to past as well as future pathogens does not discriminate by race or any other social construct that man has created if covid-19 is not contained in the most vulnerable populations it will continue to spread to all communities and alter the future of human existence

have devastated societies and the 2019 coronavirus pandemic is no different as densely populated and urban environmental conditions shaped the 1918 influenza pandemic the experience of the current day coronavirus pandemic is quite similar while the influenza and coronavirus pandemics occurred nearly a century apart there is one similarity of these events that is undeniable the public health response to disease outbreaks has remained virtually unchanged with social distancing and face covering efforts unfortunately the role of human behaviors and social ideologies stemmed from the darker side of humanity on the effect and response to the coronavirus pandemic has also not progressed considerably this review has revealed how the american burden of inequalities and injustices as related to environments and human behavior significantly impacts morbidity and mortality rates among the most vulnerable communities as observed with the 1918 influenza pandemic the present-day coronavirus

with availability of state-specific data our model only assumes certain characteristics of each state in isolation and is not an imitation of the state the first case of coronavirus is believed to be originated during the month of november in the year 2019 9 and in a matter of less than six months the confirmed cases across the globe are over 4 million in order to contain the rising morbidity and mortality governments are pursuing policies from those that restrict travel to policies that ensure a nationwide lockdown 7  with a plummeting global economy there is an increasing concern regarding the state of the global financial system a recent study ascertains the economic impact of the pandemic on gdp growth mentioning that every month of shutdown could cost approximately 2-25 of global gdp growth 3  although public health recovery is in progress the rising number of cases of the virus and its uncontrollable transmission has caused uncertainty among private and public sectors about how or when to continue day to day operations in order to begin economic recovery while the who director-general and imf managing director recently mentioned that the trade-off to save lives or save livelihoods is a false dilemma 7  for getting the right balance the intervention must take place at the policy level which not only ensures restoration of public health but also incorporates strategies to mobilize economic operations by limiting enforced lockdowns within countries we attempt to test certain lockdown strategies by modelling the pandemic and calculating the indicators of good public health as well as indicators of the economy during partial lockdown to evaluate which lockdown strategy triumphs over complete lockdown a system dynamic model of the virus is used to help predict the spread of the virus in a number of states modeled as nodes with a fixed population certain characteristics of the population in these nodes have been modeled as parameters for the system dynamics model these parameters are optimized to find a partial shutdown that satisfies healthcare constraints as well as economic viability a strategy ensuring sequential time bound lockdown to satisfy low cost to the economy as well as less infected population would constitute an optimal policy we first model states in which the suppression strategy is to be implemented due to rising covid-19 cases as nodes with inter-connectivity each state is populated with a certain number of citizens and an initial number of infected citizens currently we have not included citizen level detail to model the state instead we used the aggregate level data and have made assumptions in absence of data to model the pandemic as a seir system dynamic model many disease spread models are usually derived from the seir model which has been useful in predicting disease spread in human to human transmission when recovery fom disease takes some time a states population comprises of a susceptible population infected population and a recovered population which changes with time the population dynamics is centered around the question of how the susceptible population s might get exposed to the disease and enters the bucket e after an incubation period the exposed become infected i which is followed by recovery r 3  each state has health care facilities with health care capacities h which can vary from 1 to 2 of the states population 13  we evaluate the system from a point where a few people in each state are already infected since our interest lies more heavily on the rise in infection and it being controlled by practicing a partial lockdown we do not intend to do a micro level observation of the disease transmission and therefore we directly employ the transmission rate of covid-19 from modeling as well as other related aggregate data the following notations are used to denote the variables used in the differential equation to model the virus spread the notations used are in gives the rate of change susceptible population over time the susceptible population is directly proportional to the transmission rate  the current susceptible population and the probability that an infected person comes into contact in  in addition we add the rates of travel between states the interstate travel population fraction n ij  n ji  is assumed to be the proportional to the inverse of the distance between two states the multi-state model we have used is very similar to the model given by 4  in both the cases where people are infected or susceptible the fraction of asymptomatic and untested people   can still find themselves likely and willing to travel to other states equation 3 gives the rate of infected people the exposed component of seir model takes that population into account which has been exposed but not yet infectious for the duration of the incubation period t inc and will transition into infectious population bucket with a probability 1 at the rate of 1t inc  the rate of change of the exposed population also contains components for interstate travel of the exposed population given in equation 2 the recovery rate is directly proportional to the fraction of the population that recovers the death rate is similarly proportional to the death rate equation 5 in addition we include a component of hospital strain that influences the death rate since we expect the death rate to increase as the number of serious cases exceed hospital capacities this component is from 6  the following equations help model the population dynamics in each state which acts as a node in a network each state is connected with every other state and people can travel between states which are not in lockdown under lockdown travel is restricted within the state and beyond the state we assume that the transmission rate is dependent both on the lockdown condition of a city as well as the social behaviour of people this is accounted by the parameter  i which is dependent on the fraction of people infected in a state at any time social distancing during no lockdown has been incorporated by taking inspiration from the granovetter model equation 9 8  we assume that a population takes up social distancing measures only when a certain fraction of population starts getting infected the larger population acts collectively only when their threshold value of the fraction who are infected is exceeded we modeled the threshold curve with the assumption that certain fraction of population 2 would pick up social distancing only when 005 population are infected after a certain point an increase in infected population does not result in an increase of people following social distancing this to model the fraction of population who might not still take the virus seriously a policy of suppressing the pandemic by minimising any contact can have severe economic consequences social distancing and lockdowns have proven to be effective especially if applied well before large population becomes infected the objective is to prevent over-burdening and failure of healthcare facilities which can occur when the number of infected exceeds the healthcare capacity a study by the imperial college in london generated estimates using their model that show the use of various control strategies to ensure a functioning health care capacity 15  their work mentions that the impact of such suppression strategies on economic contribution could be substantial which is in agreement with the widespread understanding of the global economy there are various methods to model the economy shared variance international model uses the annual fractional change in gdp by modelling it as a normal distribution 14  however we want to optimize policy for a certain time frame and lack state-wise cross sectional data therefore we have modelled the direct costs to the economy due to the covid-19 pandemic the cost includes medical cost as well as the cost incurred for each revenue generating sector in the economy such as agriculture manufactuing and service sectors the following equations represent how the cost is calculated in the absence of available sector-wise per capita incomes we have estimated the distribution of per capita income as shown in equation total income in sector population working in sector 13  total income   share of sector to income total population  population working in the sector 14 the cost is calculated with the assumption that absenteeism or social distancing will lead to loss of earning more than 50 percent of indian population lies in emerging  the economic cost increases during no lockdown due to a rise in infected population which leads to a rise in medical cost whereas during lockdown the cost will also increase due to loss of work in different economic sectors an attempt to minimize the cost by using an optimal policy has been done the generated optimal policy will provide a solution to allow economic activities only when the chance of rise in infection is low thus that would allow lower medical costs as well as an escape from loss of work to generate an optimal policy we use the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm -2 nsga-2 for optimization 5  given that the dynamics of the seir model is higly non-linear the nsga-2 algorithm is ideal for optimization moreover this algorithm provides the pareto front when there are more than one objective functions the objectives used here are 1 cost to the economy 2 average number of infected people over the period of policy for each candidate policy which represents one individual in the genetic algorithm ga we use the system dynamics model to predict the number of infected people and hence the cost to the economy these objectives act as the fitness values needed for the ga the lockdown policy is kept constant for a period of time say 1 week and is determined statewise we assume lockdown is represented by 0 and no-lockdown as 1 thus the optimization is done over the domain of binary matrices of size s  t where s is the set of states and t is the time periods with each element determining the state of lockdown at a given state and period of time  in this study we obtain an optimal policy for 9 states for a period of 10 weeks with intial infection period of 22 days where no lockdown is imposed optimization is done over the average number of infected population and the total economic cost over 300 days we collected data for nine states in india and selected these states due to the variation of workforce distribution in different sectors these states have been modeled with the assumption that it is free from the effect of other economic factors such as international trade production in other factors etc we do not intend to model an actual state our interest is limited to study of covid-19 in the presence of few factors of interest in order to demonstrate the generation of an optimal policy some details of the states are in table iv the treated fraction rate is set uniformly at 20 of the infected population collected from currently available data 13 and the untreated fraction rate is 10 of the infected population the studies and observations around covid-19 specify in general that the average disease incubation period is around 5 days while the average disease infection period progression time is about 14 days the data has been taken from the who 1  in each state the fraction of asymptomatic and untested cases a is assumed to be 20 of the infected population of the state and the fraction of serious cases is also taken as 20 percent of the infected population we assume that the asymptomatic and untested population are able to move freely between cities during a no lockdown period using the current data available the transmission rate is on average 22 during no lockdown and is assumed to be 1 during the time when lockdown is in effect to study the effect of social distancing we use two models of the social distancing factor  threshold curve -i in figure 1 represents a gradual adoption of social distancing as the number of infections begin to rise we assume that a relatively high threshold of 20 of infected population fraction of people adopting social distancing rises quickly as people realize the seriousness of the pandemic in figure 2  people suddenly follow social distancing after a certain threshold and is modeled as an step function the social distancing factor is taken as   1  fraction of population following social distancing we generate results for a period of 300 days for a certain policy decision to demonstrate the effect of lockdown and social distancing on the infection curve without a complete lockdown the infection peaks early figure 3  but applying social distancing causes the curve to flatten figures 4  and 5  on the other hand when a complete lockdown is in effect the curve flattens completely the figure 6 shows a situation where people might not conform to social distancing measure during a no lockdown policy they only follow social distancing step social distancing when a collective threshold of infected population is reached even though people follow social distancing after knowing that a large population is infected the delay in intervention leads to early rise in overall infected population figures 7 and 8 show the effect of change in lockdown policy the figure 7 shows the number of infected people if the lockdown is implemented after 22 days from the first infection and then removed after 150 days this shows a flatten curve but also shows a rise in infected population later in time the curve 8 shows infected population if the lockdown is implemented for 22 days and then removed after 22 days this leads to a sharp early rise in the number of infected population the figures 9 and 10 show effect of lockdown for the state of andhra pradesh with the curves for susceptible infected recovered populations and deaths the effect of policy on the cost to economy is simulated for three hundred days in figures 12 -13 the most anticipated effect of lockdown occurs at the time of infection peak where more people get infected leading to rise in cost when no suppression there is a positive correlation of covid-19 cases and the gdp which is found by the research group zhang etal 2020 16  figures 12 and 13 shows the cost during no lockdown with social distancing in effect while figure 14 shows the cost during lockdown whereas the figure 11 shows the cost with no suppression strategy such social distancing in effect clearly not imposing a lockdown imposes large costs in a quick span of time primarily due to the large medical costs incurred on the other hand a full lockdown also imposes large economic cost due to the loss of income for people who cannot work due reduced work capacity of different sectors of the economy hence an optimal policy must be sought in order to reduce both medical and absenteeism costs while keeping the number of infections low for our policy optimization experiment we take the nine states mentioned in table iv with transmission rates as   1 for no lockdown and   01 during lockdown  the nsga-2 algorithm is used to derive the pareto front against competing objectives of minimizing total cost to the economy and the average number of infections the optimal policy is generated over 100 generations with a population of 50 for the genetic algorithm we initialize the simulation for 30 days with seed infections in each state as 10 infected individuals the optimal policy is generated in week wise blocks for 10 weeks each policy decision in each state for lockdown is thus maintained for 7 successive days the rest of the parameters are the same as in the previous sections the policy generated is a week schedule containing lockdown status of each state for that week an optimal lockdown strategy involves removing a suppression strategy to engage safe economic activity in a state with an extremely low infected population each solution of the pareto front  figure 16  shows the lockdown status for all states at different locations for a time period 10 weeks lockdown status remains constant for the period of first 2 weeks which is complete lockdown followed by altering the lockdown status of few states the solutions vary from minimizing people getting infected to minimizing ecnonomic cost the choice of selection could be made to conform to other factors in place such as hospital capacity fraction of population that might not need treatment etc we demonstrate only one of the pareto-optimal policies since it was observed that all the candidate pareto-optimal solutions have almost indistinguishable objective values the effect of the optimal policy on the cost to economy and the number of infected people is shown in figures 17 18 19 and 20 the optimal policy clearly has a lower economic costs when no lockdown is applied or a complete lockdown is applied on the other hand the number of infections lie between the two extreme cases demonstrating the effect of competing objectives moreover when we modelled social distancing with threshold curve-i it resulted in a lower infection rate and a slightly higher cost when compared to social distancing modelled with threshold curve iithus an optimal policy can help reducing economic costs while controlling the number of infections we consider the three major direct costs to economy during a pandemic viz medical cost consisting of special life support equipment cost and medical treatment cost inclusive of testing work absenteeism cost encountered due to work absentees of infected population and economic sector wise cost due to either government imposed or threshold social distancing cost components encountered due to lifestyle changes such as reduced consumption of certain types of goods and services and other indirect costs are not considered for simplicity we further do not consider the effect of delays in economic recovery as well and other indirect costs as well according to a who news report april 2020 2 due to lack of evidence it is currently unclear if recovered population that have antibodies is protected from second infection we assume recovered population to develop immunity and not get infected again it should be noted that seir is a generic infectious disease model and is not specific to covid-19 finally there exist inherent limitations of deterministic models since these do not consider of time variance of infectivity and recovery rates 12  better economic models can help get us more accurate results such as use of the cobb-douglas production function to estimate production value so that the effect of the pandemic on the production value could be measured the characteristics of covid-19 as well as its transmission remains unknown therefore any developments could help us drive the model to include more agreed upon parameter values given the rapid spread of covid-19 across the globe and countries imposing severe lockdown measures to fight the virus it has become essential to come up with a balance between cost imposed by the pandemic to the economy and the number of infections so that medical facilities are not overwhelmed over the basic seir model we have considered interstate movement of population and have built a strategy to obtain optimal policy solutions we have also modelled the fraction of population that willingly follows social distancing despite no government imposed lockdowns which makes the model coherent with covid-19 situation the optimal policy solution was generated by using the nsga-ii which offers a possible solution involving partial lockdown varying with time and place on the basis of infected population and cost incurred   defining facets of social distancing during the covid-19 pandemic twitter analysis jiye kwon connor grady josemari feliciano t samah fodeh j  social distancing has been one of the primary mitigation strategies in the united states to control the spread of novel coronavirus disease covid-19 and can be viewed as a multi-faceted public health measure using twitter data we aim to 1 define and quantify the prevalence and evolution of facets of social distancing during the covid-19 pandemic in the us in a spatiotemporal context and 2 examine the most amplified tweets among social distancing facets we analyzed a total of 259529 unique tweets containing coronavirus from 115485 unique users between january 23 2020 and march 24 2020 that were identified by the twitter api as english and us-based tweets containing specified keywords determined a priori were grouped into six social distancing facets implementation purpose social disruption adaptation positive emotions and negative emotions tweets about social disruptiveness were most retweeted and implementation tweets were most favorited social distancing tweets became overall more prevalent in the u  the emergence of novel coronavirus disease and its etiologic cause severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has prompted an international effort to limit its morbidity and mortality social distancing has been one of the primary mitigation strategies in the united states which compels individuals to stay at home as much as possible and avoid close contact with others to reduce transmission and intensity of the pandemic 1 2 3  the realization of social distancing and its intersection with many aspects of our social educational professional and emotional lives is unprecedented in its degree of magnitude social distancing can be viewed as a multi-faceted public health measure involving many stakeholders practices and consequences development and evaluation of a measure of communication on a public health intervention-here social distancing-may be beneficial for public health and public policy officials 4  we define social distancing as a multi-faceted intervention where these facets or stages unfold as we are living through the covid-19 experience these facets may change in our subsequent studies as covid-19 events evolve the facets of social distancing are 1 purpose and justification of imposing this disruptive nation-wide behavioral measure the purpose is to slow the spread of covid-19 to levels manageable by healthcare systems 2 implementation of social distancing to not only avoid mass gatherings but also maintain a 6-feet distance amongst individuals the advisories imposing this facet translated to closing non-essential businesses restaurants schools and colleges twitter is a microblogging platform by which users tweeters socialize and tweet through the network users on twitter can contribute original content through tweeting thoughts opinions and news and engage with existing content by retweeting favoriting and replying to others tweets non-protected tweets are publicly available and approximately 3 of tweets are voluntarily geotagged 5  as twitter has the advantage of real-time content availability it has been harnessed during past infectious disease outbreaks to understand networks gauge public knowledge and forecast spread 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  in recent studies we have utilized twitter to better understand critical social and behavioral outcomes such as suicide risk 13 14  our findings have shown that certain patterns of word use on twitter can define many social behaviors associated with suicide risk given that social distancing is the chief social behavioral measure taken to flatten the curve of covid-19 spread this study aims to quantify its perception implementation and impact on the nation through twitter in this study we adopt a supply-based infodemiology approach 4 to analyze facets of social distancing on twitter with the overarching goal of informing public health policy and practice our newly developed information supply measure is the prevalence of tweets concerning the different social distancing facets we achieve our goal by collecting tweets related to coronavirus we analyze the contents of the tweets and map them into categories that correspond to the relevant social distancing facets we then quantify the prevalence of these facets across different states and over time the objective of this study is two-fold 1 define and quantify the prevalence and evolution of social distancing facets in a us spatiotemporal context and 2 examine the most amplified tweets among social distancing facets we downloaded tweets that contained the term coronavirus between january 23 rd and march 24 th  2020 using the twitter api for each tweet we had the following variables the users handle time of tweet number of retweets and favorited at the time of collection geographic coordinates and text of tweet only unique tweets written in english and geotagged to the united states were included in the analyses our data is missing tweets from february 29 th through march 5 th and march 10 th -march 13 th  2020 despite missingness in the data we were able to capture the overall trends of social distancing facets thus we skipped imputation all analyses were performed using r version 361 tidytext package version 022 and tableau version 202010 keywords pertaining to facetstopics of social distancing were determined a priori and were used to collate tweets into six facets see appendix 1 tweets including terms like flatten the curve that tell the motivation for social distancing as to limit viral transmission and protect vulnerable populations were included in the purpose facet the implementation facet comprised of tweets capturing content related to institutional closures and public health advisories as to limit exposure to others the social disruption group included tweets concerning the cancellation of social events such as parties mass gatherings and other disruptions to daily life the adaptation facet is captured by how individuals adapted their livelihood into virtual settings  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder

with the covid-19 pandemic facets were not mutually exclusive as a tweet could be assigned to more than one topic the primary analysis concerned a description of the trends of social distancing facets for the entire dataset of us tweets on a daily and weekly basis the proportion of a given social distancing facet per day is calculated by dividing the number of tweets belonging to that facet by the total number of tweets that day these proportions were used for relative comparison over the entire study period and compared to events on the ground the proportion of a given social distancing facet per week is calculated by dividing the number of tweets belonging to that facet by the total number of tweets that week trends of these facets were followed and  2 tests were used to evaluate weekly change in tweet proportions geographic coordinates of the tweets from the different social distancing facets were plotted as pie graphs on a map of the us for january february and march the diameter of the pie graphs corresponded to tweet volume in a given month for simplified visual interpretation we introduced a month-specific threshold on the number of tweets to be displayed on the map to eliminate noise that does not rise to a meaningful pattern hence only facets that meet the threshold were plotted at corresponding locations  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available

frequently used hashtags exhibited heterogeneity by month with january tweets using hashtags focused on the early localized impact of the virus in china such as china coronavirusoutbreak and wuhan

covid-19 outbreak tweets among the facet negative emotions predominated with all other facets relatively less pronounced implementation grew in february accounting for about 10 of coronavirus-related tweets and then exhibited a strong upward trend in march increasing 245 from february 28 th to march 23 rd  implementation tweets comprised 24 of coronavirus-related tweets at their peak on march 23 rd  content relevant to adaptation such as working from home and studying online in addition to tweets related to the purpose of social distancing also increased over the study period albeit to a lesser degree adaptation tweets peaked on march 17 th  accounting for 43 of tweets and purpose topic tweets peaked on march 24 th at 31 alternatively tweets concerning social disruption peaked on february 3 rd with an 88 increase compared to the previous day making up 8 7 of the total tweets this facet declined steadily before peaking again on february 23 rd comprising 63 of the total tweets which is a 122 increase in comparison to the previous day after march 18 th  social disruption accounted for the lowest number of tweets among the facets we analyzed the relationship between time in weeks and each facet of the social distancing using chi-squared  tests these tests showed that the increase in the proportion of all facets besides social disruption were statistically significant p001 and the decrease in social disruption tweets was statistically significant p001  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a

and february  figure 2 and 3  social distancing tweets were sparsely distributed across the states and mostly generated from highly populated areas on the east and west coasts negative emotions was the most prevalent facet across the states overall followed by implementation and social disruption however some heterogeneity was observed notably in january implementation was more prevalent in west coast cities such as los angeles and san francisco compared to other metropolitan areas eg new york city and some cities including washington dc had a larger relative number of social disruption tweets in february as the covid-19 outbreak began to spread internationally tweets of social distancing facets were generated from more cities eg new york city chicago and houston including implementation social disruption negative emotions and adaptation  examining the average number of retweets and favorites of social distancing facets tweets we noticed that social disruption tweets were most amplified through retweeting with 374 retweets per tweet on average this was then followed by implementation 336 retweets per tweet purpose 330 retweets per tweet negative emotions 303 retweets per tweet positive emotions 222 retweets per tweet and adaptation 216 retweets per tweet on the other hand implementation exhibited the highest number of favorites an average of 1484 favorites per tweet followed by negative emotions 1203 favorites per tweet social disruption 97 favorites per tweet purpose 94 favorites per tweet positive emotions 933 favorites per tweet and finally adaptation 833 favorites per tweet in this twitter analysis of social distancing-related tweets during the covid-19 pandemic several observations emerged during the early phases of the covid-19 pandemic in january and february outbreaks were confined to china and nearby countries consequently tweets during these early months were thought to be confined and in reference to the situations in these countries  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for

referring to us events attitudes and reactions in january and february it was shown in figures 2 and 3 that the prevalence of tweets captured locations that started voicing out through the defined facets interestingly locations captured during the early phases of the outbreak are states that were thought to experience the covid-19 earlier than other states including washington illinois and california in these two maps the higher prevalence of the implementation and social disruption facets in the west coast cities los angeles san francisco and seattle compared to other major cities

cities and others including manhattan ny and washington dc albeit more so in january in february we observed two notable peaks of social disruption figure 1  on february 3 rd and 23 rd that correspond

imposed advisories and restrictions as it was formed based on words like travel negative emotions were also highly prevalent in many locations suggesting an expected reaction to a novel infectious disease of concern uncertainty and fear 17 18 19 among us users while the outbreak was largely confined to china turning to the month of march where social distancing efforts were realized in the us and the number of covid-19 cases increased dramatically there were certainly more locations across the country that voiced out about these facets of social distancing trends in these facets  figure 1

covid-19 epicenter 22  and taken together with the large volume of tweets from the new york area in march figure 4  perhaps the situation in new york was in part responsible for this peak along with rise of implementation negative emotions increased in early march but subsequentially decreased until march 24 th possibly as a result of increased emergence of other facets less represented facets such as positive emotions purpose and adaptation were still thought to play key roles in users reactions and reflection on social distancing especially across locations such as los angeles tx fl co and ny in these locations pie graphs with larger diameters and higher representations of social distancing facets were seen the facets positive emotions and purpose became more pronounced in march and adaptation reached and maintained its peak across all weekdays on the third week of march as people returned to work and school but on online platforms this increase in adaptation could also explain the decrease in social disruption observed in figure 1  perhaps as individuals acclimated to the new routines and practices social distancing tweets as a whole were predominantly generated from the

with the rise of covid-19 cases in the city 23  this suggests that overall volume of social distancing tweets can reflect the relative case count in respective locations our secondary research objective examined amplified tweets to further understand the drivers of the publics perception during the covid-19 pandemic and a period of intense social distancing we defined amplified facets as facets which had high relative engagement measured by an average number of retweets and favorites as described in the risk amplification through media spread model amplified tweets play a key role in the publics perception and response 24 and signal which content is meaningful to users 25  our study showed that the most amplified facet of social distancing tweets measured by the retweet count was social disruption and least amplified was the adaptation group in terms of favorites implementation had the highest number of mean favorites per tweet and the least amplified was adaptation these results suggest that not only do users find these topics meaningful and worth engaging with but also demonstrate that the topics of implementation and social disruption were highly broadcasted among social networks as such these facets can be leveraged to promote public health actions by echoing the wavelength that the public shares our study responds to the growing interest in the application of infodemiology in public health 4  we define facets of social distancing with the advantages of real-time publicly available twitter data through infoveillance and infodemiology previous studies have

coronavirus were downloaded from the twitter api and included in the analysis over the course of the pandemic terminology has shifted toward other nomenclature such as covid-19 sars-cov-2 or referred to colloquially as corona and in some circles as the wuhan virus or china virus these tweets were not captured however we demonstrated that coronavirus was highly used as we collected over 250000 unique tweets and this term is the most consistently used term to describe the crisis as this name preceded others additionally the number a tweet has been retweeted is dependent on when the data is collected our data collection practices were not consistent in regard to time of day nevertheless given the long period of data collection this should not be concerning finally tweets belonging to positive and negative emotion facets were classified in a way that did not necessitate they be in regard to social distancing topics as did other facets but only to coronavirus still these tweets are useful as they coincide with intensive social distancing efforts and thus offer important insight into how individuals reacted emotionally during this period  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it

that social distancing can be defined in terms of facets which may respond to certain moments and events in a pandemic social distancing efforts during the covid-19 pandemic are unprecedent and

spencer fox j alison galvani p michael pignone s johnston claiborne lauren meyers ancel  a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 emerged in wuhan china in late 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide in the absence of effective antiviral drugs and vaccines well-targeted social distancing measures are essential for mitigating the covid-19 pandemic reducing strain on local health systems and preventing mortality here we provide a quantitative assessment of the efficacy of social distancing to slow covid-19 transmission and reduce hospital surge depending on the timing and extent of the measures imposed for a metropolitan region and its health care systems we built a granular mathematical model of covid-19 transmission that incorporated age-specific and risk-stratified heterogeneity estimates for the transmission and severity of covid-19 using current best evidence  we performed thousands of stochastic simulations of covid-19 transmission in the austin-round rock metropolitan area to project the impact of school closures coupled with social distancing measures that were estimated to reduce non-household contacts by 0 25 50  75 or 90 we compare early versus late implementation and estimate the number of covid-19 hospitalizations icu patients ventilator needs and deaths through mid-august 2020 we queried local emergency services and hospital systems to estimate total hospital bed icu and ventilator capacity for the region we expected covid-19 hospital beds and icu requirements would surpass local capacity by mid-may if no intervention was taken assuming a four-day epidemic doubling time school closures alone would be expected to reduce peak hospitalizations by only 18 and cumulative deaths by less than 3 immediate social distancing measures that reduced non-household contacts by over 75 such as stay-at-home orders and closing of non-essential businesses would be required to ensure that covid-19 cases do not overwhelm local hospital surge capacity peak icu bed demand prior to mid august 2020 would be expected to be reduced from 2121 95 ci 2018-2208 with no intervention to 698 95 ci 204-1100 with 75 social distancing and 136 95 ci 38-308 with 90 social distancing current icu bed capacity was estimated at 680 a two-week delay in implementation of such measures is projected to accelerate a local icu bed shortage by four weeks school closures alone hardly impact the epidemic curve immediate social distancing measures that reduce non-household contacts by over 75 were required to ensure that covid-19 cases do not overwhelm local hospital surge capacity these findings introduction a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 appeared in wuhan china in december 2019 and was declared a pandemic on march 11 2020 by the world health organization who 1  as of march 28 2020 191 countries areas or territories have reported a total of 571659 confirmed covid-19 cases and 26493 deaths with substantial outbreaks emerging in italy the republic of korea iran and the united states which surpassed china to become the country with the highest cumulative confirmed cases 2 3  the us reported its first imported sars-cov-2 case from wuhan on january 20 2020 in washington state 4  6 and 40 days ahead of california and new york city 5 6  and its first locally-infected cases on february 28 2020 7  the number of confirmed cases has continued to grow exponentially 8  as of march 26 2020  all 50 states have reported confirmed cases 27 have reported community spread and the cumulative confirmed covid-19 cases are 68440 with 994 total deaths 8  surges in covid-19 hospitalizations are undermining local healthcare systems in new york and seattle 9 10  in order to contain the spread of sars-cov-2 cities have implemented social distancing measures at multiple scales including school closures limiting mass gatherings issuing stay at home orders imposing travel restrictions and banning non-essential commercial activities as of march 28 2020 26 states have issued a statewide shelter-in-place order or have at least one city-level stay-at-home order affecting over 229 million people 11  however the timing of interventions has been idiosyncratic and many cities have yet to enact substantial social distancing orders 12 13  as covid-19 emerged into a global threat we took a national pandemic influenza model that was built through a pandemic preparedness contract with the cdc and adapted it to model the spread and control of covid-19 within and between 217 us cities we used this model to project the potential impact of school closures coupled with social distancing in terms of reducing cases deaths hospitalizations icu visits and ventilator needs on local regional and national scales here we have focused our analysis on the city of austin which is the capital of texas and the fastest growing city in the us 14 15  as a representation of major us metropolitan areas the scenarios and inputs eg epidemiological parameters were determined in consultation with the us centers for disease control and prevention and the city of regional healthcare system executive council of the austin-travis county emergency operations command we focused on the austin-round rock metropolitan area with a population of 217 million people in 2018 but conjecture that the qualitative findings and impact of social distancing will apply to cities throughout the us we analyzed a compartmental model  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity

high risk proportions and contact rates to measure the impact of two key interventions 1 school closures and 2 social distancing measures that reduce non-household contacts by a specified percent we estimated the impact of these measures on cases hospitalizations icu visits ventilator needs and deaths we built a stochastic age-and risk-structured susceptible-exposed-asymptomatic-symptomatic-hospitalized-recovered seayhr model of sars-cov-2 transmission fig s1  individuals were separated into five age groups 0-4 5-7 18-49 50-64 and 65 years old based on population data for the five-county austin-round rock metropolitan area from the 2017 american community survey 16  each age group was divided into a low-risk and high-risk group based on the prevalence of chronic conditions estimated for the austin population  fig s2 17 -20  we also estimated the proportion of pregnant women in each age group as a special risk class 21  all individuals were assumed to be susceptible to the disease infected individuals were modeled to enter an incubation period where they were symptom-free but could be mildly infectious 22 and then progressed to either a symptomatic or asymptomatic compartment asymptomatic individuals were assumed to have the same infectious period as symptomatic individuals but lower infectiousness the rates at which symptomatic cases were moved to a hospitalized compartment and died depended on both age and risk group recovered individuals were considered fully immune the supplement describes the methods in

well as input from the us cdc and city of austin we assumed a basic reproduction number  r 0  of 22 23 and considered two different doubling times of 72 days low growth rate 23 24 25 26 and 4 days high growth rate 25 27 28  age-specific contact rates were estimated using contact matrices published by prem et al and are adjusted to model school closures and various levels of social distancing 29  transmission rates were estimated by fitting simulations to a given r 0 and epidemic doubling time the incubation period was sampled from a triangular distribution from 56 days to 82 days with mean of 7 days 30 and the infectious period was sampled from a triangular distribution from 211 days to 244 days with mean of 226 days 31  we assumed the asymptomatic ratio to be 179 32 with 126 of infections arising from pre-symptomatic transmission during the incubation period 22  following the cdcs planning scenarios we assumed that the infection hospitalization rate and infection fatality rate was ten times higher in high-risk than low risk individuals within each age group simulations began with five imported symptomatic cases in the 18-49 year-old age group on march 1 2020 and update

large crowds to near-total restriction on out of home movement except for health care and basic necessities  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who

polymod diary-based study in europe 34 and separated in contacts occurring at home at school at work and elsewhere we used the national us age distribution 35 to aggregate these estimates from 17 to the five age groups of our model tables s14-s17 we combined these matrices to model four different types of days i normal school days all contacts ii normal weekends and short weekday holidays all but school and work contacts adults are assumed to work during the long summer break iii weekdays during school closuressocial distancing iv weekend or weekday holiday during school closuresocial distancing to model school closures with social distancing we included all household contacts plus a specified proportion of contacts outside the home on weekdays this included a proportion of contacts occurring at work and elsewhere on weekends and holidays excluding summer vacation this included just contacts occurring elsewhere days were assigned to one of these four contact models based on the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 school calendars from the austin independent school district 36  which was the largest public school district in the metropolitan area serving approximately 227 of the austin-round rock msa population we assumed that hospitalized cases were admitted on average 59 days 37 following symptom onset with the infection hospitalization rate depending on the age and risk

average duration of icu care and ventilation support are 8 days and 5 days respectively there is some uncertainty regarding how these estimates may change when healthcare facilities reach or exceed capacity because of a lack of available post-discharge care and inefficiency in the healthcare system due to worker illness thus we also tested an alternative scenario with significantly longer duration of both icu care and ventilation si s3 we did not consider potential excess mortality resulting from lack of access to adequate healthcare during pandemic surges our analyses focus on two key levers of intervention--the speed of implementation and the extent of social distancing we consider two scenarios for the epidemic growth rate of covid-19 and project five outcomes --cases hospitalizations icu care ventilator needs and deaths regardless of epidemic growth rate school closures alone had little effect on the speed and burden of the epidemic fig 1  high levels of social distancing when coupled with school closures substantially delayed and dampened the epidemic peak the impact of the measures depended on early implementation under both the slower and faster epidemic growth scenarios ie seven-day and four-day doubling times immediate measures beginning on march 14th were much more effective than two-month delayed measures at slowing transmission throughout the

the higher fall peaks that were produced under the most extreme social distancing stem from baseline contact patterns in the absence of social distancing a covid-19 epidemic that begins in the spring

closures and social distancing on the emergence and spread of covid-19 in us cities our projections indicate that without extensive social distancing measures the emerging outbreak will quickly

icu demand in sensitivity analyses with more extreme assumptions about critical care requirements the projected peak demand rises accordingly the local focus of our model which incorporates city-specific data regarding demographics high-risk conditions contact patterns and healthcare resource availability allows us to project near-term healthcare demands and provide actionable insights

such measures on the transmission dynamics of covid-19 but do not consider the economic social and psychological costs of social distancing measures including the socioeconomic disparities in burden and morbidity and mortality resulting from reductions in health and mental health care services 48 49  there is an urgent need to project the relative impact of different levers for social distancing in light of their potential societal costs--including school closures partial work and travel restrictions and cocooning of the high risk--so that restrictions can be strategically lifted without compromising public health in particular school closures are often deployed earlier than more extensive social distancing measures yet they can be costly particularly for low-income families who may rely on lunch programs and be unable to afford childcare 50 51  and our analysis suggests that they may only slightly reduce the pace of transmission and peak hospital surge the role of children in

22 2020 571 cases of covid-19 had been reported in 25 provinces including districts and cities in china lu 2020 the patients showed typical respiratory symptoms such as fever coughing shortness of breath and inflammatory lung infiltration and other symptoms such as fatigue myalgia and diarrhea huang et al 2020 some cases were atypical or showed asymptomatic symptoms in this epidemic on february 11 2020 the world health organization who named this pneumonia coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 as of april 13 2020 novel coronavirus pneumonia cases were confirmed in 200 countries and regions worldwide the case fatality rate cfr of covid-19 was 23 441023 much lower than that of sars 10 and mers 36 de wit et al 2016 wu and mcgoogan 2020 suspected covid-19 patients with symptoms could be diagnosed by chest ct and polymerase chain reaction pcr kit however there were no specific effective antiviral drugs for treatment and the vaccine was still in the experimental stage zumla et al 2016 humans have a very old but extremely effective way to respond to sudden outbreaks of infectious diseasesisolation the core of the infectious disease outbreak lies in its infectivity it can be transmitted directly or indirectly from a person to one or more people li 2020 if a person who has the disease cannot spread it to more than one person the disease will gradually disappear like other viruses such as sars and mars although each infectious disease has its new characteristics prevention and control involve three factors the pathogen transmission route and susceptible population there are three core elements of isolation find and manage the source of infection cut off the transmission channels protect vulnerable groups mikulska 2019 in china the state took decisive measures to implement medical isolation for patients and close contacts block traffic cancel public activities and require people to wear masks and frequently wash their hands strong control measures were implemented in cities such as wuhan where the source of infection was concentrated while other provinces and cities also conducted careful screening and isolation of the exported cases interestingly after this strategy was identified the provinces and areas responded positively and quickly the residential areas also formulated relevant travel systems using social software to control the travel of each resident and the flow of people between different areas was also strictly controlled for example one person from every family could go out every 2 days to purchase necessities in public places the distance between people in line needed to be  2 m express delivery and takeout also allowed contactless delivery research showed that social distancing measures were most effective when large-scale return to work took place in early april this reduced the median number of infections by 92 iqd 6697 and 24 iqd 1390 in mid-2020 and by the end of 2020 respectively prem et al 2020 this time compared with the sars outbreak in 2003 the situation was more complicated including the time of the outbreak in the geographical location of wuhan because of movement related to the spring festival but highly effective control of the spread of the pandemic was shown in china social distancing involved keeping a distance of 15 m between people which can prevent the spread of most respiratory infectious diseases social distancing is one of the most effective measures to reduce the spread of the virus which is transmitted by air droplets the droplets produced by coughing sneezing or forced speaking have a certain transmission distance by keeping this distance we can reduce the spread of the virus wearing masks washing hands frequently and disinfecting with alcohol also help to prevent the virus from spreading from one person to another to control the disease the world health organization recommended that countries should strengthen case detection track and monitor contacts practice isolation from close contacts and isolate cases as well as implement traffic control and suspend large gatherings a novel coronavirus pneumonia prediction model was established by using the big data of the university of washington health index and evaluation center ihme ihme 2020 analysis of the epidemic situation in seven locked down cities in wuhan italy and spain showed that maintaining social distancing really achieved results because these cities implemented lockdowns the epidemic quickly reached a peak so far not climbing again erin mordecai a biologist at stanford university and a team of researchers developed an interactive simulator to simulate the spread of covid-19 over time demonstrating the role of social isolation and social distancing in epidemic control erin 2020 notably the government quickly adopted the correct strategy eg social distancing thus controlling the rate of the increase of cases and winning more time for doctors if this had not been the case it would have been impossible for medical staff from another provinces to go to wuhan for support and wuhan appeared to be the only outbreak city in terms of cost social distancing also saves medical resources such as masks hand sanitizers alcohol-based disinfectant etc this gives our healthcare professionals hospitals and other institutions more valuable time to prepare prevent the disease and help people who have been diagnosed with coronavirus there were 50633 confirmed cases in hubei on february 18 2020 because of a peak after the closure of the city then the number of cases began to decline as of april 13 the number of confirmed cases in hubei province was 244 however there are objections to social distancing thomas abel reported that social distancing might lead to depression and anxiety in some people abel and mcqueen 2020 and that social distancing measures are not appropriate in this situation because they will cause more panic and anxiety among people which will also have an impact on social stability of course this crisis has psychological impacts on patients health care workers and the population however we should routinely provide psychological support instead of stopping social distancing measures kim and su 2020 the way novel coronavirus pneumonia is transmitted means that taking certain social distance measures is the most effective practice to prevent and control the disease whos south east asia region director poonam khetrapal singh found that we could reduce the virus transmission by following social distancing measures the spread of this disaster is global to fight the epidemic people from all countries need to unite to see the coming of hope  impact assessment of non-pharmaceutical interventions

lee lun susan chiu s joseph wu t peng wu gabriel leung m   the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 in china outside of hubei province was addressed with the implementation of aggressive public health measures1 these measures relied heavily on massive mobility restrictions universal fever screening in all settings and neighbourhood-based household-focused social distancing that was enforced by large teams of community workers as well as pervasive deployment of artificial intelligence-based social media applications and the use of big data2 whether some or all of these measures would be acceptable and feasible in settings outside of mainland china has been questioned3
 hong kong is a special administrative region of china that operates with a large degree of autonomy it is located outside the mainland on the southern coast of china neighbouring guangdong provincewhich has recorded the largest number of confirmed cases of covid-19 1490 cases as of march 31 2020 outside of hubei having been one of the most heavily affected epicentres during the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic in 2003 the community in hong kong has been prepared to respond to emerging infectious diseases a range of public health measures have been implemented to delay and reduce local transmission of covid-19 and there have been major changes in population behaviour the initial containment or current suppression measures used to control covid-19 in hong kong include intense surveillance for infections not only in incoming travellers but also in the local community with around 400 outpatients and 600 inpatients tested each day in early march 2020 once individuals are identified to be positive for covid-19 they are isolated in hospital until they recover and cease virus shedding their close contacts are traced from 2 days before illness onset and quarantined in special facilities including holiday camps and newly constructed housing estates because not every infected person will be identified containment measures only work if social distancing measures or behavioural changes also reduce so-called silent transmission in the community as a whole 
research in context
evidence before this study
coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 was first identified in late december 2019 in a cluster of cases of atypical pneumonia in wuhan infections increased through january until the implementation of a lockdown of wuhan and other affected cities since january 2020 covid-19 cases have been reported outside china in increasing numbers with many countries not taking strong control measures such as lockdowns until relatively larger numbers of cases had been reported in hong kong singapore and taiwan public health measures to prevent community epidemics were quickly implemented and were able to avoid the need for complete lockdowns we searched pubmed on march 31 2020 for studies reporting the impact of alternative public health measures against covid-19 using keywords including covid-19 2019-ncov novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia sars-cov-2 lockdown social distancing isolation contact tracing and quarantine we scanned 227 published studies and found six that estimated the impact of public health measures in wuhan or elsewhere in mainland china one study that described the early application of testing and contact tracing in singapore and one study reporting the impact of quarantine on transmission on the diamond princess cruise ship
added value of this study
we estimated the effective reproduction number of covid-19 in hong kong as a measure of transmissibility over time and found that it has remained at approximately 1 for the past 8 weeks we described the public health measures that have been introduced to contain covid-19 transmission and the behavioural changes reported by the population and found that distancing measures and changes in behaviour were associated with rapid declines in influenza activity the speed of decline in influenza activity in 2020 was quicker than in previous years in which school closures were implemented but there were no other social distancing measures or voluntary changes in behaviour
implications of all the available evidence
the experience in hong kong indicates that covid-19 transmission can be contained with a combination of testing and isolating cases plus tracing and quarantining their close contacts along with some degree of social distancing to reduce community transmission from unidentified cases
 hong kong offers an opportunity to study the impact of public health interventions and population behavioural changes that could be rolled out in resource-sufficient settings in other countries we aimed to quantify the effect of containment measures on covid-19 in addition to identify whether social distancing and behavioural changes have been associated with reducing silent transmission of covid-19 we analysed data on influenza activity as a proxy for potential changes in transmission of infection in line with the interventions implemented assuming a similar mode and efficiency of spread of influenza and covid-19 the specific objective of this study was to quantify population behavioural changes in hong kong during the covid-19 outbreak and to describe the likely impact of the behavioural changes and public health measures on covid-19 transmission and influenza transmission in the community data on laboratory-confirmed covid-19 cases were obtained from the hong kong centre for health protection which provides daily updates with individual case data on a dedicated webpage we obtained sentinel surveillance data on influenza-like illnesses in a network of around 60 general outpatient clinics from the centre for health protection these include weekly reports on the proportion of outpatient consultations that were in patients with influenza-like illness defined as fever plus cough or sore throat we obtained laboratory surveillance data from the public health laboratory services on influenza testing results on specimens from public hospitals and sentinel surveillance sites including the weekly number of specimens tested and the number testing positive for influenza by type and subtype data on the current population of hong kong by age and sex were obtained from the census and statistics department of the hong kong government we obtained the daily hospitalisation rates for influenza-positive cases among children in hong kong using the daily hospital admissions for influenza to the paediatric departments of two large hospitals in hong kong and the relevant catchment populations4
 we did three cross-sectional telephone surveys among the general adult population in hong kong on jan 2023 feb 1114 and march 1013 2020 the methods and survey instruments used were similar to those used for surveys during the sars epidemic in 20035 6 the influenza a h1n1 pandemic in 20097 and the influenza a h7n9 outbreak in china in 20138 participants were recruited using random-digit dialling of both landline and mobile telephone numbers telephone numbers were randomly generated by a computer system calls were made during both working and non-working hours by trained interviewers to avoid over-representation of non-working groups respondents were required to be at least 18 years old and able to speak cantonese chinese or english new respondents were recruited for each survey round within each household an eligible household member with the nearest birthday was invited to participate in the survey which was not necessarily the person that initially answered the telephone survey items included measures of risk perception attitudes towards covid-19 and behaviours taken against contracting covid-19 including hygiene face masks and reduction of social contact in the second and third surveys respondents who were parents of school-age children were asked to answer additional questions about social contact patterns of their children because schools were closed at the time of the interviews ethical approval for this study was obtained from the institutional review board of the university of hong kong all participants gave verbal informed consent means and proportions of survey responses were directly weighted by sex and age to the general population categorical variables with ordinal likert-type response scales including risk perception and attitudes towards covid-19 were first dichotomised as either above or below a threshold responses to perceived susceptibility were dichotomised as 1 likely very likely or certain versus 0 never very unlikely unlikely or even chance responses to perceived severity were dichotomised as 1 serious or very serious versus 0 very mild mild or moderate responses about worry were dichotomised as 1 moderately worried or very worried versus 0 not at all worried or slightly worried responses about attitudes towards covid-19 were dichotomised as 1 agree or strongly agree versus 0 strongly disagree disagree or neutral we estimated changes in covid-19 transmissibility over time via the effective reproduction number r
t which represents the mean number of secondary infections that result from a primary case of infection at time t values of r
t exceeding 1 indicate that the epidemic will tend to grow whereas values below 1 indicate that the epidemic will tend to decline we estimated the time-varying reproduction numbers from serial intervals and incidence of covid-19 cases over time9 10 assuming a serial interval of 75 days11 we extended the approach used by thompson and colleagues10 to allow for undetected cases due to censoring and imperfect detection of local cases we assumed that 99 of imported cases and 80 of local cases would be detected we developed a data-augmented markov chain monte carlo algorithm to jointly estimate the time-varying reproduction number the delay distribution from onset to reporting which can be used to inform censoring and undetected cases time-varying estimates of reproduction numbers were made with a 7-day sliding window to measure changes in influenza transmissibility over time we first calculated the influenza proxy12 13 for influenza a h1n1 during the 201920 winter by multiplying the weekly influenza-like illness consultation rates by the weekly proportions of specimens positive for influenza a h1n1 which was the predominant strain this influenza proxy is a better correlate of the incidence of influenza virus infections in the community than either influenza-like illness rates or laboratory detection rates alone13 we interpolated daily influenza proxy values from the weekly influenza proxy values with use of flexible cubic splines14
 using the daily influenza proxy we estimated daily transmissibility via the daily effective reproduction number r
t we used a simple branching process model for epidemic spread to estimate the time-varying intensity of transmission15 we assumed the serial interval distribution for influenza followed a gamma distribution with a mean of 285 days and sd of 093 days16 we repeated these analyses for the daily influenza a h1n1 hospitalisation rates among children in two large local hospitals queen mary hospital and princess margaret hospital we evaluated the changes in transmissibility by comparing the r
t values during the 2 weeks before and after the start of the school closures including the chinese new year holidays for the 201920 winter influenza season the 95 cis for the change in r
t were calculated using fiellers theorem17 we compared the reductions in 201920 with reductions in previous years when the chinese new year holidays occurred during influenza epidemics all analyses were done with r version 362 the funder of the study had no role in study design data collection data analysis data interpretation or writing of the report the corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication as of march 31 2020 hong kong had confirmed 715 cases of sars coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection including 386 individuals that were presumed to have acquired infection outside of hong kong imported cases 142 cases that could not be linked to any other case unlinked local cases and 187 cases that were linked to the other known cases secondary cases appendix p 1 among these 715 cases of sars-cov-2 infection 94 were asymptomatic infections and 621 were symptomatic infections figure 1
shows the timeline of interventions that were implemented by the government in hong kong including travel restrictions and bans flexible working arrangements and school closures from kindergartens up to tertiary and post-tertiary institutions including tutorial centres some religious organisations cancelled services from feb 13 onwards and many conferences and other local mass gatherings have been cancelled quarantine orders have been issued to the close contacts of individuals with confirmed infection as well as travellers arriving from affected countries figure 1 although unlinked covid-19 cases have been detected in increasing numbers since early march transmissibility r
t remains around the critical threshold of 1 figure 2
 increases in local cases could be attributed to the transmission of infections into the community resulting from an increasing number of imported infections since early march with a local effective reproduction number of 1 a gradual increase in the incidence of local infections would be expected data on influenza activity based on the community influenza proxy were consistent with the rate of hospitalisation of children with influenza a h1n1 in hong kong figure 3a b
 influenza incidence peaked in the third week of january with influenza a h1n1 predominating and declined to low levels by the second week of february the r
t for influenza a h1n1 gradually declined from the second week of january but was greater than 1 before the start of the school closures and chinese new year the r
t then declined to less than 1 shortly after the school closures and continued to decrease until early february figure 3c d the estimated r
t was 128 95 ci 126130 during the 2-week period before the start of the school closures and 072 070074 during the first 2 weeks of school closures corresponding to a 44 3453 reduction in transmissibility figure 3c similarly the r
t calculated from hospitalisation data was 110 106112 before the start of the school closures and reduced to 073 068077 after school closures corresponding to a 33 2443 reduction in transmissibility figure 3d in comparison during the 201011 winter we estimated the reduction in transmissibility of influenza associated with the chinese new year holidays to be 15 95 ci 1119 declining from an r
t of 110 108113 in the 11-day period before the start of the school holidays to 095 092096 during the 11-day school holiday figure 4
 in the 201415 winter the reduction in transmissibility associated with the chinese new year holidays was 14 722 declining from an r
t of 094 093096 in the 11-day period before the start of the school holidays to 081 075086 during the 11-day school holiday we interviewed 1008 participants on jan 2023 22 response rate 1000 participants on feb 1114 23 response rate and 1005 participants on march 1013 response rate 15 appendix p 3 respondents included a broad cross-section of the adult population of hong kong appendix p 2 respondents perceived that they had similar susceptibility to covid-19 as they did to seasonal influenza but that covid-19 was a much more serious infection and around half of the respondents reported worrying about being infected with covid-19 compared with around a third of respondents for seasonal influenza table
 in survey 2 764 of respondents agreed with the statement that complete border closure would be effective in preventing the spread of covid-19 to hong kong 841 were worried about the availability of medical supplies including face masks but only 277 were worried about the availability of living supplies including food and household goods in hong kong table we identified considerable increases in the use of preventive measures in response to the threat of covid-19 in recent years face masks have mainly been used by individuals in the general community who are ill and by those who feel particularly susceptible to infection and want to protect themselves we found that 745 975 and 988 of respondents wore masks when going out 613 902 and 851 avoided going to crowded places and 711 925 and 930 reported washing or sanitising their hands more often in surveys 1 2 and 3 respectively table in surveys 2 and 3 880 and 838 reported staying at home as much as possible in surveys 2 and 3 we asked the subset of respondents who were parents of school-age children about their support for school closures and the activities of their children during the school closures among respondents who were parents 249 954 of 261 and 192 937 of 205 agreed or strongly agreed that school closure was needed as a control measure for covid-19 in hong kong and 209 801 of 261 and 141 688 of 205 responded that their children had no contact with people other than their household members on the preceding day our findings suggest that the package of public health interventions including border entry restrictions quarantine and isolation of cases and contacts and population behaviour changes such as social distancing and personal protective measures that hong kong has implemented since late january 2020 is associated with reduced spread of covid-19 in the 10 weeks corresponding to about ten generation times since the first known individual with covid-19 in hong kong began to show symptoms there has been little sustained local transmission of the disease our findings strongly suggest that social distancing and population behavioural changesthat have a social and economic impact that is less disruptive than total lockdowncan meaningfully control covid-19 the increasing number of imported infections in march poses a challenge to suppression efforts this increase has occurred at the same time as relaxation of some voluntary avoidance behaviours in the general community without a strengthening of social distancing measures local infections are likely to continue to occur given that the effective reproduction number is approximately 1 or slightly higher than 1 travel measures and testing tracing and treating efforts are particularly important in maintaining suppression although these measures will be increasingly difficult to implement as case numbers increase in addition to the identification of cases with isolation contact tracing and quarantine social distancing has also likely played an important role in suppressing transmission we found that control measures and changes in population behaviour coincided with a substantial reduction in influenza transmission in early february 2020 this observation suggests that the same measures would also have affected covid-19 transmission in the community because there will be some similaritiesas well as some differencesin the modes of transmission of influenza and covid-19 the potentially higher basic reproduction number for covid-19 indicates that it might be more difficult to control than influenza11 because a variety of measures were used simultaneously we were not able to disentangle the specific effects of each one although this may become possible in the future if some measures are strengthened or relaxed locally or with use of cross-national or subnational comparisons of the differential application of these measures the estimated 44 reduction in influenza transmission in the general community in february 2020 was much greater than the estimated 1015 reduction in transmission associated with school closures alone during the 2009 pandemic18 and the 16 reduction in transmission of influenza b associated with school closures during the 201718 winter in hong kong19 we therefore estimate that the other social distancing measures and avoidance behaviours have had a substantial effect on influenza transmission in addition to the effect of school closures however if the basic reproduction number of covid-19 in hong kong exceeds 2 it was 22 in wuhan11 we would need more than a 44 reduction in covid-19 transmission to completely avert a local epidemic a reduction of this magnitude could however substantially flatten the peak of and area under the epidemic curve thus reducing the risk of exceeding the capacity of the health-care system and potentially saving many lives especially among older adults the postponement of class resumption in local schools in hong kong after the chinese new year holiday is technically a class dismissal or suspension rather than a school closure because most teachers are still required to go to school premises to plan e-learning activities and set homework full school closures have been implemented locally in previous years including during the sars epidemic in 20036 during the influenza pandemic in 200918 and to control seasonal influenza epidemics in 2008 and 201819 20 although school closures can have considerable effects on influenza transmission their role in reducing covid-19 transmission would depend on the susceptibility of children to infection and their infectiousness if infected both of these factors are major unanswered questions at present21 22 despite this acknowledged uncertainty our surveys revealed considerable local support for school closures individual behaviours in the hong kong population have changed in response to the threat of covid-19 people have been choosing to stay at home and in our most recent survey 85 of respondents reported avoiding crowded places and 99 reported wearing face masks when leaving home using similar surveys face mask use during the sars outbreak in 2003 was 795 and it reached a maximum of 10 during the influenza a h1n1 pandemic in 20097 these changes in behaviour indicate the level of concern among the population about this particular infection and the extent of voluntary social distancing in addition to the distancing created by school closures however we did identify evidence of reductions in voluntary social distancing behaviours in our third survey in march perhaps indicating some fatigue with these measures our study has some limitations first we could not identify which measure was potentially the most effective and whether border restrictions quarantine and isolation social distancing or behavioural changes are most important in suppressing covid-19 transmission it is likely that each plays a part unlinked cases have been identified in the community and will continue to be identified indicating that not every chain of transmission has been identified by contact tracing from known cases although we have noted major effects of control measures and behavioural changes on influenza transmission the effects could be of a different magnitude for covid-19 because of differences in transmission dynamics second our surveys of population behaviours could have been affected by response bias because we relied on self-reported data they also could have been affected by selection bias away from working adults although this should have been reduced by conducting surveys in non-working as well as working hourswe were unable to assess potential selection bias without a baseline survey before jan 23 2020 we could not compare changes in behaviours although the results of similar surveys from previous epidemics can be used for comparison6 7 8 11 finally although we identified reductions in the incidence of influenza virus infections in outpatients and paediatric inpatients it is possible that these time series were affected by reduced health-care-seeking behaviours and limited health-care access that probably resulted from private clinic closure which occurred around the period of the chinese new year holiday in conclusion our study suggests that measures taken to control the spread of covid-19 have been effective and have also had a substantial impact on influenza transmission in hong kong although the transmission dynamics and modes of transmission of covid-19 have not been precisely elucidated they are likely to share at least some characteristics with influenza virus transmission because both viruses are directly transmissible respiratory pathogens with similar viral shedding dynamics23 the measures implemented in hong kong are less drastic than those used to contain transmission in mainland china and are probably more feasible in many other locations worldwide if these measures and population responses can be sustained avoiding fatigue among the general population they could meaningfully mitigate the impact of a local epidemic of covid-19 data on the incidence of

on request  crime justice  the covid-19 pandemic toward a national research agenda j miller mitchell alfred blumstein   a 2019 novel coronavirus disease covid-19 broke out initially in china and spread globally with such speed and dire effects that the world health organization declared it a public health emergency of international concern in january of this year world health organization 2020 covid-19 attacks the respiratory system more aggressively than other circulating coronaviruses that cause common cold-like illness and presents pronounced health risks of many sorts because there is not yet any pre-existing immunity available vaccine or proven treatment an airborne virus it spreads easily through human contact and has triggered exponential growth in cases hospitalizations and deaths around the globe the actual extent of the virus can only be estimated as the affected can be contagious during lengthy asymptomatic incubation periods with only mild flu symptoms raging spread has resulted in an ongoing global pandemic that at the time of writing has resulted in well over eight million cases and 454000 deaths worldwide with over two million cases and nearly 130000 deaths in the united states that certainly will be considerably higher by time this issue is in print the capacity of countries health systems to respond to the pandemic the extent of testing and reporting transparency vary considerably across and within countries so data is more approximate than exact the virus is truly worldwide and apt to linger over multiple waves with china italy iran india the united kingdom and most recently brazil and russia joining the list headed by the united states as the most plagued nations per johns hopkins covid-19 dashboard statistics not since the influenza of 1918 has the world experienced such a widespread pandemic so there is only a minimal experiential reference base to guide an informed response as the coronavirus impacts almost every part of public and professional life social scientists have quickly pivoted to collect real-time data on a vast range of pandemic issues the effects of limited human contact contraction anxiety unemployment and heightened domestic strife are but a few topics of interest to psychologists and public health researchers economists have unprecedented disruptions to employment and to supply chains and related market implications to address and political scientists have pandemic politics wherein virtually every government position involves a tradeoff between protecting public health and reinvigorating the economy  a reality only magnified by the media during this election year adolph et al 2020 for criminology and criminal justice the new normal of virus life presents a flood of similarly complex choices between protecting public safety and protecting the health of those under control of the criminal justice system as well as those working in it most pundits anticipate the virus will drive increases in some types of crime eg commercial burglary resulting from absenteeism effecting lack of guardianship while retarding others eg residential burglary per increased home presence and guardianship that increased domestic violence will ostensibly reflect the limits of social isolation and that the justice apparatus will be challenged topics representing but a fraction of crime and justice research foci national themed social problems tend to invite quick descriptions of phenomena and fast research conclusions toward crafting solutions a handful of empirical works for example have already reported early data on covid-19 crime and justice topics brantigham 2020 payne  morgan 2020 mohler et al 2020 and gerell  kindgren 2020 but similar to the time realities of vaccine approval high quality applied research takes time and ideally employs mixed methods which means qualitative as well as quantitative data collection and analysis usually facilitated through site visits that per the virus are largely suspended in general and altogether at detention facilities this is not to say that early research is wrong necessarily lacks rigor or consequence but first look explorations of phenomena do not always represent realities accurately and are typically too limited from which to make strong policy generalizations in that research shapes policy positions and practices it is prudent to move forward cautiously rather than invest too heavily on sole studies without replicated result perhaps the most direct impact of the pandemic on the criminal justice system results from the concern over contagion of covid-19 among the individuals the system controls in prisons and jails which arrestees should be sent to jail awaiting trial and which should be released into the community for people convicted should they be incarcerated or released on probation of people serving time in prison which ones can be safely released into the community either because of their high risk if infected or because4 of their low risk of committing crime on the outside these decisions of pretrial release probation and parole have traditionally been addressed daily but they could well take a different form in the context of the virus the concern about contagion puts additional weight favoring release in order to reduce the density in the inevitably crowded prison or jail environments the two foremost focal concepts of the covid-19 pandemic are contagion and containment these interrelated ideas posit arenas of case confirmation and reaction around the objective of minimizing contagion and propagation shelter-in-place epitomizes the national response of social distancing - a universal mandate of separation for everyone to stay at home and prohibition of aggregation of more than a specified number of people but these vary across and even within states - thereby canceling sporting events and entertainment events shutting down restaurants all non-essential businesses and meetings of all sorts stay-home policies and closing of significant portions of the economy has spiked unemployment social isolation and competition for basic needs while forcing home schooling and virtual workplaces drastically altered daily life due to virus rules and compliance enforcement ranging from response to defiance of stay-at-home orders and restrictions on public gatherings and punishment for assault of medical workers usually through coughing spitting or sneezing all these have fostered anomalous responses presenting a wide array of situational and global consequences that raise important research questions regarding individual and programmatic effects containment measures then are strategies implemented as social ordinances designed to limit transmission of the virus among individuals there is unsurprisingly a great deal of variation in the ways in which different countries states and cities have approached the pandemic and the types of containment measures they have employed and then the timing and type of relief from those measures as the viruses impacts are diminished lack of a unified national strategy contributes to the considerable cross-state variation in the initiation and growth patterns of virus severity and of deaths in the united states and in regional variations in virus severity but without question has resulted in containment measures and their alleviation that vary wildly from state to state and even within states as they and their citizenry vary in their trade-offs between economic recovery and aversion despite containment measures differences each jurisdictions response has involved some combination of travel restrictions and border controls quarantine requirements social isolation and distancing requirements and the large-scale closure of various services business and educational facilities while the primary concern of government has been to minimize the health impacts of covid-19 attention has also turned to the other effects of the pandemic government and regulatory interventions include stringent domestic and international travel restrictions and now a raft of phased stay-at-home and changing social distancing regulations the scale of these containment measures has left criminologists wondering what impact this will have on various kinds of crime throughout the remainder of the virus and beyond although the federal government has guided social distancing recommendations through semi-regular centers for disease control briefings that have made public health officials drs anthony fauci and deborah birx household names it has been left to states and cities to implement measures on when to close and when to open different places of business schools and public events and local law enforcement agencies to effect compliance policy choices can both stimulate or inhibit criminal activity and in doing so will thereby generate both intended and unintended consequences and those effects compared to pre-virus crime should be one focus of future research since the virus is not only ongoing but currently spiking in almost half of the states it is now certain that it will be with us for some time thereby accentuating the need for empirically informed policy guidance as well as providing the opportunity to develop that guidance as the virus has blown up online-virtual life normal human contact has been largely replaced with intra-family interaction and computerized linkages which have enabled essential government education and some business affairs to continue functioning despite the social distancing but not without consequences increased screen time not only elevates exposure to and victimization from already embedded online scams and fraudulent transactions but also virus-specific cyber-bullying and hate crime through often anonymous social mediums social distancing to flatten the curve thus impacts some routine activities known to condition criminal opportunities and guardianship cohen  felson 1979 lifestyle alterations around contagion threats theoretically should have an impact on the volume and distribution of crime with domestic and family violence correlated with quarantine economic stress and increased exposure to harmful relationships during periods of limited support options perhaps the most obvious crime threat of forced isolation usher et al 2020 bradbury-jones  isham 2020 social distancing should also have an effect in reducing interpersonal violence other than perhaps domestic violence sex offenses illicit street markets and intergang conflicts more generally empty streets could well be an indicator of a reduction in the opportunities for conducting robberies auto theft and other street crimes and bolster police patrol and surveillance of crime in traditional hot spot neighborhoods the police executive research forum perf analyzed crime reports from thirty cities across the united states between mid-march and mid-april of 2020 and compared observations to the same timeframe in 2019 httpswwwpoliceforumorgcoronavirus while the police role in the virus is pronounced and invites obvious research attention to ordinance compliance domestic violence the shut-down of the economy has also reduced autonomous revenue generation for law enforcement agencies that fund overtime opportunities eg speeding citations asset forfeitures off-duty traffic services and security services as all but one place prince george county maryland saw fewer calls for service than in 2019 violent crime generally declined for the most part over the first 100 days of the virus in roughly 60 of the nations cities but is now either stable or on the uptake in most places robberies and aggravated assault thus far have declined markedly 83 and 57 respectively 83 of cities experienced an overall drop in property crime and there were 43 less burglaries compared to same months in 2019 as staying home has bolstered online commerce cybercrime and package theft has increased amidst all of this virus crime data to sort out march and april of 2020 witnessed the highest numbers of gun-related deaths 2100 in the country since 2016 which could well be related to the reports of a significant rise in thefts of guns from gun shops and this could well be related to the reports of a significant rise in thefts of guns from gun shops as we move deeper into the quarantine and virus life the crime trend landscape is sure to shift as society attempts to balance re-opening with virus resurgence the virus is compelling a range of reactions from law enforcement the courts and corrections that also signal research opportunities in an effort to limit officer exposure to the virus police departments in several states have begun scaling back arrests for lower level offenses in order to reduce covid-19 exposure within their detention facilities the nashville police department for example has already discontinued misdemeanor arrests with the exceptions of domestic violence and drunk driving law enforcement in some places face shortages in personal protective equipment and access to testing while increasingly and somewhat ironically tasked with more virus generated risky work as more officers contract the virus and agency budgets become strained some departments will be forced to scale back non-essential services the los angeles police department has already closed its front desk to the public in order to ensure distancing and slow the spread us customs and border protection officials are enforcing new restrictions on travel and commerce along the borders with canada and mexico and the drug enforcement administration has had to reprioritize away from traditional investigations to ensure regulated medicines needed to fight the virus are available to their staff and in turn has loosened restrictions on telemedicine prescription of controlled drugs federal courts around the united states have closed and delayed trials and most state courts have suspended jury trials utilized mass plea hearings and most have pivoted to video proceedings the impact on jails and prisons in terms of decisions to de-carcerate and whom in terms of risk assessment has probably been the major impact on the cjs and especially in terms of risk measurement particularly with long-time older prisoners usually with excessive mandatory-minimum or life sentences tracking various releasees in terms of recidivism represents an opportunity for research that should be included and emphasized more covid-19 outbreaks in detention facilities has also moved courts to rethink pre-trial custody and disincentivized custodial sanctions skolnik 2020 the supreme court delayed oral arguments for at least a month  the longest delay in its proceedings since the 1918 spanish flu prisons and jails have suspended visitation and facility transfers limited attorney entry and moved to video for personal visits legal meetings and telemedicine still contagion in seemingly super-spreader prisons and jails should remain a constant concern pressure on correctional facilities to release offenders is a focal point of a general de-carcerating movement sivashanker et al 2020 though it is the courts and probation and parole offices that actually effect release wherein risk assessment is more needed and vital than ever the dynamic of the response to the pandemic will certainly have an effect on the changing impacts on the criminal justice system the first phase of the social distancing with a high rate of staying at home is largely ending as pressure to restore the economy dominates decisions the threat of resurgence remains the pressure to reduce contagion in jails and prisons will present natural experiments around early release policies that may demonstrate reconsideration of the incarceration and public safety relationship that in turn invites reconsideration of mass incarceration policies more broadly it is certainly reasonable to anticipate that recidivism rates will be higher in jurisdictions with more risky release practices but analyses of these and the justice practices and interventions contributing to them should provide useful indications of where to rethink current incarceration and release policies the increasing prevalence of long and life sentences approximately 15 of the total inmate population means a large percentage of prison cells are occupied by older and less risky offenders who are reasonable candidates for release to reduce the density of prison population vulnerable to virus contagion according to the aclu report a living death life without parole for nonviolent offenses almost 80 of the over 3000 people serving life without parole will die in prison from nonviolent drug offense convictions aclu foundation 2013 certainly a basis for review of such life sanctions resulting from naively presumed deterrence effects which are undercut by the drug markets recruiting replacements and retributive arguments for the life sentences for a single serious crime the second phase for consideration of the interaction between the pandemic and the criminal justice system will be centered around re-opening as bars and restaurants are opened and travel increased to some extent the problem of crime and offenders should begin to return as before but it will certainly be interesting to see the degree to which crime drops noticed during the separation period are erased and to what extent new crimes that emerged continue also one can anticipate somewhat of a reduction in the staffing levels at different parts of the criminal justice system due to the impact of covid-19 particularly as a consequence of their interactions as part of carrying out their professional responsibilities as the stress from the virus intensifies over time mental health issues will likely increase encounters between officers and those with mental disorders that in turn will only compound officer resiliency problems a third phase that is expected to begin in the mid to late fall of 2020 is the hardest to predict there is some speculation that the warmth of the summer will diminish the prevalence of the coronavirus but the cooler weather of the fall will reinitiate the pandemic one would hope that planning for this phase would involve careful assessment of what went well and what went poorly during the previous two phases and how best to prepare for a reemergence of the pandemic and how to respond to it it is rather early to guess about that but it is particularly important to analyze the current phase for lessons in dealing with reemergence spikes as social distancing and the wearing of facemasks become increasingly challenged there will no doubt be heavy research focus on public health implications especially as virus impacts spike up understanding the impact of social distancing on crime will also be critical for ensuring the safety of police and government capacity to deal with the lingering crisis and provide insights into whether people are complying with public health measures usher et al 2020 of course we speculate what is to come on the hopeful assumption that the public will proceed with some collective consciousness of public risk and comply with various constraints on re-opening measures there is ample evidence that many segments of the population largely ignore virus risks and seemingly have little concern about risk to others and ongoing protests over police misconduct upcoming political rallies church re-openings and similar congregant events may prompt unpredictable spikes with some states or cities moving forward with re-opening while others may have to backtrack over time virus crime coughing or spitting and social ordinance violation and justice enforcement of ordinances will become of increasing concern apart from traditional crime during the virus per se it is inevitable that the virus will expose inequalities vulnerabilities and related service gaps attention to the justice systems performance during the pandemic can be extended to more systematic and serious discussions for broader justice policies because of contagion issues the virus warrants reconsideration of the nations current mass incarceration rates that are more than quadruple those that prevailed for at least fifty years blumstein and cohen 1973 when correctional policies were decided by the functionaries within the criminal justice system rather than todays political messaging to the nave public that more incarceration inherently lowers crime rates a presumption contradicted by the failure of the drug war that revealed a labor surplus of willing replacement drug dealers blumstein  beck 1999 and those current rates of about 430 prisoners per 100000 population are still about the highest in the world and declining at a rate of only 15 per year we need rigorous research to identify evidence-based approaches and inform challenging policy and practice decisions specific to covid-19 and virus overlap with the opioid mental health and now racism epidemics related this special issue of the american journal of criminal justice addresses a range of leading crime and justice issues presented by the covid-19 pandemic contributions from several leading discipline authorities as well as notable rising scholars will hopefully instigate additional discourse and help frame inquiry strategies as we begin to attempt to understand virus crime and criminal justice response and identify appropriate and effective system behavior  the potential impact of covid-19 on psychosis a rapid review of contemporary epidemic and pandemic research ellie brown richard gray samantha monaco lo brian odonoghue barnaby nelson andrew thompson shona francey pat mcgorry   the corona virus disease 2019 covid-19 outbreak started in china in december 2019 and by march 2020 had spread across the globe while the development of a vaccine continues public health strategies to contain the spread of the disease have been put in place in nearly every country world health organization 2020 these include quarantine self-isolation of people potentially exposed to the virus and social distancing more accurately termed physical distancing of the general population world health organization 2020 while physical distancing may be the most effective way of preventing the spread of the virus center for disease control et al 2003 this measure may be associated with a range of adverse psychological effects including fear anxiety and worry brooks et al 2020 gardner and moallef 2015 in addition to the physical effects of decreased motor activity changes to diet and exposure to sunlight lippi et al 2020 such impacts are likely to differ across pandemics and populations for example wang et al 2011 reported no immediate negative psychological effect of quarantine in their sample of university students in china during the h1n1 flu outbreak the incidence of depression and anxiety in populations where physical distancing is enforced may be impacted brooks et al 2020 and there has been media speculation around this issue with some governments actively recognising and funding mental health services to respond to this potential surge in mental ill-health zhou et al 2020 the implications for wellbeing are likely to be complex however potential positives arising from the situation have also been speculated on for example a renewed sense of shared social purpose fransen et al 2015 such as everyone is in this together and we must all act to protect the vulnerable and the healthcare system there may also be short term benefits for individuals who experience social anxiety with the expectation to stay at home reducing typical stresses they experience from having to attend school or work for example psychosis is one mental health condition that requires specific attention for one the association between influenza infection and psychosis has been reported since the spanish flu pandemic in the eighteenth century and subsequent acute psychoses of influenza have been documented during multiple pandemics kpiska et al 2020 a further point is that this population may be particularly at risk from the stress associated with physical distancing measures while the use of mobile phones and technology continues to increase for people with psychosis rates are still lower than in the general population firth et al 2015 this may mean that physical distancing and reduction in social connectedness has a substantial effect on this group of individuals as they do not compensate as much with other methods of communication another impact the covid-19 pandemic may have is on the nature and content of the psychotic pathology of people with psychosis or at risk of psychosis clinicians working in mental health services have given anecdotal reports of increased paranoia content around contamination from being in close contact with other people the association between psychosis and a range of psychosocial factors including stressful life events has been extensively explored suggesting it is an important risk factor for both the onset and exacerbation of symptoms fusar-poli et al 2017 the medium- and long-term social effects of covid-19 may disproportionately impact people with psychosis or at risk of psychotic disorder for example social isolation unemployment homelessness relationship breakdown divorceseparation domestic violence and worsening physical health may all particularly effect people with psychosis given their vulnerability to social determinants of health anglin et al 2020 again the direction of this impact is not known as there is the potential for pandemics to strengthen social inequities and thus impact associated risk factors there is also the potential for an increase in the number of people with psychosis who suicide or attempt suicide with some evidence of an increase in the number of suicides occurring after previous pandemics chan et al 2006 what may complicate the interaction between psychosis and covid-19 further is that the treatment of covid-19 may involve the use of high doses of steroids to modulate the inflammatory response russell et al 2020 steroids have been known to trigger psychotic symptoms wada et al 2001 how the specific psychosocial factors associated with an epi- or pandemic affect people with psychosis including their use of health services is unlikely to be well understood by policymakers or clinicians who have not previously lived and worked through such an outbreak there may be valuable lessons about the impact an epi- or pandemic can have on psychosis that can be learned from other virus outbreaks including the recent sars severe acute respiratory syndrome mers middle east respiratory syndrome and ebola epidemics social distancing and other public health interventions to combat the spread of covid-19 may have immediate and longer-term effects on people with or who are at risk of psychosis statutory health and social care and non-government services that support and treat people with psychosis need guidance on how covid-19 may impact on their services and the people that use them and how they may respond accordingly the world health organization tricco et al 2017 advocates that rapid reviews are essential in providing informative summaries of these issues in such circumstances we therefore aimed to undertake a rapid review of research on the impact of epidemics and pandemics on people with psychosis and the mental health services they use our review aimed to address the following questions related to living in a community exposed to an epidemic or pandemic1is there a change in the incident cases of psychosisbeing identified as ultra-high-risk yung et al 2004 of psychosis2are changes reported in the form and content of psychotic symptoms ie do people incorporate beliefs about the virus into their symptoms3is there a change in demand for inpatient and community-based crisis services by people with psychosis4is there a deterioration in the physical health of people with psychosis5does the number of people with psychosis suiciding or attempting suicide change6is there an increase in the number of people with psychosis who experience social issues such as homelessness unemployment domestic violence and loneliness7how do people with psychosis experience the preventative measures put in place in pandemics eg social distancing increased handwashing
 while we did not produce a detailed protocol for this rapid review the study was registered with the open science framework on the 23rd march 2020 httpsosfio29pm4 we included studies that reported primary research included participants that had a psychotic disorder eg first-episode psychosis schizophrenia bipolar disorder or were considered to be at high risk of psychosis and had been exposed to an epidemic or pandemic eg sars mers we excluded studies that tested the association between maternal influenza and adult schizophrenia in part because this has been extensively reviewed previously kpiska et al 2020 we searched medline psycinfo and web of science on 23 march 2020 no date limits were applied we limited our search to papers written in english and published in a peer-review journal our search strategy for medline was1psychoss or psychotic or schizophreni or delusion or hallucination or paranoi or schizoaffectivetiab2pandemic or epidemic or sars or mers or influenza or hiv or malaria or tuberculosis or leprosy or smallpox or swine flu or ebola or covid-19 or coronavirustiab3psychiatric inpatient or psychiatric service or mental health service or crisis caretiab41 and 252 and 364 or 5
 in addition a search of google scholar was conducted to identify any additional relevant publications the results of our search were uploaded into covidence a web-based systematic review management package title and abstract and full-text screening were completed by two members of the research team eb rg any discrepancies were resolved by a third slm the following data were extracted from included studies country design participants epidemicpandemic measuresoutcomes ie incident cases use of psychiatric services physical healthwellbeing behaviours towards preventative measures put in place or functional outcomes one researcher rg undertook data extraction this was justified because of the rapid nature of the review and the desire to complete promptly quality of included studies was assessed using the effective public health practice project quality assessment tool ephpp tool thomas et al 2004 this tool facilitates the rating of the quality of each paper across six domains selection bias study design confounders blinding data collection method and withdrawals and dropouts these component ratings are then used to make a global rating with strong equating to no weak ratings moderate to one weak rating and a global rating of weak if there are two or more weak ratings following our initial search we made the following amendments to our study protocol we excluded papers that related to the hivaids pandemic for two main reasons the mode of transmission is different ie it is not an airborne transmission and psychosis related to hivaids is comparatively well understood and unlikely to be relevant to the covid-19 pandemic gray et al 2002 we also restricted our search to articles published after 2000 just before the sars outbreak post hoc we also decided to check the reference lists and citations of included papers one observational study hu et al 2020 and a single case report zulkifli et al 2020 examined incident cases of psychosis in people living in a geographical area where covid-19 was prevalent hu reported a 25 increase - compared to previous years - in incident cases of schizophrenia in january 2020 which the authors attributed to the psychosocial stress and physical distancing measures associated with the covid-19 outbreak hu et al 2020 the authors extracted data from 13783 outpatients of which 1210 presented for the first time attending the xuzhou oriental peoples psychiatric hospital in january 2020 the start of the covid-19 outbreak the authors adjusted for a limited number of potential covariates - age gender and place of residence - in their analysis the absolute number of new cases of schizophrenia is comparatively small and may be explained by simple random variation no data are reported in terms of the difference in presentation - other than that patients were seemingly older with median age increased from 39 to 50 at the time of writing these data were published on a chinese open science platform rather than a peer-reviewed journal additionally of concern is the use of the diagnosis schizophrenia when typically symptoms are required to be present for six months before this diagnosis to be reached we identified a single case report from malaysia of an acute episode of psychosis seemingly precipitated by fear and distress associated with covid-19 zulkifli et al 2020 the 31-year-old male patient had no previous history of mental disorder and did not use illicit substances he responded well to a low dose antipsychotic however causality cannot be implied as there are usually several aetiological factors that lead to the development of a psychotic disorder and the anxiety that precipitated the episode may have just been the most proximal factor both hu and zulkifili postulate that frequent media reporting of covid-19 particularly potentially sensationalist news found on social media platforms may amplify psychosocial stress in novel and potentially more damaging ways in total we identified seven papers addressing incident cases of psychosis linked to a virus this included four observational studies kim et al 2018 lee et al 2004 mak et al 2009 sheng et al 2005 of which three were associated with exposure to sars lee et al 2004 mak et al 2009 sheng et al 2005 and one mers kim et al 2018 additionally we identified two case reports of patients with the h1n1 chang et al 2015 and sars cheng et al 2004 and one study examined coronavirus immunoreactivity in people with recent-onset psychosis severance et al 2011 all of the studies included in the review indicated a link between exposure to the virus and psychosis in the first observational study sheng et al 2005 surveyed 308 sars patients discharged from hospital and identified psychiatric symptoms using the neuropsychiatric symptoms checklist npsc developed by the authors for this study auditory hallucinations visual hallucinations and persecutory ideas were reported by 39 2 and 39 of patients respectively although it is unclear from the data presented if these are unique participants or if single participants were reporting multiple symptoms and declined at follow-up the severity of sars symptoms and higher doses of corticosteroid were significantly associated with an increased risk of experiencing psychosis symptoms in the second observational study following the sars outbreak mak et al 2009 administered the scid structured clinical interview for dsm-iv validity 2004 to 90 sars survivors 30 months after the outbreak four 44 participants were identified as experiencing post-sars psychotic symptoms with three other participants reporting transient auditory and visual hallucinations during admission for sars treatment but did not meet diagnostic criteria the authors report no details about the treatment and response lee et al 2004 undertook a retrospective chart review of sars survivors in hong kong to test the hypothesis that post-sars psychosis was associated with treatment with steroids an incident rate of 09 n  15 was reported in the 1744 sars patients reviewed for the study they subsequently matched these to 30 control patients who had sars but did not experience psychosis all participants in the study were treated with steroids patients in the psychosis group received significantly higher doses of steroids while inpatient than controls median dose in hydrocortisone equivalent 10975 mg v 6780 mg the authors also suggest that a family history of mental illness and psychosocial stressor may have been associated with an increased risk of psychosis in their sample in the final observational study we identified kim et al 2018 completed a retrospective chart analysis of all patients admitted to an acute mers inpatient unit in seoul south korea of the 24 mers survivors 17 708 exhibited psychiatric symptoms of which 2 118 experienced auditory hallucinations in the two case reports where psychosis followed virus infection one reported two patients infected with the h1n1 chang et al 2015 and the other three patients who had the sars virus cheng et al 2004 in both reports authors observed that psychotic symptoms seemed to be attributable to a combination of virus symptom severity the isolation during treatment and administration of steroids of the three patients in the chang case series it was noted that hallucinations seemingly worsened in two patients when steroid treatment was stepped down at the end of acute treatment both of the patients in the chang h1n1 case series were young girl 14 and boy 13 years old and were treated with an antiviral agent oseltamivir but not steroids both patients responded well to treatment with low dose antipsychotic medication aripiprazole 5 mgday the authors concluded that exposure to antiviral treatment induced the psychosis chang et al 2015 in a cross-sectional survey the association between four coronaviruses 229e hku1 nl63 and oc43 and psychosis was examined in a study involving 106 people with recent-onset psychosis and 196 non-psychiatric controls severance et al 2011 all four coronaviruses were more common in people with psychosis compared to controls after adjusting for confounding variables age gender socioeconomic status and smoking status the odds of the hku1 and nl63 coronavirus were associated with a 32 and 142 increase in the odds of psychosis suggesting that coronavirus may be important risk factors for psychosis three included studies considered psychotic patient adherence with protective measures cheng et al 2004 maguire et al 2018 pang 2004 there was a consistent conclusion that adherence was markedly more problematic in people with psychosis although included studies had important methodological limitations a single cross-sectional study examined willingness and perceived barriers to adopting protective measures in 71 adults with and 238 without schizophrenia attending primary care maguire et al 2018 people with schizophrenia were less willing to receive a vaccination and were more concerned about vaccination side effects people with schizophrenia were also less willing to be isolated compared to those without schizophrenia there was no difference in willingness to hand wash or perceptions of the effectiveness of handwashing between people with and without schizophrenia 
pang 2004 reports a service evaluation of the impact of sars on psychiatric services however the author does not provide any empirical data within the publication they reported that while psychiatric inpatients were taught self-hygiene measures and provided with face masks their adherence to these measures was inadequate in the cheng et al 2004 case series it was noted that psychotic symptoms were linked to poor adherence with infection control measures clinicians working on the sars unit were concerned about mental health clinicians visiting the ward unless necessary which they reported complicated access to treatment two papers were identified that examined perception of the risk of infection in people with psychosis iancu et al 2005 maguire et al 2019 one study examined if the sars epidemic caused anxiety and worry in 30 inpatients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia compared to a control group of 30 staff members in israel where the virus was not endemic iancu et al 2005 most patients were aware of the sars epidemic compared to the control group patients reported they were more protected from sars in hospital perceived that staff did all they could to protect them and believed that there would be no sars cases in israel patients were also more likely to accept psychotic explanations for the sars virus such as it is a punishment a sign the world is coming to an end and a sign for humankind in a second paper maguire et al 2019  derived from the maguire et al 2018 survey - the authors reported that in participants with schizophrenia affect seems to play a role in risk perception of swine flu infection and willingness to adhere with protective measures for example they reported that higher levels of reported anxiety in those with schizophrenia were associated with a reduced likelihood of perceiving they were at substantive risk from swine flu maguire also reported a trend in perception towards people with schizophrenia - compared to controls - being less likely to get swine flu maguire et al 2019 two studies examined the impact of an outbreak of a virus on psychiatric services kamara et al 2017 pang 2004 in both studies services were impacted pang 2004 reported a significant reduction in demand for psychiatric services in hong kong following the sars outbreak there was a 6 reduction in the number of acute admissions from the emergency department a 14 reduction in the length of hospitalisation and a 5 drop in outpatient attendance community visits reduced by 50 seemingly because home visits to patients were suspended clinicians compensated by making telephone contact the long-term implications of the scaling back of community services were not reported and it is unclear if this was done to protect clinicians or patients 
kamara et al 2017 described the outcomes of 143 patients of whom 30 had psychosis attending nurse-led mental health services during the ebola outbreak in sierra leone the epidemic had a substantial impact on the provision of already fragile health services in the country while the authors noted an increase in numbers of people attending mental health services during the outbreak no primary evidence is reported to support this claim accessing medication was one of the major challenges reported in this paper we found no evidence of changes in the form and content of psychotic symptoms impact on the physical health of people with psychosis rates of suicide or attempted suicide nor incidence of homelessness unemployment and domestic violence the results of the quality assessment of included studies are presented in table 2
 eight included papers received the rating of weak and two of strong it was not possible to undertake quality assessment for the three case reports and the one service evaluation included in the paper there was evidence that people with psychosis may be less motivated to comply with infection controlphysical distancing measures that are likely to raise some practical and ethical issues particularly for clinicians running inpatient psychiatric units iancu et al 2005 in hong kong during the sars epidemic - a notably less contagious virus - patients who did not comply with required infection control practices were placed in enforced quarantine pang et al 2004 in some countries such practices may be considered unethical and potentially incompatible with mental health laws helping people with psychosis maintain physical distancing and infection control requirements may be challenging particularly while they are inpatients for clinicians working in mental health services where personal protective equipment ppe may be limited this may cause concern in the longer term tailored patient education about the importance of complying with infection control measures was recommended by pang et al 2004 in the absence of any high-quality evidence about how to ensure compliance with infection control behaviours clinicians may need to consider applying other psychoeducation techniques xia et al 2011 particularly for individuals with prominent disorganisation symptoms behavioural issues have been reported as challenging and timely recognition and initiation of treatment may be helpful notably reports are emerging of new incident cases of psychosis - seemingly in an older group of people - associated with exposure to the psychosocial stress of covid-19 hu et al 2020 zulkifli et al 2020 while extreme caution should be applied in inferring an association given the limited amount of available data increased awareness and vigilance may be justified the increased risk of psychosis in people exposed to a virus during an epi- or pandemic is more compelling between 09 and 4 of people exposed develop psychosis or psychotic symptoms hallucinations andor delusions this is in contrast to a median incident rate of 152 in 100000 mcgrath et al 2004 in some cases the psychosis seemed to be associated with treatment with steroids used to treat the infection eg mak et al 2009 treatment with low doses of antipsychotic medication - notably aripiprazole - seems to have been effective in patients with an emerging infectious disease and those associated with psychosocial stress associated with an emerging infectious disease during the sars outbreak in hong kong community services were suspended pang et al 2004 policymakers and service managers may consider that the protection of their staff is paramount and it should be possible to provide some form of community support using telehealth technology people with psychosis do - at least in advanced economies - have access to online and mobile-based technologies that seem to be acceptable and feasible in this population alvarez-jimenez et al 2014 firth et al 2015 the safety effectiveness and acceptability of telephoneinternet-based delivery of community-based mental health services for people with psychosis need to be carefully monitored as will their potential use of other medical services for example emergency departments we found no studies or case series of people with existing psychosis that had been infected by a virus during an epi- or pandemic presumably this is because infection is a comparatively rare occurrence in this group of patients in pandemics to date given that we identified that people with psychosis are seemingly less adherent with protective measures it seems reasonable to hypothesise that during the covid-19 outbreak  where a large number of people can expect to be infected  mental health clinicians will likely be in a position where they need to encourage patients to physically distance and self-isolate there was little evidence to guide how best to address this issue clinically inevitably patients with psychosis and covid-19 will require admission to medical wards studies of patients with coronavirus induced psychosis have reported that this is a complex and extremely challenging group of people to treat it may be reasonable to suggest that consideration will need to be given at a hospital and government level about how best to support these individuals accessing medical facilities there was limited evidence from emerging economies with only one study kamara et al 2017 reporting on the impact the ebola epidemic had on mental health service delivery in contrast to the relatively contained outbreaks of sars mers and ebola covid-19 is spreading across the globe mental health care in these economies tend to already be neglected services and governments and hospitals may have to be creative in their treatment delivery perhaps expediting a move away from hospital-based care that can still dominate in these economies another novel shift in service provision could be making use of a peer-based workforce stastny 2012 to reinforce infection control measures there are some important limitations to this rapid review that should be considered when appraising our findings amendments were made to our registration entry after we had undertaken our initial search this could be interpreted as a post hoc effort to amend the aims of the study after we had started to read the available studies our search strategy was not externally peer-reviewed while it would have been helpful to have our search further scrutinized it was felt that this would have delayed the review process and we decided to omit this step only three databases were searched we did not search key databases such as cinahl that indexes research not covered by the databases we used the decision to restrict the databases we searched was based on our experience of the likely relevance of studies indexed in cinahl primarily focused on nursing and other candidate databases that said there may be relevant studies that we omitted as a consequence finally data extraction was undertaken by a single researcher although this was done carefully there is a possibility that errors may have occurred because this was a rapid review that we aimed to complete in a timely way to inform policymakers we judged that the time saved by only having a single researcher undertake data extraction was warranted the main finding from our rapid review is that there is moderate if low quality evidence to suggest a small but important number of patients will develop coronavirus related psychosis that is likely associated with steroid or viral exposure pre-existing vulnerability and psychosocial stress psychosis in patients with coronavirus may present a major challenge and potential infection control risk to clinical teams there was limited evidence to suggest that patients that developed psychosis responded well to low dose antipsychotics such as aripiprazole in addition to steroid-induced psychosis there was some limited and poor-quality evidence which suggested that extreme psychosocial stress-triggered incident cases in people previously unaffected of importance to current mental health service provision patients with existing psychosis may be less likely to comply with physical distancing and personal hygiene requirements required during an outbreak of an infectious disease representing a potential risk to the community and mental health clinicians the current covid-19 pandemic offers a global opportunity to explore the findings of this rapid review in greater depth and quality there is much to speculate upon regarding the consequences of the covid-19 pandemic on individuals with psychosis our review highlights that within the current literature at least minimal consideration has been given to this disadvantaged population and proactive research is required eb and rg conceived the study completed the screening and completed the first draft slm completed the search and screening at bn bod

era a plan for reconstituting long-term economic security mary allen beth mehdi mirsaeidi   a pandemic represents a multifaceted global threat in addition to the obvious impact on population health pandemics also represent an important threat to the global economy these important economic costs can potentially result in a comparable impact on population health as all economic factors have a proven positive correlation with key health status outcomes 1 therefore effective public health policy must always respect the impact of economic factors on population health as health and economic stability remain as variables in a reinforcing feedback loop in the absence of proven treatment or vaccination social physical distancing is the most proven and effective means of combating communicable infectious diseases for covid-19 impacted regions worldwide this remains one of the few options to slow the spread of the infection while preserving fragile health delivery institutions social distancing policy usually includes school and business closures and home-based work recommendations while enforced curfews and quarantine orders have also been enacted although studies acknowledge the economic consequences of forced closures of business and restrictions on private businesses most researchers agree that social distancing measures are effective relative to cost as part of pandemic preparedness 2 further the burden of disease is well-noted to impact the economy without social distancing policy with many economists arguing that preserving lives has a shorter term economic impact however not all studies agree on the appropriate iteration of social distancing as clear policy depends on unique features of the virus as well as geographical features and risk groups for severe disease and mortality in a simulation study of a community of 10000 residents targeted social distancing focusing on children and teenagers was found effective for the influenza pandemic occurring in the 1950s through school closures and home-based education simulations similar to the spanish influenza epidemic identified that more aggressive targeting was suitable involving children through young adult populations these findings indicate that community size as well as viral population risk groups should be considered in forming effective targeted social distance policy 3 because resource utilization remains a concern for policy makers in the event of a pandemic social distancing measures as a method for reducing the demand for a limited stockpile of antivirals was not found effective over a long period of time but delaying the occurrence of infections in order to support vaccine development was found to be effective policy 4 the implications of the literature applicable to the current outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 leave many questions because covid-19 is caused by a novel corona virus many of the disease features researchers anticipated are vastly different and not well-understood among these features are differing presentations of disease and severity within populations while early data suggest that older populations were at an increased risk for severe disease the identification of infections in different populations has revealed the presence of severe disease in much younger populations also no proven medication protocol currently exists which has resulted in clinical trials all over the world being conducted to create new therapies develop a vaccine and evaluate existing medications developed for the treatment of other viral illnesses with the latter representing the most immediate benefit with some data also understood and an existing supply and distribution chain in place several of these therapies have been tested in both laboratory and clinical settings with mixed results with remdesivir showing the most promising results so far of existing antivirals the us food and drug administration has recently issued emergency authorization for the experimental use in treatment of severe covid-19 5 this will create a practical challenge as the demand for the drug will undoubtedly exceed the existing supply and the continued interruption of global supply chains will delay immediate production and distribution to care centers and patients in need despite this the promise of remdesivir is encouraging following the disappointing results from hydroxychloroquine studies which found unacceptable side-effects with no significant effect on disease outcome 6 7 still shortages of hydroxychloroquine were immediate due to widespread experimental use for both covid-19 patients as well as prophylaxis for at risk healthcare workers these shortages had important consequences for patients who receive the medication for the management of chronic autoimmune disorders who were unable to access their regular treatment further prolonged mechanical ventilation as the only validated treatment option in severe covid19 may likewise present scarcity challenges as has occurred in italy and spain furthermore the reinfection rate seems to be low which has important implications for the evolving immunity of the herd in the future existing social distancing policy in many states has minimized the interaction of american communities states and regions that is likely to support variations in peaks between communities according to the institute for health metrics and evaluation ihme several states with a high volume of cases are expected to have a prolonged epidemic peak for multiple weeks from early may to june with the exception of new york which attained peak infections early-mid april this projection has been calculated based on the current social distancing measures and the varying degrees of population density which will result in outbreaks in different communities occurring at different times this has important implications for the fragile healthcare delivery system as shifting resources to the areas in the most need of equipment medical staff and other important resources will only be possible if epidemic peaks do not occur in unison the return to normalcy will only occur through a complex assortment of policy interventions that transform the american economy continue targeted social distancing and use medical science as a tool to personalize social distancing to facilitate gradual personal interactions of low risk individuals among the many differences in the covid-19 pandemic with previous influenza pandemics one of the most notable is the ability to facilitate operations through technology many industries operating in professional services and functional departments within companies like management and administration have already adopted conferencing technology that facilitate in person interactions similar implementations of technology have not been achieved in manufacturing and distribution as low level employment has driven these functions that are now considered essential further the impact of the global economy most specifically from the burden of disease in china has placed entire supply chains at risk for critical medical supplies the us should use this crisis as an opportunity in invest in the automation of the manufacturing sector shrink supply chains and create higher level jobs as a benefit to the economy included in this policy should be workforce training available to those who have been replaced through automation social distancing policies should continue as each region state and city locality make decisions regarding the reopening of businesses based on their unique disease curve this has already happened as a result of unclear federal policy but the practice of each community should be standardized workplaces should be adapted to this policy and facilitate standardization of physical distancing medical science will support the gradual reconstitution of the in person work force this step will depend on many factors such as the development of treatment protocol vaccine development and currently available antibody testing that identifies individuals with covid-19 immunity who can re-enter these industries without posing the risk of infection or infecting others for those previously infected with covid-19 infection severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov2 immunity develops with an immunoglobulin response measurable by increasing igm and igg levels that have been shown to eliminate viral load and promote recovery 8 although antibody testing is available now the adoption of rapid igg testing would be best suitable for widespread population level screening as part of a comprehensive plan for incrementally rebuilding the in person work force the human cost of this pandemic is without question significant however the transitioning of the economy to better utilize technology along with reconstructing the work force could improve the standard of living for many americans as well as better prepare the us for future pandemics we could also create a better response annually to seasonal influenza as its annual cost to the us in terms of morbidity mortality and loss in quality adjusted life years is significant finally the political support for prioritizing public health preparedness as a matter of national and economic security will likely be stronger and will result in better surveillance that identifies and prevents future pandemics and streamlines strong national and coordinated responses that will mitigate the potential damage to the economic and health infrastructure and support a more timely recovery all datasets generated for this study are included in the articlesupplementary material mm and ma were involved in conception design and drafting of

relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest  applicability of time fractional derivative models for simulating the dynamics and mitigation scenarios of covid-19 yong zhang xiangnan yu hongguang sun geoffrey tick r wei wei bin jin   fractional calculus can provide a promising tool in modeling biological phenomena as reviewed recently by lonescu et al 1 for example fractional-derivative equation fde models have been applied to capture complex dynamics in biological tissues 2 tumor growth 3 dna sequencing 4 drug uptake 5 and salmonella bacterial infection in animal herds 6 most recently the fde models have been applied to model the pine wilt disease 7 the human respiratory syncytial virus hrsv disease 8 the harmonic oscillator with a position-dependent mass 9 human liver using caputo-fabrizio fractional derivative 10 11 and tumor-immune surveillance 12 motivated by these successful applications this study tests whether the fdes can be applied to model the dynamics and mitigation scenarios of coronavirus an emerging and critical research area that has not been focused by the fractional calculus community before the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 outbreak a respiratory illness that started first detected in late december 2019 is a pandemic infecting 336000 people in more than 140 countries with the average fatality rate of 44 globally data up to 3222020 13 the covid-19 pandemic is infiltrating almost every aspect of life damaging global economy and altering both man-made and natural environments urgent actions have been taken but further effective and efficient strategies are promptly needed to confront this global challenge to address this challenge and promptly guide the next efforts it is critical to model the covid-19 outbreak mathematical models are among the necessary tools to quantify the covid-19 and therefore testing the applicability of such fde models under this new global pandemic is the primary objective motivating this study this study aims to model the covid-19 evolution dynamics ie transmission infection recovery and death evolution for representative countries with apparent coronavirus cases including china the united states us italy japan and south korea using mathematical models most specifically the fde models described previously it should be noted that the covid-19 spread in these countries experienced different starting initiation and detection times an important fact to consider when applying these models for example china had passed the peak of the coronavirus outbreak finally reaching a milestone with no new local infections on 3192020 79 days from the onset 12312019 in wuhan china while the us coronavirus cases soared past 10000 on the same day this study will apply the core characteristics of the covid-19 outbreak obtained in china to estimate the covd-19 spread in the us as well as other countries where the number of affected people has not yet reached its number of peak cases in addition this new pandemic may last for a relatively longer time than expected 14 no vaccine against sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is currently available 15 indeed a vaccine for prevention and infection control may not be ready before march 2021 for the covid-19 considering a minimum of 45 weeks for trials and at least 1 year for safety evaluation and final deployment efficient strategies are therefore needed to mitigate the covid-19 outbreak possible non-pharmaceutical scenarios such as isolation of cases and contact tracing can be evaluated using mathematical models 16 in order to identify the most efficient mitigation strategies going forward this is another major motivation and the secondary task of this study using the fde models to address the questions mentioned above this study is organized as follows section 2 proposes an updated seir model with an fde-based component for covid-19 where s e i and r stand for susceptible exposed infectious and recovered people respectively 17 this model is then applied to fit and predict the covid-19 spread in various provinces and major cities in china resulting in abundant datasets to derive the core characteristics of the covid-19 dynamics in evolution section 3 predicts the spread of covid-19 in the other countries using the knowledge that is gained from the china case study section 4 proposes a fully lagrangian approach with the time fde to model the spatiotemporal evolution of covid-19 and then applies it to evaluate non-pharmaceutical scenarios to mitigate the virus spread section 5 reports the main conclusions specifically the feasibility of fdes for capturing covid-19 evolution in the appendix the impacts of the non-singular kernel and fractional derivative type on model results are further discussed for readers particularly interested in these fractional calculus techniques the main contributions of this work therefore include 1 the first application of fdes in modeling the evolution of the covid-19 death toll 2 an updated seir model with a transient recovery rate to better capture the dynamics of covid-19 pandemic within china and for other countries and 3 a particle-tracking approach based on stochastic bimolecular reaction theory to evaluate the mitigation of the spread of the covid-19 outbreak the classical seir model containing four populations s e i and r takes the form 291adsdtrpisn

2 is the rate for the healthy susceptible person to be transferred to an infected one from exposed persons note that covid-19 patients in the incubation period might be contagious too and r
2 is the number of healthy susceptible people that are contacted by exposed people daily now the infection rates can change with time and the infected persons are removed from the risk of infection via a time-dependent rate term of t if the recovered individuals can return to a susceptible status due to for example a loss of immunity then the partial differential equation pde 2d for the time rate of change of r requires one more sink term r where  is the rate of the recovered individuals returning to a susceptible status we replace the integer-order derivatives in the classical seir 1 by the fractional-order derivatives in 2 to capture the possible nonlocal impact such as the memory impact or any apparent delay in the covid-19 outbreak herein we use the death evolution 2e as an example hence the fde 2e containing the death probability of  while the other patients are cured is modified asdddt110tdtd which is the caputo fractional derivative 30 31 with order  0     1 note that all the other indexes 
1 
2 
3 and 
4 in model 2 are in the same range of 0 1 the caputo fractional derivate was selected here because the initial condition for caputo derivative takes the same form as that for the integer-order pde particularly the caputo derivative allows the utilization of initial values of the integer order with known physical interpretations when the order 1 model 2e reduces to the classical integer-order pde for the death evolution the fractional pde 2e is used here for two reasons first the evolution of deaths and cures may be characterized by a random process due to the fact that the exact time for the recovered person to be initially infected is unknown ie the patient that died or was cured today may have been diagnosed yesterday or last week second some patients may not be treated in time after being infected making the death toll evolve with a time memory therefore we extend the classical mass-balance equation of death cases using the fde to characterize the random property and memory impact embedded in the temporal evolution of mortality the fractional pde 2e and its classical version will be compared below using real observed data other complex seir models were also applied to model covid-19 spread such as the one proposed by tang et al 32 which has 12 ratesprobabilities and 8 groups of people in seir numerical results show that compared with the seir model 2 the complex model proposed by tang et al 32 with solutions shown by the dotted lines in fig 1
a accurately fits the observed data at the early stage but then overpredicts the spread of covid-19 observed after 2122020 the dynamics of transmission for covid-19 especially the recovery rate therefore changed over time in china likely due to the time-dependent conditions ie improvementsadjustments in medical care as mentioned above a dynamic time-local seir model therefore may be preferred for modeling covid-19 spread in china in addition compared to the fde 2e the best-fit solution using the classical pde dddti for death evolution see the black dotted line in fig 1
a slightly overestimates the late-time growth of mortality the actual death toll in hubei province grew slower than that estimated by a constant rate model indicating that the memory impact may affect the late-time dynamics of death and can be better captured by the fde 2e the best-fit solutions using model 2 fit the evolution of the infected and recovered populations well for the data recorded from hubei province and three large cities closely related such as in transportation or economic cooperation to wuhan china fig 1 the model was also shown to predict well the observed time series of covid-19 spread from 382020 to 3222020 for most places except for shanghai city fig 1
d this is likely due to the number of overseas covid-19 cases imported into shanghai whereby the number of cases were observed to increase rapidly after 332020 causing inconsistency in the affected population and failure of the model shanghai pudong international airport one of the two airports located in shanghai city is the eighth-busiest airport in the world and the busiest international gateway of mainland china when excluding the coronavirus cases imported from overseas model 2 predicts the covid-19 spread evolution data in shanghai fig 2
 therefore model 2 works well for various places in china that may not be experience a significant influx of imported cases as external sources can easily break the internal evolution especially the asymptotic status of covid-19 in china the resultant time-dependent recovery rate t is depicted in fig 3
 where the rate fitted by the latest observation data point within the fitting period ie 372020 remains stable in the following prediction period the best-fit recovery rate is the highest for shanghai except for the impulse of t for wenzhou as discussed below which is expected since shanghai has the best public health system of all of these cities contrarily hubei shows the lowest recovery rate likely due to its delayed response and the relatively limited public health capability at the beginning of the outbreak compared with shanghai wenzhou exhibits an impulse in the infection and recovery dynamics of coronavirus fig 1
b different from that observed for the other places studied herein on february 27 2020 the number of wenzhous infected people suddenly declined combined with the sudden increase of the number of people cured this abrupt change can be effectively captured by the seir model 2 with an impulse in the recovery rate t this recovery impulse is most likely due to a new hospital the no 2 affiliated hospital of wenzhou medical university recently built in this city in early february which significantly improved the public health system the first discharged cases of coronavirus from this hospital appeared in late february 2020 resulting in the sudden increase in the total recovery rate in addition a relatively large number of people working in wuhan returned to wenzhou in late january and it appears that the improved efficient screening process successfully identified the number of infected cases the new cases were 29000 from 1242020 to 1312020 in wenzhou with an average of 3600 new patients per day who were then immediately centralized for treatment it appears that this fast response helped to alleviate the spread of coronavirus in wenzhou the best-fit parameters of model 2 are listed in table 1
 and the initial values for each group of people are listed in table 2
 we reveal three behaviors in model parameters first the best-fit s-shaped recovery rate t fig 3 can be described by the sigmoid function ta1ebtc where a b and c are factors showing that the recovery rate increases exponentially before reaching a stable condition this increase is likely due to the fact that healthcare facility capabilities improved with time with an accelerating rate before reaching their asymptote or maximum capacity second the rates and probabilities r r
2 p and p
2 affecting the covid-19 transmissioninfection evolution slightly change in space and remain stable for a given site table 1 the small spatial fluctuation of these rates may be due to the similar strategies implemented by local governments for intervening and mitigating covid-19 spread ie full lockdowns across the country the time-invariant transmissioninfection rates for a given site indicate that the spreading rate of covid-19 may not significantly change over a short period of time for a given area with consistent intervening policies enacted third the model predictions show that it may take 47 14 25 and 11 days from 3142020 for the current infected population to drop below 1 of the cumulative infected population for hubei province and the cities of wenzhou shenzhen and shanghai respectively notably since the best-fit t increases in time the prediction using a constant  may overestimate the long-term future infection cases and underestimate the future recovery trend for covid-19 we also introduce an index c to quantify the infection severity of covid-19 at different places3cnimax where imax is the maximum number of cumulative infected people at the given site a smaller c represents a greater infection severity of coronavirus there is a power-law relationship between the regional population n and the maximum cumulated number of infected people imax fig 4
 this empirical formula may be used to approximate the largest cumulative number of infections which will be applied in the subsequent section for predicting the covid-19 evolution outside of china where the coronavirus infection has not yet reached its peak number of cases to decrease the acceleration of covid-19 spread the uss main propagated mode up to 3222020 has been the use of social distancing actions the predicted covid-19 spread in the us is plotted in fig 5
 there is a high uncertainty in the prediction of covid-19 evolution within the us considering the recent dramatic fluctuations in the number of infected people and the delayed screening during the beginning stages of the outbreak thus we must make assumptions and can only estimate the future coronavirus evolution in the us under specific scenarios based on the index of infection severity c in the representative areas of china we predict the us covid-19 evolution dynamics under two scenarios as shown in fig 5 
fig 5
a shows the possible spread of covid-19 in california us assuming that the coronavirus dynamics including the infectionrecovery rates and the infection severity are similar to those observed in hubei china the solid lines representing an optimistic scenario or can change quite differently the dashed lines representing a longer-term severe scenario the estimated total population of infection in california varies from 50000 to 200000 with the peak number of cases occurring around 20 to 50 days from 3222020 
fig 5
b shows the possible spread of covid-19 in the us solid lines represent model solutions assuming that covid-19 spreads similarly to that as observed in hubei china while the dashed lines are model solutions that assume covid-19 spreads differently the results show that the estimated total infected population varies from 700000 to 3000000 with the peak number of cases occurring 2050 days and the covid-19 outbreak lasting for 50 days from 3222020 respectively to decrease the acceleration of covid-19 spread italys mode is now similar to china lockdown of the full population the predicted covid-19 spread in italy is plotted in fig 6
a although italy has followed chinas mode of national isolation the number of infected people increased rapidly from 3142020 to 3192020 495 new cases per day to account for the delayed national quarantine compared with china we decrease the c index while also increasing the upper limit of the cumulative infection the covid-19 evolution prediction results show that there may be a turning point in the next two weeks when the current infected cases begin to decline we also separate the death toll from the number of recovered cases south koreas mode of combating the spread of covid-19 is through fast detection and tracking of the disease south korea is using efficient mobile diagnoses tests and accurate tracing of infected cases to maintain a low death rate even with a large infected population the mobile method can test 20000 people per day the maximum capability on 3122020 and apps for cell phones andor credit cards can accurately track the routes of infected people with the help of local government without an invasion of privacy so that warnings can be immediately delivered to the general population to obviate the places with high risk the current infected population may have passed its peak number of cases around 3202020 and the prediction shows that the covid-19 outbreak may be well controlled in 35 days from 3222020 fig 6
b japans mode of combating the spread of covid-19 is compatible with that of the us in addition to other changes such as enhanced educationoutreach and rapid treatment of the infected cases specific policies include social distancing which might be a key barrier to the spread of the novel coronavirus personal hygiene and quarantine of the infected cases the current data and modeling results fig 6
c show that japan has an efficient way so far to limit the maximum population infected and slow the spread of covid-19 while this outbreak may last for a while the random walk based stochastic model for covid-19 spread is analogous to a mixing-limited bimolecular reaction-based mechanismcondition 35 when a reactant a particle representing a susceptible individual a meets a reactant b particle representing an infectious person b a chemical reaction may occur if the collision energy is large enough to break the chemical bond meaning that the susceptible person a may be infected if satisfying additional criteria such as a and b are close enough and b touches hisher face after receiving coronavirus from a therefore the condition of a being infected is not deterministic but rather a random probability-controlled process this probability is related to various factors such as the duration that a and b are in contact the infectivity rate and the distance between the two people which may be characterized parsimoniously by the interaction radius r that controls the number of reactant pairs susceptible  infectious in a potential reaction infection 35 hence the core of the random walk stochastic model to simulate covid-19 spread is to define the interaction radius r the analogous development and similarities between bimolecular reactions and the sir model can also be seen from their governing equations the time-dependent sir model takes the form 364adstdttstitn

scenario 1 no special constraints assuming a city with 10000 people and 4 initial coronavirus cases this scenario does not put any constraints for any population we assume that the population distributes in the city randomly at the beginning and then moves randomly the spread of covid-19 is then simulated using the stochastic model proposed in section 41 
scenario 2 social distancing this scenario assumes that all people in the city maintain a social distance significantly decreasing the probability of infection 
scenario 3 attempted quarantine this scenario creates a forced quarantine for infected individuals before the outbreak which is expected to be the most efficient way of quarantine in the stochastic model we assume that 10 days after being infected the person will be removed because of being cured or expired dead this is because the median disease incubation period has been estimated to be 51 days 39 for simplicity purposes the interaction radius r 6 remains constant since the constant interaction radius was found to be able to efficiently capture the temporal variation of effective reaction rates in mixing controlled reaction experiments or simulations 35 37 the initial number of a and b particles is 10000 and 4 respectively the lagrangian solutions of the covid-19 outbreak for the three scenarios are depicted in fig 7
 modeling results for scenarios 1 2 and 3 show a peak in the curve of newly infected people at time t28 65 and 32 respectively demonstrating that the virus spreads the fastest for the scenario without mitigation constraints ie scenario 1 where the number of the total infected people or cases increases by one order of magnitude every 10 days in the rising limb as expected however the value for this peak scenario 1 198 people is lower than that for scenario 3 267 people although the total number of the infected people for scenario 1 9336 is slightly larger than scenario 3 9322 this may be due to a greater separation of infection cases for the higher number of initial coronavirus carriers in scenario 1 which causes a lower and relatively flatter covid-19 evolution peak compared to that of scenario 3 scenario 2 has the lowest peak value 121 people and the most-delayed peak in the curve for new cases and the total infection time is almost doubled compared to the other two scenarios indicating that people living with strict social distancing may also suffer from a much longer period of covid-19 threat it is also noteworthy that the overall trend of the solution simulation of scenario 1 initial surge without special constraints fig 7
a is similar to that for italy which had a delayed response to the covid-19 outbreak initially fig 6
a and scenario 3 solution a lower peak value and a longer duration due to social distancing fig 7
b is similar to that observed in japan where social distancing actions have been implemented fig 6
c the simulated particle plumes plotted in fig 8
reveal the subtle discrepancy between the three mitigation scenarios scenario 1 assumes that four initial cases were initially located on the right side of the city while the whole population 10000 susceptible persons was distributed randomly in the 1  1 domain fig 8
a the trajectory of each person is assumed to follow two-dimensional brownian motion with retention described by eq 7 to capture the random vector for each displacement and the random waiting time between two consecutive motions described by the time fractional derivative term in eq 7 the virus moved quickly from east to west figs 8
b and 8
c spreading over the entire city before all the infected people were cured or expired dead at time t69 fig 8
d a total of 664 susceptible people 66 of the total population distributed randomly around the city were never infected 
scenario 2 assumes that social distancing can reduce the infection probability which can be characterized by a smaller reaction rate or a smaller interaction radius in our lagrangian approach the virus was spreading at a much lower rate from west to east than that in scenario 1 figs 8
e8g reaching a stable condition ie  of cases neither increasing or decreasing at a later time t125 and leaving more susceptible people unaffected 2734 total which is 273 of the population therefore social distancing is effective in limiting the spread of coronavirus among people note however this scenario assumes that every person in this city strictly maintains social distancing otherwise a surge of infections may occur the same way as that shown in scenario 1 
scenario 3 assumes self-quarantine notably not all of the infected people can be effectively quarantined due to the following 1 people can be infected without coronavirus symptoms 2 people in the incubation period can transmit the infection and 3 limited health care facilities and capabilities for the large influx of patients for example according to imai et al 40 many infected people could not be appropriately screened initially in wuhan city china under this condition we assume that 50 of people infected and diagnosed are immediately quarantined while the remaining infected people fig 8
i can still cause the spread of coronavirus figs 8
j8l self-quarantine therefore may not be as effective as maintained social distancing fractional calculus provides a useful tool to modeling complex dynamics in biology and this study extended the fde for modeling the coronavirus outbreak the covid-19 is a pandemic radically impacting our lives by altering our daily patterns and interactions in an unprecedented way and rate a time-dependent seir model with built-in fde components motivated by the coronavirus milestone of recording zero new local infections in china on 3192020 was applied to capture the covid-19 evolution observed over the last three months in china a stochastic model built upon the time fde for random resting times of people was also proposed to evaluate non-pharmaceutical mitigation options three main conclusions are presented by this study first different properties in the covid-19 spreading in china data up to 3222020 exhibited different kinetics and the death evolution can be captured by the time fde model fitting showed that the recovery rate of covid-19 increases with time due to various human factors the fast-increasing recovery rate caused the rapid decline of the current infected population curve removing the possible memory impact and any delayed processes which does not require a time-nonlocal model such as the time fde contrarily the evolution of deaths in china italy south korea and japan can be captured well by the time fde likely due to the time memory in the death toll it is also noteworthy that the time fde version of the seir model might be needed if the late-time recovery rate declines due to the change of coronavirus properties affected by the change of climate public policy andor possible evolution of the virus itself and the contiguous mannerrate second the updated seir model provided predictions although with high uncertainty for covid-19 evolution within china and for other countries for example the improved seir model showed that if the infection and recovery rates remain stable the number of cumulative infections is likely to decline to 1 of the total infected population within one month from 3222020 in china the overseas imported cases however may break the internal asymptotic status and significantly postpone the ending time of covid-19 in china predictions using the validated seir model also showed different evolution dynamics of covid-19 within populations of the united states italy japan and south korea for example it may take at least 23 months for the current infected population to drop below 1 of the cumulative infected population in the us requiring more efficient mitigation strategies while south korea may control the covid-19 spread in a relatively shorter period however these predictions contain high uncertainty due to uncertainty in the maximum infected population and changes of transmissioninfection and recovery rates among different countries third a stochastic model based on the lagrangian scheme for the time fdes analogous to a mixing-limited reaction mechanism model showed that self-quarantine may not be as effective as strict social distancing since not all the infected people can be diagnosed and immediately quarantined while strict social distancing can apparently slow covid-19 spread the pandemic may last longer this is another case that fractional calculus may be used to explore covid-19 outbreak therefore one of the main contributions of this study is to extend the application of fdes to model dynamics and mitigation scenarios of the coronavirus spread yong zhang conceptualization methodology

the vaccine efficacy has to be at least 60 when vaccination coverage is 100 reproduction number r 0 25-35 this vaccine efficacy threshold rises to 70 when coverage drops to 75 and up to 80 when coverage drops to 60 when r 0 is 25 rising to 80 when coverage drops to 75 when r 0 is 35 to extinguish an ongoing epidemic the vaccine efficacy has to be at least 60 when coverage is 100 and at least 80 when coverage drops to 75 to reduce the peak by 85-86 61-62 and 32 when vaccination occurs after 5 15 and 30 of the population have already been exposed to covid-19 coronavirus a vaccine with an efficacy between 60 and 80 could still obviate the need for other measures under certain circumstances such as much higher and in some cases potentially unachievable vaccination coverages conclusions this study found that the vaccine has to have an efficacy of at least 70 to prevent an epidemic and of at least 80 to largely extinguish an epidemic without any other measures eg social distancing 3 with the continuing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and much of the us having implemented social distancing measures and other non-pharmaceutical interventions eg wearing masks owing to the lack of alternatives there has been a push for efforts to develop a vaccine however as these vaccine development efforts progress it is not yet clear what vaccine efficacies are necessary to achieve this goal with a vaccine alone thereby eliminating the need for measures such as social distancing as described previously 12 it is important to determine efficacy thresholds to aim for early on and during a vaccines development this can help identify the best candidates for different roles eg vaccines that can prevent or extinguish an epidemic versus reduce the impact of an epidemic to help guide resource allocation and also properly manage expectations once each vaccine reaches the market currently there are 16 vaccine candidates under clinical phase i-ii evaluation and more than 100 preclinical candidate vaccines are in the immunization pipeline 3-6 in order to help establish the ideal goals for the vaccine efficacies needed to prevent and extinguish a covid-19 coronavirus epidemic the team developed a computational simulation model representing the us population the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and the impact of a vaccine under various conditions methods using microsoft excel version 16 with the crystal ball add-in the team developed a computational transmission clinical and economics outcomes model in 2020 representing the us population 357157434 people and their different interactions with each other as well as 4 the spread of sars-cov-2 and the potential health and economic outcomes 7 the model appendix figure 1  advances in discrete 1-day time steps for 25 years which is the longest epidemic duration in the scenarios evaluated in this study on any given day each individual in the model is in 1 of 5 mutually exclusive sars-cov-2 states 1 susceptible s not infected and able to become infected 2 exposed e infected but not able to transmit to others 3 infectious and asymptomatic i a  infected but without symptoms and able to transmit to others 4 infectious and symptomatic i s  infected showing symptoms and able to transmit to others or 5 recoveredimmune r not infected and unable to become infected on day 1 a set number of individuals start in the i a state and i s state ie coronavirus seed with the remainder starting in the s state each day individuals interact with each other and a person that is infectious can potentially transmit the virus to a person who is susceptible if a susceptible person comes in contact with an infectious person and is exposed they move from the s state to the e state the following equation determines the number of susceptible individuals who became exposed each day   s  i s    05  s  i a  beta  equals the basic reproduction number r 0  the average number of secondary cases generated by 1 infectious case divided by the infectious period duration and the number of individuals in the population s and i represent the number of susceptible and infectious individuals respectively on any given day exposed individuals remain in the e state for the latent period duration ie time between exposure and ability to transmit before becoming infectious and moving to the i state at a rate of 1latent period duration as individuals can transmit the virus prior to disease onset 8 they could transmit 1 day prior to the start of symptoms each individual moving to the i state has a probability of being symptomatic which governs if they are in the i s or i a state each person in the model draws an infectious period duration from a distribution range4-15 days including the day prior to 5 symptom onset infectious individuals remain in the i state until they recover and are no longer infectious moving from the i state to the r state at the rate of 1infectious period duration vaccination occurs when different percentages of the population have been exposed to sars-cov-2 during the epidemic varying with scenario and protects in two different ways by preventing infection and by preventing symptomatic disease ie reducing viral shedding individuals who are vaccinated move into the v state each day vaccinated individuals mix with others and if they come in contact with an infectious person they move to the e state when the vaccine prevents infection individuals in the e state will move to the r state based on the vaccine efficacy individuals for whom the vaccine is not effective move to either the i a state or i s state when the vaccine reduces viral shedding it reduces their probability of moving to the i s state based on the vaccine efficacy effectively vaccinated individuals in the e state move to the i a state where they transmit at a lower rate for example   05 vaccination is defined as the timepoint at which onset of protection occurs eg if onset is 2 weeks after vaccination vaccination start date occurs 2 weeks prior to simulated day and that the vaccine had no impact on individuals who had already been infected or exposed to sars-cov-2 each symptomatically infected person ie covid-19 case travels through a probability tree to determine their clinical outcomes with all of the probabilities and outcomes being age-specific appendix figure 1b  7 an infected person showing symptoms starts with a mild infection and has a probability of seeking ambulatory care or calling their physician ie telephone consult this person then has a probability of progressing to severe disease requiring hospitalization if this person has only mild illness and is not hospitalized they self-treat with over-the-counter 6 medications and miss school or work for the duration of symptoms if this person is hospitalized they have a probability of developing severe pneumonia or severe non-pneumonia symptoms and a probability of intensive care unit admission this patient then has a probability of having either sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome with or without sepsis if this patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome they require the use of a ventilator if the person is hospitalized they have a probability of dying from covid-19 complications the person accrues relevant costs and health effects as they travel through the model the third-party payer perspective includes direct costs eg ambulatory care hospitalization and the societal perspective includes direct and indirect ie productivity losses due to absenteeism and mortality costs hourly wage across all occupations 9 serves as a proxy for productivity losses absenteeism results in productivity losses for the duration of symptoms all covid-19 cases accrue productivity losses regardless of age or employment status as everyone is assumed to contribute to society death results in the net present value of productivity losses for missed lifetime earnings based on annual wage 9 for the years of life lost based on an individuals life expectancy 10 the appendix and appendix table 1 describes the model inputs along with their values distributions and data sources this study evaluated the impact of introducing a vaccine with varying efficacies in the absence of other measures from the third-party payer and societal perspectives the overall goal of this study was to identify the vaccine efficacy thresholds above which vaccination could prevent a wave of the epidemic or extinguish an ongoing wave epidemic across a range of possible scenarios rather than predict exactly what will happen with the current pandemic predicting the 7 specific course of the pandemic can be challenging with such variable social distancing measures being applied and limited data on the actual spread of the virus therefore the team ran ranges of possible epidemic scenarios that varied r 0 and the proportion of the population that has already been exposed to sars-cov-2 prior to vaccination onset in doing so the aim was to represent the spectrum of possibilities if social distancing measures were relaxed completely the initial scenario assumes an epidemic with no vaccination whereas experimental scenarios consisted of vaccinating individuals to either prevent infection or prevent symptomatic disease sensitivity analyses varied the vaccine efficacy 20-100 population coverage those vaccinated and those otherwise immune 50-100 percentage of the population exposed prior to vaccination onset 0-30 and r 0 25-35 11-13 additional scenarios varied the probability of an infected individual being asymptomatic from the distribution in appendix table 1 to 35 and the infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals 05-1 compared with symptomatic individuals 14 experiments consisted of 1000 trial monte carlo simulations varying each parameter throughout its distribution appendix table 1  table 1 presents the results of the initial scenario ie no vaccination showing the number of cases clinical outcomes resources used and costs incurred over the epidemic duration when r 0 is 25 an epidemic results in 2825 million total sars-cov-2 cases and a higher r 0 of 35 results in 3129 million total cases results no vaccine vaccine efficacy needed to prevent an epidemic these scenarios determine what would happen if vaccination took place at the very early stage of the epidemic or prior to a second or subsequent wave the question then is whether vaccination can prevent a peak from occurring figure 1 shows how vaccine efficacy x-axis and coverage those vaccinated and those otherwise immune can reduce the size of the peak ie maximum number of daily sars-cov-2 infections y-axis in terms of percentage reduction of what the peak would be without vaccination as figure 1a shows vaccine efficacy has to be at least 60 when it prevents infection to reduce the peak by 99 ie number of new cases per day never exceeds the initial number of cases on day 1 when r 0 is 25 and vaccination coverage is 100 this vaccine efficacy threshold rises to 70 when coverage drops to 75 and up to 80 when coverage drops to 60 when coverage drops to 50 it is no longer possible to eliminate the peak even when vaccine efficacy is 100 of course eliminating the peak does not necessarily mean there will be no cases as infection can continue to occur at a stable level figure 2 shows how the vaccine efficacy x-axis impacts the total number of sars-cov-2 cases averted yaxis compared with no vaccination over the simulated period as figure 2 shows when vaccination coverage is 100 the number of cases averted plateaus after the vaccine efficacy reaches and exceeds 60 which is consistent with the threshold identified to eliminate the peak similarly when vaccination coverage is 75 cases averted plateau after vaccine efficacy reaches and exceeds 70 resulting in 90760 symptomatic cases appendix table 2  when r 0 is 35  figures 1a and 2a appendix table 2  vaccine efficacy has to be at least 60 to reduce the peak by 99 when vaccination coverage is 100 this vaccine efficacy threshold increases to 80 when coverage drops to 75 these vaccine efficacy and vaccination coverage thresholds are also the same thresholds at which the number of cases averted plateaus  figure   9 2a when coverage drops to 60 it is no longer possible to eliminate the peak even with 100 vaccine efficacy  figure 1a  if the vaccine only reduced viral shedding  figure 3a  even a 100 vaccine efficacy with 100 coverage of the population is not enough to eliminate the peak and still results in a total of 1229-2398 million sars-cov-2 cases during the epidemic when r 0 is 25-35 as figure 3b shows when individuals have a 35 probability of being asymptomatic and are equally infectious as symptomatic cases vaccine efficacy has to be at least 40 to reduce the peak by 100 when r 0 is 25 and vaccination coverage is 100 this efficacy threshold rises to 60 when coverage drops to 75 and to 100 when coverage drops to 60 the number of cases averted also plateaus after reaching and exceeding these vaccine efficacy and coverage thresholds  figure 3b  the next set of scenarios evaluated what would occur if vaccinating during the course of an epidemic and to what degree vaccination could extinguish the epidemic this would correspond to rolling out a vaccine at various points during an epidemic again figures 1b-d and 2b-d show how vaccine efficacy and coverage can reduce the size of the peak and impact the total number of sars-cov-2 cases averted compared with no vaccination when different percentages of the population have already been exposed to sars-cov-2 assuming that natural infection incurs immunity table 1 shows the clinical and economic outcomes as shown in figure 1b  when vaccination prevents infection and occurs after 5 of the population has already been exposed the peak can only be reduced by at the most 86 when r 0 is 25 vaccine efficacy has 10 to be at least 60 to reduce the peak by 85 when coverage is 100 this vaccine efficacy threshold increases to 80 when coverage drops to 75 86 reduction and 100 when coverage drops to 60 85 reduction however while reducing the peak the number of cases averted continues to increase not reaching the maximum until both vaccine efficacy and coverage are 100  figure 2b  when vaccination occurs after 15 of the population has already been exposed the resulting reduction in the peak is at most 65 as figure 1c shows the reduction in the peak size plateaus after vaccine efficacy reaches and exceeds 60 with a 100 coverage and 80 with a 75 coverage however the number of cases averted continues to accrue with increases in efficacy until reaching the maximum when both vaccine efficacy and coverage are 100  figure 2c  figure 2d  the lines for various coverage levels move closer together and are lower on the y-axis at most the peak can be reduced by 39 when vaccination occurs after 30 of the population has already been exposed while increases in efficacy result in similar reductions in the peak size eg with a 50 coverage a 40 vaccine efficacy reduces the peak by 27 and an 80 efficacy reduces it by 31 reductions in the number of cases averted continue to accrue  figure 2d  when r 0 is 35 vaccination cannot reduce the peak by more than 91 71 and 46 when vaccination occurs after 5 15 and 30 of the population has already been exposed respectively as figure 1b -d shows the reduction in the peak size starts to plateau as vaccine 11 efficacy reaches and exceeds 60 when vaccination coverage is 100 and 80 when coverage drops to 75 when coverage drops to 50 and 5 of the population has been exposed it is no longer possible to extinguish an ongoing epidemic even when vaccine efficacy is 100 again increasing efficacy continues to avert cases except when vaccination occurs after 5 of the population have already been exposed when vaccine efficacy reaches and exceeds 80 when coverage is 100  figure 2b-d  as shown in figure 3c  when individuals have a 35 probability of being asymptomatic and are as infectious as symptomatic cases vaccination when 15 of the population has already been exposed can reduce the peak at most by 67 vaccine efficacy has to be at least 60 to reduce the peak by 61 when r 0 is 25 and vaccination coverage is 100 and 70 when vaccination coverage drops to 75 61 reduction this study found that in the absence of other interventions to prevent an epidemic the vaccine has to have an efficacy ie probability of preventing infection of at least 70 when vaccination covers at least 75 of the population to extinguish an ongoing epidemic and obviate the need for any other measures eg social distancing the vaccine has to have an efficacy of at least 80 with a 75 vaccine coverage these efficacy and coverage thresholds hold as the proportion of the population exposed increases from 5 to 30 at which point the peak of the epidemic is rapidly approached as more and more people become exposed and immune achieving a 75 coverage is not trivial although recent poll by reutersipsos of 1215 american adults found that 75 of respondents would get a coronavirus vaccine if assured it 12 was safe 15 even if enough people were willing to get the vaccine there would have to be sufficient production capacity vaccination supplies and staffing as well as an adequate supply chain to reach everyone there are circumstances in which a vaccine with an efficacy between 40 and 70 could prevent an epidemic and between 60 and 80 could extinguish an ongoing epidemic but these would require a-potentially unachievable-100 coverage of the population all of this suggests that a vaccine alone may not allow everything to immediately return to normal ie stop social distancing unless both vaccine efficacy and vaccination coverage are fairly high therefore it will be important to manage the expectations of the public who may believe that no more social distancing will be needed as soon as a vaccine becomes available 16-20 especially if that vaccine has an efficacy below the 70-80 range of course this does not mean that a vaccine with a lower efficacy may not be useful for example a vaccine could also help reduce the burden on the healthcare system so that it is not overwhelmed eg a vaccine efficacy of 40 could prevent 28 million patients from requiring a ventilator and 895 million hospital bed days additionally vaccination could be combined with other control measures eg testtrace-isolate mandatory masking a vaccine with a lower efficacy could also be used for targeted vaccination eg response to a local outbreak or to protect certain groups as this study shows even if a vaccine does not prevent or extinguish an epidemic it can still save a considerable number of lives hospitalizations and costs the focus of the study however was not on measuring the cost effectiveness of the vaccine which may be addressed in future studies limitations all models by definition are simplifications of real life and cannot account for every possible outcome 29 model inputs drew from various sources and new data on sars-cov-2 continue to emerge for example estimates of r 0 vary widely and in many studies are calculated considering only symptomatic infections 11 12 13 as the course of an actual sars-cov-2 epidemic may not be very predictable this study explored a range of possible scenarios and parameter values in sensitivity analyses additionally individuals mixed equally with each other when in actuality transmission and thus vaccinations impact may be higher among closer contacts raising the possibility that targeted vaccination approaches may have higher impact simulation experiments assumed an optimistic situation in which the population was vaccinated in 1 day in reality vaccination would take place over an extended period of time which would reduce the impact of vaccination moreover assumptions about levels of herd immunity required may depend on differing individual susceptibility to sars-cov-2 the model also assumes that there are sufficient healthcare resources eg intensive care unit beds and ventilators for all patients  introduction given the continuing coronavirus disease 2019 covid- 19 pandemic and much of the us

not allow everything to immediately return to normal ie stop social distancing unless both vaccine efficacy and vaccination coverage are fairly high therefore it will be important to manage the expectations of the public who may believe that no more social distancing will be needed as soon as a vaccine becomes available 16 17 18 19 20 especially if that vaccine has an efficacy below the 70-80 range of course this does not mean that a vaccine with a lower efficacy may not be useful for example a vaccine could also help reduce the burden on the healthcare system so that it is not overwhelmed eg a vaccine efficacy of 40 could prevent 28 million patients from requiring a ventilator and 895 million hospital bed days additionally vaccination could be combined with other control measures eg testtrace-isolate mandatory masking a vaccine with a lower efficacy could also be used for targeted vaccination eg response to a local outbreak or to protect certain groups as this study shows even if a vaccine does not prevent or extinguish an epidemic it can still save a considerable number of lives hospitalizations and costs the focus of the study however was not on measuring the cost effectiveness of the vaccine which may be addressed in future studies no financial disclosures were reported by the authors of this paper prevents infection compared to no vaccination varying

such as increased attention to hygiene and avoiding crowds can reduce disease spread awareness also supports rapid identification and treatment of new cases and facilitates collective responses such as closures of schools or transit systems 1  in the modern world diseases can move faster than ever due to the growing movement of people between cities regions and countries however digital technology means information can move even faster providing an opportunity for individuals and communities to protect themselves ahead of the disease itself arriving 2 this study considers the spread and persistence of public awareness of the novel wuhan coronavirus which emerged in late 2019 during the first few weeks of this outbreak there was little coverage from mainstream media outlets providing an unusual opportunity to study the spread of awareness of an emerging disease via other channels previous studies show that the spread of awareness is strongly related to the physical locations of individuals in a social network in relation to the unfolding events 2 3 4  termed the social distance effect in online social networks people with more connections tend to receive earlier warnings of catastrophic events for example in hurricane sandy in the usa twitter users with more followers had an awareness lead-time of up to 26 hours than less connected users 4  moreover the magnitude of awareness increases over decreasing distances to the epidemic centers for example public awareness in weibo a chinese social media platform was two orders of magnitude stronger for the h7n9 influenza outbreak that occurred in china than the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov outbreak that occurred elsewhere 5  experience of similar events such as outbreaks of h5ni influenza in 2001 sars severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 h1n1 influenza in 2009 and ebola in 2014 is also likely to influence awareness in china the outbreak of sars between 2003 and 2004 caused a total of 7429 reported cases and 685 deaths 6  and had a lasting traumatic impact on survivors and communities 7 8  in this work we set out to test whether public awareness of the new disease outbreak is related to social distance from the centre of the epidemic and past experience of the sars epidemic in 2003 the sars outbreak was 17 years ago but its horror might still condition public awareness of lethal infectious diseases to the best of our knowledge few studies were carried out to understand how past severe outbreaks affect public awareness when a new outbreak occurs this study estimates the post-sars effect called sars memory effect on the current outbreak we use the continuing wuhan coronavirus outbreak as our case study to estimate the effects of social distance and sars memory on the spread of public awareness in late 2019 a new coronavirus designated as covid-19 was identified in wuhan the capital of chinas hubei province 9  as of february 1st 2020 the virus has caused approximately 11184 cases and 258 deaths in 21 countries with the majority of cases in mainland china 10  the first symptoms were reported on december 1st 2019 11  but there was no solid evidence of human-to-human transmission until january 10 th  2020 when a patient who did not travel to wuhan became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four family members 12  however there was little information available to the public until an official announcement about human-to-human transmission of the virus on january 20 th  2020 13  wuhan city long known as the nine provinces thoroughfare  is in the central part of china serving as a major transportation hub transiting more than 120 million passengers every year 14  the massive numbers of transits provided a perfect opportunity for the virus to spread another feature is the timing of the outbreak close to the spring festival travel season chunyun  which started on january 10 th  2020 while the virus spread across almost all provinces 16 cities had been locked down by january 23 rd  2020 15  accordingly this study focuses on the time period between december 15 th  2019 and jan 23 rd  2020 seeking epidemic-related information online can provide an indicator of public awareness of this new disease in this study we use the baidu search index bsi available publicly at httpindexbaiducom to measure the public awareness over time and locations eg city the total number of internet users using the baidu search engine reached 649 million in 2014 accounting for 479 of the national population 16  bsi has been used to predict epidemic outbreak 17  hivaids incidence 18 and tourism flows 19  suggesting bsi can provide a representative proxy for public awareness bsi provides a weighted index for each search term in this study we used the term wuhan pneumonia   as the public has widely used we also tried novel coronavirus  and wuhan outbreak  but the former did not exhibit a search surge and the latter was not indexed by baidu due to the privacy concern baidu masks daily readings that are below 57 as zero therefore we used the maximum bsi value of the search term common cold  between dec 10 th and 31 th  2019 to control the size effect for each city we use the ljung-box test 20 to estimate whether or not the daily readings of common cold are stationary as a result the daily readings of 18 out of 364 cities were found to be non-stationary so they were excluded from this study the magnitude of public awareness of the wuhan outbreak over time and city  1   346 can be represented as the earliest day the magnitude of public awareness exceeds the arbitrary thresholds  15 2 3 4 is defined as the earliest warning day    for city  we also define the starting day of chunyun as   indicating the onset day when it is likely the virus would reach all cities as chunyun transited approximately 3 billion million passengers in 40 days in 2019 21  crowded transport hubs create perfect opportunities for the virus to spread therefore the earlier the lead-time awareness the better for infection control the lead-time of awareness for city is thus defined as awareness typically follows a cyclical process called the unaware-aware-unaware uau process as time passes keeping the public at a high level of awareness could help mitigate the virus transmission process therefore we also measure the awareness retention rate as the average of magnitude from the next day of   to the day of chunyun over the magnitude at    microblogs eg weibo and private social media eg wechat are the primary communication tools used by most chinese people 16  while information flows cannot be observed directly empirical studies show that social networks are influenced by long distance travel 22 we therefore use migration flows as a proxy for long-distance information flows to be more specific if workers born and raised in city a now work in city b they are likely to relate information about an epidemic in city b back to friends and family in city a this is particularly relevant in the chinese context where migrant workers account for more than one-third of the working population 23  is the

the network does not include hong kong macau and taiwan as the baidu migration matrix does not include them we use the migration flows extracted from the baidu migration matrix bmm to build a migration network fig 1  we then compute the shortest steps between any city to wuhan deriving the variable social distances for city as  1 8  wuhan and the cities located in hubei province have  1

has     1 macau and taiwan both have frequent traffic flows to hong kong 24  so we added   2 and   2 we collected all reported sars cases in mainland china hong kong taiwan and macau and assign the numbers of cases to each city as   1   346 the values range between zero no reported cases and 2521    with an average of 708 and a median of 4 cases in cities with at least one case reported we then use the logarithm as most cities reported zero cases of sars resulting in we build three groups of regression models to estimate the effects of social distance and sars memory on public awareness

under direct control of the central government are also labelled as  1 those sub-provincial and above cities have much better facilities and expertise for infection control than other cities 25  so we assume residents could be more alert is used to control the effects of administrative level we also introduce euclidean distances as a control variable denoted as  all data necessary to replicate the

outbreak fig 2b  however awareness then decreased until jan 19 th  2020 one day before the chinese centre for disease control and prevention confirmed human-to-human transmissions of the novel coronavirus since jan 20 th  2020 overall awareness has increased by a magnitude of at least five demonstrating significant awareness across all cities fig 2b  awareness remained low as the epidemic spread falling close to its lowest point on the starting day of chunyun jan 10 th  2020 considering cities that showed initial novel coronavirus awareness levels at least 15 times that of the search

emerging catastrophic events until they are told by their social contacts they remain aware during the event and awareness then fades subsequently 2 26  however during the wuhan outbreak the public experienced a process as aware-unaware-aware with public awareness declining during the early phase of the outbreak dividing cities into two groups of equal size according to the numbers of reported sars cases we found the cities that had been struck by sars to be more alert  p  005  during onset 2b therefore we believe the sars memory still conditions public awareness we provide evidence of its

substantial lead-time advantage are those either closed to wuhan in terms of social distances or struck by the sars outbreak for example changchun in jilin province with 34 sars cases and far away from wuhan still achieved a ten days lead-time advantage the cities that did not exhibit awareness such as qaramay and heihe are mainly located far away from wuhan and did not suffer from the sars

lost awareness before chunyun while four cities developed greater awareness xilingol league in inner mongolia ranked 4 th  with a retention rate at 103 xilingol is far away from wuhan in terms of social distance but it was struck by sars it is worth noting that a confirmed case of plague was reported in xilingol on nov 16 th  2019 only 45 days before the wuhan outbreak the effects of social distance and sars memory on the lead-time advantage are estimated according to eq 4 controlled by euclidean distances gdp per capita and the citys administrative level table 1  we found that in model 3 in table 1 exhibits positive effects while shows a negative association with awareness that means cities of strong sars memory and which are closer to wuhan in terms of social distances develop early awareness moreover the interaction term  exhibits negative effects indicating that the sars memory effect becomes stronger where cities are closer to wuhan in terms of social distances while controlling the model with euclidean distances model 5 in table 1  we found that sars memory effect becomes non-significant but social distance and its interaction with sars memory hold meanwhile euclidean distances effect are non-significant even though it exhibits negative effect alone in model 4 in table 1  we further control the model with gdp per capita and administrative level model 6  7 in table  1  model 6 is more favorable than model 7 because the former achieves slightly lower aic scores akaikes information criteria 27 at 1893132 with fewer degrees of freedom df  8 than the latter aic  1894160 df  9 in model 6 in table 1  we found that both social distance and euclidean distances exhibit negative effects but the social distance effects decrease almost half compared to model 5 in table 1  the sars memory effects hold also the interaction term  is still significant which means cities of stronger sars memory will develop more lead-time advantage particularly when they are closer to wuhan gdp per capita and the binary variable exhibit significant positive effects on the lead-time advantage lead-time    30  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a

we control by euclidean distances gdp per capita and the administrative level model 5 and 6 in table 2  those effects still hold moreover the effects of administrative level and development level both exhibit positive effects on the magnitude of awareness we hypothesize that residents with better education proxied by gdp per capita better understand the danger of deadly infectious diseases and

weak adj 2  0104 it seems the decreasing awareness is a collective behavior that occurred simultaneously interestingly social distances have a significant effect while the euclidean distances do not

preprint in which was not certified by peer review preprint  the wuhan coronavirus outbreak is still striking china with thousands of cases and dozens of deaths reported every day from this study we found that the spread of public awareness varies markedly across chinese cities through controlling for development administrative levels and euclidean distances we observe cities that were struck by sars and have more migration to the epicentre wuhan showed earlier stronger and more durable public awareness of the outbreak moreover 48 cities had developed public awareness as early as dec 31 st  2019 with up to 19 days of lead-time advantage against some other 255 cities the study suggests that memory of previous events as well as social links to an emerging threat may influence public behaviour greater awareness could help slow the spread of a disease for example through increased attention to hygiene mask-wearing and reduced interpersonal contact it might also facilitate collective responses such as enforced quarantine measures however in some circumstances enhanced awareness could have negative impacts such as unnecessary panic or ostracism of groups perceived as being at greater risk of infection due to the lack of infection statistics we cannot yet statistically estimate the effect of public awareness on the subsequent seriousness of the outbreak we note that xilingol league in inner mongolia which had relatively stronger and more durable public awareness had fewer cases two cases as reported at feb 7 th  2020 10  than other cities in the same province totally 50 cases with an average of 455 cases per city 10  to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to investigate how memory of previous catastrophic events eg sars and social distances could affect the spread of public awareness further studies will be needed to understand whether this holds in other context beyond the unusual and tragic circumstances of the noel

activities work and travel behaviour evidence from longitudinal data in the netherlands mathijs de haas roel faber marije hamersma -marije nl hamersmaminienw  covid-19 has massively affected the lives of people all over the world this paper presents first insights in current and potential future effects of the virus and the dutch governments intelligent lockdown on peoples activities and travel behaviour findings are based on a representative sample of about 2500 respondents from the netherlands mobility panel mpn we show that approximately 80 of people reduced their activities outdoors with a stronger decrease for older people 44 of workers started or increased the amount of hours working from home and 30 have more remote meetings most of these workers report positive experiences students and school pupils however are mostly not happy with following education from home furthermore the amount of trips and distance travelled dropped by 55 and 68 respectively when compared to the fall of 2019 so-called roundtrips eg a walking or cycling tour gained in popularity people are currently more positive towards the car and far more negative towards public transport changes in outdoor activities seem to be temporal with over 90 of people who currently reduced their outdoor activities not expecting to continue this behaviour in the future after corona however 27 of home-workers expect to work from home more often in the future in addition 20 of people expect to cycle and walk more and 20 expect to fly less in the future these findings show that the coronavirus crisis might result in structural behavioural changes although future longitudinal analyses are needed to observe these possible structural effects countries have taken drastic measures to contain the outbreak in europe several countries such as france and italy have implemented national lockdowns limiting all nonessential travel other countries such as sweden were less strict and still allowed for people to visit bars restaurants or go to school in the netherlands the government implemented its socalled intelligent lockdown at the time of this study people were urged to leave their homes as little as possible and work from home furthermore bars restaurants schools gyms and contact professions were closed and visiting people in nursing homes was not allowed even though people were urged to stay home they were still allowed to move around freely as long as they journal pre-proof j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f  in wuhan china an outbreak of pneumonia was detected in december 2019 it has since been identified as a novel and contagious coronavirus which is now named covid-19 zhu et al 2020  after spreading around the world at an alarming rate the world health organization who declared covid-19 as a pandemic on the 11 th of march 2020 who 2020  governments are taking unprecedented measures to limit the spread of the virus with the aim of eventually containing this pandemic as such covid-19 has massively affected the lives of people all over the world kept a distance of 15m to others this instruction was strictly enforced within the limits of available police forces and offenders were fined 390 the societal impacts of both the virus and the measures taken to reduce its spread are severe the circumstances result in a unique situation in which people have had to change their daily life radically often within the span of days or weeks peoples activity patterns the way they work and how they travel are three facets of daily life that have changed drastically from both a research and policy point of view it is important to assess how people respond to these externally induced changes and how these immediate impacts might lead to structural behavioural changes research has shown that people are creatures of habit daily travel behaviour particularly depends on habit and routine schnfelder  axhausen 2010  therefore changes in behaviour do not occur often however several studies have shown that there are certain events in peoples life course that trigger change in travel behaviour mggenburg et al 2015 schoenduwe et al 2015  schfer et al 2012 describe these life events as windows of opportunity to change peoples habitual routines earlier research has for instance shown that changing jobs leads to a mode shift towards the car oakil et al 2011 and that people tend to shift to a travel pattern in which mainly car and walking trips are made de haas et al 2018 scheiner  holz-rau 2013  other research shows that not only travel patterns but also activity patterns are less stable after such events hilgert et al 2018  besides changing behaviour themselves after certain life events research has also shown that people are more susceptible to interventions after these events anable 2013 verplanken  roy 2016  the current lockdown situation may be a similar game changer having comparable effects on behaviour as life events with the exception that it occurs for society as a whole and that it is externally induced breaking habits without an external life event is shown to be difficult dean 2013 showed that the length of time required to create new habitual behaviour depends on the type of new behaviour one wants to learn forming habits for relatively simple activities such as drinking a glass of water with breakfast is much easier than forming habits for more difficult activities such as incorporating an activity like jogging into a daily pattern furthermore sigurdardottir et al 2013 revealed the importance of both positive and negative experiences for example it was easier for people to make cycling part of their daily routine if they had more positive experiences with cycling when they were young trying out new activities can help in adopting new habits as this experience may show that obstacles that were initially envisioned for instance that cycling requires too much effort or is unsafe turn out to be untrue strmberg  karlsson 2016  as people in the netherlands and many other countries now have to follow directives to stay at home many are now forming experiences with new behaviour these experiences might affect future behaviour long after the virus itself is no longer a threat people might for instance prefer to work from home in the future now that they have experienced what it is like to work from home experiences with these new types of activities and ways of travelling and external factors related to covid-19 and governmental measures could have an influence on peoples attitudes as well the relationship between attitudes and travel behaviour has been studied extensively and it has been shown that attitudes indeed play a role in mode choice behaviour grling et al 1998 paulssen et al 2014  the influence of attitudes on mode choice behaviour was found to be particularly strong in cases where habit is weak verplanken et al 1994  this is particularly interesting in the light of the current covid-19 situation as many people are forced to at least temporarily break their habits it may be expected that attitudes have changed as a result of covid-19 people might for instance have a more negative attitude towards shared travel modes due to the fear that they might become infected with the virus when using these modes if this change in attitudes turns out to be a structural it might have structural effects on travel behaviour for instance people might structurally shift from public transport to car for commuting such a shift could have negative consequences in terms of both sustainability and accessibility to understand possible effects of covid-19 and the lockdown on travel behaviour in a future without the disease insights are needed into how people are experiencing its current effects and how these experiences relate to travel behaviour and attitudes governments worldwide are facing challenges for the future with regard to their transport system the high popularity of motorized transport comes with a number of issues such as j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f 3 increased congestion damage to the environment and human health due to emissions and reduced liveability of cities in the eu road transport is responsible for more than 70 of all co 2 transport emissions and up to 30 of small particulate emissions in the eu alonso raposo et al 2019  furthermore it is expected that urbanization rates will further increase in the future with an expected share of 70 of people worldwide living in urban areas by 2050 the world bank 2019 this will not only put more pressure on the transport system as transport demand will increase it also means that more people will be affected by its negative side effects such as congestion and emissions to deal with these challenges governments are looking to not only change the transport system itself but also the behaviour of its users in this light it is important to monitor the temporal changes in travel behaviour due to the coronavirus crisis and assess whether these will result in structural behavioural changes this study aims to explore how the coronavirus and related measures affect peoples daily behaviour and attitudes in terms of activity patterns work education and travel patterns it discusses the current situation the changes in daily mobility compared to the situation before the corona virus and peoples expectations for the future the findings are based on longitudinal data from a representative sample of approximately 2500 dutch citizens from the netherlands mobility panel mpn using such data makes it possible to study intrapersonal behavioural changes the longitudinal data is combined with additional partly retrospective questions to better understand the current behaviour and future expectations this way we gain a broad picture of the actual and expected impact on daily travel related behaviour on the shorter and on the longer term this study will assess the extent to which the covid-19 virus and the measures taken by the dutch government influence peoples daily life in terms of activity patterns work education and travel now and potentially in the future after the coronavirus crisis in this section the research methods and data collection are presented using literature on the relation between external events and behavioural change a research framework is developed to structure the data collection and data analysis of this research the aim of this framework is to show how the coronavirus might have affected peoples current behaviour as well as how it might structurally affect future behaviour in the framework two separate drivers of behavioural change associated with covid-19 are distinguished the first is the impact of the coronavirus crisis on the personal situation this encompasses for instance a change in work situation as businesses are closed as well as the fear of becoming or actually being infected with the virus the second category are governments measures taken to reduce the spread of the virus which in the netherlands at the time of data collection consisted of a so-called intelligent lockdown which was further explained in the introduction both the personal impact of the virus and the governments measures as a result of covid-19 are likely to have led to changes in behaviour and preferences associated with this behaviour preferences here are defined as a broad concept and may for instance be influenced by attitudes or the way people experience certain behaviour from previous studies it is known that attitudes play a role in determining peoples travel behaviour bohte et al 2009  preferences may directly be influenced by covid-19 as people might for instance prefer to avoid places where keeping 15m distance to others is difficult such as public transport preferences may also be influenced through experiences with new behaviour for example a negative experience with grocery shopping outdoors in the current situation may result in a lower preference for outdoor shopping given that a bi-directional relation between attitudes and behaviour seems to exist kroesen et al 2017  such a negative experience with grocery shopping in itself might again affect this behaviour social demographics might mediate these relationships for example older people might react differently to the impacts of covid-19 than younger people both behavioural change itself and preferences towards this behavioural change as a result of how this new behaviour is experienced might have an effect on peoples expectations of future behaviour after the corona situation ajzen 1991 dean 2013 sigurdardottir et al 2013  people are suddenly confronted with new behaviour which is in many cases different from their normal habits this may be a trigger for structural behavioural change to take place when j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f experiences with the current changed behaviour are more positive it is more likely to be reflected in positive expectations regarding continuing the behaviour in the future strmberg  karlsson 2016  therefore we expect a direct relation between peoples expectations about their current behaviour such as their current way of working and their expectations about future behavioural change the relationships hypothesized above are graphically presented in figure 1  this presented research framework could be applied to many research fields but the interest of this paper is to analyse the effects of covid-19 on personal mobility in the netherlands mobility here is seen as a derivation from activity patterns to study this three relevant categories influencing mobility are identified outdoor activities work and education and travel behaviour if our outdoor activity patterns change then our mobility demand will change as well this research studies both general outdoor activities like grocery shopping and social contacts and the more specific activity of work or education covid-19 has undoubtedly changed the behaviours and experiences of these activities if not due to the direct impact of the virus itself then due to the governments measures taken to reduce the spread of the virus activity patterns and the current situation of work and education influence peoples travel patterns in addition preferences for certain travel modes could have changed which also may influence peoples travel pattern the main interest here is to what extent and how people have travelled and what their experiences are the mode of transport travelled distances and attitudes towards modes are particularly relevant here it should be stressed that it is not the goal of the present study to test the hypothesised relationships in the framework the framework has been used to identify topics of interest and to both structure the data collection and data analysis of this research to capture behaviour changes either longitudinal or retrospective data are required in the present study both types of data are included using the netherlands mobility panel mpn the mpn is an annual household panel that started in 2013 and consists of approximately 2000 complete households each year household members of at least 12 years old are asked to complete a three-day travel diary and fill in an extensive questionnaire that includes questions on topics such as work outdoor activities and attitudes towards the use of different modes of transport furthermore every household is asked to fill in a questionnaire about household related characteristics such as information about household composition and ownership of means of transport more information about the mpn can be found in hoogendoorn-lanser et al 2015  for the purpose of the present study a representative sample of 2800 panel members from the mpn were asked to keep a travel diary for three consecutive days in the week between 27 march and 4 april 2020 a questionnaire was distributed to this group as well the research framework  figure 1  has been the basis for the data collection for this study by comparing j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f peoples behaviour before the situation with corona and during the situation with corona behavioural changes are measured in addition to that questions are posed about peoples experiences with their behaviour in the current situation finally people have been asked about their expectations for their future behaviour after the corona situationthereby the questionnaire included both retrospective and forward-looking questions it consists of three core components the first focusing on peoples occupation the second on peoples outdoor activities and the third on peoples travel patterns the response to the survey amounted to 2296 completed diaries and 2494 completed questionnaires -a net response of 82 and 89 respectively as respondents already participated in the mpn before their travel behaviour in a time with covid-19 can be compared directly to their travel behaviour before the pandemic table 1 shows the composition of the sample in this table data from the 2019 wave of the mpn are used the population statistics for some variables such as occupation have been affected considerably by covid-19 the sample used in this study is thus a fairly representative subset of the dutch population before covid-19 there is a small underrepresentation of young people and an overrepresentation of people with a high level of education for the analyses data is weighted on both sociodemographic-and geographical factors  given the urgent need for information on the impacts of the corona virus on society the present article will discuss the main findings of the data collection in a mostly descriptive way where relevant the effects on experiences behaviour and expectations are broken down by background characteristics such as age or region furthermore this research uses the longitudinal structure of the data to enable a direct comparison between behaviour measured in the fall of 2019 and behaviour measured during the early stages of the coronavirus crisis in late march and early april of 2020 retrospective questions are used for these comparisons in some cases where prior information was not recorded in the fall of 2019 these comparative analyses are complemented by a chi-square test to give an indication of the significance of the differences to interpret the results the assumption is made that many of the changes in behaviour between the two measurement periods are a consequence of the coronavirus crisis however there may be other j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f reasons for the differences in behaviour between the two periods for individuals such as changes in weather or life events in this section we discuss the main findings of the study we start with a few main insights on how people experience the current coronavirus crisis in the netherlands more detailed findings are presented in a structure that is based on the framework presented before and the three main themes of outdoor activities work and education and travel patterns as experiences with the current situation are very subjective a number of questions regarding impact on both the personal situation and society in general were included in the survey generally speaking the majority of people 90 indicate that they think the current crisis will have large long-term impacts on society fewer people about 50 perceive a negative impact on their personal situation younger people more often experience a negative impact on their personal situation which contrasts to the initial expectations that the more vulnerable group of elderly people would be most affected  2 5 n  2492  15271 p  001 this can be explained by the fact that this group used to be more active in terms of participating in activities such as sports and going out before the coronavirus in addition they are more likely to be affected in terms of work more flexible and temporary contracts and education on average about 35 of people are afraid to become infected with the virus here a clear age effect is observed as well but now the number increases with age only one in five younger people 25 years are afraid of becoming infected while a majority of people older than 65 are afraid  2 1 n  2492  95230 p  001 there are no clear regional differences about 6 of the respondents think that they have already been infected by the coronavirus this number is a bit higher in the southern provinces of the netherlands which makes sense given that this area of the netherlands has a higher infection rate as determined by the number of positive tests rivm 2020  we should stress that these findings purely reflect the experience of respondents and may not reflect true infection numbers our findings show that the coronavirus crisis has resulted in people of all age groups in the dutch population to be less active outdoors figure 2  for example where in september 2019 15 of the respondents did their groceries outside of their home at least four times per week this number dropped to about 8 in late marchearly april 2020 especially the number of times that people shop outdoors or visit other people has dropped since the coronavirus reached the netherlands respectively around 85 and 90 of the people indicate that they do these activities less often j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f older people in particular are much less active than before the crisis chi-square tests grocery shopping  2 2 n  2492  36411 p  000 shopping  2 2 n  2492  13078 p  001 exercising  2 2 n  2492  28876 p  000 volunteering  2 2 n  2492  37606 p  001 visiting people not significant the fact that elderly people are more afraid of becoming infected with the new virus might play a role in this with regard to outdoors exercise a large decrease can also be observed for the youngest age group which might be explained by the fact that this group was the most active before the coronavirus given the fact that the southern provinces of the netherlands were more affected by the coronavirus than the northern part when our data was collected it was expected that people in the southern provinces would show a larger drop in outdoor activities as a result of the governments appeal to stay at home as much as possible on the 31 st of march halfway through our fieldwork the most heavily affected province in the south noord-brabant had almost 7 times more confirmed cases of covid-19 per inhabitant compared to the least affected province in the north friesland rivm 2020 however no clear regional pattern was found which seemed to indicate that people seem to adjust their behaviour to the situation irrespective of the amount of people infected in their surroundings the finding that 90 of respondents indicate that the appeal by the government to stay at home is the main reason for the reduction in their outdoor activities is a further confirmation of this explanation the second most reported reasons that people do not want to go outside due to the virus itself reported by about 80 of people however would seemingly contradict this explanation older people 65 years or older are more likely to name this reason which makes sense given the fact that they are more afraid of being infected more in-depth experiences were collected for two types of outdoor activities namely grocery shopping and social visits to other people with regard to doing groceries a positive j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f 8 finding is that most people about 80 experience sufficient possibilities for getting their groceries in the current situation perhaps surprisingly older people are a bit more positive compared to other age groups  2 4 n  2376  10312 p  035 despite having sufficient access to groceries most people experience grocery shopping as unpleasant in the current situation interestingly this applies to both grocery shopping outdoors as well as ordering groceries online by ordering groceries online one avoids a visit to the supermarket and the associated risk of becoming infected however the capacity for delivery of online ordered groceries has turned out to be insufficient to accommodate the sudden increase in demand therefore waiting times were long this might explain why people experience online grocery shopping as unpleasant most respondents then also report that digital solutions for grocery shopping are not a sufficient replacement for physical shopping as could be expected especially older people are less positive in this respect while people aged 25-44 are most positive  2 4 n  1814  46437 p  000 in addition people in urban areas seem to be a bit more positive compared to people in less urban areas  2 4 n  1814  21223 p  000 perhaps because possibilities for digital grocery shopping are more prevalent in urban areas with respect to social visits to other people the findings show that about 40 of people were not happy about the possibilities for social interaction at the time in which the fieldwork was conducted the group of people that were still happy with the possibilities for social contact is of about the same size the rest is neither positive nor negative no differences are found between age groups or household composition single households couples or families older people however are currently less comfortable with physical meetings  2 4 n  2302  15826 p  003 digital alternatives for social interaction were considered to be more convenient than physical meetings for all age groups nevertheless people also indicate that they do not consider digital or online social interaction as a full replacement for physically meeting people although almost all people report fewer outdoor activities people expect to go back to their behaviour from before the coronavirus when the threat of the virus has subsided the vast majority of people 90 do not expect that the current changes in outdoor activities will continue after the coronavirus crisis figure 3  this is not entirely unexpected as it was found that a considerable group of people do not have positive experiences with their current activity patterns especially with regard to visiting people most respondents expect to go back to their previous behaviour however people who consider digital solutions to be full replacements of physically meeting people are more likely to expect to also visit fewer people in the future  2 16 n  2269  391996 p  000 the same holds for grocery shopping outdoors for people who are happy with doing their groceries online  2 16 n  1354  148590 p  000 or who think online grocery shopping is a full replacement of outdoors grocery shopping  2 16 n  1521  143498 p  000 interestingly among the people who reported more outdoor activities during the pandemic expectations about keeping to the new behaviour are higher than people who showed a decrease in outdoor activities this however entails a small percentage of the total population  the coronavirus crisis and the governments measures also have a large impact on peoples work and educational situation schools are closed and people are urged to work from home whenever possible furthermore certain businesses closed completely such as bars restaurants hotels and contact professions restaurants were however still allowed to open for take-away or delivery services at the time of our survey approximately half of the workers indicated that their work situation had changed only a small part 1 lost their job or went bankrupt most changes relate to a change in working times 24 or a reduction in working hours 16 approximately 10 of people indicated that they temporarily stopped working another part 8 of workers reported an increase in their working hours especially entrepreneurs and employees with a flexible contract are affected by the coronavirus crisis entrepreneurs report more changes to their work situation compared to non-entrepreneurs  2 1 n  1873  13349 p  000 and people with a flexible contract reported more changes compared to people with a contract for a fixed number of hours  2 4 n  1873  150859 p  000 the most important reason for people to temporarily stop working is that their company closed down followed by receiving less work from their clients or employer the latter is also the most important reason for people to have decreased their working hours note that this information pertains to the week where data was collected this situation can drastically change depending on the length of time during which the economy has to be partly shut down to control the spread of the virus aside from the aforementioned changes to employment number of hours worked and work schedules people report changes on how they did their work approximately 44 of workers reported that they either started to work from home or increased the hours that they are working from home in 2019 6 of respondents reported to work almost all their hours 75 from home this figure sharply increased to 39 in the current situation currently more than half 54 of all workers work from home at least a part of the week physical meetings are also less common with 30 of workers reporting an increase in remote meetings for instance by videoconferencing since schools and universities were completely closed nearly all students and pupils need to follow education from their homes these changes have resulted in a sizeable drop in the number of commuting and education trips which causes a big change in our mobility system estimating the entirety of this impact is outside of the scope of this study but one thing to look at is which people are more likely to work from home and how they commuted before one j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f expectation here is that people who normally commute by public transport are more likely to have increased the number of hours they work from home since people were urged to avoid public transport as much as possible indeed results show that this share is with 69 significantly higher among workers who usually commute by public transport  2 1 n  1425  35655 p  000 a somewhat surprising and very relevant finding is that people are in general positive about the changes in the way they have to work figure 4 shows peoples experiences with working from home over 60 of people who work from home indicate that this is easy for them even more people have a good place to work from home 65 and sufficient digital facilities 85 it should be noted that the latter is not surprising as the netherlands has the highest share of households having an internet connection 98 in the eu eurostat 2020  while over 90 of households owning a computer statistics netherlands 2018  roughly 40 of the people who worked from home said that they considered themselves as an experienced home-worker before the coronavirus crisis hit the netherlands the majority 58 are thus forming completely new experiences with working from home similarly to experiences with working from home over 60 of people who are now having more remote meetings have had positive experiences with 42 of people considering remote meetings just as productive as physical meetings  figure 5  while just over half of these people 55 consider remote meetings to be suitable for most types of appointments almost two thirds 64 think these types of meetings are particularly suitable for consultation with direct colleagues for most people remote meetings are new to them as only one in five 21 indicated that remote meetings were already normal within their organization before corona there are some differences between sectors here difference in working more from home between sectors  2 5 n  1427  164686 p  000 difference in increase in remote meetings between sectors  2 5 n  1427  114751 p  000 in the sector automation and it the number of people working from home increased by the greatest amount in healthcare and in retail relatively few people have started working from home experiences with both working from home and remote meetings also differ per sector with people from the sector automation and it being most positive difference in experience with working from between sectors  2 20 n  828  49010  p  000 difference in experience with remote meetings between sectors  2 20 n  451  34443 p  023 strikingly people working in the section education are much less positive even though they have started to work from home at an only slightly lower rate compared to automation and it alongside those in the workforce younger people are also experiencing major changes in their daily routine as schools and universities had to close down students and school pupils are therefore forced to follow lessons at home compared to people who work they are not as positive on their new way of education  figure 6  only one in three students and school pupils 34 experiences home education as pleasant while most have a good working place 76 and sufficient digital facilities 89 only slightly more than half 53 can concentrate on their study or school work while the vast majority 90 of people do not expect that current changes in outdoor activities will continue in the future after corona as discussed in section 31 this turns out to be different for the new way of working over a quarter 27 of people who currently work more from home expect to work more from home in the future after corona compared to the situation before corona for remote meetings 36 expect to do this more often in the future for people who indicated to have positive experiences with working from home or remote meetings expectations to continue this behaviour in the future are higher working from home  2 16 n  869  153774 p  000 remote meetings  2 16 n  460  150803 p  000 if these expectations are realized into actual behaviour this could result in a significant change within the mobility system resulting from the structural decrease in the number of commuting and business trips an important factor in realizing the expectation into actual behaviour is whether employers will allow their employees to also work more from home or have remote meetings in the future expectations of the students and school pupils who are currently following education from their homes are much more moderate only 13 of them expect to follow education from home more often after corona than they did before corona this can be explained by the overall less satisfying experience with home education while not included in the questionnaire another important reason for this is likely to be the lack of social interactions with their fellow students or classmates finally students and pupils might have less say over whether they follow their education from home or not as their schools and universities play a large part in this decision the final category of interest are the personal travel patterns and how these have changed because of corona how people experience their current patterns and what they expect to do in the future findings show that people stay at home for an entire day much more often with corona compared to our measurement in september 2019 without corona in september 2019 about 20 of the people stayed home on an average day in our survey of march and early april 2020 respondents reported no trips in their travel diaries on 50 of the days not having to leave home for work or education the governments appeal to stay at home and the fear of being infected when leaving their home are likely to play an important role in this sharp increase people who are afraid to become infected stay at home significantly more often compared to people who are not afraid to become infected 53 versus 48  2 1 n  6589  16257 p  000 j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f 13 the total number of trips and travelled distance in three days as the mpn includes a three-day travel diary these figures are reported for three day aggregates has then also dropped considerably with 55 and 68 respectively the average amount of trips dropped from 80 trips to 36 trips per three days all travel modes are affected by this decrease in overall mobility however with only a 14 decrease walking trips are affected the least the total travelled distance dropped from 94 km to 30 km in three days the average distance travelled per trip has dropped as well from around 12 to 8 km per trip similar to what was observed in outdoor activities and work and education no clear regional relationship seems to be present relatively speaking the use of public transport and car as passenger show the largest decrease for public transport more than 90 fewer trips are reported whereas almost 80 fewer car trips as passenger are reported as a result the mode shares of these modes in terms of trips also show a considerable drop by contrast the share of walking has almost doubled figure 7 shows the modal split in trips from the travel diaries of september 2019 and the travel diaries of the wave in march and april 2020 this significant drop in public transport use is not unexpected as both the government as well as public transport operators urged people to only travel by public transport if highly necessary furthermore students and people with a higher education both groups that are generally more likely to be able to study or work from home often used public transport before the coronavirus crisis because of changes in daily activities the relative importance of different travel purposes has also changed while most trip motives show a decrease in share figure 8  the share of commuting trips is comparable to the situation before the corona virus meaning that the relative decrease in number of commuting trips is comparable to the overall decrease in number of trips furthermore only the shares of grocery shopping and touringwalking show a significant increase in share with the share of touringwalking almost quadrupling it should be noted that touringwalking is the only trip motive with an increase in absolute number of trips j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f this sharp increase in the share of touringwalking is strongly related to an increase in number of so-called roundtrips eg trips where the destination is the same as the origin like walking the dog or cycling for recreational purposes whereas before the coronavirus crisis approximately one in fifteen trips 7 was such a roundtrip this has increased to one in four trips 25 in the 2020 wave absolutely speaking the number of roundtrips increased by over 70 especially the number of cycling and walking tours increased as this is currently the most important reason for a roundtrip before the coronavirus crisis the most important reason for a roundtrip was to walk the dog this increase in tours by either foot or bicycle also has an effect on the average trip distance with these modes while the overall average trip distance decreased from approximately 12 to 8 km both cycling and walking show an increase in average trip distance the average distance of a cycling trip has increased by 30 from 33 to 43 km per trip the length of walking trips increased even more with 83 from 12 to 22 km per trip this is a result of the increase in relative importance of roundtrips as we know from previous measurements of the mpn that roundtrips are generally longer in distance compared to more utilitarian trips it may be expected that the current situation not only has an effect on travel behaviour but also a direct effect on attitudes and preferences towards travel modes as attitudes were already measured in the mpn effects of the coronavirus crisis on these attitudes can be assessed figure 9 clearly shows that especially attitudes towards public transport have changed considerably people were already the least positive about public transport before the coronavirus in the new measurement these attitudes however dropped even further as less than 10 of people have a positive attitude towards train bus tram or metro besides public transport there is a noticeably increase in the number of people who are very positive towards the car attitudes towards the bicycle and walking have not changed these changes in attitudes are also reflected in the fact that almost all people 88 indicate that they currently prefer to use individual modes like car of bicycle over public or shared modes of transport people who are more afraid to become infected have a stronger preference for individual modes compared to people who do not fear of becoming infected  2 4 n  2443  71811 p  000 whereas 71 of people who are afraid to become infected currently strongly prefer individual modes only 54 of people who are not afraid say the same evidently both travel patterns and attitudes towards travel modes have changed at least temporarily due to the coronavirus crisis the question whether these temporal effects will result in structural behavioural changes remains especially the observed changes in attitudes towards travel modes might partly be temporal as they will partly revert to the pre-corona values when shared transport modes are considered to be safe again people generally do not expect that the current situation will largely affect their use of travel modes in the future as approximately 80 of people think they will use all travel modes just as much in the future after corona as they did before corona figure 10  others think their mode choice use will change for public transport there is a larger group thinking they will decrease their use whereas for the private car more people think they will increase their use these differences are however less strong than the expectations for the active modes walking and cycling for cycling 20 thinks they will increase their use as opposed to 3 who expects a decrease for walking this is 21 and 5 respectively a possible explanation for this expected increase of walking and cycling are the current positive experiences people may find the increase in walking and cycling tours to be a positive experience which may result in the intention to also do this more often in the future these effects are measured relatively shortly after the coronavirus reached the netherlands so long-term economic effects of the crisis were yet very unclear the aforementioned expectations might change as a result from changes in expectations with regards to the economic effects of corona in the longer term the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on international travel is even larger than on daily regional mobility due to international travel restrictions many airlines have to keep large parts of their fleet grounded results from our survey show that 21 of people who have flown before expect to reduce their amount of air travel in the future after corona approximately 5 expects an increase in air travel there seems to be a clear relationship between age and expectations for the amount of air travel in the future as older people expect a stronger decrease  2 4 n  1615  123967 p  000 while just under 16 of people under 65 years old expect to decrease their air travel 43 of people 65 years or older do this might be related to the fear to become infected with covid-19 as the current pandemic showed that being abroad during the outbreak of a pandemic could for instance lead to problems returning home it might be that older people do not feel comfortable to be dependent on aviation to return home another explanation might be that this is the result of older people expecting to fly less because of their age irrespective of covid-19 the main rationale behind this study is that covid-19 and the governments policies to stop the spread of the disease will not only have an effect during the pandemic but may also have structural long-lasting effects on travel behaviour and peoples mobility the findings presented in this paper provide some first evidence for this hypothesis we show that there are major immediate changes in outdoor activities work and travel behaviour due to covid-19 and related governmental measures we also show that people expect that some of these changes will last into a future without an active pandemic as about 30 of people expect to work more from home 20 to cycle and walk more and fly less in the future after the coronavirus crisis our findings contribute to the literature on life-events indicating that certain events in someones life eg relocating to a new home could have both immediate and structural behavioural effects mggenburg et al 2015 schfer et al 2012 schoenduwe et al 2015  studying covid-19 from this angle might prove fruitful allowing researchers to embed their studies of this new and unique phenomenon into this branch of literature however there are still some uncertainties with respect to our findings regarding potential structural changes first whether people will structurally change their behaviour will probably depend on the longevity of the crisis and its economic repercussions currently it is unknown how long government measures will be in place and how they will affect our economy on the longer term an economic recession may lead to higher unemployment rates affecting both commuting mobility as well as travel budgets of people for non-commuting trips furthermore as long as people need to keep a distance of 15m to others capacity of public transport will be considerably lower forcing people to stay home or search for alternatives secondly our method relies on peoples self-reported experiences and expectations peoples expectations do not always result in actual behavioural intentions in the future ajzen 1991  these intentions and future behaviour in itself are also influenced by peoples ability to change their behaviour irrespective of others in reality this ability depends on external factors such as the employer educational institutions public transport operators and others to what extent people actually change their behaviour and behavioural intention in the future thus remains to be seen future measurements are needed to alleviate this concern this research has several implications for policy makers for example many of the observed changes in behaviour would not have been possible without ict people resort to digital solutions for grocery shopping or social contacts or e-conferencing to work from home however this increased importance of ict in daily activities may have some negative effects in light of the so-called digital divide selwyn 2004  for people who do not have access to these ict tools or do not own the necessary skills to use them this shift to ict may result in being unable to participate in these daily activities in turn this could lead to some forms of social exclusion lucas 2012  in addition the present research showed that experiences with these ict solutions are not always positive for social contacts for instance the group that considers digital social contacts as a full replacement for face-to-face contacts is just as large as the groups that does not the same goes for home-workers while the majority of workers indicate to have good digital facilities there is a smaller group without sufficient digital facilities to work from home for policy makers it is important to address the issue of digital divide that may become larger with an increasing reliance on ict and address the apparent shortcomings of available ict solutions to facilitate behavioural changes that rely on ict furthermore the results show an immediate shift towards more sustainable behaviour as overall travel decreased which can be seen as a positive side effect of the governments policies to reduce the spread of the coronavirus in addition we observe an increased interest in cycling and walking on the other hand when looking at the remaining trips only a fraction of public transport use remains while the relative importance of the car changed only minimally the latter development does not indicate more sustainable behaviour in the present situation policy makers should be aware of the increased preference for individual travel modes as well as the more negative attitude towards public transport because of the corona crisis in sum the extent to which covid-19 and related governmental measures will have long term positive effects on sustainability needs to be seen the finding that one in five people expect to walk and cycle more and fly less and over a quarter of home-workers expect to work from home more often in the future after the coronavirus crisis could have positive outcomes in terms of sustainability and health nevertheless people also expect to make as much use of the car and to go back to the same amount of outdoor activities as before the crisis which would have no positive sustainability impacts in itself it probably also depends on accommodating policies by national and regional governments eg to stimulate working from home and active mode use when returning to a new normal whether or not behavioural changes will be structural from a sustainability perspective the current exogenous shock might be seen as a window of opportunity for policy makers to realise these desired behavioural changes on the other hand the governmental urge to restrict public transport use could result in a structural shift from public transport to car given these uncertainties it is important for governments to actively follow the changes in mobility behaviour and the impacts of governmental actions this study aimed to explore to what extent the coronavirus and related governmental measures to reduce the spread of the virus in the netherlands impact peoples daily mobility behaviour and may result in structural behavioural changes the findings are based on a combination of longitudinal data complemented with partly retrospective questions on behaviour attitudes and preferences during the coronavirus crisis from a representative group of approximately 2500 dutch citizens aged 12 years and older who are part of the netherlands mobility panel mpn the dutch government introduced an intelligent lockdown a lighter version of a full lockdown at the time of this study people were urged to leave their homes as little as possible and work from home furthermore bars restaurants schools gyms and contact professions were closed and visiting people in nursing homes was not allowed even though people are urged to stay inside of their home they are still allowed to move around freely as long as they keep a distance of 15m to others despite these relatively mild measures when compared to many other european countries impacts on all studied aspects relating to mobility are found to be very large our findings show that at the time of the data collection marchapril 2020 approximately 80 of people reported less activities outside of their home older people in particular are much less active than before the crisis although most people still experience enough possibilities for grocery shopping roughly 40 of people are unhappy with the restricted possibilities for social interaction digital solutions are generally not considered to be a full replacement for meeting people physically roughly half of the previously employed people faced a change in their work situation such as working less hours or at different times furthermore people and businesses have been able to experience working from their home and remote meetings most people report positive experiences with this new way of working students and school pupils however are mostly not happy with following education from home changes in outdoor activities work and education as well as the virus itself have impacted peoples travel patterns the amount of trips and distance travelled are reduced by 55 and 68 respectively when compared to the fall of 2019 the use of public transport is impacted the most with a decrease of over 90 of trips so-called roundtrips gained in popularity currently one in four trips is a roundtrip such as a walking or cycling tour besides use of travel modes attitudes have also changed a larger share is very positive towards the car while peoples attitudes towards public transport have taken a drastic turn for the worse this is also reflected in the fact that 88 of people currently prefer individual modes compared to public or shared modes of transport in addition we provide first indications that the drastic shock to daily life may have some structural effects on our mobility even when the immediate threat of the virus has subsided for outdoor activities more than 90 of people who currently reduced their outdoor activities do not expect that they will continue to reduce their outdoor activities in the future however our results indicate that the coronavirus crisis might have permanently altered the way we work and travel more than a quarter of home-workers expect to work from home more often in the future after the coronavirus crisis for workers who currently have more remote meetings just over a third expect to continue to hold more remote meetings in the future similarly some structural changes on the way we travel are expected roughly 20 of people expect to cycle and walk more in the future a similar share of people with air travel experience expect to decrease their air travel in the future these findings show that the coronavirus crisis might turn out to be an external event forming a window of opportunity for behavioural change as discussed before future research could follow-up on this study in several ways first there is a need for longitudinal measurements in the future enabling researchers to measure how expectations experiences and behaviour change over time this allows studying whether peoples expectations with regard to changes in activities and travel behaviour will result in actual structural behavioural change after the coronavirus crisis second more in-depth qualitative studies can be applied to better understand how and why peoples behaviour is changing because of the coronavirus crisis third the results of this study can be embedded in the broader field of how policies can stimulate desired behavioural shifts and deter undesired behavioural shifts for instance more insight is needed in the role of ict in behavioural changes next to the required ict developments and policies to facilitate behavioural change these studies should focus on how it can be ensured that also people without access to the ict tools or without the required digital skills can still participate in activities that have largely shifted to ict solutions finally there is a need for international comparison the coronavirus will have different effects for different countries based on the amount of cases governmental policies and previous behavioural trends given the international nature of the coronavirus crisis and the interconnectivity of the globalised world international studies are needed to further research possible structural effects of this crisis and understand which policies might have caused them approximately 80 of people reduced their activities outdoors eg grocery shopping share of workers that work almost completely from home increased from 6 to 39 27 of home-workers also expect to work more from home in the future after corona the amount of trips and distance travelled dropped by 55 and 68 respectively 20 of people expect to cycle and walk more and to fly less in the future after corona journal pre-proof   mathematical assessment of the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on curtailing the 2019 novel coronavirus calistus ngonghala n enahoro iboi steffen eikenberry matthew scotch raina chandini  macintyre matthew bonds h abba gumel b  a pandemic of a novel coronavirus emerged in december of 2019  causing devastating public health impact across the world in the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or antivirals strategies for controlling and mitigating the burden of the pandemic are focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social-distancing contact-tracing quarantine isolation and the use of face-masks in public we develop a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of the aforementioned control and mitigation strategies rigorous analysis of the model shows that the disease-free equilibrium is locally-asymptotically stable if a certain epidemiological threshold known as the reproduction number denoted by r c  is less than unity simulations of the model using data relevant to covid-19 transmission dynamics in the us state of new york and the entire us show that the pandemic burden will peak in mid and late april respectively the worst-case scenario projections for cumulative mortality based on the baseline levels of anti-covid non-pharmaceutical interventions considered in the study decrease dramatically by 80 and 64 respectively if the strict socialdistancing measures implemented are maintained until the end of may or june 2020 the duration and timing of the relaxation or termination of the strict social-distancing measures are crucially-important in determining the future trajectory of the covid-19 pandemic this study shows that early termination of the strict socialdistancing measures could trigger a devastating second wave with burden similar to those projected before the onset of the strict social-distancing measures were implemented the use of efficacious face-masks such as surgical masks with estimated efficacy  70 in public could lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least 70 of the residents of new york state use such masks in public consistently nationwide a compliance of at least 80 will be required using such masks the use of low efficacy masks such as cloth masks of estimated efficacy less than 30 could also lead to significant reduction of covid-19 burden albeit they are not able to lead to elimination combining low efficacy masks with improved levels of the other anti-covid-19 intervention strategies can lead to the elimination of the pandemic this study emphasizes the important role social-distancing plays in curtailing the burden of covid-19 increases in the adherence level of socialdistancing protocols result in dramatic reduction of the burden of the pandemic and the timely implementation of social-distancing measures in numerous states of the us may have averted a catastrophic outcome with respect to the burden of covid-19 using face-masks in public including the low efficacy cloth masks is very useful in minimizing community transmission and burden of covid-19 provided their coverage level is high the masks coverage needed to eliminate covid-19 decreases if the masks-based intervention is combined with the strict social-distancing strategy  infected but is asymptomatic or mildly-symptomatic and unaware heshe ill the face-mask offers efficacy against their ability to transmit infection to susceptible individuals 12 30 31 32 33  predicting the course or severity of a pandemic such as covid-19 as well as the realistic assessment of proposed public health intervention strategies for combating them in real time is a major challenge to both the public health and the scientific community a number of models have been developed and used to study covid-19 dynamics ferguson et al 34 used an agent-based model to investigate the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on human deaths from covid-19 and in reducing burden on healthcare facilities and equipment they projected that in the absence of control measures over 81 of the populations of the us and great britain might become infected and covid-19 may cause up to 22 million deaths in the us mizumoto and chowell 35 used a mathematical model and incidence data to study changes in covid-19 transmission potential as the outbreak progressed through the diamond princess they obtained a higher reproduction number and noticed a substantial decrease in the effective reproduction number after improved quarantine was instituted hellewell et al 36 used a stochastic model with covid-19 data to examine the impact of contact-tracing and isolation on disease control and suggested that for most instances covid-19 spread can be contained in 3 months if these measures are highly effective using a stochastic model kucharski et al 37 examined the covid-19 trajectory in wuhan from january-february 2020 showing a reduction in transmission a 13 reduction in the associated effective reproduction number of the model when travel restrictions were implemented consequently there is a need to examine the combined impact of multiple non-pharmaceutical interventions applied together or in sequence the present study is based on the development of a new mathematical model for studying the transmission dynamics and control of the covid-19 pandemic in the us particularly in the state of new york the epicenter of  the model takes the form of a kermack-mckendrick compartmental deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations 38  it incorporates features pertinent to covid-19 transmission dynamics and control such as the quarantine of suspected cases and the isolationhospitalization of confirmed covid-19 cases similar to the models developed in 39 40 41  the model parameterized using available covid-19 mortality data more reliable than case data provides a realistic real-time assessment and estimate of the burden of the pandemic in the us state of new york in addition to assessing some of the main intervention strategies being implemented in the state in particular quarantine isolation contact-tracing social-distancing and the use of face-masks in public we designed and analyzed a novel kermack-mckendrick-type mathematical model for the transmission dynamics and control of covid-19 in a population 38  the model which incorporates the main non-pharmaceutical interventions being implemented to curtail covid-19 transmission in a community such as social-distancing quarantine of suspected cases isolation of confirmed cases contact-tracing testing and use of face-masks in public is formulated based on stratifying the total human population at time t denoted by n t into the mutuallyexclusive compartments of non-quarantined susceptible s u t quarantined susceptible s q t non-quarantined exposed ie newly-infected individuals who do not yet show symptoms of the disease and cannot transmit infection e u t quarantined exposed e q t symptomatically-infectious i u t asymptomatically-infectious i a t hospitalizedisolated i h t intensive care patients i icu t and recovered rt so that n t  s u t  s q t  e u t  e q t  i u t  i a t  i h t  i icu t  rt it should be mentioned that the asymptomatically-infectious compartment i a  also includes those with mild symptoms of covid-19 data from the world health organization shows that about 80 of covid-19 confirmed cases show mild or no symptoms 16  and that individuals in this category particularly those who are in the 65 age group or those with pre-existing health conditions can develop a mild form of pneumonia that might require self-isolation or hospitalization 42 43 44 45  furthermore some individuals in this compartment particularly those who show no clinical symptoms 46  can be detected via testing andor tracing and testing of the contacts of confirmed covid-19 cases and sent to self-isolation or hospitalization it is worth mentioning that although the self-isolation or hospitalization of individuals in the i a class is associated with contact-tracing the i a to i h transition can also result from improvement in or scaling up of testing as is the case in iceland 47  in fact in our study contact tracing is very much inter-linked with testing contact tracing is carried out after a confirmed case is diagnosed following testingdiagnosis of a confirmed case furthermore individuals in the quarantine class s q or e q  are those who have been traced following the positive diagnosis of someone they have had close contact with ie a confirmed covid-19 case they have been exposed to people in quarantine can be susceptible or newlyinfected but unaware of their infection status and are continually monitored tested to determine their status those who test positive are moved to the e q class and those who remain negative after the incubation period are returned to the s u class thus the process of quarantining individuals suspected of having had close contacts with an infectious individual can be interpreted as contact-tracing in addition to contact-tracing of contacts of confirmed cases people can be placed in quarantine because of other factors such as having travelled to areas with high covid-19 transmission eg new york italy china spain uk etc quarantine and isolation can either be at home self-quarantine and self-isolation or at designated healthcare facilities furthermore hospitalization in the context of this study includes self-isolation at home and isolation at the hospital hence hospitalization and isolation will be used interchangeably in this study the model is given by the following deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations where a dot represents differentiation with respect to time where force of infection  is defined as where  is the effective contact rate ie contacts capable of leading to covid-19 transmission 0  c m  1 is the proportion of members of the public who wear face-masks correctly and consistently in public and 0   m  1 is the efficacy of the face-masks low values of c m imply limited use of face-masks by members of the public while values of c m that are closer to unity imply widespreaduniversal use of face-masks in the community furthermore values of  m that are closer to zero imply that the face-masks are not very effective in preventing acquisition if worn by a susceptible human or transmitting infection if worn by a symptomatic or asymptomatically-infectious human while  m close or equal to unity implies that the face-masks used by the members of the public are of near or perfect efficacy against the acquisition or transmission of infection reduction in the contact rate parameter  can be thought of a measure of effectiveness of strategies that limit contacts between people to avoid community transmission notably social or physical distancing the parameter 0   a  1 measures the relative infectiousness of asymptomatically-infectious humans in the i a class in relation to symptomatic individuals in the i u class similarly 0   h  1 is a modification parameter accounting for the relative infectiousness of hospitalizedisolated infectious humans in the i h class in relation to individuals in the i u class the parameter 0   q  1 is a measure of the effectiveness of quarantine hospitalizationisolation and icu admission to prevent infected quarantined hospitalizedisolated individuals and icu patients from transmitting infection in particular  q  0 implies that infected quarantined hospitalizedisolated individuals and icu patients mix freely with the rest of population and can transmit at the same rate as other infectious individuals on the other hand  q  1 implies that the efficacy of quarantine hospitalizationisolation and icu admission in preventing infected quarantined hospitalizedisolated individuals and icu patients from transmitting infection is perfect in other words  q  1 means infected quarantined hospitalizedisolated infectious humans and icu patients are no longer part of the actively-mixing population hence do not contribute to disease transmission in the model 21 the parameter 0  p  1 is the probability of infection per contact while q is the proportion of non-quarantined individuals that are infected at the time of quarantine the parameter  q measures the rate at which quarantined-susceptible individuals revert to the wholly-susceptible non-quarantined class s u  at the end of the quarantine period the modification parameter 0   j  1 is a measure of the efficacy of quarantine to prevent the acquisition of infection by quarantined-susceptible individuals during quarantine it should be mentioned that in the formulation of the model 21 the quarantine rate is defined as a function of the proportion of infectious individuals in the community in particular the quarantine rate of susceptible individuals is 1  p while that of newly-infected exposed individuals in the e q class is qp where  is the force of infection in other words the more the number of confirmed covid-19 cases in a community the more the number of residents of that community that are quarantined the parameters  u  q  is the rate at which exposed non-quarantined quarantined individuals progress to the symptomatic hospitalized class ie 1 u and 1 q is the intrinsic incubation period of non-quarantined and quarantined exposed individuals respectively a proportion f 1  of exposed individuals move to the i u class at the end of the incubation period at the rate f 1  u  similarly another proportion f 2  moves to i h class at the rate f 2  u  and the remaining proportion 1  f 1  f 2  moves to the i a class at the rate 1  f 1  f 2  u  noting that f 1  f 2  1 the parameter  a represents the rate at which asymptomaticallyinfectious humans are detected via contact-tracing and hospitalized the parameter  a represents the rate at which asymptomatically-infectious humans are detected via contact-tracing and hospitalized a proportion r of exposed quarantined individuals move to the i h class at the end of the incubation period at a rate r q  while the remaining proportion 1r moves to the i a class at a rate 1r q  the parameter  u represents the rate at which exposed non-quarantined individuals are detected by contact-tracing and placed in quarantine the parameter  u  a  h  icu  is the recovery rate for individuals in the i u i a i h i icu  class while  h is the rate at which hospitalized individuals are placed into icu furthermore the parameter  u  a  h  icu  represents the covidinduced mortality for individuals in the i u i a i h i icu  class it is worth mentioning that in the formulation of the model 21 the community transmission rate  is assumed to be the same for both the symptomaticallyinfectious i u  and the asymptomatically-infectious i a  classes it may be possible that the community contact rate for asymptomatically-infectious individuals is higher than that of symptomatically-infectious individuals this is due to the fact that the former are less sick or are not even aware that they are infected and may therefore be having more contacts and causing more infections the assumption for the homogeneity in the community contact rate allows for a more tractable assessment of the impact of social-distancing and other community contact reduction strategies as well as mathematical tractability the model 21 is an extension of the quarantine model for ebola viral disease developed by denes and gumel 39 by adding epidemiological compartments for asymptomatically-infectious humans and hospitalized individuals in icu as well as incorporating contact-tracing of suspected cases and the use of face-masks by members of the general public to the authors knowledge this may be the first deterministic model for covid-19 that incorporates five non-pharmaceutical interventions quarantine isolation contact-tracing use of public masks and social-distancing in addition to allowing for the assessment of the impact of asymptomatic transmission on the trajectory and burden of covid-19 by adding a compartment for asymptomatic-infectious humans a flow diagram of the model is depicted in figure 1  and the state variables and parameters of the model are tabulated in tables 1 and 2  to keep track of covid-19 related deaths required for calibrating our model with cumulative death data for covid-19 and for quantifying and predicting the public health impactburden of disease we define the bookkeeping state variable dt to measure the number of covid-deceased individuals it then follows from some of the equations of the model 21 that the rate of change of the population of deceased-individuals is given by 22  we estimated the baseline epidemiological parameters of the model from available covid-19 data and sources from the published literature since the generally recommended period for quarantine of people suspected of being exposed to covid-19 is 14 days 6 16  we set the rate at which quarantined susceptible individuals revert to the non-quarantined susceptible class  q  to be  q  114 per day further whiel some studies have estimated the incubation period for covid-19 to range from 2-14 days with about 975 of infected people developing disease symptoms within 115 days of infection 13 14 15  other studies have estimated the incubation period to be 5-6 days 3  we consider an average incubation period taken from these ranges of 51 days so that  u  rate at which quarantined individuals revert to the susceptible class 1 q is the average duration in quarantine  a  h  modification parameter for the assumed reduced infectiousness of asymptomatically- efficacy of quarantine to prevent acquisition of infection during quarantine 0   j  1 incubation period for non-quarantined quarantined exposed individuals  a rate at which asymptomatically-infectious humans are detected via contact-tracing and hospitalizedisolated  u rate at which exposed non-quarantined individuals are detected via contact-tracing and placed in quarantine proportion of exposed non-quarantined individuals who progress to

hospitalizationisolation and icu admission to prevent infected individuals in quarantine hospitalisolation and icu from transmitting infection 0   q  1  q  151 per day 13  similarly we set the progression rate from the asymptomatically-infectious class i a  to the isolatedhospitalized class i h to be  a  14 per day following 34 48  we consider an infectious period of about 10 days so that the recovery rate from covid-19 infection  is set to  u   icu  110 per day ferguson et al 34 estimated the average time covid-19 patients spent in hospital for infections that do not lead to complications requiring icu admission to be about 8 days therefore we set  h  18 per day furthermore following ferguson et al 34  it is assumed that there is a short time lag of about 5 days between the onset of disease symptoms in non-quarantined humans and hospitalization hence we set the hospitalization rate  u  to be  u  15 per day some studies have suggested that most covid-19 infections over 80 show mild or no symptoms about 14 show severe symptoms but without requiring icu admission and 6 show criticallysevere symptoms requiring icu admission 16 49 50  consequently we set f 2  02 and assume that half of the 80 of cases that show no or mild symptoms are asymptomatic hence we set f 1  04 and 1   the modification parameter for the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic people  a  was estimated from 34 51 to be 05 further li et al 51 estimated this parameter to be between 042 and 055 hence we set  a   h  05 since about 15 of covid-19 patients die 34  we estimated  u   h  0015 per day to obtain estimates for  a and  icu  we assume that  a  05 u so that  a  00075 per day and  icu  15 u so that  icu  00225 per day 52  the parameter for the efficacy of quarantine to prevent acquisition of infection during quarantine  j  is estimated to be  j  05 we estimated the efficacy of face-masks  m  based on the results of a number of clinical trials for instance data from driessche et al 53 shows that surgical masks reduced p aeruginosa infected aerosols produced by coughing by over 80 in cystic fibrosis patients a similar study by stockwell et al 54 shows that surgical masks reduced colony-forming unit cfu count by over 90 these two studies in 53 54 show that the n95 masks respirators were more effective similarly van der sande et al 55 show that home-made tea-cloth masks had an inward efficiency between 58 and 77 over a 3-hour duration of wear while inward efficiency ranged 7285 and 9899 for surgical and n95-equivalent masks consequently following eikenberry et al 52  we estimate inward mask efficacy to range widely between 2080 for cloth masks and at least 50 for well-made tightly fitting masks made of optimal materials and 7090 for surgical masks and over 95 typical for p in the range of properly worn n95 masks based on this we set  m  05 we set the proportion of quarantined exposed individuals who are hospitalized r to be r  07 there is no good data for the efficacy of isolationhospitalization to prevent disease transmission by symptomatic individuals in isolationhospital nonetheless it seems plausible to assume that at the later stage of the pandemic such as at the present moment the public health system capacity has been greatly improved to the extent that such transmission do not occur hence we set  q  1 the parameter  h  for the rate of icu admission is estimated to be  h  0083 per day based on data from 56 it is in the range of 6  12 the remaining parameters of the model 21  c m   a and  u  were estimated from the mortality data for the state of new york and the entire us 4 5 6 7 based on the fitting of the state of new york data in figure 2 a and data for the entire us in figure 2 b the estimating process involved minimizing the sum of the squares of the difference between the predictions of model 21 cumulative deaths and the observed covid-19 cumulative deaths data from new york state for the period from march 1 2020 to april 7 2020 in particular the fitted values obtained using the state of new york mortality data were   08648 per day p  08073 per day c m  00546  a  02435 per day and  u  01168 per day while the fitted values obtained using mortality data for the entire us were   10966 per day p  07163 c m  01598  a  03090 per day and  u  01065 per day 4 5 6 7  the red dots represent data points while the solid blue line represent predictions of death from system 21 the model 21 has a line of disease-free equilibria dfe given by where s u 0 is the initial size of the non-quarantined susceptible individuals the asymptotic stability of the dfe will be analysed using the next generation operator method 57 58  using the notation in 57  it follows that the next generation operator matrices f and v for the new infection terms and the transition terms are given respectively by it is convenient to define r c by where  now represents the spectral radius of the next generation matrix f v 1  where with the result below follows from theorem 2 of 57  the quantity r c is the control reproduction number of the model 21 it measures the average number of new covid-19 infections generated by an average infected individual introduced into a population where basic public health interventions quarantine isolation social-distancing testing etc are implemented the quantity r c is the sum of the constituent reproduction numbers associated with the number of new covid-19 cases generated by symptomatically-infectious humans r cu  hospitalizedisolated individuals r ch  and asymptomaticallyinfectious humans r ca  the epidemiological implication of theorem 31 is that a small influx of covid-19 cases will not generate a covid-19 outbreak if the control reproduction number r c  is less than unity it is worth mentioning that for kermack-mckendrick-type mathematical models with no vitaldemographic dynamics ie births or natural death processes or waning immunity to continuously feed the susceptible class such as the model 21 it is instructive to compute the final size of the epidemic 40 59 60 61 62  the final epidemic size relations which are natural quantities associated with the dynamics of epidemic models with no vitaldemographic dynamics allow for the realistic quantification of disease burden and can be used to assess the impact and effectiveness of various intervention and mitigation strategies 40  the final size relations for the epidemic model 21 are calculated in section 32 below in this section the final size of the covid-19 pandemic will be calculated using the notation in 59  let x  ir 6   y  ir 2   and z  ir  represent the sets of infected susceptible and recovered components of the model thusit follows from the model 21 that xt  e u t e q t i u t i h t i a t i icu t t  yt  s u t s q t t and zt  rt further following arino et al 59  let d be the m  m diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries denoted by  i i  1 2     m are the relative susceptibilities of the corresponding susceptible class it is convenient to define  to be an n  n matrix with the property that the i j entry represents the fraction of the j th susceptible compartment that goes into the i th infected compartment upon becoming infected let b be an ndimensional row vector of relative horizontal transmissions using the notation in 59  let the infection rate  of the model 21 be represented by  that is using the above change and variables and definitions the model 21 reduces to where w is a k  n matrix with the property that the i j entry represents the rate at which individuals of the j th infected compartment transition into the recovered i th z compartment upon recovery and the matrix v is as defined in section 31 it is worth stating that the reproduction number r c  of the model 21 or equivalently 32 can be recovered using the definition r c  0 y 0  z 0 bv 1 dy 0 given in theorem 21 of 59 it should be noted that this theorem also allows for recovering the local asymptotic stability result for the family of diseasefree equilibria of the model 21 given in section 31 furthermore the results below for the final size relations of the model 21 or equivalently 32 can be established using theorem 51 of 59   where with the parameter groupings k i i  1 2 3 4 as defined in section 31 it is worth mentioning that by setting e u 0  e q 0  i u 0  i a 0  i icu 0  s q 0  0 with s u 0  0 and i h 0  0 the final size relations given by the inequalities in 33 reduce to we simulated the model 21 using the baseline parameter values tabulated in table 3 unless otherwise stated to assess the population-level impact of the various control and mitigation strategies against the spread of covid-19 in the us state of new york discussed in section 21 we also simulated the model using the calibrated parameters in table 4  together with the other estimated parameters in table 3  to assess the population-level impact of various control measures in the entire us it should be mentioned that in all the simulations carried out the various nonpharmaceutical interventions are maintained at their baseline values unless otherwise stated we simulated the model to first of all assess the impact of social-distancing which in our study extends beyond individuals staying 2 meters or 6 feet apart to include school and non-essential business closures staying at home avoiding large gatherings etc further in our study we measured the effect of social-distancing by the overall reduction in the baseline value of the community contact rate parameter  the simulation results obtained depicted in figure 3  show a projected 66 300 patients in hospital or in self-isolation at the pandemic peak expected to be attained on may 5 2020 figure 3 a  and 105 100 cumulative number of deaths figure 3 c  for the state of new york under the baseline scenario ie for the baseline level of social-distancing similarly the projections for the entire us under the baseline nation-wide social-distancing scenario are 115 000 daily hospitalizations at the pandemic peak figure 3 b  and 164 000 cumulative number of deaths figure 3 d  it is noteworthy that our projection for the cumulative mortality for the entire us of 164 000 falls markedly below the 22 million mortality projected by ferguson et al 34  our us-wide mortality projection however falls within the range of 38 243 162 106 estimated by murray et al 65  when social-distancing is improved above the baseline effectiveness levels ie increase in efficacy and adherencecoverage of social-distancing figure 3 shows a dramatic reduction of covid-19 burden for both new york state and the entire us in particular for a socialdistancing regimen that reduces the contact rate parameter  by 10 from its baseline value the expected number of daily hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases at the peak of the pandemic decreases to 50 380 corresponding to a 24 decrease in hospitalizationsisolation from baseline for the state of new york similarly nation-wide hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases at the peak of the pandemic decreases by 21 to 89 930 furthermore for a highly-effective social-distancing strategy such as a social-distancing strategy that results in at least 40 reduction in the baseline value of  the peak hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases for new york state and the entire us dramatically reduce to 5 000 and 14 000 respectively this represents a 92 and 88 reduction in peak hospitalizations for the state of new york and nationwide respectively similarly for this scenario the cumulative mortality for new york state and the entire us reduce respectively to 20 700 and 59 600 thus implementing a highly-effective social-distancing strategy which can reduce the baseline community contact rate  by at least 40 will avert over 80 and 64 of the predicted baseline deaths in new york state and nationwide respectively the effectiveness levels and coverage of social-distancing in new york state and the entire us has table 3  estimated and fitted parameters of the model 21 using covid-19 mortality data for the state of new york 4 5 6 7  with this set of parameter values the control reproduction number r c  is given by r c  195 value greatly improved by april 2 2020 66 67 68 69  to the extent that it is plausible to assume that 40 reduction in the baseline value of  has already been achieved in both the state of new york and nationwide therefore this study shows that the state of new york and the entire us could have recorded catastrophic covid-19-induced mortality between 100 000 to 200 000 if not for the high effectiveness levels and coverage of the strict social-distancing measures implemented in the state and nationwide our study suggests that if the current level of social-distancing effectiveness and coverage is maintained through may or june 2020 in the state of new york and nationwide covid-19 can be eliminated from both the state and the entire nation extending the simulations for figure 3 shows that the current level of the social-distancing regimen in the state of new york should be extended until late september 2021 to guarantee the elimination of covid-19 in the context of figure 3  covid-19 elimination is measured in terms of when the cumulative mortality stabilizes similarly for the entire us social-distancing needs to be maintained until march 2021 additional simulations were carried out to assess the population-level impact of the duration and timing of when to terminate the current strict social-distancing protocols for the best-case scenario where the current strict socialdistancing protocols were assumed to be implemented right from the very beginning of the covid-19 pandemic in new york state march 1 2020 and the entire us january 20 2020 and maintained until early december 2020 the results obtained for the cumulative mortality recorded for new york state and the entire us are 25 000 and 60 000 respectively this represents 76 and 63 reductions respectively in the cumulative mortality for new york state and the entire us in comparison to the baseline scenario ie worst-case scenario where the socialdistancing and other community contacts-reduction strategies have not been implemented at the stringent levels blue curves in figures 4 a-f  furthermore if the social-distancing regimens were implemented on the days they were officially implemented in new york state march 22 2020 and the entire us march 16 2020 but maintained until early december 2020 the cumulative mortality to be recorded will be 55 000 and 75 500 this represents 48 and 53 reductions respectively in the cumulative mortality from the baseline magenta curves in figures 4 a-f  the effect of the timing of when to terminate the current strict social-distancing protocols was also monitored our simulations show that terminating the current strict social-distancing by the end of april 2020 ie the 40 reduction in the baseline value of  is now lost due to the termination of the social-distancing measures a significant rebound of covid-19 burden will be recorded in as early as july 2020 in particular new york state will record 144 000 deaths representing a 37 increase from the baseline scenario figure 4 a  while the entire us will record up to 156 000 deaths this represents a mere 5 reduction of cumulative mortality in relation to the baseline scenario figure 4 d  in other words the early termination of the current strict social-distancing measures by the end of april 2020 will result in catastrophic covid-19 burden similar to the dire projections made for the pre-social-distancing period ie all the gains of the social-distancing and other control and mitigation measures will essentially be lost however if the strict-distancing measures were to be terminated by the end of may 2020 the cumulative mortality figures are projected to be 91 800 for new york state and 118 300 for the entire us this represents a 13 and 28 reduction respectively in the baseline cumulative mortality figures 4  b and e finally if the social-distancing measures are terminated at the end of june 2020 the projection for the cumulative mortality figures are 33 200 for new york state and 50 300 for the entire us this represents 68 and 69 reductions respectively in the baseline cumulative mortality figures 4 c and f  these projected mortality numbers for the early termination of social-distancing fall within the range given by murphy et al 65  our study clearly shows that the clamor to relax or terminate the social-distancing measures that have proven to be hugely successful in both the state of new york and the entire us as part of the move to re-open the state and the country would undoubtedly trigger a devastating rebound of covid-19 in both new york state and the entire us data has already shown that certain countries that have relaxed the successfully-implemented social-distancing measures such as taiwan hong kong and south korea are now witnessing a rebound of covid-19 70  in particular hong kong announced 84 newly-confirmed cases on march 28 followed by over 70 new daily cases in the next three days further taiwan reported more than 20 newly-confirmed cases per day in mid-march up from barely 5 cases per day late in january south korea reported 83 newly-confirmed cases on april 3 2020 70  it is worth mentioning that the aforementioned simulations for the effect of social-distancing were carried out for the case where other interventions contact-tracing quarantine face-mask usage etc are also implemented at their baseline values in tables 3 and 4  if face-masks are not used then the above cumulative numbers will be even more catastrophic for instance if the strict social-distancing protocol is terminated in new york state by april 30 2020  and no face-mask-based intervention is implemented about 150 800 deaths will be recorded by july 2020 furthermore terminating the social-distancing protocols by end of may 2020 or end of june 2020 will result in projected 108 500 and 44 300 deaths respectively in the state the corresponding numbers for the entire us for the case where mask-based intervention is not implemented are projected to be 167 000 148 000 and 91 900 respectively thus this study strongly suggest that utmost caution should be exercised before terminating the current strict social-distancing protocols being implemented in the state of new york and nationwide at the very least a careful state-by-state or county-by-county phase withdrawal based on the updated covid-19 incidence mass testing data and proximity to covid-19 hot spots should be carried out the effect of quarantine of individuals suspected of being exposed to covid-19 is monitored by simulating the model 21 using the baseline parameter values and various levels of effectiveness of quarantine to prevent the acquisition of infection during quarantine  j  the results obtained depicted in figure 5  show that quarantine of susceptible individuals has only marginal impact in reducing covid-related hospitalizations for both new york state  figure 5 a  and the entire us  figure 5 b  in particular at the baseline quarantine efficacy  j  05 the state of new york will record 66 000 daily hospitalizations the implementation of a perfect quarantine in the state ie  j  0 reduces the number of hospitalizations marginally to 60 000 the numbers for the entire us for the baseline and perfect quarantine are 115 000 and 97 000 respectively the marginal effect of quarantine in minimizing covid-related hospitalizations is even more pronounced when the isolation strategy is perfect  figures  5 c and d  that is for the epidemiological scenario where the isolation or hospitalization of confirmed cases is perfect that is individuals in isolation at home or in hospital are not part of the actively-mixing population so that  q  1 the community-wide implementation of mass quarantine of individuals suspected of being exposed to covid-19 will have very marginal impact on covid-19 burden measured in terms of reductions in covid-19 hospitalizations this result is consistent with that reported in 71  thus this study suggests that since selfisolation and isolation in hospitals have been implemented at high effectiveness levels in both the state of new york and in the entire us the mass quarantine of suspected cases may not be a cost-effective public health strategy for combating the spread of covid-19 in both new york state and the entire us figures 5 c and d illustrate the dynamics of the model 21 for various effectiveness levels of quarantine and isolation for both new york state and the us further emphasizing the marginal nature of quarantine even for the cases where isolation was not implemented at a perfect level in minimizing covid-19 hospitalizations the effect of contact-tracing measured in terms of the detection of asymptomatic cases following testing diagnosis of a confirmed covid-19 case they may have had close contacts with or random testing on the transmission dynamics and control of the covid-19 pandemic is also monitored by simulating the model 21 using the baseline parameter values in table 3 and various values of the contact-tracing parameters  u and  a  in particular the simulations are run by increasing the values of  u and  a  simultaneously and by the same amount from their respective baseline values figure 6 depicts the solution profiles obtained showing the worst case scenario of 49 400 cases in the state of new york and 64 600 cases nationwide on the day the pandemic peaks on april 26 2020 if no contact tracing is implemented if implemented at its baseline rate contact tracing reduces the size of the pandemic peak number of new covid-19 cases by 27 for the state of new york and by 22 nationwide while a 75 improvement in contact-tracing will reduce the predicted number of confirmed cases to approximately 31 300 for the state of new york and 41 200 nationwide this represents 13 and 10 reduction from baseline and shows that while contact-tracing implemented even only at baseline is important in reducing the size of the pandemic peak number of new covid-19 cases investing much resources towards contact-tracing beyond the baseline rate might not be cost-effective simulations were further carried out to assess the population-level impact of the widespread use of masks in public by running the model 21 with various values of mask efficacy  m  and coverage c m  the results obtained depicted in figure 7  show a marked decrease in the number of hospitalizations for both new york state figures 7 a b and c and the entire us figures 7 d  e and f with increasing values of the mask efficacy and coverage further using an efficacious mask such as a mask of efficacy 50 can greatly flatten the pandemic curve in addition to significantly reducing the burden of the pandemic measured in this case in terms of hospitalizations however such a mask will fail to lead to the elimination of the disease figure 7 b  it is worth emphasizing that although the use of masks with low efficacy may not lead to disease elimination they still are highly useful by causing a significant decrease in the burden of the pandemic ie significantly reduce hospitalizations if a significant proportion of the populace wear them for instance if 75 of the populace in new york or the entire us wear masks with efficacy as low as 25 ie cloths masks the number of hospitalizations will be reduced by 63 and 64 respectively compared to the scenario were masks were not used figures 7  a and d  a contour plot of the reproduction number of the model r c  as a function of masks efficacy  m  and compliance c m  is depicted in figure 8  if masks of higher efficacy such as surgical masks with estimated efficacy  70 are used in the state of new york disease elimination is indeed feasible if at least 70 of the populace wear the masks figures 8 a and b  similar results were obtained for the entire us figures 8 c and d additional simulations were carried out to assess the combined impact of public face-masks use strategy and strict social-distancing strategy which reduces the baseline value of the community transmission parameter  by 40 on the control of covid-19 in new york state and the entire us the results obtained depicted in figure  9  show that combining the strict social-distancing strategy with a strategy based on using moderately-effective face-masks with efficacy  m  05 in public will lead to the elimination of the disease in new york state if only 30 of the population use face-masks in public figure 9 a  this clearly shows that disease elimination in new york state is more feasible if the face-masks-based strategy is combined with the strict social-distancing strategy similar results were obtained for the entire us figure 9 b where in this case only 10 compliance in mask usage in public will be needed for covid-19 elimination in summary the above simulations show that the use of face-masks even those with low efficacy but with high coverage in public offers significant community-wide impact in reducing and mitigating the burden of covid-19 in both new york state and the entire us in other words the use of low efficacy face masks with high coverage is always useful further combining the face-masks use strategy with a strategy based on the implementation of strict social-distancing is more effective in curtailing and eliminating covid-19 in comparison to the singular implementation of either strategy parameter values used are as given in tables 3 and 4  the world is currently experiencing a devastating pandemic of a novel coronavirus caused by sars-cov2 that emerged in wuhan city of china in december of 2019 the deadly covid-19 pandemic has spread to over 210 countries causing over 19 million cases and 125000 deaths worldwide with some parts of asia europe and now the us suffering the brunt of the burden there is currently no safe and effective vaccine for use in humans against covid-19 there is also no safe and effective antiviral consequently control and mitigation efforts against covid-19 are limited to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social-distancing which involves keeping a physical distance of at least 6 feet from other humans in public lockdowns of communities closure of schools malls places of worships and other gathering places quarantine of suspected cases contact-tracing isolation at home or in hospital of confirmed cases and the use of face masks both low quality cloth masks and the higher quality surgical masks in public this study is based on the design analysis and simulations of a new mathematical model for providing deeper insights into the transmission dynamics and control of covid-19 in a community specifically the model designed in this study was parametrized using covid-19 data from the us state of new york and the entire us population the model was used to assess the population-impact of the aforementioned control and mitigation interventions we parameterized the model using covid-19 data from new york state and the entire us and extensive numerical simulations were carried out using the parametrized model to assess the population-level impact of the various intervention strategies with the baseline levels of the four main intervention strategies considered socialdistancing quarantineisolation contact-tracing and the use of face-masks the state of new york is projected to see a peak of the pandemic around mid april 2020 with 66 300 number of hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases and 105 100 deaths at the peak while the entire us will see its peak around end of april 2020 with 115 000 hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases and 164 000 deaths at the peak our projections for baseline worst-case mortality for the us are much lower than the 22 million deaths suggested by ferguson et al in the absence of interventions 34  but fall within the range estimated in 65  our projected numbers for covid-19 burden morbidity and mortality dramatically decreases if strict social-distancing measures are implemented at high adherence levels for instance it was shown that strict compliance to the statewide lock-down in new york state which corresponds to reducing the baseline contact rate in our model by at least 40 will reduce the peak values for hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases and mortality by 92 and 80 respectively similarly the peak values for cases and mortality in the entire us if a nation-wide lockdown capable of reducing baseline contact rate by at least 40 will decrease by 88 and 64 respectively the duration and timing of the termination of strict social-distancing measures are critically-important in the battle to effectively combat pandemics of respiratory diseases such as the devastating covid-19 pandemic while the rapid implementation of strict social-distancing measures during the early stage of the pandemic maintained over a relatively long period of time eg until the summer will undoubtedly effectively combat the burden of the pandemic early termination of these measures will cause catastrophic outcomes for instance our study shows that relaxing or terminating the strict social-distancing measures in the state of new york and the us as a whole by end of april 2020 will trigger a devastating second wave generating covid-19 burden similar to those obtained during the pre-strict-social-distancing time in the state and in the entire nation by the end of july 2020 with cumulative mortality numbers in the range reported in 65 for both new york state and the entire us in particular up to 144 000 and 156 000 cumulative deaths will have been recorded in the state of new york and the entire us if the social-distancing measures are shut down by the end of april 2020 extending the termination of social-distancing such as to end of june 2020 significantly reduces the likelihood of a second wave in addition to significantly reducing the associated burden of the pandemic consequently a great deal of caution must be exercised before decisions are made to relax or terminate the existing highly-successful social-distancing protocols in both the state of new york and the entire us it is noteworthy that countries that have recently relaxed these measures such as taiwan hong kong and south korea have already started seeing a rebound of covid-19 our study suggests that the decision to relax or terminate the social-distancing measures should by on a case-bycase ie state-by-state or county-by-county basis and should be informed by updated covid-19 incidence and mortality data number of covid-19 tests both antibody and surveillance tests and proximity of a locality to covid-19 hot spots in particular our study shows that strict social-distancing should be maintained until the year 2021 up to late september 2021 for new york state and early march 2021 for the entire us to eliminate covid-19 quarantine of people suspected of being exposed to a respiratory disease is perhaps the oldest public health control measure in human history our study shows that widescale implementation of quarantine intervention may not be very effective in minimizing the burden of covid-19 if the strategy of isolating confirmed cases is effective in other words our study suggests that if isolation can be implemented effectively high efficacy and coverage then quarantine of people suspected of contracting covid-19 may not be necessary this result is consistent with what was reported by day et al 71  tracing the contacts of confirmed cases known as contacttracing was also shown to only be marginally-effective in minimizing the burden of the pandemic in particular even if contact-tracing is implemented at the highest possible level represented in our study based on increases in the contact-tracing parameters by 75 the decrease in the burden of the pandemic recorded was only marginal 13 and 10 for cases in new york state and nationwide respectively and 5 and 3 for mortality for new york state and nationwide respectively the use of face-masks in public in times of outbreaks of respiratory diseases has a rich history although quite popular in some parts of the world notably asia the use of face-masks in public is somewhat controversial this was more evident in the us during the covid-19 leading ultimately to the recommendation to use face-masks home-made cloths masks in public by the the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc on april 2 2020 our study shows that the use of high efficacy masks such as surgical masks with estimated efficacy of at least 70 will lead to a dramatic reduction of covid-19 burden if its coverage is high enough at least 70 in fact our study shows that even face-masks of low efficacy home-made cloths masks will lead to a dramatic reduction of disease burden albeit this will not lead to the elimination of the disease for example even face-mask efficacy of 25 can lead to a 63 and 64 reduction in the number of hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases at the pandemic peak in new york state and nationwide if 75 of the population wear face-masks in public these results are consistent with those reported by eikenberry et al 52  furthermore by generating contour plots for the control reproduction number of the model 21 r c  as a function of mask efficiency  m  and coverage c m  our study shows that the use of high efficacy masks such as surgical masks with estimated efficacy of  75 will indeed lead to the elimination of covid-19 in both the state of new york and in the entire us nation if the coverage is high enough about 80 this study shows that the use of face-masks in public is always useful and their population-level impact increases will increases efficacy and coverage in particular even the use of low efficacy masks will greatly reduce the burden of the pandemic if the coverage in their usage in the community is high enough furthermore our study shows that combining the masks-based strategy with the strict social-distancing strategy is more effective than the singular implementation of either strategy for instance our study shows that covid-19 can be eliminated from the state of new york if the strict social-distancing measures implemented are combined with a face-masks strategy using a moderately-effective mask with efficacy of about 50 if only 30 of the residents of the state wear the masks the masks use compliance needed to eliminate the disease nationwide under this scenario with strict social-distancing nationwide is a mere 10 in summary our study suggests that like in the case of the other coronaviruses we have seen in the past namely sars and mers 10  covid-19 is a disease that appears to be controllable using basic non-pharmaceutical interventions particularly social-distancing and the use of face-masks in public especially when implemented in combinations the factors that are obviously critically-important to the success of the anti-covid-19 control efforts are the early implementation and enhancement of effectiveness of these intervention measures and ensuring their high adherencecoverage in the community  love in the time of covid-19 sexual function and quality of life analysis during the social distancing measures in a group of italian reproductive-age women michele schiavi carlo vincenzo spina marzio zullo angelo vanessa colagiovanni paolo luffarelli rocco rago pierluigi palazzetti   the coronavirus-2019 covid-19 represents the cause of the pandemic that is currently affecting worldwide since the first reports of cases from wuhan a city in the hubei province of china at the end of 2019 the disease has spread rapidly across the world1 covid-19 similarly to the virus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is a beta-coronavirus that can be spread to humans through intermediate hosts such as bats2 the coronavirus covid-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge we have faced since world war ii actually more than 3800000 confirmed cases of covid-19 with 265000 new deaths have been reported3
 the mortality rate declared by who is around 2 unfortunately older age was associated with increased mortality with a case fatality rate of 815 among those aged 70 to 79 years and 80 years or older respectively4

5 covid-19 is much more than a health crisis it has the potential to create devastating social economic and political crises that will leave deep scars to date in italy a total of 215000 positive cases of coronavirus and 30000 people dead have been recorded with an evident increasing trend3

6
 italy is therefore the third most affected country in the world for the number of infected and dramatically the second for the number of deaths after the united states among the first containment measures implemented by our government 11 municipalities in the north of italy were quarantined despite this the spread continued aggressively and on 11th march the restriction and social distancing measures were extended to the whole nation these measures aimed to ensure the social distance between people avoiding the people aggregation most of the services and commercial activities have been closed and in open services the social distance between individuals of at least 1 meter must be guaranteed with protective masks7

8 however although these procedures serve to decrease the spread of the virus people are experiencing suddenly a change in their daily routine limiting many personal and work activities it is understandable that during this time people may experience increased anxiety and stress levels as they limit social interactions and spend long periods at home9 previous research has shown a significant psychosocial impact on people during times of global epidemic10
 anxiety and fear over personal health or the health of loved ones are typical reactions to a global pandemic other feelings can include anger frustration and boredom over the uncertainty of when life will return to normal in high-stress situations and loneliness some people may experience symptoms of depression or post-traumatic stress disorder11
 sexual function is influenced by multiple factors that impact the emotional or hormonal aspect12 furthermore in several studies parity level of education lifestyle and work are some of the characteristics who could influence sexual life currently in the literature there are no data regarding the change in sexual function during the social restriction period however the stressful period has been linked to female reproduction by contrast much less research attention has been focused on the relationship between stress and sexual functioning both psychological and physiological components can potentially be involved in the relationship between stress and sexual function13 the evidence of the negative effects of stress on sexual function is consistent and the mechanisms involved in this relationship are not well defined14 several studies document the hormonal mechanisms involved in the suppression of reproductive function by both acute and chronic stressors psychologically stress can interfere with sexual activity through both emotional and cognitive changes that distract the individual from focusing on sexual cues this distraction from sexual stimuli would result in lower levels of arousal because the women experiencing higher levels of stress may not be attending to the sexual stimuli at the same level of participants with lower levels of stress distraction from sexual cues has been shown to have deleterious effects on both genital and subjective arousal in women15 probably the fear of contagion the stressful situation and the change in daily life may hurt the sexual activity of the women examined16 this study aims to evaluate the modification of sexual function in an italian reproductive-age women group during covid-19 pandemic period is an observation analysis of reproductive age women referred to the department of gynecological and obstetric of sandro pertini hospital of rome to physiopathology of reproduction and andrology unit sandro pertini hospital of rome and to pelvic floor surgery and proctology department of campus biomedico university of rome between february 2018 and february 2020 who had completed specific questionnaires to assess sexuality and quality of life during their first visit 4 weeks after the introduction of the social distancing measures due to the covid-19 outbreak they were invited to respond to the questionnaires again all data were evaluated from a gynecological and urogynecological internal database the research was conducted according to good clinical practice guidelines strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology strobe guidelines the institutional review board approved the study the women enrolled in the study were visited for the first time at the aforementioned departments for several reasons gynecological check-up urogynaecological diseases contraception required infertility and pelvic control ultrasound all women had completed the specific sexual function and quality of live questionnaires female sexual function index fsfi and the female sexual distress scale fsds questionnaires for the sexual function evaluation and the 36-item short form survey sf-36 for the quality of life assessment at the time of the visit as we usually propose17 18 19
 during the covid-19 epidemic period at least 4 weeks after the introduction of the restrictive measures given the impossibility of returning to the specific outpatient these women were invited to answer the same questionnaire to re-evaluate sexual function and quality of life questions were sent by e-mail to avoid the telephone interview that could influence the answers of the women interviewed a time limit of 3 days was offered to respond to the questionnaires the inclusion criteria were as follows women in reproductive age 1845 years old sexually active women who live with them not infected with covid-19 virus a compilation of fsfi fsds and sf-36 previously at least 4 weeks before the covid-19 epidemic period and the introduction of the restrictive measures signature of informed consent and consent to the processing of health data for research purposes the exclusion criteria were as follows no sexually active women under the age of 18 or over 45 covid-19 positivity sexual partner with covid-19 infection superficial and profound dyspareunia women with chronic pelvic pain deep endometriosis or interstitial cystitisbladder pain syndrome neurogenic bladder gynecological cancer or urological cancer history of pelvic radiotherapy pelvic organ prolapse  grade 3 according to pop-q classification pregnancy menopause premature ovarian failure pof all the gynecological urological and oncological diseases diagnosed in the period between the first and the second compilation of the questionnaires which may have influenced sexual life and quality of life no signature of informed consent the definition of sexual activity was as follows sexual intercourse between women and the partner defined as penile penetration of the vagina we have not rated solitary sex or nonpenetrative sex unfortunately the data related to autoeroticism and nonpenetrative sex were missing in the pre-covid period and therefore were not collected for analysis nonsexually active women mean the absence of sexual intercourse during the analyzed period all the e-mails containing the questionnaires were received by a single author mcs who systematically entered the data in a shared database anonymously for the patients respecting the current privacy rules demographic and individual characteristics age work educational level contraception parity smoking were analyzed to assess the possible correlation with the change in sexual function during the epidemic period all the women analyzed live in the same house with their partner the selection of women characteristics who can influence sexual function has been extrapolated from the available data in the database the primary endpoint was the assessment of change in womens sexual function during the government-imposed social restriction period due to the covid-19 virus epidemic by analyzing the frequency of sexual intercourse fsfi and fsds questionnaires the secondary endpoint was the evaluation of the impact of these social restriction rules on the quality of life calculated with the sf-36 questionnaire women who did not respond to all parts of the questionnaires were excluded from the analysis the incidence of events was analyzed for statistical significance by using the fisher exact test odds ratio or and 95 confidence intervals cis were calculated for each comparison the t-test and mann-whitney u test were used to compare continuous parametric and nonparametric variables when the data do not fit into the normal distribution respectively correlations between numerical parameters were computed using the spearman rank correlation coefficient paired t-test was applied to determine the change in questionnaires fsfi fsds and sf-36 values univariable and multivariable analysis through a logistic regression anova was used to assess the predictive value and relative risk of specific variables all analyses were conducted using the statistical package for the social sciences spss 220 for mac ssps chicago il significance was set at a p-value of 05 254 patients were enrolled in the study 101 were excluded from the analysis because they did not meet the proposed inclusion criteria 11 refused to participate and 53 were lost to follow-up figure 1
 therefore 89 patients were considered for the final analysis the median age was 39 2850 years the other baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in table 1
 overall the mean number of sexual intercoursesmonth decreased significantly from 63  19 to 23  18 39  12 p  0001 and 8 9 women did not have sexual intercourse during the month of social restriction the number of women who practiced 4 sexual intercoursesmonth 4 weeks after the introduction of the social distancing measures due to the covid-19 outbreak decreased from 89 100 to 52 584 p  023 and the women who had 8 sexual intercoursesmonth decreased from 31 348 vs 8 9 p  0007 median fsfi was 285 before the covid-19 period while during the containment measures it was 197 the total fsfi score decreased significantly 292  42 vs 192  33 97  26 p  0001 the change of specific items desire arousal lubrication orgasm satisfaction and pain is shown in table 2
 the fsds score increased significantly during the social distancing period from 93  55 to 201  52 108  34 p  0001 quality of life assessment with the sf-36 questionnaire showed a significant change 822  102 vs 642  117 178  67 p  0001 the subanalysis in 60 women working outside the home compared with 29 women working in the home showed a significant difference in the mean number of sexual intercoursesmonth 23  13 vs 68  21 p  04 for the fsfi score 183  33 vs 244  45 p  0001 for the fsds score 211  51 vs 187  48 p  04 and the sf-36 622  118 vs 702  113 p  003 during the covid-19 outbreak the subanalysis in 41 women with university education level compared to 48 women with nonuniversity education level showed a significant difference in the mean number of sexual intercoursesmonth 31  14 vs 57  19 p  03 for the fsfi score 187  43 vs 221  48 p  0008 for the sf-36 611  120 vs 675  118 p  014 but no significant difference for the fsds score 217  46 vs 199  43 p  06 during the covid-19 outbreak the subanalysis in 68 women who have 1 child compared with 21 childless women showed a significant difference for the fsfi score 178  47 vs 224  43 p  002 and no significant difference in the mean number of sexual intercoursesmonth 46  18 vs 51  22 p  70 for the fsds score 222  44 vs 207  49 p  17 and the sf-36 621  117 vs 652  101 p  28 during the covid-19 outbreak finally women taking oral contraceptives 35 393 showing no significant difference in sexual function or quality of life compared to 54 607 women who do not take them considering factors influencing the fsfi score the univariable analysis identified working outside the home university educational level and parity 1 as predictive factors of lower fsfi score independent risk factors for low sexual function by multiple logistic regression analyses are shown in table 3
 after adjusting all those variables in multivariable analysis working outside the home and combination of working outside the home  university educational level  parity 1 were the independent factors of a lower fsfi after 4 weeks from the beginning of the covid-19 period the study showed a decrease in sexual function and quality of life in reproductive-age women during the social restriction period due to the covid-19 epidemic despite the longer cohabitation time women who live with their partners have reduced significantly the sexual activity specifically women who practiced 4 sexual intercourse a month before government measures decreased from 89 100 to 52 584 social distancing measures imposed must be respected to try to decrease the infections and deaths smart-working is raised interpersonal relationships have decreased but people had to adapt and understand that it is extremely useful for the whole population nevertheless in this atmosphere of generalized alarm the way of life is inevitably changed this social restriction and the uncertainty about the future have an impact on peoples quality of life and sexual function20 the main psychological impact to date is caused by high rates of stress and depression anxiety and dissatisfaction9

21
 in times of high stress sexual activity can be reduced more in women who do not have a partner at home because the distancing measures prohibit going out12 however as demonstrated in our results women who live with their partners also suffer from negative influences from the external environment and showed a significantly lower fsfi and sf-36 scores during the covid-19 epidemic also the increase in sexual distress negatively affects womens quality of life this worsening probably is due to the emotional impact caused by the emergency on the women psychology9
 during the initial phase of the covid-19 outbreak in china female gender student status and specific physical symptoms were associated with a greater psychological impact and higher levels of stress anxiety and depression22 the psychological trauma is felt by the health workers surprisingly in the non-frontline chinese nurses and the general public severity was significantly higher than the frontline nurses who are in close contact with covid-19 patients therefore people confined to home far from a real perception of the epidemiological situation also experience generalized fear21 certainly as already proposed in china during the forced quarantine the introduction of specific health information and some precautionary measures including psychological support has been linked to a lower level of stress anxiety and depression and a better psychological outcome11 unfortunately in the present study there are no data on the association between psychometric alteration and sexual activity in fact the analyzed women had not completed psychological tests the decrease in the average number of sexual intercourses during an extreme stress period depends on several variables23

24 peoples priorities have certainly changed and sexual arousal and relationship status are influenced by the surrounding environment inevitably women tend to decrease sexual activity during this period sometimes with a significant impact on marital life above all if the stressful period is prolonged25

26
 therefore the panic of contagion fear of having contact with the partner working outside the home 30 of our population reported partner working outside the home during the epidemic period anxiety and depression compromise daily life furthermore less body care during the quarantine may have affected the reduction of desire the sexual dysfunction measured by fsfi was found in 67 of the sample associated with a sedentary lifestyle27 in the present study women working outside the home during the covid-19 outbreak period showed a greater reduction in sexual function and fsfi and sf-36 scores than in women working in the home these results could be explained by the greater exposure of these women to the external environment and therefore to the possibility of infecting the sexual partner indeed the desire is significantly reduced in this group of women14
 a significant difference was also observed between university educational level vs nonuniversity educational level women women who had a higher level of education showed a greater decline in terms of sexual activity and quality of life perhaps the greater propensity for critical reading of pandemic information strict compliance with the rules and a higher percentage of women working outside the home into the group could affect sexual desire and quality of life21

28 parity 1 was another factor influencing negatively fsfi due to the constant and demanding presence of children at home which could reduce sexual desire we excluded pregnant women because it has already been widely demonstrated that pregnancy significantly diminishes sexual function in women29 probably facing a stressful period reduces sexual desire and quality of life the activation of psychological and sexual assistance programs can be useful in women who will not be able to solve the problem after the end of quarantine but the end of social restrictions and the return to normal daily life will be essential to restore womens psychological balance the acute stress caused by the governments social restriction measures to contain covid-19 infections has worsened sexual function and quality of life in women living with their partners probably due to the inability to adapt quickly to a significant change in daily life this deterioration may be due to the emotional impact caused by the emergency although sexual activity is not the main concern during the covid-19 emergency period it is a key aspect of womens lives23

30 to our knowledge this is the first study in the literature that analyzes the change in sexual function in women of reproductive age during the covid-19 pandemic surely it would be very interesting to evaluate the correlation between restriction measures and the relational aspect with the partner but the present study is essentially aimed at assessing sexual function and frequency of sexual intercourse therefore the main limitations of the study were the low number of participants analyzed psychological tests were not included and data on masturbation self-heroism solitary and nonpenetrative sex were not collected also the emotional relationship and affectivity within the couple were not evaluated further prospective studies on a larger number of women are needed to confirm these results and any possible change in the national birth rate due to a reduction in sexual activity

  coronavirus and international business an entrepreneurial ecosystem perspective vanessa ratten   the covid19 coronavirus pandemic has presented unique problems and opportunities for international business and entrepreneurship as parnell et al 2020 p 1 states the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 lays bare the society we have created centuries of global processes and the cultivated networked society and its interdependent infrastructural architecture no region of the world has not been impacted by the virus and there does not seem to be any distinction between developed and developing countries in terms of the effects of the virus world health organization 2020 while there has been other health pandemics that have affected the global economy the uncertainty caused by covid19 has resulted in new ways of looking at entrepreneurship liguori and winkler 2020 other health pandemics such as the middle east respiratory syndrome and ebola have affected specific geographic regions while coronavirus has had global consequences this means a new way of understanding how entrepreneurship results in times of heightened uncertainty is needed in addition the quick progression of coronavirus has resulted in significant cultural social and business change from a cultural perspective it has altered societal practices most notably in the form of social distancing due to the highly contagious nature of the disease individuals were told to practice social distancing which meant maintaining a physical space when in the presence of others this has led to a reliance more on online rather than physical communication while there are many disadvantages associated with physical distancing such as the inability to read nonverbal cues it has created advantages in the new form of communication made possible from digital technologies this has emphasized more the use of digital devices and communication methods to exchange ideas it can also be easier to communicate online rather than in a physical form due to geographic reasons this has led to increased usages of streaming facilities that has further intensified societies need for digitalization qian 2018 from a social perspective there has been a dramatic reduction in group activities this has been an unprecedented event due to the way it has changed communities there is now more emphasis on individual rather than group activity this is not to say group activities do not exist as they do but in a new format since coronavirus first emerged in january 2020 it has quickly spread to become a health issue of global importance unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome sars which was largely concentrated in asia coronavirus has had a huge effect on europe and north america this resulted in businesses shutting down and individuals confined to their homes the new normal now refers to a lifestyle that encompasses social distancing and more emphasis on personal hygiene from a business perspective largescale events have been cancelled this has dramatically impacted the tourism and hospitality industries moreover most countries have instituted bans on group activities and this has led to largescale events being cancelled as entertainment sport and music events have become part of individuals lives this change has substantially affected the events industry in addition the flow on effect to activities such as tourism and food purchases has stopped as this happened quickly for most event organizers there was no chance to instigate alternative events at home events such as live streaming of music in the musicians home are becoming popular thus entrepreneurship and entrepreneurs are needed to develop new types of events based on the environmental context the coronavirus pandemic is predicted to have worse economic effects than the 2008 global financial crisis the objective of this article is to discuss the implications for international business and entrepreneurship derived from the coronavirus pandemic the key research question for this article is how do international entrepreneurs navigate the coronavirus pandemic to answer this question the next section will further discuss the role of crisis management in influencing entrepreneurial behavior based on responses to the coronavirus previous research on crisis management has tended to focus on natural disasters or financial events grewal  tansuhaj 2001 this has limited the current literature to crises that occur as a result of economic or weather related factors while there is some research about health crises the research tends to take a more narrow view of issues that in a way progress in a slow manner entrepreneurship literature has discussed crises management but more from an economic rather than a behavioral perspective as the current crises is still ongoing there needs to be more attention paid to how entrepreneurs attitudes and behaviors are changing based on creativity innovation and futuristic decisionmaking this will help to understand how resilient entrepreneurs are as they cope with the global uncertainty a crisis can be described as a phenomenon that does not occur often has a high level of uncertainty and impacts society a crisis generates a sense of urgency in how to respond to the situation crises can differ in length type and magnitude depending on its impact on society in order to respond to crises there needs to be coordination among stakeholders natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes and bushfires tend to be a oneoff event that occur based on specific environmental circumstances this means that while they continually occur they are typically sporadic and can be controlled with the use of interventions other types of crises such as technological disasters such as computer bugs have serious effects on business but the origin is known and easier to deal with firms from a management perspective governmentlevel crises such as political deadlocks or changes in leadership can have a large effect on the stability of a country health crises are harder to understand as they are typically infrequent and unpredictable thus health crises can be characterized as a black swan in that they are unexpected but have severe consequences bogle  sullivan 2009 black swan events are characterized as being surprising of great significance and having a major economic effect kuckertz et al 2020 recent health crises have included the ebola crisis which affected the centralwestern african region in terms of income level manufacturing and food processing cortez and johnston 2020 in addition the sars epidemic had a negative effect on production and sourcing of supplies however the coronavirus is a more aggressive pandemic that has affected most regions of the world in addition the consequences of the pandemic have resulted in changing workplace and societal practices that have previously not occurred before the global nature of the pandemic has meant a concurrent effect on most health systems thus the focus has been on treating patients based on available information while at the same time trying to safeguard current citizens the sudden effect of the pandemic represents an opportunity for entrepreneurs to develop quickly necessary products and services the coronavirus crisis has threatened the ability of a business to conduct is activities due to social policies being introduced such as working from home and social distancing this combination has made it difficult for many businesses particularly those in the service economy to survive in addition the cash flow of many businesses has substantially changed in a short time frame some businesses most notably supermarkets and technology companies have flourished but also faced difficulties in terms of high customer demands and supply chain difficulties crises also result in market turbulence due to changes in routines and structures williams gruber sutcliffe shepherd  zhao 2017 businesses that have established specific capabilities based on the continuance of current market circumstances have had to dramatically reevaluate their decisions few businesses would have been prepared for the current health crises despite having risk management and resilience strategies in place the concept of resilience has been studied in the entrepreneurship literature in terms of understanding how business adapt or resist change doern williams  vorley 2019 resilience incorporates a sense of innovativeness in terms of being able to change business activity in addition innovative businesses tend to be able to anticipate and then adjust to change in an appropriate way this enables them to pivot or change direction depending on market need crises have had a profound effect on businesses particularly small businesses that rely on weekly projections in order to maintain their market share the unpredictability resulting from crisis means an increased need for government assistance and support the ecosystems metaphor was first used by moore 1993 to describe the competitive marketplace in terms of predators and prey this language was a way of understanding the strengths and weaknesses of firms in the economic environment as there are firms that are acquired by others this terminology is a useful way of describing the process it took some time for the concept of entrepreneurial ecosystems to gain popularity in the marketplace due to the emphasis on other ways to describe innovative activities occurring in a place the concept of an entrepreneurial ecosystem is an important way of understanding the effects at the present time and in the future as a result of the coronavirus audretsch et al 2019 p 314 states the metaphor ecosystem reflects the tendency in academia to describe the old phenomena of agglomeration effects of regions urban regional national ecosystem and industries agriculture chemical manufacturing media finance ecosystems that is clusters either of firms business entrepreneurial ecosystems or activities service innovation digital ecosystems traditionally there has been a tendency to focus on an individual entrepreneur or organization rather than considering their contextual environment this has changed with an increased awareness of how the environment affects entrepreneurship particularly as a result of crisis such as the coronavirus an ecosystem is broadly defined as a purposeful collaborating network of dynamic interacting systems that have an everchanging set of dependencies within a given context sussan  acs 2017 p 57 this means that in an ecosystem a variety of entities are required in order for it to function in a proper manner this requires interaction among entities that encourages collaboration and information sharing with regard to current events including critical incidents such as the coronavirus within an ecosystem there are different types and levels of information flow depending on the entrepreneurial cycle ecosystems have a dynamic nature as they change based on environmental conditions this means to truly understand how an entrepreneurial ecosystem evolves requires a great deal of time and effort this is due to the way the interactions in an ecosystem determine the effect of a crisis natural ecosystems are defined as a community of living organisms in conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment where the eco part of the word is assumed to be related to the environment and system implies the function as a collection of related parts that function as a unit smith  smith 2015 p 19 this definition highlights the interaction between science and business from the coronavirus entrepreneurial ecosystems are based on the selforganization of members around entrepreneurial pursuits and in times of crisis are important ways to cope with change this means that as more members become involved in entrepreneurship the ecosystem acts in a sustainable way this enables more entrepreneurial action to take place based on the embedded interactions between stakeholders affected by the coronavirus in order to grow an entrepreneurial ecosystem there needs to be strategies put in place in order for more entities to succeed in entrepreneurial pursuits acs et al 2014 p 479 define an entrepreneurial ecosystem as a dynamic institutionally embedded interaction between entrepreneurial attitudes abilities and aspirations by individuals which drives the allocation of resources through the creation and operation of new ventures this definition is particularly relevant for how to deal with the crisis derived from the coronavirus the main components of an entrepreneurial ecosystem include a community culture sustaining networks and infrastructure thus there is no single formula for an entrepreneurial ecosystem rather it relies on environmental forces for its development this means some entrepreneurial ecosystems will be more efficient in offering ways to deal with the coronavirus due to the expansion of entrepreneurial activities therefore the trajectory of a region is dependent on the existence of entrepreneurial ecosystems that encourage new venture creation most conceptualizations of ecosystems are based on the assumption that they contain similar entities this is not always true as entrepreneurs have different access to resources depending on socioeconomic factors and impact of crises this means the participation and involvement in an ecosystem will be based on opportunity as well as necessity platform ecosystems are based on companies generating a set of tools that can be built upon by others this can include integrated technologies that reduce the need for research and development by sharing knowledge about the coronavirus infrastructure refers to the portfolio of public goods that facilitates entrepreneurship infrastructure includes highways ports and telecommunications that are normally managed by government entities other forms of infrastructure include education institutions and research facilities that are funded by the government in an ecosystem these forms of infrastructure are utilized as a form of concurrent activities that occur based on environmental changes from the coronavirus over time these activities either align or diverge depending on the involvement of ecosystem members an ecosystem approach to entrepreneurship has been embraced due to the way it captures the evolving and dynamic nature of entrepreneurship there are many different forces that influence entrepreneurship that are constantly changing based on environmental conditions this means more policy makers and business leaders are trying to handle the coronavirus based on an entrepreneurial ecosystem philosophy a vibrant ecosystem is the result of many activities that support innovation and new venture creation in order to support high levels of entrepreneurial activity in a region there needs to be a number of activities occurring on a constant basis that focus on problem solving for the coronavirus this includes learning and information sharing that helps foster innovative behavior the main attributes of a vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem includes deep reservoirs of early stage investments entrepreneurshipspecific human capital cutting edge research institutions lead users of innovations dense social networks among entrepreneurs and cultural orientations that are supportive of entrepreneurial activities roundy 2019 p 4 early stage investment is needed in a region in order to foster innovative projects regarding the coronavirus this helps designate money to causes that are likely to have a positive flow on effect in the economy due to the uncertainty of some innovations regarding the coronavirus it helps to have a foothold in a number of early stage projects this reduces the risk associated with just one project by sharing the costs and time involved among multiple projects this risk reduction strategy enables investors to have a more diverse investment portfolio in terms of potential cures or vaccines for coronavirus thereby sharing both the financial and nonfinancial gains or losses human capital is required in entrepreneurial ventures that require proactive individuals to take initiative in developing business ventures the type of human capital needed differs from scientific knowledge in the case of medical technologies to more generalist business knowledge associated with startups as human capital involves specific skills it is important that regions encourage individuals with these skill sets to reside there this can build capacity in certain topic areas and facilitate further entrepreneurial activity some regions are known for the industries that are located there which provides a motivation for individuals interested in those regions to move there other regions establish themselves based on specific skill sets of people residing in the area that are suited to specific occupations this includes areas that have a high level of engineers or scientists thus entrepreneurshipspecific human capital needs to be considered based on the regional and industry context depending on the severity of the coronavirus cutting edge research institutions encourage entrepreneurship through breakthrough innovations in order to bring about societal change there needs to be major innovations that change the status quo this helps drive competitiveness by introducing improved products services or processes research institutions enable science and education to transform current ways of thinking they also provide ways for individuals to learn about new practices that has flow on effects to other sectors of the economy this means it is important to foster the knowledgepractice association that is made possible by research institutions the investment that governments place on research institutions also has positive flow on effects in other areas of society this includes new inventions being made that have commercial potential due to the increased emphasis on the knowledge economy it is important that research institutions are given priority in government funding coronavirus schemes in addition more research institutions are becoming selffunded due to a need to diversity their income sources this enables less reliance on government funding and more emphasis on business partnerships lead users of innovations are entities that are among the first to try new products services or processes these first adopters help to test an innovation by providing necessary feedback this helps encourage related innovations to take place that enables a platform system to emerge being a firstmover in an industry is important and provides a way for entities to gain a reputation for being innovative dense social networks among entrepreneurs enable ideas to be circulated more easily this fosters information acquisition that is important in a knowledge economy obtaining access to relevant information in a timely basis is useful for competitive reasons therefore entrepreneurs who continually engage in networking activities can help encourage further entrepreneurship this means it is important to have events that enable entrepreneurs to interact with each other by providing relevant social forums it can speed up the innovation process as innovation can be the result of both planned and unplanned activities it helps to have continual networking activity this will foster by chance occurrences to happen among entrepreneurs thereby paving the way for more focus on proactive activities that involve innovation cultural orientations refer to the way entities want to learn about historical events or societal conditions this is useful in promoting a sense of inquisitiveness among individuals in a community in an ecosystem there needs to be a diverse range of entities coexisting in order for it to work properly this includes a variety of industries that may or may not be complementary in most successful ecosystems there tends to be one dominant industry that has influenced its development normally the technology industry is referred to as being the originator of entrepreneurship but other industries such as manufacturing can also induce entrepreneurship needed to cope with the coronavirus for this reason ecosystems should also have industries at different development stages in order to create a more entrepreneurial environment this includes historically necessary industries such as banking and finance as well as new funding sources such as crowdsourcing this will enable older businesses to coexist with newer forms of business as it may take some time for new businesses to gain momentum in the market it helps to be patient with their development regarding coronavirus although there is a stereotype of entrepreneurial ventures launching quickly in reality it can take time for them to grow this is due to the businesses having different objectives in terms of growth strategy while most entrepreneurs are motivated by financial reasons there can also be social or environmental reasons ecosystems can be measured in terms of their connectivity density diversity and fluidity nambisan  baron 2013 connectivity means how well linked are different entities in an ecosystem some entities might communicate on a frequent basis but this needs to also be analyzed in terms of performance results if the connection results in a good outcome then it is likely to be referred to in a good way this means the quality versus the quantity of the communication should be assessed density refers to how many entities are part of the ecosystem environment in a highly dense ecosystem there are many different entities that are constantly engaged in entrepreneurship this results in an economy of scale and can produce more entrepreneurial business ventures diversity refers to the different types of entities in an ecosystem diversity can be measured in terms of size such as micro small medium and large businesses or alternatively different industry structures such as technology or retail other ways to define diversity include ethnicity or country of origin more diverse entities in an ecosystem are likely to be considered as necessary for entrepreneurship this is due to different views and ways of conducting entrepreneurship becoming apparent fluidity refers to the flow of entrepreneurship in an ecosystem in wellfunctioning ecosystems there is a continual flow of information and knowledge this helps to create a productive environment for entrepreneurship coronavirus has significantly affected international business particularly in terms of free movement across countries so taking an entrepreneurial ecosystem approach is useful regional trading blocs including the european union which were based on the idea of free movement between countries has changed due to individual countries closing their borders most notably countries like spain have banned travel between their neighboring countries while at the same time maintaining european union membership due to increased levels of internationalization because of both work family and lifestyle reasons the impact of these closed borders has been significant global society has become used to frequent international travel and interaction so border closures have been a surprising development as a result international institutions have had to deal with the pandemic at a country regional and international manner as international business and travel have been assumed to continue regardless of social change the health pandemic has surprised many people social interaction in a physical format is important for building a more cohesive international society thus the limitations placed on travel as a result of the virus have led to a deinternationalization strategy for many countries in addition to the large decrease in international travel has been the associated economic and political effects blame is being placed on governments for how they have dealt with the crises which is further fuelling international tensions due to the infectious nature of the disease there has been a ban in many countries on mass gatherings as global society is largely networked there has been further effects on business activity the sport industry is one of the most effected by the restrictions put in place because of the virus almost all professional sport events including the olympics were cancelled due to the virus the efforts to make travel effortless across geographic borders have been put at risk due to the virus in a time when there has been unprecedented international travel the travel restrictions have profoundly affected individuals particularly for international students this has been an area of concern as they have faced economic and social hardships for many individuals their economic and social life has been brought to a standstill because of the restrictions from the virus some countries have stayathome orders in place which have severely restricted movement in addition there are expected to be high economic psychological and social costs associated with the physical distancing restrictions in order to soften the impact of the virus governments have provided cash payments and income protection plans to those in need however many areas of the economy such as the informal sector are not eligible for government support this has increased the income inequality and associated economic effects for certain segments of society entrepreneurs are agents of change and provide a source of hope for many in order to spur economic activity entrepreneurs are needed as they come up with solutions to market problems there are indirect effects from the crisis including export and import delays which is affecting global trade coronavirus has resulted in more stress and tensions in the international business environment the stress has come from the changes needed to stay competitive while at the same time protecting individual health businesses have had to change their models to an online format in order to access customers for many businesses based on traditional face to face interaction this has required a change in current business practices some more entrepreneurial businesses have been able to transform more quickly than others as a result of environmental changes the reason for this is the desire of the business leaders to stay in the marketplace while respecting required regulations this has caused much tension among businesses due to the need to change quickly entrepreneurs by definition thrive from uncertainty however the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a large amount of uncertainty from a variety of sources this means there is still uncertainty about whether future changes are required or if the changes made are adequate in the past most entrepreneurship was based on market uncertainty but the current pandemic includes market health and social uncertainty this combination requires strong leadership about the changes needed by business coronavirus is a zoonotic disease which means it originated in animals then spread to humans there is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the origins of the disease that is causing increased tension in the world the lack of knowledge about how to potentially find a cure or vaccine is leading to further stress as people are spending greater amounts of time online it has changed the way businesses market their services social media and in particularly online communities are a way that businesses are connecting with their customers people now have more time to spend on artistic or creative ventures so they are establishing social media pages the large amount of people previously in socially interactive positions such as baristas tourism operators and musicians now need to find another social outlet online communities and forums have flourished as a safe way of interacting with other individuals in addition new types of products such as facemasks are being made to cater for changing societal needs initially the effects of the virus were dismissed by global political leaders due to mistaken belief in its impact gosling scott  hall 2020 the lockdown measures in wuhan china were expected to be sufficient to health the spread of the virus this did not occur due to global travel carrying the virus to other parts of the world in addition mass public gatherings including sport and music events further spread the virus due to the role of community transmission played in the increased number of individuals with the virus social distancing policies were put in place due to the lack of medical technology to treat the virus other interventions including home isolation and quarantine began the severity of these restrictions differed depending on the geographic location of an individual countries like australia closed its borders to nonresidents and instigated a mandatory twoweek hotel stay for all new arrivals in the country in addition state borders in australia were closed in order to further restrict travel and contain the virus these closures were unprecedented as never before have the borders between states in australia been shut this resulted in simultaneous state and federal government policies regarding the virus with many countries imposing travel bans economic activity weakened due to the uncertainty in the business environment the virus closed most tourism and hospitality places including hotels restaurants and pubs this is in contrast to previous media attention on overtourism and saturation of the tourism market within a couple of months from when the virus first originated there has been an unprecedented shut down of many sectors of the economy the flow on effects particularly to the informal economy has also been profound this has meant the food industry instead of offering on site services have had to switch to offering take away services this affected their supply chain in terms of the types of products and services they provided an alternative possibility is that overall entrepreneurial activity in the global economy may not be adversely affected by coronavirus this is likely not to be true due to the profound way coronavirus has changed societal structures although the nature of entrepreneurship as a result of coronavirus may undergo a fundamental change with more entrepreneurial thinking required to meet society needs for this reason it is important that entrepreneurs design their ventures with safety and security in mind this will enable a number of ventures to be started that address consumers concerns about the health crisis part of this change requires asking if the entrepreneurship is actually different to precoronavirus forms or is the same this will enable a better understanding about how pandemics affect entrepreneurship and the ability of entrepreneurs to cope with multiple pressures unlike other crises the coronavirus crisis has resulted in entrepreneurs being able to respond quickly to multiple needs thus an important issue for entrepreneurs is whether consumers concerns about the pandemic will lead to more entrepreneurship based on safety and security thereby creating a need for further innovative activity  a multi-hazards earth science perspective on the covid-19 pandemic the potential for concurrent and cascading crises mark quigley c januka attanayake andrew king fabian prideaux   the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and its associated coronavirus disease covid-19 emerged from probable zoonotic origin from chinas hubei province in early december 2019 the virus and disease are collectively referred to as covid-19 in this paper covid-19 rapidly spread around the world and was declared a pandemic by the world health organization who on 11 march 2020 httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019events-as-they-happen as of 29 april 2020 the john hopkins university coronavirus dashboard httpscoronavirusjhuedumaphtml reports more than 31 million confirmed infections and more than 217200 fatalities globally this paper uses quantitative and qualitative measures to assess the likelihood of natural hazards coinciding with and influencing epidemiological characteristics of the covid-19 pandemic natural hazard curves for seasonal eg tropical cyclone floods heat waves monsoons tornadoes hazards are plotted against covid-19 time-series forecasts fig 1 stochastic eg earthquakes volcanic eruptions hazards are also considered in a general sense but not specifically analysed the effects of these natural hazards on human life depends on the severity of the hazard the exposure of humans and infrastructure to it the vulnerability of exposed elements and the ability to respond and recover covid-19 has the potential to significantly impact the exposure vulnerability and response elements associated with natural disasters and vice-versa thereby requiring a systems approach to analyse risk and resilience eg simonovic 2011 harrison and william 2016 approaches to mitigating covid-19 risks share some commonalities with natural disaster mitigation for example enacting social distancing protocols to reduce covid-19 exposure could be considered analogous to land-use planning to reduce exposure to natural hazards eg floods earthquakes quigley et al 2020 covid-19 health and service policies aimed to preference vulnerable groups including the elderly those with ill health and comorbidities the homeless or underhoused and people from vulnerable socioeconomic groups that might be vulnerable to financial psychosocial andor physical challenges lancet 2020 are crudely analogous to defining and enforcing seismic building codes and strengthening earthquake-vulnerable buildings to reduce life safety risks eg stucchi et al 2011 hosseini et al 2009 epidemiological forecasts of covid-19 infections and fatalities fig 1 exhibit large spatial and temporal variations due to differences in modelling approaches mitigation scenarios eg supress and lift strategy used in hong kong and singapore see normile 2020 health system capacity epidemiological parameters and demographic parameters httpscovid19-scenariosorg changes induced by external eg the concurrency of other emergent phenomena such as natural disasters and internal factors eg relaxation of social distancing measures return-to-work decisions can impact on many of these parameters significantly and thus create more uncertainty in infection and fatality predictions fig 1 it is therefore challenging to define what a worse-case covid-19 fatality scenario is given the susceptibility of forecasts to major perturbations induced by phenomena with uncertain spatial and temporal properties given this context resolving policy priorities in response to the covid-19 pandemic and associated compounding effects of natural hazards involves a complex higher-level decision-making process that must inevitably be guided by scientific insight colwell and machlis 2019 filippelli 2020 in view of this our study seeks to provide a qualitative analysis of the combined effect of covid-19 epidemic and external perturbations specifically natural disasters to propose thaticovid-19 epidemiological models may be highly sensitive to disasters originating from natural hazards and thus inclusion of seasonal and  or stochastic events might better enable worst-case scenarios to be considerediicontemporary covid-19 related policies such as relaxations of mitigative measures may increase the probability that diverse multi-hazards will interact with the covid-19 crisis and stimulate concurrent and cascading crises andiiidisaster preparedness strategies and resourcing should carefully consider the impact of covid-19 on future response operations including adaptation of implementation modalities to account for the disruption of critical supply chains the potential localisation of response efforts due to limited mobility of humanitarian actors availability of evacuation centres with capacity for social distancing the capacity of humanitarian workersvolunteers and medical staff to respond to natural disasters in covid-affected regions and the availability of personal protective equipment and medical equipment eg respirators to incorporate large spikes in need in this paper we forthwith use the term natural disaster to refer to an adverse event or series of events that originate from the interaction of hazardous events of natural origin with humans andor their physical andor socioeconomic systems and infrastructure droughts floods meteorological and earthquakes geophysical are the most common natural disasters in the world affecting millions of people every year kouadio et al 2012 natural disaster fatalities since 1900 reveal decreases in average annual deaths from major drought and flood events and increases in fatalities associated with earthquakes including tsunamis and extreme weather eg tornadoes tropical cyclones and temperature events eg heat waves fig 2 fatality estimates from extreme temperature events are considered a minimum value because heat and cold temperature extremes may exacerbate pre-existing medical conditions and contribute to mortality rates without formal attribution medina-ramon et al 2006 a concurrent hazard is defined herein as hazardous events of natural physical eg earthquake volcanic eruption flood tropical cyclone or biologic origin eg an infectious disease such as covid-19 that overlap in time and space the occurrence of two or more hazardous events eg an earthquake during covid-19 is referred to here as a multi-hazard scenario aka compound events although this term has a broader definition than used here eg zscheischler et al 2018 hazards that are sourced from triggered by andor influenced by preceding hazards are referred to as cascading hazards for context we provide brief examples below on january 12 2010 a catastrophic 70 magnitude earthquake struck haiti causing more than 200000 fatalities displacing more than 15 million people and affecting 3 million people overall doocy et al 2013 see also fig 2 the earthquake severely damaged the public sanitation system and created ideal conditions for outbreaks of major infectious diseases nine months later a cholera outbreak originating from human transmission orata et al 2014 began to spread across the country eventuating in more than 9000 deaths and 650000 infections httpswwwcdcgovcholerahaitiindexhtml prior to 2010 there was no reported history of cholera in haiti long-term impacts and hazards originating from the earthquake crisis socioeconomic impacts infrastructure impacts hazards such as aftershocks spatially and temporally overlapped interacted with and amplified the cholera impacts these could be considered as a protracted multi-hazard scenario with cascading elements and disastrous impacts other cascading multi-hazard examples includeiincreased long-term flood hazard in christchurch new zealand caused by and concurrent with the 20102011 canterbury earthquake sequence quigley and duffy 2020 caused significant damage to property and infrastructure and increased vulnerability to coastal-tidal hazardsiilarge death tolls in puerto rico and some caribbean islands due to the cascading effects of hurricanes irma and maria compounded societal vulnerability through infrastructure damage and power outages that left millions without electricity water and cell phone service for 24 weeksiiithe 2015 magnitude 78 nepal earthquake along with its magnitude 73 aftershock triggered snow avalanches largest  23 km2 and thousands of landslides the latter of which caused flooding due to river blockages and landslide dam breaches martha et al 2017 blocked and damaged road infrastructure directly impacted earthquake response efforts including search and rescue activities the timely provision of emergency aid the ability to conduct rapid needs assessments and the provision of essential services khazai et al 2015 the complex spatial distribution of landslides highlights the need for considering additional dimensions including seasonality in a multi-hazard scenario roback et al 2018ivextreme events eg floods of 1987 1998 and 2007 tropical cyclone in 1991 in bangladesh that offer a perspective of the interaction between extreme natural hazards and socioeconomic vulnerabilities and how that could be amplified by covid-19 siddique et al 1991 khalil 1993 mushtaque et al 1993 dove and khan 1995 chowdhury 2000 benson and clay 2002 mirza 2002 sherman and shapiro 2005 mcmahon 2007 zoraster 2010 rahman et al 2013vthe 2011 tohoku magnitude 91 earthquake which caused shaking damage triggered a tsunami with disastrous impacts including a major malfunction at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant that exposed people to severe radiation hazards locally and significant hazards globally ten hoeve and jacobson 2012 it is also pertinent to consider hazard cascades with epidemic components for instance previous cases of acute respiratory infections aris following natural disasters can shed light on disaster response needed to counter the spread of covid-19 aris were a major concern following natural disasters such as the south asian tsunami world health organization 2005 doocy et al 2007 major-to-great earthquakes weekly morbidity and mortality report pakistan vol 42 dews 2006-36 woersching and snyder 2004 akbari et al 2004 volcanic eruptions surmieda et al 1992 and hurricanes campanella 1999 outbreaks of other communicable diseases eg water borne diseases in communities affected by natural disasters are commonly attributed to crowding of displaced people in camps weekly morbidity and mortality report pakistan vol 23dews 20062017 marin et al 2006 watson et al 2007 kouadio et al 2012 several natural disasters have now occurred during the covid-19 crisis we consider some of these in sects 3 and 4 many countries around the world including those with increasing covid-19 infection and fatality rates are highly susceptible to seasonal natural disasters some decision-makers have reduced or are considering reduction of covid-19 mitigation measures based on epidemiologic data andor priority valuation of other inputs eg economic political the likelihood of future natural disasters and potential impacts on covid-19 exposure and vulnerability is scarcely mentioned in these narratives  figure 1 presents epidemiological forecast models for covid-19 fatalities and infections for the usa australia bangladesh and china developed using httpscovid19-scenariosorg software curves were generated by iteratively bootstrapping the covid reproduction number ro simulation onset date and  mitigation variables to maximize goodness-of-fit between confirmed cumulative fatalities and modelled deaths through the same time period several alternative scenarios were considered by adjusting the  mitigation variable only the average ro ranges from 19 australia to 39 china bangladesh is 38 and the united states is 32 these estimates are consistent with the range of reported ro values from scientific literature httpswwwnaturecomarticlesd41586-020-01003-6 noting that the ro values used here are intended to be an average value since covid-19 onset rather than a value representing the current situation that are modified by adjusting the  mitigation parameter at various time-slices mitigation dates for each country were derived from internet media reports by searching country name and covid-19 mitigation actions in google and google news search engines the mitigation  effectiveness parameter was estimated from our analysis of the mitigation protocols taken as represented by the media consulted for mitigation dates a preference was given to peer-reviewed literature andor government-issued information sources for example in australia we assigned a mitigation estimate of 75 range 50 to 90 effectiveness commencing on 23 march 2020 when many places of social gathering were closed and a variety of mitigation strategies aimed to reduce social contact were progressively enacted based on a government source summary document httpswwwhealthgovaunewshealth-alertsnovel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alerthow-to-protect-yourself-and-others-from-coronavirus-covid-19limits-on-public-gatherings-for-coronavirus-covid-19 some countries have highly incremented and highly regionalized mitigation processes httpswwwcdcgovmmwrvolumes69wrmm6915e2htmscidmm6915e2x for which a single ro metric grossly simplifies the reality for example the us where 20 march 2 april 12 april in these cases we acknowledge this complexity but consider our estimates to best represent available information at the time of writing ro values mitigation dates and  effectiveness estimates and projected fatalities are included in the supplementary information item 2 accompanying this manuscript infection and cumulative fatality scenarios vary widely and are highly sensitive to small changes in  mitigation scenarios eg fig 1d chn398567 vs chn398567 particularly for countries with higher ro values both estimates are intended for the main purpose of demonstrating how reducing mitigation measures can dramatically influence these projections in the case of the us where a lifting of restrictions and re-opening of businesses is being considered reduction in mitigation measures is likely to sustain higher infection and fatality rates see usa32307080 curve concurrent with peak tornado hazard season in the southeast and central us blue curve overlapping with increasing and peak wildfire and heatwave hazards and potentially overlapping with increasing flood hurricane and tropical cyclone hazards other covid-19 related restrictions are likely to compound natural disaster and covid-19 risks for example the us forest service has cancelled its planned seasonal burns due to covid-19 restrictions and travel restrictions may reduce the likelihood of provision of international support for firefighting this is explored in more detail in sect 6 in the case of australia where strong and increasing social distancing measures were enacted nationally beginning on 23 march daily confirmed infections are reducing significantly and the cumulative fatality curve has mostly plateaued as of 16 april 2020 infection and fatality rates began to increase in australia after the cessation of the severe 20192020 bushfire season black summer fires in which thousands of australians were forced to evacuate into communal environments had covid-19 emerged only 12 months earlier in australia community transmission risks would have been significantly higher all of the major seasonal hazards are reducing or at low levels it seems less likely that natural multi-hazard scenarios will concur with covid-19 although the protracted nature of the latter and possibility of stochastic hazards eg earthquakes and out-of-peak season floods means this is still possible in the case of bangladesh infection and cumulative fatality rates are currently steeply increasing some mitigation measures have been in effect however the effectiveness of these is currently unclear cumulative fatality projections vary widely our results suggest sustained 70 average effectiveness in the absence of other concurrent disasters or major changes in internal variables could keep fatalities below 10000 but weaker mitigation strategies forecast  500000 deaths regardless of the mitigation scenarios considered here sharp increases in infections and deaths are predicted to overlap with the forthcoming tropical cyclone and heatwave peak hazard seasons and may overlap with peaks in monsoonal flood hazard these aspects are further considered in sect 6 in the case of china renewed secondary spikes in infections in late march and early april enhance uncertainty in epidemiologic projections if the average post-peak infection and fatality rate reductions have plateaued our model suggests  4500 deaths chn3985 however if mitigative restrictions are relaxed and if infection resurgences are sustained and stimulate cascading infections it is conceivable albeit unlikely that cumulative fatalities could exceed 70000 or more eg chn398567 in the latter scenario infection and fatality rates could increase concurrently with increasing flood heatwave and hurricane and tropical cyclone hazards which cause more than 1000 fatalities per year in china on average han et al 2016 china also contains regions with high earthquake hazard to reduce risks of concurrent and cascading multi-hazards our analysis indicates that strong and sustained mitigation to reduce covid-19 infection rates are required the covid-19 pandemic is active and continuously evolving the time interval over which our forecast models are valid is shorter than the expected duration of this crisis for example capturing rapid movement of hot spots through china italy spain turkey and the united states due to continuously evolving population dynamics and government measures adds an additional layer of complexity reducing the predictive power of forecasts over longer time periods in the absence of a vaccine it is conceivable that the covid-19 pandemic might last for multiple months or years and its resurgence may occur in waves as in any other previous major pandemic eg cohn 2008 adapting resurgence histories of previous covid-19 like pandemics eg human corona virus hcov-oc43 for modelling transmission dynamics kissler et al 2020 suggest that the current pandemic or its waves may last through 2024 this effectively translates into an increase in compound risks associated with covid-19 pandemic and therefore while our preliminary analysis of concurrent compound hazards is useful for the time interval considered it does not preclude the possibility for future multi-hazard scenarios concurrent with covid-19 to occur beyond the temporal extent of our analysis on 19 march 2020 at midnight the croatian government introduced strict measures to counter the spread of covid-19 virus as the number of confirmed cases rose to 105 dong et al 2020 these included closing of borders shutting down all non-essential activities such as public events and gatherings and service facilities and requiring employers to facilitate working-from-home arrangements httpsbalkansaljazeeranetvijestiu-hrvatskoj-na-snagu-stupile-stroge-mjere-zabranjen-prelazak-granica these strict measures were enforced to promote social-distancing to reduce covid-19 communal infection risks concurrent with the countrywide partial lockdown a moment magnitude mw 53 earthquake occurred in the northern suburbs of zagreb the capital of croatia with a population of over 800000 prior to this earthquake zagreb has been devastated by several moderate earthquakes the latest of which occurred in 1880 with a magnitude of 63 kozk and ermk 2010 that caused damage to about 500 buildings within a  25 km radius from the epicentre past experiences have shaped earthquake preparedness in zagreb and approximately 80 of buildings are built to standards consistent with the earthquake building design codes however the mw 53 event and its aftershocks in march 2020 caused significant damage and disruption in the city there was one fatality and at least 27 people suffered injuries electricity water and heating were lost in some parts of the city and about 250 houses sustained significant damage an estimated 59 people required temporary shelters due to loss of dwellings httpsabcnewsgocomhealthwirestoryaftershocks-rattle-croatian-capital-day-strong-quake-69744525 the croatian earthquake is not an extreme natural disaster scenario however it provides a useful perspective of compound risks for example in the immediate aftermath of a natural disaster measures imposed to ensure social-distancing may collapse temporarily due to the moderate size of the event and relatively localized damage zone the croatian government managed to clamp down on partial lockdown measures within about a day by issuing new directives whereby the natural human behaviour of congregating in numbers and comforting each other in the aftermath of such an event was disrupted nonetheless it is evident that the risk of covid-19 transmission increased in a short-time window immediately following the zagreb earthquake the daily new infectee rate fig 3 shows an apparent increase following the zagreb earthquake on 22 march 2020 within the covid-19 incubation time range further analysis is needed to ascertain the exact cause of this apparent signal although it is not unreasonable to presume that temporary disruption of social-distancing measures not only in zagreb but also in other parts of the country in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake might have played a role therefore the importance of acting rapidly and decisively by governing bodies in the immediate aftermath of a natural disaster is highlighted by the zagreb earthquake identifying probable natural disasters and advance preparation might enable enforcing such actions more efficiently and systematically reducing risks posed by the covid-19 virus tch originated as a severe meteorologic event in the pacific ocean and made landfall in solomon islands vanuatu fiji and tonga between 1 april 2020 and 8 april 2020 httpspublicwmointenmedianewstropical-cyclone-harold-challenges-disaster-and-public-health-management disrupting covid-19 early intervention made by these communities it first hit the solomon islands as a category 2 event and rapidly transitioned into a category 5 event by the time it reached vanuatu sustaining high winds of 200 kmh moving further southeast it traversed fiji and tonga as a category 4 tropical cyclone initial assessments indicate that 59000 people were affected in solomon islands and 27 people are missing at sea to date in vanuatu the northern province sanma sustained severe damage where 90 of the population lost their homes and about 50 schools and 25 health centres were damaged initial aerial investigations conducted by the national disaster management office of vanuatu indicate that 159474 people have been affected with possible 3 deaths httpsndmogovvutropical-cyclone-harold the damage to houses evacuation centres gardens water systems health facilities and schools vary between 50 and 90 across seven different provinces httpsndmogovvutropical-cyclone-haroldcategory100-01-ndmo-situation-reports in fiji more than 1500 people have been moved to evacuation centres the coastal flooding early warning system recently installed under the coastal inundation forecasting demonstration project in fiji recorded storm surge heights between 65 m and 85 m during the passage of tch which suggests that damage to life and property might be higher than known at present damage in tonga is less documented but expected to be widespread with damage to homes water supply and food crops tch provides an example of how disaster response and recovery may impact covid-19 measures for example vanuatu has reduced in-country travel restrictions to facilitate humanitarian and relief operations however reduced capacity of communication services disruptions infrastructure lifelines and supply chains and limited resources are likely to compromise relief efforts and may increase societal vulnerability to covid-19 fortunately these islands have recorded a very low number of covid-19 confirmed cases to date and it is yet to be seen if tch has perturbed this trend anak krakatoa garnered much attention after its southwestern flank collapsed in an eruption in december 2018 and generated a tsunami that killed 437 and injured thousands along western java and southern sumatra ye et al 2020 the volcano started a new eruption cycle on 10 april 2020 concurrent with the covid-19 pandemic this has remained an active situation to date with constant alerts being disseminated to the public httpsmagmaesdmgoidv1vonapage1 with a volcano observatory notice for aviation vona alert level assigned as orange 34 volcano is exhibiting heightened unrest with increased likelihood of eruption with column height below 6000 m above sea level to our knowledge no damage has been reported from this latest eruption cycle a flank collapse analogous with the december 2018 is very unlikely as the volcano has greatly reduced in aerial extent as a result of that event however this highlights in general the high volcanic hazard throughout indonesia and the risk of volcanic activity to cause fatalities and population displacements that could impact on current covid-19 mitigation strategies indonesia is still in early stage of the pandemic with only 4839 confirmed cases and 459 deaths however the mortality rate of 95 is higher than global average of 64 on 14 april 2020 on 12 and 13 april cold fronts crossed the southeast of the united states bringing widespread rainfall and embedded mesoscale convective systems mcss with associated strong winds and tornadoes the mcss within the larger weather system crossed several states but mississippi georgia and south carolina were the worst impacted the severe weather killed at least 30 people httpswwwnytimescom20200413ustornado-storm-southhtml across four states and destroyed many more peoples homes the typical immediate emergency response during a tornado outbreak is centred around finding shelter and this is practised by the community in the central and southeast us which has been well drilled in this process through past experience of severe weather there is obvious potential for social distancing to be compromised where large tornado shelters are used but accurate weather forecasts allowed for planning so that individual families within shelters were instructed to stand apart concerns about managing disaster response during the covid-19 pandemic prompted the american meteorological society to draw up a list of guidelines for sheltering from tornadoes during the covid-19 pandemic httpswwwametsocorgindexcfmamsabout-amsams-statementsstatements-of-the-ams-in-forcetornado-sheltering-guidelines-during-the-covid-19-pandemic much of the advice is consistent with standard procedures for severe weather but additionally people should be sure ahead of time that specific tornado shelters are open the us was in the midst of a steep rise in covid-19 cases and fatalities at the time of this tornado outbreak it is presently unclear whether this severe weather has compounded the effects of the covid-19 pandemic in the southeast us to qualitatively understand the effect of an external perturbation such as a natural hazard on the daily covid-19 infectee rate we created a simple epidemic model assuming that the cumulative growth of infectees over time follows a logistic differential function eq 1 for a holistic analysis this simple model is appropriate as the distribution of confirmed cumulative covid-19 cases in countries that have implemented strict counter measures eg china south korea and australia can be approximately explained by this model the exponential growth of covid-19 cases observed in other countries is an indication of early stage exposure to the disease and that patient distribution is not sustainable over a longer time horizon due to the finiteness of populations and counter measures taken by governments therefore the cumulative distribution of covid-19 cases can be expected to converge to a model similar to that described by some variation of eq 11documentclass12ptminimal

where n is the cumulative number of infectees at any given time t is time nmax is the expected maximum number of infectees and g is the fractional growth of cumulative infectees figure 4 compares data from china and the model based on eq 1 with g  03 nmax  83213 and a time horizon of 83 days where an approximate value for g is selected based on visual inspection of the fit between data and the model note that the first patient in china was potentially discovered on 10 december 2019 and data for the period from that day to 22 january 2020 start date given in the figure is not reliably recorded httpswwwwsjcomarticleshow-it-all-started-chinas-early-coronavirus-missteps-11583508932 rather than analysing cumulative infectee numbers we focus on the effect on the flattened daily new infectee rate following an external perturbation eg a natural disaster as it is the behaviour of this curve that is being used to design covid-19 counter measures curve flattening shown in fig 4 bottom panel we make several assumptions to construct our simple modelsin the immediate aftermath of an extreme natural disaster it is reasonable to assume that measures taken to contain the spread of covid-19 collapse in the area directly affected by the event and the control over spreading rate is lost resulting a spike in infectees in this case we assume that the spreading rate increases to the background value that existed prior to imposing curve flattening measuresgovernments re-establish social-distancing measures fully over a finite time horizon pdays following the external perturbation which means that the flattened spreading rate that existed prior to the external perturbation will take effect beyond pdays in the interim period ie within pdays it is highly likely that governments will take partial measures that will reduce the spreading rate as was seen for the earthquake in croatia also compliance of citizens to these partial measures can be expected although it may depend on the severity of the event and the socio-political profiles of countries thus we model this effect by linearly reducing the spreading rate from the background value to the flattened value in the interim period we test several reasonable time horizons to understand their effect on the flattened daily new infectee rate curve depending on the nature of the external perturbation different scenarios may play out for instance in the event of a flood a population may get displaced and scattered from days to months sastry 2009 or it may be that populations get displaced but not scattered as in the case of an earthquake akbari et al 2004 asokan and vanitha 2017 these different scenarios will have an effect on the spreading rate describing the spreading rate quantitatively for different scenarios is not the focus of our modelling instead we model the general behaviour of the flattened curve in the event of an external perturbation subjected to above 1the covid-19 incubation time period the time between exposure to the virus and emergence of symptoms is five days consistent with the median incubation time published by who httpswwwwhointnews-roomq-a-detailq-a-coronaviruses this means that no new cases will be found within the first five days following an event this simplifies the ground truth somewhat as according to who incubation time range varies between one and fourteen days in our models we set nmax  10000 a background spreading rate gb of 02 a flattened spreading rate gf of 01 and a time horizon of 150 days we test the perturbation to the flattened curve with pdays  1 7 14 21 and 28 days figure 5 shows the results of modelling the flattened daily new infectee rate after introducing a concurrent event with pdays  1 7 14 21 and 28 days for each pdays we tested two scenarios where we introduce external perturbations at 72 left panels and 112 days right panels from the start date of the flatten curve these two time points are located symmetrically on either side of the peak of the flattened curve day 92 and thus provide qualitative insights into demands on the health services depending on the event occurrence relative to the peak our results provide two main insights 1 a concurrent event occurring prior to reaching the peak of the flattened curve increases the new infectee rate more in the aftermath of a concurrent event than if it were to occur at a post-peak time this translates into increased demand on health services in the pre-peak period than in the post-peak period in some instances pre-peak concurrent events increase curve-flattened peak infection rates to levels approaching unmitigated peaks 2 the number of days a government takes to re-establish covid-19 spreading control measures pdays is a critical factor that determines the level of demand placed on health services that is the longer it takes for a government to re-establish control measures the higher the demand on the health services particularly in the pre-peak period these results based on our simple model emphasize two main policy recommendations that governments could consider first measures must be enforced as early as possible to flatten the daily new infectee rate curve to minimize risks of temporally-overlapping covid-19 infection rate increases with concurrent disasters this reduction of risk of a natural disaster occurring in the pre-peak period could reduce demand on health services second contingency plans must be devised with a focus on re-establishing covid-19 counter measures as fast as possible in the wake of an event this would involve identifying possible natural disasters their magnitude timing for example seasonal events and regional dependencies following our example more sophisticated models can be built to incorporate infectious disease dynamics in the wake of a concurrent event for example we have only considered the infected component in this instance whereas a standard epidemiological compartmental model will incorporate susceptible and recovered components in addition to the infected component kermack and mckendrick 1927 enabling the mapping of dynamic interactions between different population groups prediction capabilities can be further improved with even more complex models where the underlying assumption of a well-mixed population is relaxed and structured populations are used to reflect variable dynamics among different groups of population eg inaba and nishiura 2008 for real time applications however more work will be needed to reduce uncertainties in parameters that capture the spatiotemporal characteristics of spreading of a disease eg r0 ridenhour et al 2014 in australia summer 201920 saw substantial natural hazards including major heatwaves that brought record high temperatures to populated areas including canberra and western sydney severe bushfires that swept through an unprecedented area of the continent boer et al 2020 and continuing drought that has devastated farming areas diminished water supplies and primed the australian forests for bushfire king et al 2020 australias black summer also saw millions of people experience very poor air quality for several days at a time as smoke from the fires blanketed sydney canberra and melbourne on several occasions the bushfires which resulted in 33 fatalities led to mass evacuations from vulnerable areas and people sheltering on crowded beaches in mallacoota victoria amongst other places the black summer came only months before the covid-19 pandemic began and as australia approaches winter the risks of severe weather related to heatwaves bushfires tropical cyclones and hailstorms is reduced while there are still natural hazard risks in australian winter notably related to floods and extratropical cyclones the overall rate of meteorological hazards is lower than in summer in that sense australia is fortunate to have not experienced major natural hazards coincident with the covid-9 pandemic and it is less likely to do so than northern hemisphere countries over the coming months note that there are non-natural hazards that could also occur during winter that could exacerbate the effects of covid-19 in australia such as seasonal flu in the us we have already highlighted the tornado outbreak of 12 and 13 april as occurring during the covid-19 pandemic the us experiences its seasonal peak in tornado probability in may so there are likely to be further severe storms around this time during boreal summer the us often experiences other natural hazards including heatwaves and hurricanes while these extremes both have devastating impacts their interaction with the ongoing covid-19 pandemic will likely differ heatwaves tend to exacerbate pre-existing health conditions this would place an additional burden on a healthcare system that may also be stretched due to covid-19 in contrast hurricanes tend to damage infrastructure and like tornadoes people evacuate and shelter often travelling interstate or sheltering with many other people in large buildings such a response to a hurricane in summer 2020 would not abide by social distancing protocols and could aid the spread of the virus alternate plans should be considered both heatwaves and hurricanes affect larger areas than tornadoes and have the potential to strain emergency response systems already managing the covid-19 pandemic south asian countries with some of the highest population densities httpsneoscigsfcnasagovviewphpdatasetidsedacpop are exposed to compound risks from covid-19 pandemic and extreme weather events such as severe floods as the region enters the wet season from may to october for instance 1110 people died and nearly 14 million were affected in the floods of june 2007 in bangladesh dewan 2015 in addition northern pakistan and india nepal and bhutan are located along the himalayan main frontal thrust capable of producing large mw  70 earthquakes lav et al 2005 the devastation caused by the 2015 mw 78 gorkha earthquake that occurred in nepal exemplifies the exposure of this region to extreme geologic hazards this particular event killed 8790 people injured 22304 and affected another 8 million people and damaged 755549 buildings gautam 2017 it is evident from these statistics that solitary extreme natural hazards in this region have the potential to affect large numbers of people and displace them in particular displacement in large numbers during severe natural events is mainly attributable to the poor quality of dwellings and infrastructure this in turn is detrimental to measures enforced to counter the spread of covid-19 foremost of which is social distancing in the event of natural hazards these measures are highly likely to disintegrate completely substantially increasing the risk of covid-19 infections while we have qualitatively aggregated these hazards on an domestic scale the countries considered herein and many other countries with high natural disaster risk including japan the philippines iran turkey and many central america and pacific island nations have strong regional variations in hazard exposure and vulnerability that are superimposed on spatiotemporal variabilities in covid-19 risks it is well beyond the scope of this article to consider these regional variations however we provide one example from the us state of texas fig 6 currently texas has implemented two of four potential social distancing measures but has a climbing rate of covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths that are collectively increasing demand on resources fig 6 projected peaks in fatality rate and hospital demand overlap with the seasonal peak in tornado hazard long et al 2018 upper bounds 95 confidence on projected icu resource capacity currently approach icu bed availability if tornadoes increase icu demand by increasing critical care injuries associated with the tornado andor covid-19 infectees or reduce capacity by power outages and infrastructure damage then it is conceivable that resource limits could be approached in 2020 it is estimated that 167 million people across 55 countries will require humanitarian assistance ocha 2019 with ongoing global economic uncertainty imf 2020 it is unclear what impact the covid-19 pandemic will have on humanitarian financing and resource mobilization in the event that a crisis exceeds the coping capacity of a host country a funding or resourcing gap resulting from covid-19 would severely impair the governments ability to deliver critical humanitarian aid and to scale-up response efforts to meet the needs of the affected population for many countries a hazard response beyond the coping capacity of the government will trigger a level 3 l3 inter-agency standing committee iasc humanitarian system-wide scale-up iasc 2018 involving one or more clusterssectors ie water sanitation and hygiene wash health protection logistics shelter to coordinate response efforts responding to a l3 multi-hazard situation during covid-19 will require additional resources and rely more heavily on integrated programming and inter-sectorial coordination incorporating competing priorities from different clusterssectors where countries have an existing humanitarian response plan hrp or contingency planning simulations have been carried out such as the 2019 bangladesh contingency plan for earthquake response in major urban centres hctt 2019 response plans will need to be revised to account for the increased risk of disease transmission and additional limitations and access considerations imposed by covid-19 during response and recovery operations where an iasc system-wide l3 emergency response is triggered such as a major earthquake on a similar scale to the 2015 gorkha earthquake global humanitarian response mechanisms may be limited in their ability to rapidly mobilize international surge capacity including humanitarian staff and volunteers and resources typically relied on for large-scale humanitarian response international military deployments may also be limited due to an increasing focus on domestic priorities as a result response efforts will likely need to become much more localized with a focus on improving remote coordination and support for local responders movement restrictions will make it increasingly difficult for remote and isolated populations to seek medical services and assistance ocha 2020 and specialized services such as psychosocial support will increasingly need to be delivered through remote systems as already observed during the recent croatia earthquake response ifrc 2020 multi-hazard risk profiles in these circumstances will need to include an array of often compounding vulnerabilities such as the risk to elderly populations and the elevated risk of sexual and gender-based violence logistics supply chains have already been severely compromised by covid-19 with a disruption of critical supply chains due to border closures importexport restrictions and access restrictions ocha 2020 this will influence the way humanitarian programming can be implemented stimulation of local markets where they still exist through cash and voucher assistance cva programming improved engagement with the private sector and utilization of local industry and resources and will likely play an increasing role in strategies for recovery a multi-hazard situation in an already compounded and protracted or complex emergency is of particular concern these include densely populated camp-like situations with a high risk of natural hazard such as the bangladesh rohingya refugee response as of december 2019 some 810000 rohingya refugees live in 34 congested camps at high risk of flooding landslides and seasonal cyclones and are reliant on humanitarian aid to meet basic needs ocha 2019 the added complication of covid-19 containment measures into this already protracted crisis will put populations at significant risk of loss of life and will cause unprecedented complexity for humanitarian response efforts in the event of a natural hazard dense settlements with a high population density will need to carefully consider social and physical distancing measures in humanitarian programming this will limit the types of assistance emergency centres camps emergency shelter cash distributions rental assistance etc that can be delivered and the implementation modalities that can be used without increasing risk of transmission and thereby compromising efforts to contain covid-19 it is essential that humanitarian response remains proportionate appropriate and relevant to the emergency while still being timely and effective sphere 2020 humanitarian response should avoid exposing populations to further harm and it is critical that preparedness plans pre-emptively assess and evaluate the compounding risks posed by covid-19 in multi-hazard situations a tiered resilience approach that concurrently integrates resilience indices visualization tools and modelling methods from multiple agencies organizations and researchers could assist in reconciling analytical complexity with stakeholder humanitarian organizations and beneficiaries needs and resources available for creating actionable recommendations to enhance resilience linkov et al 2018 the compounding effect of seasonal natural hazards eg floods cyclones on the covid-19 pandemic is largely a foreseeable problem and plans developed ahead of time could prevent some of the worst potential impacts from occurring these plans can be based on modelling similar to that shown in this paper and we encourage emergency management agencies to consider use of these hybrid models to build response plans covid-19 epidemiological models may be highly sensitive to natural disasters and thus inclusion of seasonal and  or stochastic events might better enable worst-case scenarios to be considered this may be particularly important considering a the effect on infectee rate of the timing of a concurrent event relative to the peak of the infectee rate curve as demonstrated in this study fig 5 b the uncertainty in intensity and duration with which covid-19 counter measures must be implemented for them to be effective where possible use of prediction models may help agencies ramp up emergency planning procedures days and weeks before meteorological extremes occur for example seasonal prediction allows advance planning for the possibility of specific weather extremes and this should be undertaken to prevent some of the worst impacts of such events there is already an indication that the 2020 atlantic hurricane season will be unusually active eg httpsengrsourcecolostateeducsu-researchers-predicting-active-2020-atlantic-hurricane-season so planning for major land-falling hurricanes in the us over heavily populated cities during the covid-19 pandemic could be beneficial in particular developing alternate response plans and communicating these well in advance should prepare people for the most suitable actions to take that keep them safe from the hazard while also adhering to social distancing could help in preventing a major disaster even on the timescale of numerical weather prediction the response to the 1213 april tornado outbreak demonstrates that several days may be enough to prepare for well-forecast small-scale extreme weather events it is likely that hazard mitigation measures for worst-case scenarios of expected natural disasters seasonal or stochastic are already in place for many countries and regions eg hurricanes in the us floods in bangladesh earthquakes in nepal however these plans do not account for the existing covid-19 crisis that requires social-distancing as the primary counter measure thus incorporating effects of natural hazards in epidemiological models can guide modifications required in existing natural hazard mitigation plans the compound risks associated with stochastic natural disasters eg earthquake volcanic eruptions can potentially be mitigated by modifying existing hazard mitigation plans specific suggestions include establishing strategies for decongestion of densely populated spontaneous camps and settlements introducing clear physical distancing protocols for distribution of essential assistance increasing space allocations for vulnerable populations in shelters to reduce the risk of covid-19 transmission and the use of more emergency shelter locations with fewer people so that some semblance of social distancing may be achieved even in the aftermath of a hurricane or earthquake large-scale availability of personal protective equipment ppe to emergency responders would also help prevent the spread of infection given the disproportionate impacts of many prior pandemic and natural hazards on the developing world plans to equip developing countries and ngos in preparing for and responding to natural hazards during the covid-19 pandemic would help limit the impacts of such disasters as our simple epidemiology models show spikes in daily new infectee rates are a likely scenario in the wake of a natural disaster the magnitude and duration of these spikes could in principle be controlled by policy decisions described above thus disaster planning strategies and resourcing such as the introduction of remote coordination platforms the localisation of response efforts and resources availability of evacuation centres with capacity for social distancing potential mobility of humanitarian actors volunteers and medical staff that could respond to natural disasters in covid-affected regions and the availability of personal protective equipment and medical equipment eg respirators must be designed in combination with above ii countering challenging conditions associated with natural hazards limited road access lack of communication etc must be considered in upholding covid-19 social-distancing measures we offer these recommendations in the hope that they may be used to prevent some of the worst-impact scenarios of coincident natural hazard occurrences with the ongoing covid-19 outbreak these recommendations support the independently-derived strategic disaster risk reduction recommendations proposed by djalante et al 2020 i strengthen knowledge and science provision in understanding disaster and health-related emergency risks ii mobilize existing disaster risk governance structure to manage disaster risk and potential health-emergencies iii utilize existing disaster coordination mechanisms at regional level to inform epidemic response iv understand covid-19 economic implications and resilience v prepare inclusive early recovery plans and vi strengthen community-level preparedness and response urgent sharing of scientific information models methods particularly with developing countries is important because many of these countries may lack capacity to generate knowledge rapidly to improve resilience against foreseeable compound risks our recommendations are framed around the ideas of building resilience to natural hazard risks such that their impacts are reduced in the era of covid-19 we note that the concept of increasing resilience to mitigate impacts of extreme events is not novel bostik et al 2018 linkov et al 2018 however we hope that our suggested actions will build on those provided previously and will be used to reduce risks from natural hazards during the covid-19 outbreak our use of plausible scenarios could stimulate production of resilience analyses that incorporate uncertainty and complex dynamics of physical and humansocial factors across multiple spatial and temporal scales eg bostik et al 2018  estimating the impact of covid-19 outbreak on high-risk age group population in india harjit singh pal vikas khullar monica sharma   in todays scenario the human race is panicked due to an alarming situation of the recent pandemic of covid-19 covid-19 is also depicted as 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov or the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the initial epicentre of the present pandemic was wuhan the capital of hubei province china in december 2019 3 but now worldwide humanity is affected by 2019-ncov due to lack of possible cure of this novel virus the initial transmission mode of this newly discovered 2019-ncov was considered to be cough or sneeze the world health organization who announced that this virus can enter into the body when a person comes in contact with droplets produced through cough sneezing or when the person touches some infected any physical area then touches their eyes mouth or nose 1 but recently who published that this covid-19 virus is airborne and can spread through breathing or even just talking 7 the initial symptoms of covid-19 virus infection were found to be cough sore throat fatigue which could lead to fever diarrhea and malaise among others further due to human-to-human transmission the exponential increment in the number of infectious cases was observed 1 3 27 according to who till 14042020 from china to the rest of the world in 206 countries areas or territories around 1844863 cases of coronavirus infections and 117021 deaths have been reported 6 in indian scenario the observed trends of virus transmission till 24032020 expected the local or initial stage of covid-19 epidemic most of the cases were found to be migrants overseas visitors and some others who were in contact with these infected persons to tackle this initial transmission the countrywide lockdown was called by the indian government the situation seemed to be under control due to lockdown till 24032020 since the total number of confirmed and death cases found to be 511 and 10 respectively as presented in table 1 but now till 14042020 india has reported 11488 cases and further trends are discussed in table 1 8 11 the frightening trends were reported from 04042020 when the number of confirmed cases increased drastically and shoot up to 2650 from 909 as reported on 28032020 and presented in table 1 the sudden horrifying increment in cases was occurred due to the religious gathering in new delhi and its spread throughout the country which lead to human-to-human transmission of covid-19 in india initially most of the people who came in contact with such infected persons were unaware of the virus symptoms in their bodies the prime cause of the virus spread was supposed to be fear and the non-expressive way of infected persons about their health to the health workersauthorities for initial screening although preventive measures such as social distancing quarantine and isolation methods were taken worldwide these preventive measures were proved effective when the appropriate pharmacological techniques and experiments did not cure so much 1 27 there is a large part of the worlds population which could require more care and timely medical assistance for their livelihood and this age group of elderly people with age 50 years and greater could have more chances of infection due to covid-19 and became the major part of total death cases of worldwide infected cases 13 25 in india till 14042020 the total death cases increased to 392 in which most of the death cases pointed to specific age-group of elderly people 8 according to census-2011 1592 of the total population belongs to the age group of 50 years and greater and the effect of the present covid-19 outbreak needs to be studied concerning this age group 4 17 the work in this paper presents the forecast of the total infection cases and possible death cases in this age group of elderly people in india several dynamic models were applied concerning the population of india to predict the number of infected elderly people and death cases of elderly people in the coming 21 days up to 05052020 further the investigation was also deeply studied for some of the statesregions of india the real-time updated data of the cumulative number of cases of confirmed death and cured in india and rest of the world was taken from covid-19 tracker india 8 dong et al 11 and ritchie 22 the database source recorded the daily update of the regionstateut based number of confirmedreported death and cured cases up to 14042020 the cumulative projections could be considered for estimating the predictions for the next 21 days since the database might contain some irregularities and some reporting delays wang et al 26 analyzed the outbreak of the canada 2009 h1n1 outbreak gta 2003 sars outbreak singapore 2005 dengue outbreak and the taiwan 2003 sars outbreak using a constrained richards model pell et al 20 implemented a generalized richards model to forecast the impact of epidemics such as ebola 2015 on the human population and predicted the final epidemic size chowell et al 5 analyzed the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in singapore plague in madagascar and also ebola in the democratic republic of congo drc pan et al 19 analyzed the time duration of lung changes on chest ct during recovery from covid-19 epidemic diao et al 10 suggested that the cure rate could be used to analyze the treatment effectiveness in various medical techniques and could be significant for epidemic decision-making perc et al 21 used the mathematical model to analyze the behavior of covid-19 over various countries worldwide and also estimated the growth rate of covid-19 for 21 days for different countries such as the usa slovenia iran and germany singh et al 23 analyzed the impact of social distancing on the transmission of covid-19 and predicted the duration of the lockdown period for india based on available data till 25032020 but after 25032020 there was a dramatic increase in infectious covid-19 cases due to a religious gathering and transmission trends were terribly changed in the present work the autoregressive mathematical model was used to forecast the impact of covid-19 for the next 21 days till 05052020 in india and also the impact of the current outbreak on the most sensitive age group of 50 and greater in india further the investigation was also performed for some of the statesregions of india an autoregressive integrated moving average arima model is a

highlighted in this section the global and indian trends for infectious death and recovered cases are presented in figs 1 and 2 respectively in this section the impact of the covid-19 outbreak was considered over the population of india to consider the impact over the population of india the population considerations were done according to census-2011 4 and the projected population for 2019 24 according to the census-2011 the total population of india was 1210854977 which was projected to be 1353890423 in 2019 as per available resources the projected impact over the population according to census-2011 and projected 2019 is presented in figs 3 and 4 the horrifying trends of the covid-19 pandemic predicted more than 115000 deaths in just 101 days in the worldwide scenario the worldwide actual and predicted number of infected and death cases till 14042020 and for the coming 21 days till 05052020 are presented in fig 1 it was observed from the results that if the outbreak of this infectious virus could not be controlled timely then the estimated 3500000 of infected cases would be found around the globe as presented in fig 1a and the graph of the death cases would also rise to the peak and the approximate number of deaths become 250000 as presented in fig 1b india is the second-ranked country in terms of population and also not much affected by covid-19 outbreak yet with the decision of early lockdown this outbreak was supposed to be controlled but it could become mandatory to estimate the transmission of this dangerous virus in coming days thus the statistical predictions for india are presented in fig 2 and it was predicted for next 21 days till 05052020 that more than 35000 persons would be affected with this deadly virus in pre-implemented controlled conditions such as lockdown social distancing etc throughout the whole country as presented in fig 2a it was also observed from fig 2b that the death cases would also be raised to more than 1400 in the coming 21 days the human immunity plays a vital role in fighting covid-19 infection and in the light this fact till now around 1000 infected persons were recovered and this number will become more than 7000 in the coming 21 days as presented in fig 2c the present pandemic outbreak could affect the large portion of the population of india and this impact is presented in figs 3 and 4 since the last census was done in 2011 and actual data was available regarding population then it was observed from fig 3a that 0003130 of the population could be infected by covid-19 virus and 0000116 portion of the population could be dead in next 21 days prediction as presented in fig 3b a similar prediction could be done over the increased and projected population of 2019 in india and observations from fig 4a b could be depicted that population percentage of 0002789 could become infectious and death cases could become 0000104 of the projected population-2019 respectively the recovery rate seemed to be much less than the infection rate but curedrecovered cases could become the important factor to lower down the horrifying fear of outbreak and 0000535 and 0000478 of the total population of india as per census-2011 and projected 2019 could be recovered from this deadly virus infection till 05052020 as presented in figs 3 and 4 respectively the nation wise covid-19 virus impact was considered in case i but it could be important to study the virus transmission through stateregion wise scenario this section presented the trends and prediction of virus impact over various states and regions of the republic of india the comparison of stateregion wise impact according to census-2011 and projected-2019 population is presented in fig 5 further the stateregion wise projected infectious death and cured cases are presented in fig 6 it was observed from the results presented in figs 5 and 6 that impact of the current virus outbreak could be crucial and the predicted high-risk stateregions could be delhi maharashtra tamilnadu kerala gujrat rajasthan telangana andhra pradesh madhya pradesh goa and punjab the prediction peaks for infection cases for the next 21 days for both census-2011 and projected-2019 population were very high in the highlighted states as presented in fig 5 the most infectious statesregions such as maharashtra infectious cases  2650 delhi infectious cases  1550 tamilnadu approximately 1200 infectious cases etc had put the population at high risk in some regions the rate of virus infection became double or more in a few days such as punjab it was also observed from fig 6 that the predictions for death cases could also be high in the coming 21 days the major portion of the stateregion could be infectious in the next 21 days if the virus outbreak continues as per its current transmission rate the precautionary measures need to be imposed in the high infected areas and spreading hotspot areas should also be identified in all statesregions as soon as possible the stateregion wise projected trends for infection cases in the next 21 days from data recorded date 14042020 are presented in fig 6 the analysis in case i and case ii presented the population-wise impact of present outbreak india and various statesregions in india but the impact of the current pandemic and its transmission should also be considered age-wise and it was predicted that the elderly group of the population could be at high risk the death rate trends and prediction as per the indian scenario are presented in fig 7 since the elderly age group could be at a very high risk of infection due to covid-19 and then it could become mandatory to discuss the total high-risk population of india as per publication by the ministry of statistics and programme implementation of india regarding elderly in india 12 86 population 104133528 people belonged to elderly people were present in census-2011 and this was projected to be around 10 135389042 people in the projected population of 2019 2 the large portion of the population could be more prone to covid-19 virus infection and death the state-wise  of the elderly population and the predicted high-risk population are presented in table 2 if the contribution of this age group in economic section of the country is considered then it was found that 416 of this age-group people are responsible for strengthening the economic ground of india and as per census-2011 the total population became 503715670 persons which is at high risk in current pandemic if the same economic percentage could be applied to the projected population of india in 2019 then the population number could be increased to 563218416 persons if the social distancing and lockdown could not be followed then this population portion could be at very high risk as per published icmr study that the r0 value for the current coronavirus infection was considered to be 25 and if the social exposure reduced by 75 then one sick person can only infect 25 persons in 1 month 14 but in case the social distancing and proper lockdown conditions are not properly followed by the citizens of india then the scenario will be different and terrible the present study will be in favor of proper lockdown for the next 21 days and further extension if needed and also the strict norms of social distancing should be followed in the presence of limited resources proper health care of high-risk age-group should be taken to stop the spread of covid-19 and also to control the causality to high-risk age group the frightening effects of the current outbreak of covid-19 can be observed all over the globe and several medicalsocial efforts are in progress to stopcontrol the transmission of the 2019-ncov virus it was necessary to study the impact of current pandemic over the different age-group population in various countries with satisfactory or limited health resources since the virus outbreak affected almost all countries in the world irrespective of development in the medical sector the work in the present study analyzed the trends of noble coronavirus outbreak globally and also deep analysis was performed over the population of the republic of india the analysis and predictions were performed for the next 21 days till 05052020 and observed that the number of infectious and death cases could rise to the maximum number in the coming 21 days the study also identified various high-risk indian statesregions which could become spreading hotspots in the country further the impact of the outbreak was considered age-wise and it was found that the large percentage of the population belong to the age group of elderly people with age 50 years and greater could be at a very high fatality risk and virus infection the proper care must be taken and all necessary medical facilities should be provided to this age-group of elderly people so that the social distancing could be sacrificed the government of the republic of india had already taken very bold steps to control virus transmission such as a countrywide lockdown the study is in favor of extending lockdown up to the next 21 days or more if needed to slow down the virus spread throughout the country and the norms of social distancing should be strictly implemented to avoid any region or person becoming super spreader and to stop community transmission random and mass testing will be proved effective to control or locate virus transmission further larger areas should be divided into smaller zones and colony-wise and the mass level initial screening should be performed zones to identify the patients with initial symptoms after the end of lockdown when the normal routine would be resumed still then the proper sanitization and centralized initial screening mechanism with high-quality equipments should be implemented throughout the country to track the infected patients at various gathering areas such as restaurantshotels grocery stores interstate transfer terminals railway stations toll checkpoints airports border entryexit terminals educational sectors industries sectors etc  novel coronavirus disease a delicate balancing act between health and the economy ukertor moti gabriel daniel goon ter   every continent is affected by the covid-19 pandemic as of 27 april 2020 global confirmed cases of covid-19 stood at 2 858 635 and 196 295 deaths across 213 countries in the world10 in africa the confirmed cases of covid-19 were 20 316 and 839 deaths10 while scientists search for a vaccine cure for the covid-19 infections non-pharmaceutical interventions can be appliedsocial distancing regular handwashing limiting unnecessary movement and social gatherings or events are crucial for the management of covid-1911 evidence from fighting previous epidemics has proved that social distancing is effective in reducing person-to-person transmission thereby decreasing morbidity and mortality12-14 from a public health perspective the upward trajectory of covid-19 in african countries with weaker health systems is worrying although in principle many african countries have expressed their readiness to manage covid-19 which is commendable however practical and proactive measures regarding the availability of the rapid testing equipment masks and protective wear for health workers is desirable furthermore the respective countries health departments need to recruit more health workers to treat and manage patients in hospitals health is very critical to the prosperity of any society the absence of health affects the overall well-being of an individual and limit movements in the work place poor health slows down individual performance levels firm or organization productivity and ultimately income this is what covid-19 has caused and is causing this disease has locked down economies and created wide-ranging socio-economic disruptions in different countries across the world for instance banks have lowered their repayment rates on housing loans and there is temporary cancellation of value-added tax vat receipts associated with small businesses and company taxies amongst other protecting and saving the economy measures the unavoidable impact of all these measures is that government revenues have dwindled artisans and petty traders have been left without recourse whilst some small-scale businesses and even some big ones have collapsed especially where there is total lockdown schools are closed resulting in months of lost education the impact is felt across all sectors as the most effective mitigating strategies according to experts and who still remain hand washing social distancing and lockdowns10 from a public health perspective health epidemics of the middle east respiratory syndrome mers outbreak in the asian nation of south korea the ebola virus in west africa and the current novel covid-19 have international health impacts and drastic socioeconomic disequilibrium of life in the society1516 the unfolding of the corona virus has aggravated an international shortage of medical equipment like medical masks ventilators and other personal protection equipment ppes businesses are now trying to be innovative and meet these gaps in supply and demand whilst respecting the regulations put in place apart from the morbidity and mortality rates of covid-19 the huge consequence of impaired productivity because of individual sickness their social unit or their community are glaring17 impacts could involve psychological academic or skills losses on individual households the high death rate witnessed in west africa during the ebola viral haemorrhagic fever outbreak triggered various impacts such impacts included dilated socio-economic impacts declined growth rates wage lost because of peoples inability to work or their contagion concerns exaggerated economic condition and food insecurity loss of education and lost jobs18 a similar trend is emerging with covid-19 the global infection rate is high and increasing exponentially and only the early preventative measures imposed by governments on populations could possibly slow down the death rates however some of the preventative measures directly or indirectly affect the economy negatively given the already weak economy of some countries and the resultant draw back risks precipitated by the covid-19 pandemic the near-term challenges would warrant reinforcing some policy actions to contain the untold challenges of covid-19 there is a need to strengthen health care systems boost investor confidence and demand and limit adverse economic effects there is need for multilateral policy dialogue to curtail and foster agreements on acceptable containment policy measures are needed to cushion the economic impact of the coronavirus regarding inflation of essential commodities and services as countries grapple with mitigation and containment the socio-economic impact is affecting the containment measures which when relaxed may have dire health consequences this has called for a delicate balance between health and economic considerations there are no easy choices each country will have to carefully navigate this dilemma within its context but based on what the prevailing figures and available scientific evidence from experts reveals broadly however governments need two policy instruments to deal with the pandemic a mitigating policy and a post covid-19 recovery and rejuvenation policy the mitigation policy will be a health policy-a proactive health policy framework and management approach this will involve containment measures protection of health providers provision of personal protection equipment ppes and incentives testing centres and kits isolation centres with relevant facilities etcetera in addition to aggressive education and health literacy health education and literacy is important to mitigate the impact of covid-19 on crises-affected populations some countries may have to create massive information and surveillance people would need to provide a transparent image of travel history health records movement and different relevant data so as to assist identification of potential infected persons therefore governments and agencies can implement evidence-based approaches recommended by the world health organisation who for combating covid-19 hand washing hygiene could be an extremely effective public health intervention amidst other preventative measures such as regular use of facial masks safe coughing and social distancing19 the post covid-19 recovery and rejuvenation policy or economic policy should include palliatives to encourage citizens to endure lockdowns and observe social distancing to cushion adverse effects of the coronavirus on vulnerable social teams short-time operating schemes could be implemented to boost the pliability of operating hours such schemes would protect jobs and pay but they may not be pliable enough to defend temporary or migrant staff from lay-offs20 governments can adapt several economic palliative measures to mitigate the impact of covid-19 on households these could include providing money transfers or state insurance especially for staff placed on unpaid leave and guarantees for lower medical costs for all additionally governments can reduce policy interest rates and possibly provide economic stimulus packages to boost business confidence such measures would assist with the recovery of demand once the spread of the virus eases and travel restrictions are lifted however such measures could be less effective in coping with the immediate supply-side disruptions that result from imposed shutdowns and travel restrictions ugm conceived and wrote the first draft dtg read

immune enough to combat covid19 pandemic an economic query bijoy rakshit daisy basishtha   the outbreak of covid19 which was initially conceived as a chinesecentric shock has now been understood to be a global crisis with the number of cases increasing rapidly the world health organization who on march 12 declared covid19 as a global pandemic the unprecedented outbreak of the virus has brought considerable human sufferings to every sphere of human lives in addition to the public health emergency the crisis has unpredictably hit the world economy the operations of the world economy have substantially come to a halt the economically challenging measures adopted across the countries such as bans on traveling imposing restrictions on labor mobility shutting down manufacturing companies and sharp cutbacks in service sector activities to contain the disease have produced enormous adverse effects on the economy however an accurate empirical assessment about the size and persistence of the pandemic and its likely impact on the world economy is yet unknowable the earlier pandemics sars avian flu mers had affected particularly those countries that were economically less dominant moreover the magnitude of the previous pandemics was much smaller than covid19 the effect of this virus is however economically different the number of infections is frequently changing on an hourly basis the top most affected economies out of the outbreak are united states italy china spain france united kingdom and germany these economies accidentally happen to be the worlds largest economies as well g7 economies have witnessed exponential growth in the number of confirmed cases these economies account 60 of the worlds demand and supply 65 of the worlds manufacturing and around 40 of manufacturing exports baldwin  di mauro 2020 therefore there is a saying going around that while these large economies sneeze the rest of the world will get the cold unctad projects that the slowdown in the world economy as a result of the outbreak of covid19 will cost around 1 trillion dollars according to the united nations the sudden decline in oil prices has been the major contributing factor to the global economic slowdown figure 1 highlights the loss in gdp growth worldwide although the pandemic is likely to affect the advanced economies most emerging economies like india cannot stand unaffected governments in many countries have expressed their concern and imposed lockdown to mitigate the rapid spread since india has imposed 21day lockdown nationwide with anticipation of extending it later the economic activities in the country have reached to a near halt by suspending the production process the states are incurring huge economic cost gollier and gossner 2020 the current situation of covid19 clubbed with plummeting economic growth has pushed the developing countries like india into a volatile market condition among all south asian countries india has recorded the maximum number of active coronavirus cases as of april 13 there has been total 9241 number of covid19 cases in india with 331 deaths figure 2 explains the total number of confirmed cases in india before the outbreak of covid19 indian economy had already been experiencing economic slowdown over the past few quarters the economy was already reeling under rising unemployment low consumption and weakening industrial output and prices precovid19 the economy was witnessing sluggish economic growth compounding the existing problems of rural distress malnutrition and widespread inequality furthermore indias vast informal sector is particularly vulnerable in 20172018 out of nations 465 million workers around 91 422 million workers were associated with the informal sector these economic constraints along with the current supply side shock have put the economy on an adverse situation it will be challenging to predict the scale and speed of the effect of covid19 on any economies however there is no doubt that the impact will be much pronounced than the demonetization in 2016 and 2017 gst rollout it appears to be apparent now that these two events that caused shocks to the economy and yet not recovered fully there is another shock ahead for the economy to face the similarity with the 2016s demonetization and 2017s gst does not end at their economic impact the indian economy was going through 6year low growth rate at 47 in the third quarter of the current fiscal year in the events of declining domestic investment and mean consumption rate several monetary and fiscal policy measures were taken to recover the growth rate at the end of the last quarter rbi in its biannual monetary policy report has emphasized that the outbreak of covid19 pandemic has drastically altered the outlook of the indian economy and it has been the high time for the policymakers to formulate some monetary and fiscal measures to curb the economic slowdown in india1 as the situation has not turned normal and the number of cases is increasing worldwide as well as at national level it has been anticipated that the occurrence of the virus will further deteriorate the recovery process in the near to medium term the outbreak has put a new set of challenges before the country by spreading its dangerous effect on both demand and supply side from a public health perspective the ability to contain the outbreak in india will primarily depend upon the strength of the public health system in india as the number of confirmed cases in india is on the rise the capacity of the public health system in combating the pandemic is being questioned by the experts indias expenditure on health as a percentage of gdp is lower than the poorest countries in the world according to the national health profile in 2019 india spends only 128 of its gdp as public health expenditure2 world health organization ranks india 145 among 195 countries in terms of health care access and quality india ranks much below than china 48 sri lanka 71 bangladesh 133 and bhutan 134 in south asia the human resources and physical infrastructures of the public health system in india stand at an inferior stage while the private health care system is flourishing in india more than 65 population does not have health insurance putting massive pressure on the public hospitals in order to ensure the public health first the government of india on march 24 had announced 21 days effective nationwide lockdown the main objective of the lockdown was to maintain social distancing and suspend all forms of travel so that it can prevent the spread of infection from the infected at the community level india has very less number of hospitals and testing centers in india there is only one hospital per 47000 population states like himachal pradesh and arunachal pradesh have 12 and 16 hospitals respectively for per lakh population maharashtra which has witnessed the maximum number of coronavirus cases in india has only one hospital for every 16 lakh population statistics also reveal that on average there is only one doctor for 10700 people in india given this poor medical condition in india a genuine question arises how well prepared is indias public health system to deal with this crisis3 while testing needs to be an essential part to fight the crisis and contain the spread india does not have enough kits to test most of its population for the new coronavirus as of april 9 india has conducted a total of 144920 tests recording lowest test rates per capita in the world some states in india have reported no tests so far4
 given the background this article attempts to answer a very crucial question that what is the economic effect of covid19 on the indian economy in general and its impact on different sectors in particular however before we discuss the economic repercussion of the pandemic we first and foremost consider this outbreak as a human tragedy there are no parameters that can account the human sufferings which the pandemic has brought as the outbreak of covid19 is spreading like wildfire some of the current economic explanations may stand redundant as the crisis evolves this article potentially reflects our perspective of covid19 on the indian economy as of april 13 through this article we address the following three aspects of covid19 pandemic in the context of the indian economy first we examine the effect of covid19 on different sectors of the economy such as the agricultural sector manufacturing sector and the service sector second we will highlight how the bilateral trade relation between india and china has been affected due to the outbreak third we present the impact of 21day nationwide lockdown on social consumption in india finally we conclude the article by highlighting the growth projections about india and recommending some policy implications boone 2020 identifies three relevant channels through which the pandemic can affect economic activities across the countries our study will be based on these three crucial channels
supply channel the first important channel is the supply channel with the disruptions in the production unit closures of factories irrespective of sizes cutbacks in the service sector especially the financial sector can result in a significant disruption in the global supply chain
demand channel as a consequence of the outbreak there will be a fall in demand in the travel and tourism sector the decline in the education services decline in trade contraction in demand for entertainment and leisure services
confidence channel the third crucial channel is the confidence channel amidst the global uncertainty there is a fall in the confidence pattern of consumers as there is less consumption of goods and services to contain the spread several containment measures have been adopted by several countries which are likely to affect the consumer and financial market confidence spillover effects are being transmitted through finance and confidence channel to financial markets
 the pandemic has disrupted the agriculture activities and supply chains the monetary loss occurred to the agricultural sector in india amidst the outbreak of covid19 has been tremendous the nationwide lockdown has put the future prospectus of the agriculture sector at stake amidst the uncertainty the sector has been encountering several challenges as the labor mobility and movements of goods have been affected nonavailability of migrant labors is causing problems in harvesting activities the north and west region encountered significant problems as wheat and pulses are not being harvested on time there have been disruptions occurred in supply chains also because of the 21day lockdown in the country and subsequent bans on transportations and other activities it is being predicted that the sector is likely to get a double hit due to the recent uneven monsoon and economic contagion that the sector is facing as ravi harvest season is approaching farmers across the states are worried about their crops lying unharvested in the field the cultivation of wheat pulses and mustard has already witnessed a decline in its productions owing to untimely and heavy rainfall with the cases farmers and agricultural laborer are fleeing to their homes in the wake of this coronavirus lockdown farmers income is going to be affected severely following are the points through which we will highlight the negative effect of covid19 on indian agricultural sector first the supply chain of agricultural products will be heavily affected due to the coronavirus lockdown in india the 21day lockdown nationwide has created hindrance in the interstate movements of trucks carrying the essential agricultural commodities owners of warehouse and cold storage have complained over the lack of available labor supply in the agricultural sector second the outbreak can also affect agriculture and allied activities through its effect on the poultry sector the fastest growing sector in the indian agriculture ecosystem apparently india ranks third in terms of egg production and fifth in terms of the producers of broilers however due to the misinformation spread on social media and linking meat consumption to the coronavirus disease the sector is facing huge losses on a daily basis there has been a sudden fall in demand for poultry products and farmers are facing lower prices for their poultry products third as the restaurants and hotels are shut down the demand for agricultural products are plummeting in india as a result there has been a fall in the prices of farm products by 1520 in the time of this uncertainty in exports5
 the pandemic has hit the manufacturing sectors across the globe in different ways since the outbreak initially emerged in the manufacturing heartland of the world east asia it is likely to disrupt the global supply chain in the industrial giants with the further spread of the virus the manufacturing sector across the world will experience a similar hit the supply chain contagion will create a direct supply shock to the manufacturing sectors in the less affected nations the less affected nations would find it harder to import the raw and possessed materials from the hardhit economies as a result of the pandemic subsequently there will be a demand disruption in both less affected and hardhit economies owing to the macroeconomic drops in aggregate consumption demand baldwin  di mauro 2020 the indian economy was already struggling hard to recover from the economic slowdown prior to the outbreak however the continuing outbreak of covid19 in india has made the possibility of revival difficult as several sectors in the economy are witnessing an adverse effect of covid19 even the finance minister has assured that the government will take some stringent measures to help the manufacturing industries mainly the msmes to reduce the effect of covid19 on the sector on the manufacturing front the impact of the coronavirus will depend upon to the extent the sector is connected to china the pharmaceuticals and automobile industries are already facing the effect as the pharmaceutical industry is strongly linked to china the supply chain of raw materials of drugs has been affected immensely though india is considered to be the top exporters of drugs in the world it depends heavily on the import of bulk drugs in the financial year 20182019 india had imported around 24900 crores of bulk drugs and the import constitutes approximately 40 of the domestic consumption6 indias dependence on china for the import of many critical antibiotics and antipyretics accounts close to 100 the largest production unit of pharmaceutical in himachal pradesh is undergoing the lockdown incurring huge manufacturing loss in india on the other hand with the disruptions in the supply chain the automobile industry in india has also seen a severe impact the coronavirus outbreak not only has affected the automobile industry but also hit the automotive components and forging industries china accounts for 27 of exports of auto components in india and considers to be the leading supplier in india as the manufacturing industries in china were shut down in the wake of the coronavirus crisis many indian automobile companies have suffered the losses several automobiles companies including mahindra and mahindra mm tata motors and mg motors in india have announced that they are facings constraints in the supply of auto components from the virushit china7
 as far as the chemical industries are considered the local dyestuff companies in india relies on china and imports several raw materials such as chemicals and intermediates from china due to the ongoing crisis the delayed shipments and the rising prices of raw materials are affecting the dyes and dyestuff industry particularly in gujarat the production of these items has been impacted by 20 due to the disruptions caused in the supply of inputs from china the spread of covid19 can also affect the electronic industries located in india china being the largest supplier of both final and raw material of electronic products the electronics industry in india fears supply disruptions economists are often criticized for producing bad records in predictions acknowledging the fact beck 2020 has recommended several ideas to interpret the effect of covid19 on the financial markets to him the effect of the coronavirus on financial markets will depend upon three significant conditions first to what extent the virus will further spread and its effect on economic activities worldwide second the effective implementations of fiscal and monetary policy to the crisis third the centrals banks and regulators reactions to the possible bank fragility applying these three conditions we examine the impact of covid19 on the indian financial system the effect of the coronavirus and the lockdown it triggered is visible on the financial markets in india the banking sector in india was already going through a crucial time even before the emergence of the crisis the collapse of yes bank created some hue and cry in the banking sector amidst the anomalies in the economic activities and deteriorations in the quality of the assets the rating agency moody has revised the prospectus of the indian banking system to negative from stable8 the outbreak of the virus will affect the profitability of banks adversely as there has been an increase in loanloss provisions and a decline in revenues the deterioration in the assets quality across micro small and medium enterprises msmes corporate and retail segments will induce a huge pressure on banks capitalization capital infusions to the public sector banks psbs as done by the governments over the past few years can mitigate the pressures on bank capitalization given the current situation where the private sector banks are facing default the growing risk aversion faced by the old private sector banks will put funding and liquidity pressures on small private sector banks the outbreak has also hit investor confidence in the financial market investor sentiment has been so low that despite relatively lower cases reported in india the indian stock market has fared worst among global peers indian stock market has lost 26 in dollar terms between february 1 and april 9 compared with a decline of 20 and 14 in european and united states markets9
 in this strongly connected world the effect of covid19 on international trade is inevitable the outbreak of covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted the bilateral trade relation between india and china china has been the major importers of indian products that include jewelry seafood and pharmaceuticals as far as the total exports of diamond and pharmaceuticals are considered india exports 36 of diamond and 34 of pharmaceuticals to china as the outbreak has primarily disrupted the manufacturing activities in china and other parts of the world united states and europe it is hitting the indian exports significantly due to the restrictions imposed on exports to china it is expected that there could be a fall in the price of petrochemical products in india reports released by chinese official reveal that between january and late february trade between both the countries fell by 124 year on year when the outbreak was spreading in china it had affected the exports and imports in both countries chinas exports to india stood at 671 billion yuan dropped by 126 on year on year basis whereas the imports from india was declined by 116 to 18 billion yuan10 according to unctad estimates the loss occurs to indias trade as a result of covid19 pandemic would stand around us348 million india is among those 15 countries that have been affected severely as the outbreak disrupted manufacturing industries in china and destroyed world trade in case of india the effect of covid19 on trade is estimated to be worst for the chemical sectors with a loss of 129 million dollars whereas the damage has been estimated to be 64 million dollars for textiles and apparel apart from this several other trading companies such as automotive electrical machinery leather products wood and furniture products are likely to be affected by this coronavirus crisis the pandemic is also expected to have affected the domestic fisheries sector as the sector has incurred huge losses with its fall in exports to china the bilateral trade between india and china is also tied by the agricultural products as the agricultural products have been witnessing a negative trend in india it is also hitting the agricultural markets across indopacific region including china the main objective of the initial announcement of 21day lockdown followed by its further extension till may 3 has been to ensure social distancing social distancing interventions can be effective against fighting the pandemic but are potentially detrimental to the economy koren  pet 2020 business and corporate companies that depend heavily on the face to face communications or close physical proximity while producing a product or service are particularly vulnerable the idea of social distancing has been proven effective to contain the rapid spread of the epidemics hatchett mecher  lipsitch 2007 markel et al 2007 wildersmith  freedman 2020 many countries across the world have implemented the practice of social distancing by closing down schools prohibiting large community gatherings restricting nonessential stores and transportation in an effort to contain the spread anderson heesterbeek klinkenberg  hollingsworth 2020 thompson serkez  kelley 2020 in this regard questions arise that what are the economic effects of such social distancing previous research has established the efficacy of the implementations of social distancing on reducing the spread of epidemics 1918 spanish flu in the united states bootsma  ferguson 2007 hatchett et al 2007 markel et al 2007 and seasonal viral infections in france adda 2016 are the notable examples it does not require a trained economist to assess the impact of the complete social and economic lockdown of india on the supply side of the indian economy this lockdown will bring massive disruptions in the production and distributions of goods and services except for the essential commodities in an effort to contain the rapidly spreading coronavirus a fall in social consumption can severely affect the gdp of an economy as people are getting aware about the community transmission of the disease they are maintaining social distancing and cutting back social consumption loss in social consumption is partly considered as a permanent loss however reductions in social consumption may not necessarily amplify all scenarios by the same degree and magnitude this is due to the reason that demand and supply in the market are complementary to each other if closing down the educational institutions and banning public events result in people taking more off from their works then it will create supply shocks in such a situation demand shock will have less scope to do damage asian development bank adb has projected that the outbreak of covid19 might incur economic in indian from 387 million to 299 billion in terms of personal consumption losses in order to assess the economic effect of the outbreak on developing economies in asia adb has categorized four possible scenarios these scenarios are the bestcase scenario moderate case scenario worsecase scenario and hypothetical worstcase scenario under the bestcase scenario it has projected the loss to be 387 million for india if the spread is contained by travel suspension and taking some precautionary measures after 2 months from late january in the occurrence of a moderate scenario the loss is likely to be hit by 640 billion imposing some restrictive policies in place and with the continuation of some precautionary measures for the next 6 months under the worstcase scenario the personal consumption expenditure in india will fall by 12 billion oecd as against the growth predictions made in 2019 now amidst the global uncertainty oecd has revisited the growth forecast in the case of india considering the grave economic situation it has revised the growth by lowering down by 110 basis points to 51 for the financial year 20202021 and subsequently by 80 bps to 56 in 20212022 when it comes to global economic growth oecd has revised down it by 50 bps against the prior projections made in november 2019 due to the intensification of the spread and its possible economic consequences on manufacturing and service sector activities fitch has reduced its growth projection from 51 to 49 in 20192020 according to fitch this lower economic growth is driven by domestically weak demand for many consumable items and disruptions in supply chains after examining the effect of covid19 on the indian economy and its different sectors this study recommends some policy actions both for the shortrun and long run effective implementation of easy monetary policy by considering a repo cut of 50 basis points and extending the period from 90 to 180 days in recognizing the nonperforming assets npas can provide stimulus to the financial sector corporate social responsibility csr can also play a significant role in mitigating the effect of covid19 spending on pandemic mitigation measures should be a part of csr initiatives to minimize the effect the government should induce more capital to the public sector banks in india micro small and medium enterprises msmes should be given easy and cheap credit as these companies are worst affected by this pandemic the msmes industry provides more than 100 million employment opportunities and contributes 166 to indias gdp post the crisis the employees associated with the sector will experience a decline in their incomes government should provide some incentives to the employees to compensate for the loss that they are facing owing to the lockdown farmers and agriculture migrant workers should be included in the several assistance packages announced by the government and any social protection programs addressing the crisis should include the migrant labors unemployed informal workers should be provided cash income support through jan dhan financial inclusion program given the status of indias poor health care system government expenditure on public health care should be substantial to ensure all the required medical facilities to the people india has reported a very low number of coronavirus tests the government should ensure the supply of masks gloves and medical kits to the health workers to contain the virus since the agricultural and allied activities are heavily affected and there has been a fall in aggregate consumption in the country except for the essentials direct benefit transfers to the farmers can improve the demand for agricultural products post the pandemic due importance should be given to research and innovation so that scientist and researchers can find an effective way to address the crisis in addition to public health the government should also help vulnerable households by providing them with temporary direct benefit transfers such actions of the government would support the households to compensate for the loss of their incomes arising out of work shutdowns and layoffs international cooperation and development aid from the developed countries to less developed countries can be proven effective during this crisis  dynamics of the covid-19 pandemic in india subhas khajanchi kankan sarkar jayanta mondal matja perc  understanding the dynamics of the covid-19 pandemic is crucial for improved control and social distancing strategies to that effect we have employed the susceptible-exposedinfectious-recovered model refined by contact tracing and hospitalization data from indian provinces kerala delhi maharashtra and west bengal as well as from overall india we have performed a sensitivity analysis to identify the most crucial input parameters and we have calibrated the model to describe the data as best as possible short-term predictions reveal an increasing and worrying trend of covid-19 cases for all four provinces and india as a whole while long-term predictions also reveal the possibility of oscillatory dynamics our research thus leaves the option open that covid-19 might become a seasonal occurrence we also simulate and discuss the impact of media on the dynamics of the covid-19 pandemic  electronic address subhasmathspresiunivacin  electronic address matjazpercgmailcom individuals the key to safeguard our families near ones and communities lies in understanding the nature and behavior and why and how this particular virus is developing some other factors like population mobility by air travel the documented human-to-human transmission low air temperature and low humidity highly affect the transmission of coronavirus 1 11   according to the world heath organization who 1878489 confirmed cases 119044 confirmed deaths of novel coronavirus disease 2019 2019-ncov has been reported throughout the world as of april 15 2020 including 11439 confirmed cases 377 deaths from india 1  the outbreak was first announced by the health commission of hubei province china a cluster of unexplained cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology unknown cases 2  which is lethal was first identified in wuhan the capital city of hubei and seven largest city of china on december 31 2019 3 4 5  later on the novel coronavirus disease was called officially as covid-19 by who 1  the epidemic was announced a major public concern worldwide on january 30 2020 by the world health organization 2  coronavirus an enveloped virus described by a single-stranded positive-sense rna belonging to the family of coronaviridae and the nidovirales order and extensively disseminated among humans as well as mammals 6  the ongoing coronavirus epidemic has been announced a pandemic by the world health organization who on january 30 2020 and the govt of india has announced 21 days nationwide lockdown from march 25 2020 to april 14 2020 to prevent stage-iii spreading of the virus or human-to-human transmission coronavirus causes typically mild infections but sometimes lethal communicable disorders leading to severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers and in present covid-19 pandemic and in general it can be thought as sarsr-cov 7  which is mostly observed in bats-could create a future disease outbreak 8 9  the most important modes of transmission of coronavirus are respiratory droplets and contact transmission contaminated hands and it has incubation period 2-14 days 3 10  from the confirmed cases of coronavirus the symptoms range from fever sneeze or even a runny nose dry cough fatigue breathing problem and lung infiltration to severely ill and dying 10  shared surfaces are also an important risky since the virus clings on to surfaces and propagates as soon as another person touches the shared surface the virus also can remain active for about 3 hours after aerosolization droplets carrying virus mixed with air on plastic for fifteen hours and on metallic surfaces for five-six hours the continuing coronavirus outbreak has been announced a widespread by the world health organization as of march 16 2020 the united nations public health agency has authenticated 167511 confirmed cases including 6606 deaths across 151 countries throughout the world 1 3  as countries start shutting down borders cutting off international marketing and quarantining their cial places as well as contacts of cases quarantine surveillance contact tracing 17  the route of an outbreak can be described by a series of important factors but some of which are extremely difficult to understand at present coronavirus disease the basic reproduction number r 0 is one of the most crucial quantities in infectious diseases as r 0 measures how contagious a disease is r 0 designates the number of secondary infections infected by one infected individual in a whole susceptible class or more specifically the area under epidemic curve for r 0  1 the disease is expected to stop spreading but for r 0  1 an infected individual can infect on an average 1 person that is the spread of the disease is stable the disease can spread and become epidemic if r 0 must be greater than 1 r 0 can help us to understand the effectiveness of the disease that is under what condition the disease can stop or spread  the values for r 0 in china is around 25 in the primary stage of the outbreak of coronavirus 18  the spread of coronavirus outbreak depends on the infectivity of the virus and the availability of susceptible individuals mathematical modeling play a vital role to better understand the disease dynamics and designing policies to manage quickly spreading infectious diseases in lack of effective vaccine or specific antivirals 19  recently many mathematical model have already been studied to understand the complicated dynamics of novel coronavirus and some of these are cited in our references 3 5 12 20 21 22 23 24 25  a novel coronavirus model has been established by chen et al 20 and find the basic reproduction number imai et al 21 studied a computational model for novel coronavirus disease 2019 in wuhan a city of china and their model mainly focused on human-to-human transmission tang et al 5 established a compartmental model for coronavirus by incorporating symptomatic ill class to obtain the patients epidemiological status they obtained the basic reproduction number 647 which is very high for the infectious diseases nadim et al 23 studied a mathematical to investigate the coronavirus disease where they performed stability analysis and they validated their model with the data from hubei the city of china their model is originally established by gumel et al 7 for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak wu et al 25 established a coronavirus model by considering four classes namely susceptible exposed infected and recovered to study the human-human transmission dynamics based on the data from december 31 2019 to january 28 2020 they computed the reproduction number approximately 268 for coronavirus disease the conventional models governing the outbreak of infectious diseases mainly depend on the interplays among susceptible infected and exposed classes moreover the other aspects such as vaccination huge news coverage educational campaigns and rapid information flow can create great psychological effects on the population and thus remarkably change the publics behavior and affect the implementation of individuals intervention and control strategies 26  it is mainly the awareness program due to media which make the individuals enlighten regarding the disease to take safeguards such as vaccination wearing protective masks social distancing etc to minimize their risks of being infected 27 28  how long and how effectual media related impact persists is thus an important issue for future outbreak and quantifying this impact through a modeling process falls within the scope of our investigation several mathematical models have been incorporated with the assumption that the media related awareness has an impact on reducing the contact rate of susceptible and infected population 26 29 30 31 32 33  influenced by those literatures we develop and analyze a mathematical model for coronavirus to study the impact of media related awareness program to obtain a better insight into the important factors related with the control of novel coronavirus in a community and throughout the world we investigate a dynamic model to study the epidemic of coronavirus and its control in four mostly affected states namely maharashtra delhi kerala west bengal and the overall india we estimated most important parameters namely  s   a  q a   h  h   i and  i by using least square method we calculate the basic reproduction for our model for four different states as well as the india here we extend the classical deterministic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed seir compartmental model refined by introducing contact tracing-hospitalization strategies to study the epidemiological properties of coronavirus  we calibrate our mathematical model using data gained form confirmed cases of coronavirus in india and estimated the basic reproduction number for the disease transmission in order to make our mathematical model more realistic we consider the following assumptions  the model involves a net inflow rate of susceptible individuals  s per unit time  the model has no zoonotic infections of coronavirus considering only the epidemic spread through human beings  there is no effective control measures before april 10 2020  the model involves some demographic effects by accepting a proportional natural mortality in each of the sub-populations in the underlying dynamic model the total population nt is classified into six subpopulations classes namely susceptible st exposed et asymptomatic at clinically ill or symptomatic it hospitalized ht and recovered rt respectively the coronavirus outbreaks in the population throughout the world and so the news concerning coronavirus epidemics through different media including television social networking sites and newspaper as well as educational programs from government non-government organization and local bodies the source of information density of media is assumed to be proportional to the number of symptomaticinfective individuals and will alter as the symptomatic population alters herein mt denotes the cumulative density of media in individual such that mt  0 for it  0 this is mimic to the mathematical model developed by donofrio et al 27  in the case of non-delayed model and mimics to the media variable as incorporated there this media creates the behavioral alteration in the susceptible populations to save themselves from contracting infection as for example government of senegal has taken an initiative through sms campaign to spread the information regarding ebola awareness 34  albeit individuals are informed through media not everyone responses to it due to insufficiency of resources irresponsive nature and economic condition etc therefore a part of susceptible individuals with news regarding coronavirus responding to the news for corona symptoms and altering their behavior to avoid infection and will move to the recovered individuals the rate of behavioral response through media has been considered to be a function of both the densities for susceptible populations and media that is f st mt moreover we assume that the source of media is a function of it that is f m it as the source of media depends on the density of symptomatic populations a schematic representation of the above biological mechanism of coronavirus in human upon which our model is based is shown in the figure 1  the dynamics of novel coronavirus model is governed by the following system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations the susceptible individual is recruited into the population with a constant inflow rate  s and decreased by a natural mortality mortality rate  s  here  s  a represents the transmission coefficient of the asymptomatic individuals to susceptible  s  i is the transmission coefficient of symptomatic infected classes to the susceptible and  s  h denotes transmission coefficient of the hospitalized classes to susceptible population we consider  s is the disease transmission coefficient for both the infectiousness of covid-19 and contact rates with adjustment factors  a for asymptomatic classes  i for symptomatic classes and  h for hospitalized individuals albeit coronavirus is supposed to be spread completely by symptomatic populations a very lower rate of transmission by asymptomatic populations cannot even be ruled out the adjustment parameter  a  0 take into accounts for varying levels of hygiene preventions through asymptomatic an analogous explanation can be drawn to the adjustment parameters  i and  h during symptomatic and hospitalization respectively as the asymptomatic symptomatic and hospitalization programmes and hygiene preventions during asymptomatic symptomatic and hospitalization were executed and enriched progressively after an epidemic of coronavirus the spreading coefficients  a  s   i  s and  h  s  asymptomatic symptomatic and hospitalized rates could be modeled as a time-dependent parameters in computations moreover the interplay among susceptible and infected population asymptomatic symptomatic and hospitalized is modeled utilizing standard homogeneous mixing incidence 35 36  in the form of total individuals the rate of change of susceptible individuals can be represented by the following ordinary differential equation ode b dynamics of exposed individuals et the population who are exposed individuals but not yet developed clinical symptoms of coronavirus the exposed individual is declined by asymptomatic individuals at the rate  e and natural death at the rate  e  the constant per-capita rate  e modeled progression from the exposed individuals e to either the asymptomatic individuals a or symptomatic individuals i the constant q a 0  q a  1 represents budget for the rate of progress of population who move to either the asymptomatic partially-infectious class a or symptomatic class i at the per-capita rate  e  the corresponding model dynamics for exposed population can be presented by the following ode asymptomatic populations were exposed to the coronavirus but not infectious for the community the exposed classes move to the asymptomatic classes at the rate  e by a constant portion 1  q a  the asymptotic individuals progress to the recovered class at the per-capita rate  a and natural mortality rate  a  the rate of change of asymptomatic individuals is govern by the following ode the symptomatic individuals are produced after the progression of clinical symptoms of coronavirus diagnosed by the clinicians by the asymptomatic individuals the exposed individuals move to the symptomatic classes at the per-capita rate  e by a constant portion q a  the symptomatic or clinically ill individuals progress to the hospitalized or isolated class h at the percapita rate  i and natural mortality rate  i  it can be assumed that  i  the per-capita rate at which symptomatic or clinically ill classes seek clinical attention and are therefore put into the hospitalized class is bigger than  e  the per-capita rate at which the exposed individuals progress to the asymptomatic classes the clinically ill classes class i are moved to the recover classes without being diagnosed at the per-capita rate  i  the transmission dynamics of symptomatic populations are governed by the following ode  f dynamics of recovered individuals rt it can be assumed that the recovered population have enduring immunity against coronavirus albeit to date this has neither been confirmed nor contradicted the asymptomatic symptomatic and hospitalized individuals recover from the coronavirus at the per-capita rates  a   i and  h  respectively the recovered individuals die at the per-capita rate  r  the rate of change of recovered individuals can be written by the ode we assume that the source of media related information index is proportional to the number of symptomatic individuals the function f m i represents the growth of information index rate which depend on the symptomatic individuals while the coronavirus outbreaks the world health organization who health agencies social media government and non-government organization become dynamic to spread the information or media awareness in concerning the prevalence of coronavirus as for the function f m i one can consider any function satisfying f m 0  0 and f  m i  0 33  the most easiest example is f m i   m i with  m  0 1 that is i is linear function of the present prevalence of the coronavirus which could represent for instance current standardized incidence of serious cases of the coronavirus 27  one more example could be f m i  mi 1mi  where i indicates the nonlinear increasing function for the prevalence of the coronavirus which could be considered as a measure of the perceived risk for the infection rather than the original one 28 37  here  m represents the source rate of the information index and  m is half saturation constant thus we consider the following ode model for media awareness program based on the above biological assumptions and schematic representation of coronavirus see the figure 1  together with specific forms we formulate a mathematical model of novel coronavirus with media awareness given by the following seven-dimensional nonlinear system of odes the model is satisfied the following positive initial conditions since the model system 8 monitors the dynamics of human population all state variables are assumed to be positive the basic reproduction number symbolized by r 0  is the expected number of secondary cases produced in a completely susceptible population by a typical infective individual 38 39  the dimensionless basic reproduction number provides a threshold which play a crucial role in determining the disease persists or dies out from the individual in a more general way r 0 can be stated as the number of new infections created by a typical infective population at an infection free equilibrium r 0  1 determines on average an infected population creates less than one new infected population during the course of its infective period and the infection can die out in reverse way r 0  1 determines each infected population creates on average more than one new infection and the disease can spread over the population the basic reproduction number r 0 can be computed by using the concept of next generation matrix 38 39  in order to do this we consider the nonnegative matrix f and the non-singular mmatrix v expressing as the production of new-infection and transition part respectively for the system 8 are described by the jacobian matrix for the system 8 can be computed at an infection free state e  a  represents the spectral radius for a next generation matrix f v 1  thus from the system 8 we get the basic reproduction a detailed elucidation on the computer simulations for the coronavirus model system 8 figure 2 designates the prcc results which implies that the highest positively correlated parameters are the disease transmission coefficient rate  s  proportion rate of exposed individuals q a  the rate  h by which the hospitalized class converted to recovered class the rate  h by which susceptible individuals converted to exposed class and the highly negatively correlated parameters are the rate  i by which symptomatic individuals become recovered the rate  i by which symptomatic individuals converted to hospitalized class and the rate  a by which the asymptomatic individuals moved to recovered individuals account for most uncertainty with respect to the symptomatic population thus our prcc analysis yields these 7 parameters  s  q a   i   i   h   h and  a are the most effective parameters out of 17 parameters therefore we estimated the 7 parameters by using least square method now we have calibrated our coronavirus disease model 8 table iv  the output of our model for daily new cases are shown in figure 3  also the observed daily new coronavirus cases are overlapped on the fig 3  it is also important to observe the total number of coronavirus cases in a province only so the observed daily cumulative confirmed coronavirus cases and the model simulation has been plotted in the fig 4  to assure the performance of our coronavirus system without media 8  where table iii  the fitting data enables us to quantify the basic reproduction number r 0 from the expression of 10 whereas the slope of the simulated curve is relatively high for the state kerala to describe how best to diminish human impermanency and morbidity due to novel coronavirus it is very essential to see the relative significance of various factors responsible for its transmission the initial disease transmission is completely associated to the reproduction number r 0  and we calculate the sensitivity indices with regard to r 0  to the parameters for the system 8 the sensitivity indices describe us whether or not the infectious diseases will develop throughout the individulas sensitivity analysis is mainly utilized to describe the robustness of the reproduction number r 0 to fluctuation in the system parameters it also give us to identify the relative change in a state variable when a system parameter alters the normalized forward sensitivity index for r 0 with respect to the parameter p is defined as follows as we have the explicit expression for r 0 in 10 we obtain the analytical formulae for sensitivity indices of r 0   r 0 p  to each of fourteen parameters stated in the table vi  as for example the sensitivity index of r 0 with regards to  s is independent of any parameters this represents that r 0 is the increasing function with respect to  s  it implies that the probability of disease transmission has a high impact on coronavirus control and management other parameters have their sensitivity indices are specified in the table vi  from the table vi  it can be noticed that some of the indices are positive and some of the indices are negative which indicate that the indices having  signs increase the value of r 0 as one increase them and those having - signs decrease the value of r 0  as they are increased the most sensitive parameter is the disease transmission coefficient  s  where sensitivity index  r 0 s  1 indicates that the increasing  s by 10 will increase r 0 by 10 also the sensitivity index of  a  that is  r 0 s   0844286 represents that increasing  a by 10 will decrease r 0 by 844286 similarly we can interpret the other parameters too we plot the sensitivity indices of r 0  for each of the model parameters using in the table vi has been shown in the figure 6  in order to control the coronavirus outbreaks we must target the most sensitive parameters who has the great impact in controlling the system dynamics for instance the disease transmission coefficient  s is the most effective parameter in controlling the coronavirus diseases which can easily be identified from the figure 6 as well as in the table vi to control the coronavirus outbreaks the draw the contour plots for the r 0 with respect to the positively correlated parameters namely disease transmission coefficient  s and the clinical outbreak rate q a for all the infected classes in the figure 7  the contour plot represents the dependence of r 0 for the four states kerala delhi west bengal maharashtra and the republic of india contour plot indicates that for the higher values of  s and q a the reproduction number r 0 become high which means the coronavirus may enter the stage-3 and it spread through the community therefore to control r 0 must be restrict the values of the transmission coefficient  s and the portion q a by which the exposed class become symptomatically ill to keep the mortality rate as low as possible we must be take the values of  s and q a as small as possible the figure   6 and table vi represents that the adjust factors  a   i and  h are positively correlated with the basic reproduction number r 0  thus we must have to reduce the adjust factors too thus we may conclude that to reduce the coronavirus disease outbreak we need to maintain social distancing limit or stop taking fairs and theaters performances etc to study the impact of media related awareness for the coronavirus disease we simulate our system 8 for four provinces namely kerala maharashtra delhi west bengal and the republic of india with respect to the parameter values specified in the table i we also investigate the media related awareness for the novel coronavirus diseases for the republic of india and four provinces namely kerala maharashtra west bengal and delhi with respect to parameters listed in the table i and rest of the estimated parameters listed in the table   ii with initial individuals are listed in the table iv  the impact of media awareness effect for the daily cumulative confirmed cases of coronavirus diseases for symptomatic classes are shown in the to study the future outbreaks of coronavirus diseases we simulate our system 8 for a long days of the infected individuals namely asymptomatic individuals and symptomatic or clinically ill individuals for the parameters are listed in the table i and we have considered the estimated   parameters for the table ii in case of indian data only with initial population sizes are given in the table iv  the model simulation represented that the people from overall india can experience future epidemics if the control policies are not implemented more effectively as shown in the figure 10  the number of infected individuals asymptomatic and symptomatic are oscillate around 130 days and around 320 days this can be interpreted as the reproduction number r 0 is always greater than unity in india see the table v for india  otherwise we can say that the impact of media related awareness is a dynamic process and the media has a great impact in reducing the transmission of coronavirus outbreaks at the initial stage of an epidemic the factors like low air temperature and as well low humidity has a great impact on the transmission of novel coronavirus 11  moreover to control the future outbreaks of novel coronavirus the media related awareness programme and the control strategy must be implemented properly in this manuscript we propose a compartmental epidemic model on novel coronavirus diseases by incorporating the effect of media awareness to predict and control the outbreak in our model we noted that media awareness play a key role in generating public consciousness and encouraging disease measures 42  in our proposed model we consider two infectious individuals namely asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals with former being a fast spreader of the coronavirus diseases our model formulation is based on the work by gumel et al 7  where we estimate the system parameters based on the prcc sensitivity analysis at an early stage of the outbreak in which the number of cumulative classes grow exponentially we calibrated the proposed model to fit with the data from four different states namely maharashtra kerala delhi west bengal and the republic of india the most important part is to perform the sensitivity analysis of 17 model parameters and its estimation to identify the key input parameters which contributed to the symptomatic outcome strongly assisted the implementation of an integrated policy for various measures involving the epidemic during different phases of the diseases we use the sensitivity analysis by using prcc techniques prcc analysis yields the most sensitive parameters are  s  q a   i   h   a and  h out of 17 input parameters without incorporating media impact then we estimated these 7 parameters based on the data from four different states and from the entire india by fitting data on novel coronavirus cases during january 30 2020 to march 31 2020 in the four different states of india and the overall india to our proposed model we were able to get estimates of the unknown parameters for our system by fitting our proposed model simply the classical model without considering media impact system 8 with real data obtained from india covid-19 tracker httpswwwcovid19indiaorg we were able to get acceptable estimations for the system parameters and curve fitting as shown in the figures 3 and 4  to ensure the performance of our system without media we compute the numerical errors namely e m ae and e rm se  within the reasonable set of parameters the model simulations without incorporating media awareness obtained relatively good fits to novel coronavirus data as plotted in the figures 3 and 4  from the basic reproduction number r 0 in table v  it can be compared that the province kerala is highly effective by coronavirus diseases compare to other three provinces and the republic of india nevertheless our model-based analysis also demonstrates that the basic reproduction number in india and four different provinces remains greater than unity the estimation of basic reproduction number r 0 indicates that the strengthen control involvements are mandatory to reduce andor eradicate the future coronavirus diseases thus in this scenario the public must have to give utmost priority to stay home quarantine and successful the lock-down to combat against coronavirus pandemic in this situation media related awareness is mandatory to aware each and every people such that they can maintain social distancing wear mask to protect themselves and avoid cultural programme from the sensitivity indices see table vi and the figure 6  for the basic reproduction number r 0  we observed that the disease transmission coefficient  s and the portion q a clinical outbreak rates in all infected classes are positively correlated with r 0  this indicates that to reduce coronavirus diseases the social distancing is the most important factor and we reduce the values for  s and q a to control the diseases as we know for r 0  1 the diseases can be died out thus to keep control the value of r 0 we must reduce  s and q a  while investigating the contour plot we observe that for the lower values for  s and q a  the reproduction number can be controlled and reduced to less than unity as shown in the figure 7  thus if we are able to control the social distancing then we are able to control the basic reproduction number r 0 and hence we are able to eradicate the coronavirus diseases since r 0 quantifies the initial epidemic transmission its sensitivity indices enable us to establish the relative significance of various parameters in coronavirus transmission from the sensitivity of basic reproduction number r 0  we can conclude that the most effective control measures are the isolation of all close contacts and strengthening the self-protection ability for susceptible individuals table ii thus our calibrated model predicted that the increasing pattern of coronavirus diseases will be continued if the people not aware about the diseases thus the public must have to take the precautions and the health care agencies should concentrate on successful implementation of control mechanisms to reduce andor eradicate the disease in order to study the long-term dynamics of our model we observed the most interesting switching phenomena as plotted in the figure 10  maybe this is happen due to the impact of media awareness as it is a dynamic process on disease epidemic also the media awareness has a good impact in mitigating the disease transmission at an initial stage of an epidemic it is worthy to mention that the media impact is not always remain efficacious for mitigating disease transmission throughout the epidemic 43  a detailed understanding of media awareness during an outbreak can help in the progression of an implementable public health strategy a particular interest to the designers of such strategies are the effects of media awareness on some significant epidemic features such as the size of the peak its timing and the whole number of diseases our proposed model and its simulation like those in earlier investigations 26-33 37 42 43  allow that quantifying these media effects gives additional insights our model simulation and prediction suggests that the novel coronavirus diseases has a potentiality to exhibit oscillatory dynamics in the future but can be controllable by maintaining social distances and effectiveness of isolation or hospitalization our model forecasts that isolation or hospitalization of populations with coronavirus symptoms under stringent hygiene safeguards and social distancing be able to effectual control in a community and may even eliminate the diseases our study also suggests that the size and duration of an epidemic can be considerably affected by timely implementation of the hospitalization or isolation programme based on the model simulations and prediction to control the coronavirus diseases we provide some particular inferences to face with emerging diseases i avoidance of mass gatherings rallies social distancing and implement extensive lock-down ii provide essential personal safeguard to the staff who are involved in emergency services iii timely give the statistics of the coronavirus diseases to the community including the number of asymptomatic cases symptomatic cases hospitalized cases and so on iv increase the media awareness to aware the population organize the targeted health care education and self-protection and remove the public mental disorder table i and rest of parameters are estimated and   taken from the table ii for

victims unsafe at home exploring the risk and consequences of intimate partner violence during the covid-19 pandemic catherine kaukinen   in looking at the way in which the covid-19 pandemic is likely to shape the incidence prevalence and impact of ipv it is important to note that scholars have explored how past natural disasters and epidemics have shaped trends in rates of violence impacted the health and well-being of ipv victims but also exacerbated the factors associated with violent behaviors and victimization this includes work in the united states and abroad on the impact of hurricanes earthquakes and other natural and man-made disasters parkinson 2019 campbell  jones 2016 chan  zhang 2011 buttell  carne 2009 there is strong evidence to suggest that womens physical and mental health and the risk of ipv is connected to the consequences of natural disasters and pandemics including social isolation economic instability and increasing relationship and family conflict given the likely impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the risk for a number of consequential health impacts galea merchant  lurie 2020 point to the need for investments in efforts to ensure historically marginalized groups and those likely to be isolated during the pandemic receive outreach services this includes older adults women with historic victimization experiences and those with mental illness and chronic health conditions drawing on police calls for service and arrest data from the new orleans police department both before and after hurricane katrina buttell and carney 2009 found a significant increase in calls for service along with increased rates of arrests for domestic violence related offenses they also found an increase in the severity of ipv in the post-hurricane data most importantly buttell and carney 2009 note that the new orleans police department actively responded to ipv calls for service following hurricane katrina and that there was not an agenda to prioritize other demands on police time during and after the crisis bell and folkerth 2016 have shown that survivors of natural disasters have significant health sequelae and that ptsd and depression are commonly seen in women who have lived through a natural disaster their work also draws on data post-hurricane katrina and showed that rates of violence against women rose from 46 cases per 100000 per day to well over 16 cases per 100000 per day among displaced populations following the hurricane they found that one year after hurricane katrina those victims housed in fema trailer parks reported higher levels of negative mental health as compared to non-victims in contrast work by bell  folkerth 2016 note evidence suggesting that for some couples natural disasters may enhance intimate relationships particularly among those individuals and couples with a strong sense of community and social cohesion along with those with a strong integration into the workforce these unprecedented events may provide increased time for couples to share coping mechanisms to manage the stress of these disasters and may also provide motivation and incentives to draw on social support systems that enhance their intimate relationship and relationships with others work by jenkins and phillips 2008 notes that while domestic-violence victims and survivors experienced heightened levels of violence during hurricane katrina and its aftermath even in that difficult context some women made the choice to call the police report the violence and leave their abusive situations this suggests that the stress and impact of natural disasters and pandemics may impact the decision-making of ipv victims they also noted that victim advocates responded in new ways to help these women meet their unique needs as both victims of ipv and post-katrina survivors as with these natural disasters and perhaps the covid-19 pandemic there may be an impetus for some women with long histories of ipv to report to the police and seek assistance from diverse medical and social service entities it may be that the pandemic will serve at the final crisis situation in their violent relationship these natural disasters may therefore serve as a cathartic event for victims of ipv leading to a turning point in attempts to bring an end to a violent relationship for some victims the pandemic may create the context in which they will proceed through what burke gielen mcdonnell ocampo  maman 2001 note as the key behavioral changes needed for ending and fleeing a violent relationship this includes assessing the options for and preparing for leaving selection of actions and the use of safety strategies to remain free from violence and abuse it will be challenging to fully document the early impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the incidence and impact of ipv due to the hidden nature of violence at the hands of an intimate partner the low rates of police reporting and the challenges for scholars to quickly deploy a research plan that would be able to draw on diverse methodologies to measure victimization experiences among a representative sample of the population will impact the ability to assess the connection between covid-19 and ipv this is a consequence of the under-reporting of these crimes to law enforcement agencies the under-utilization of victim and social service agencies by victims and the challenge of collecting self-report victimization data during the pandemic most importantly researchers do not yet have access to the types of data that would most readily allow for an examination of the relationship between covid-19 and ipv a recent article by the world health organization 2020 notes that many of the survey research methodologies drawn on traditionally in the violence against women literature will not be practical during the pandemic and others research strategies may place women at risk of violence yet there is some early data from the united states and abroad that suggests there have been increased reports of ipv during the pandemic particularly increases in officially reported ipv to police agencies emergency rooms domestic violence hotlines and social service agencies it is important to note that police reported crimes and victimization are not clearly correlated to actual levels of criminal and violent behavior increased reporting to the police and victim service agencies may be and is likely to be a function of an increased number of victimization experiences of those victims who are most apt to call the police to report their experiences these are more likely to be victims with the economic resources to be able to navigate ending a violent relationship and have the social support systems to assist changes in official reporting rates may also be a function of a change in the experiences and decision-making of those who were victims of ipv prior to the pandemic the pandemic may serve as the catalyst for victims to report their experiences importantly the early data on the relationship between covid-19 and ipv come from news agencies who report data from police agencies domestic violence shelters andor emergency rooms from individual or small groups of cities for example taubs 2020 new york times article notes evidence for the relationship between covid-19 and increased rates of ipv citing significant increased calls to domestic violence emergency support lines in china italy and spain yet the source nature and quality of the data for these reports is not clear bradbury-jones and isham 2020 similarly note that the leading ipv organization in the united kingdom reported that calls to its domestic violence hotline increased by 25 within the first week of the tighter social distancing and stay-at-home measures similarly azpirir 2020 also notes that a vancouver-based domestic violence crisis line had experienced a 300 increase in calls amid the covid-19 pandemic victims have also increased their utilization of internet based resources this includes increased internet browsing traffic to a united kingdom-based website which has seen a 150 surge in traffic after the government lockdowns bradbury-jones  isham 2020 campbell 2020 has suggested that the growing global trend of increasing reports of domestic violence cases is likely to continue throughout the pandemic and may only represent a tip of the iceberg as many victims still find themselves trapped with the perpetrator and unable to report the abuse the increasing sale of guns and ammunition during the pandemic also give rise to added concern for womens safety given the link between firearm access and the risk of lethal ipv an additional concern is the increased risk of childrens exposure to ipv given stay-at-home orders and school cancellation these are alarming increases in documented reporting via law enforcement agencies and victim service providers with consequential health and mental health impacts importantly they do not have the ability to tell us about the experiences of victims that do not seek assistance or are unable to make such calls due to shared quarantining with their abuser what will be needed as we proceed through the pandemic is the triangulation of diverse data sources from both criminal justice and social service agencies and self-report victimization data to explore the relationship between covid-19 and ipv to fully understand the extent of ipv as function of the stressors associated with covid-19 stay-at-home orders and social isolation researchers will need to identify the characteristics of the women and children that arewere most at risk during the pandemic research by piquero riddell bishopp narvey reid and piquero 2020 published in this special issue provides an initial exploration of the way in which the stay-at-home measures associated with the covid-19 pandemic may be correlated with domestic violence calls for service using domestic violence incident reports for dallas texas and an intervention time-series methodology they compared domestic violence crimes for an 83-day period before the mandated stay-at-home orders to a 35-day period thereafter they conclude that there is some evidence pointing to a short-term increase in the two weeks immediately following the stay-at-home orders in dallas but also note a decrease after the initial rise in officially reported ipv incidents the authors are cautious to attribute the increase to covid-19 orders as the cause of this increase as they note appeared to have been part of an increasing trend in officially reported ipv prior to the stay-at-home orders they also note that the short-term upward trend in domestic violence incidents may have been associated with citizens voluntarily following cdc recommendations to social distance and quarantine piquero et al 2020 also note that work looking to examine the association between covid-19 lockdown orders and changes and trends in domestic violence need to recognize the importance of exploring the factors associated with the economic implications of the pandemic that are associated with the risk of ipv including the social isolation associated with remote work and the financial stress of layoffs and furloughs the longstanding body of research on the reporting and under-reporting of ipv to the police will be important in the context of the work that will be needed to explore the connection between covid-19 and ipv the extensive scholarship on police reporting and ipv highlights the fact that the domestic violence crimes brought to the attention of the criminal justice system are not representative of all incidents of ipv or ipv victims and that the majority of these crimes remain unrecorded by official statistics police calls for service are therefore not a good measure of true incidence of ipv and this may be particularly true during covid-19 there are a number of factors that are likely to shape increases stability or declines in ipv calls for service to the police and the incidence of actual violent behavior and victimization is just one of those these are discussed below if we rely on data on social service utilization during covid-19 we are also likely to see a decline in this type of help-seeking and reporting because of social distancing measures that will prevent victims from accessing services we will therefore need to expand our data collection efforts beyond police reported incidents emergency room admissions shelter data and data from diverse social service providers in examining womens risk for intimate partner violence during covid-19 self-report victimization surveys offer an advantage over official law enforcement estimates the use of large-scale representative victimization data will help avoid some of the problems associated with law enforcement and clinical sample bias providing researchers with a larger estimate of the extent and dynamic nature of ipv yet a different form of selectivity will bias these estimates particularly during covid-19 self-report data typically under-represent the most severe and violent forms of intimate partner violence and abuse particularly among women with chronic health conditions and disabilities the samples from self-report data may therefore not include all women who are the victims of the most severe types of ipv or those who are victims of covid-19 disease this points to the need for careful joint analyses of self-report survey data estimates from law enforcement agencies and clinical data during and after covid-19 to tap diverse types of intimate partner abuse and also explore the way in which covid-19 disease progression may place women at further risk for physical violence emotional and financial abuse and coercive control this may be particularly true for older victims of ipv and would be exacerbated by covid-19 disease and symptoms this points to the need for leadership at the state and national level to organize and coordinate data collection for research and policy decision-making we likely will not have a good self-report measure of ipv during the pandemic perhaps some researchers will be able to measure in smaller regions with national science foundation rapid grants and other funding mechanisms but a national level data collection seems unlikely if this were to happen the leadership for the national crime victimization survey would need to move very quickly to develop measures that could tap changes in ipv both during and immediately after the pandemic but also measure the factors that might correlate with both ipv and covid-19 including the social isolation and stressors associated with social distancing and quarantine and the economic impacts of the pandemic on families there are a number of predictions that could be made with regard to the impact of covid-19 and police reports of ipv it is likely that we will see an increase in domestic violence calls for service to the police because of an actual increase and change in the level of violent behavior by some batterers and abusers this is likely to be the case among the same set of women who were victims of ipv prior to covid-19 and who might also during covid-19 experience a greater number of individual incidents of violence by their previously abusive partner and perhaps more severe types of abuse this increase in the incidence and severity of violence by historic abusers may lead to new reporting behaviors by these victims andor someone else in their household or neighborhood might increase their reporting to the police it is also likely that we will see a new set of victims experience violence due to the consequences of social distancing measures and stay-at-home orders these measures have placed those most vulnerable to violence and abuse in close proximity to their potential abuser and this may lead to an increase in the risk factors associated with ipv the cause of this increase is likely to be shaped by a variety of factors that are associated with ipv more generally but that will be more prevalent during the covid-19 pandemic this includes social isolation and increased attempts by abusers to exert power and coercive control unemployment economic distress marital conflict and substance use and abuse these are discussed further below the covid-19 epidemic may also serve at a turning point for some victims of ipv creating the crisis and catharsis that leads to attempts to flee and end the violent relationship alternatively the rates of police reporting victim calls for service during covid-19 could stay relatively flat we might actually see those who have been victims of ipv prior to the pandemic to now be less apt to call the police during covid-19 so while actual behaviors by offenders may stay the same or incidents of violence may go up during the pandemic some victims during covid-19 may be less likely to call the police or seek help this could be for a number of reasons including the lack of access to a secure place to call the police and reach out for help andor the inability to find a safe place to research options for leaving including safety planning organizing paperwork and packing due to quarantine and stay-at-home orders the lack of economic resources to leave the abuser during the pandemic and fear of reprisal by the offender leading to greater violence will also impact victim decision-making rates of police reporting may also decline there may be some women who will be less likely to call the police during the pandemic because they want to reserve these essential services for those in immediate need  specifically covid-19 patients it may be that during covid-19 that in some jurisdictions rates of police reporting could go down and rates of police reporting among some types of ipv victims decline actual violent behaviors may stay the same or go up or incidents of violence experienced by women who have been experiencing ipv prior to the pandemic may stay the same or go up but now women are even less likely during covid-19 to call the police to seek help for fear of reprisal and inability to find a safe place to call due to social distancing illness associated with covid-19 disease may also impact a victims ability to reach out for assistance with ipv calls for service would therefore decline during this time during covid-19 social distancing and stay-at-home orders may expand a current perpetrators coercive control and power over their victim with victims and perpetrators in close proximity batterers will be able to increase their ability to be in control of decision-making determine day-to-day outcomes and monitor and socially isolate their victim from family and friends bradbury-jones and isham 2020 note that the home is often a sphere where the dynamics of power are distorted and subverted by perpetrators during covid-19 this is made worse due to the lack of outside scrutiny from family and friends for many victims this will lead to increased physical violence emotional and financial abuse and coercive control alternatively for those victims who have learned to adapt to their batterers control techniques and read the cues for their use of violence and abuse the use of ipv by some batters may decline given stay-at-home orders the batterer will be better able to exert day-to-day control over household decision-making and there may be less perceived need by the abuser to use physical violence since the batterer is able to exert control and manipulate their victim during stay-at-home orders abusers may be better able to know where their victims are and control their victims access to their family and friends  preventing access via the phone computer andor other technologies for these batterers their ability to gain control and manipulate their victim may lead them to not need to use physical methods to gain coercive control there are a number of elements of the covid-19 pandemic that may also serve as mechanisms of control by abusers for example batterers use a variety of methods to exert control over their victims and keep their victims in a constant state of fear these may be expanded during the pandemic covid-19 may be used by offenders both those currently with their victim and those who are separated or divorced as a way to control the victim via threats to expose them and their shared children to the novel coronavirus victims may also fear their abuser taking their children outside of the home during the outbreak and not be able to control who their children are exposed to or whether proper hygiene and social distancing measures are practiced other violent partners and ex-partners may use a victims risk for covid-19 sucha as those who are healthcare providers grocery store workers working in transportation etc as a way to seek custody of their shared children during the pandemic and this custody may continue after the pandemic healthcare providers may be particularly vulnerable to this type of abusive behavior since children may be social distancing with the abusive partner while the victim is forced to quarantine in another area of their home or outside of the home due to their ongoing risk for covid-19 the risk factors for ipv victimization and the factors that limit womens ability to leave violent relationships include economic dependence on male partners ie lack of education income and employment and the responsibility for children both before and after divorce a history of violent victimization also places women at risk demographic factors also shape risk including age younger raceethnicity and marital status cohabitation and dating finally male partners with drug and alcohol problems chronic unemployment and prior intimate partner violence are at greater risk for perpetration and these factors may be particularly prevalent during the covid-19 pandemic it is difficult to know whether during the pandemic we might see violence by new offenders men who were not previously violent to their partner or an increase in violence by previously violent men due to increased proximity and exposure between victims and offenders and the exacerbation of these risk factors for ipv the question researchers will need to explore both during the early stages of the pandemic and long-term is whether there has been or will be an increase in ipv among men who were not previously violent due to factors that enhance the risk for ipv that also correlate with the covid-19 pandemic see below alternatively will we may be most likely to see an increased incidence and severity of violence by perpetrators who were previously violent but now covid-19 has exacerbated the role of those risk factors stress frustration perspectives posit that any form of negative affect or distress is likely to increase the likelihood of violence and aggression stressful life events produce aggression and violence because they create negative affect stress-frustration theories holtzworth-munroe bates smutzler  sandin 1997 suggest that diminished economic resources within the family lead to stress frustration and conflict in intimate relationships that heightens the risk of male-perpetrated violence against women this suggests that during covid-19 women with unemployed partners would be at the greatest risk for ipv and abuse the economic uncertainty during the pandemic and record levels of unemployment are likely to add to the stress experienced by both men and women heightening the risk of marital conflict and violence economic and marital dependency of female partners on their husbands will place many women at risk for new or continued ipv during covid-19 and also create financial challenges to women navigating ending a violent relationship womens lack of employment and financial resources during the pandemic and their disproportionate responsibility for children will limit their ability to end violent relationships andor identify mechanisms for leaving their abuser some feminist research kaukinen 2004 anderson 1997 also suggests that economic variables are often symbolic in nature and that men who do not have access to marital power via employment and economic resources will use violence in an attempt to re-establish their power at home given their lack of access to economic resources to establish a traditional masculinity the financial stress of the covid-19 pandemic will be unprecedented we have already seen the highest rates of unemployment in the last 50 years for those couples in which the female partner may be able to continue working remotely or otherwise while the male partner is unemployed will experience a shift in economic and symbolic power particularly among couples in which the male partner previously held that breadwinner role in exploring the role of covid-19 and the risk of ipv social distancing and stay-at-home orders will likely lead to increased conflict disagreements and arguments due to increased daily proximity of couples this in turn could lead to an increased prevalence of common couple violence among both couples with and without previous ipv johnson 1995 notes that this type of intimate partner violence does not include severe acts of violence is likely to be mutual between partners gender symmetric and does not exhibit a general pattern of coercive control by the male partner a recent new york times article by taub 2020 on china noted that some victims stated that during the epidemic we were unable to go outside and our conflicts just grew bigger and bigger and more and more frequent everything was exposed for some couples particularly those experiencing financial and family stressors during the pandemic they will likely have an increase in the number of arguments and conflicts during sustained social isolation and physical proximity increases in common couple violence is a likely consequence of the pandemic particularly among young and newly formed intimate relationships the risk and impact of ipv during the covid-19 pandemic may also be shaped by rates of drug and alcohol use and abuse there is research brooks webster smith woodland wessely greenberg  rubin 2020 to suggest that quarantine and other social isolating conditions are associated with alcohol abuse depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms while researchers fals-stewart 2003 leonard  quigley 1999 have pointed to a strong correlation between drinking and in particular heavy alcohol consumption and the risk of intimate partner violence the exact mechanism is less clear some scholars have suggested that problematic drinking and the risk of ipv perpetration may share a common etiology a need to achieve personal power and control my own research has shown that women with male partners who engage in heavy episodic drinking are also more likely to engage in both physical violence and coercive control the exact relationship between alcohol and drug use and abuse and the risk of ipv is complicated substance abuse along with the economic stressors associated with covid-10 will provide perpetrators with an excuse and justification for their violent and abusive battering behaviors and an explanation for victims to excuse their abuser alcohol allows perpetrators to justify their violent behavior and for victims to explain it and excuse it it is therefore best to view substance use as a risk marker for ipv while not a direct cause at the same time drinking may increase the frequency or severity of male perpetrated violence against women clay and parker 2020 note the importance of public health approaches that explore the public health effects of long-term social isolation related to covid-19 on alcohol use and misuse noting the need to protect the most vulnerable individuals from excessive alcohol consumption during the pandemic in addressing the connection between substance use and the stressors associated with covid-19 da im  schiano 2020 note the need to put in place awareness and telehealth strategies to curb what is likely to become a serious consequence of the coronavirus pandemic many ipv victims will be reluctant to seek help from healthcare providers or engage in social service utilization during the pandemic for some victims they may be reluctant to seek healthcare or other emergency care for their ipv-related injuries due to the fear of contracting covid-19 due to enhanced exposure in healthcare settings other victims might believe they should reserve those healthcare services for the people most in need those suffering from covid-19 disease many ipv victims will have reduced access to victim services during the pandemic since many of these services are limited by social distancing and stay-at-home orders and are only operating remotely remote type therapies and services are likely to place many victims at risk for further violence by their abuser or may lack access to phones and internet during covid-19 due to financial hardships or coercive control by their abuser access to housing and other advocacy services will continue to be limited during the early days of stay-at-home orders due to social distancing and quarantine requirements with many of these services temporarily shut down including courthouses for example a fall outbreak of the pandemic will make worse womens experiences with ipv and further limit their options for leaving a violent partner there will be the need for strong federal and state leadership to expand victims access to support services and economic resources during the pandemic we will need to be creative in our thinking on how to outreach to victims and provide awareness messaging to bystanders we will need to create ways in which ipv victims will be able to safely access both in-person and telehealth options in discrete ways without alerting their perpetrator bradbury-jones and isham 2020 also point to the importance of protecting the advocates who work in a voluntary manner to support victims and the need for personal protective equipment to be provided boserup mckenney  elkbul 2020 note the importance of making ipv screening tools and assessments more readily available in diverse clinical settings and among telehealth providers during the pandemic social workers advocates and others who work with victims will need to identify ways to safely work with victims on safety planning and self-care but also plans for victims to leave their violent partner there will need to be collaboration and creative thinking on how to expand the availability of services and diversify the nature of transitional housing particularly for victims who may have contracted or been exposed to covid-19 for those victims who report to the police there will be a need for more intensive police and social service follow-up both during and after the covid-19 pandemic this will be particularly true for women who remain in their home with the abuser finally we will need to change the way in which awareness campaigns have provided information to ipv victims and bystanders reliance on public spaces for this information is no longer the most effective way to outreach to victims boserup mckenney  elkbul 2020 therefore suggest that diverse social media outlets should seek to identify ways to reach a wider audience during city lockdowns and stay-at-home orders  global assessment of environment

there were 2896746  377 per million people reported cases around the globeof which 202846  26 per million people deaths were recorded alongside 1993780  260 per million people active cases and 816685  106 per million people recovered cases lauren 2020 currently the usa has the highest number of confirmed cases 938154 and deaths 53755 among 183 countries followed by spain 223759 confirmed cases and 22902 deaths italy 195351 confirmed cases and 26384 deaths france 160292 confirmed cases and 22614 deaths germany 156513 confirmed cases and 5877 deaths and the uk 148377 confirmed cases and 20319 deaths lauren 2020 surprisingly this is the first time in history that coronavirus has triggered a global pandemic thus covid-19 is a public health concern that poses grave threats to health environment and economic outcomes the novel coronavirus is reported to have attracted more global discussion and pandemic uncertainty compared to sars 20022003 avian flu 20032009 swine flu 20092010 and ebola 20142016 since 1996 ahir et al 2018 though uncertainty levels due to pandemic are reported to be high in developing countries due to its strong relationship with market volatility and economic uncertainty ahir et al 2018 however a first-quarter report fig 1 on covid-19 global pandemic uncertainty1 ranks the uk 12836 index as the country with the highest uncertainty level among 143 countries towards covid-19 pandemic other countries include switzerland 9173 mexico 6756 brazil 6683 nigeria 6427 canada 6130 peru 4983 kenya 4506 germany 4491 and the usa 4357 knoema 2020 during this period of the global pandemic several measures have been put in place to contain the spread of covid-19 gautam and hens 2020 such containment measures include quarantine travel ban and restrictions social distance enforcement and lockdownclosure of public places and cancellation of public events these containment measures put in place to reduce health outcomes of the global pandemic have affected environmental sustainability and economic development while some studies have reported the environmental impact of covid-19 gautam and trivedi 2020 no study has yet reported the health and economic implications of the global pandemic given this we present the pros and cons of environmental health and economic impacts of covid-19 across countries we contribute to the existing studies on covid-19 pandemic by examining the impact of covid-19 on health outcomes and provide recent policies to improve health quality across the globe second we present the several fiscal measures monetary policies and private sector economic burden-sharing across countries due to the impact of the social distancing measures on economic sectors this is essential to understand the global picture of the covid-19 pandemic from socio-economic and environmental dimensions social distancing policies instituted across countries are reported to have yielded environment sustainability total lockdown in many countries saw a halt in carbon and energy-intensive economic sectors such as manufacturing and transportation the interruption of road transportation and airlines saw overwhelming decongestion in urban centres and traffic level leading to a decline in anthropogenic emissions verisk 2020 it is reported that the social distancing measures led to a decline of energy demand and industrial output hence affecting environmental quality coal-fired power generation is reported to have declined by 50 in china whereas oil consumption declined by 2030 carbon brief 2020 the reduction in coal and oil consumption led to a decline in carbon dioxide emissions by 25 100mtco2 corresponding to a 6 reduction in global emissions carbon brief 2020 nasa satellite images showed a reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions by 70 due to a reduction in the consumption of fossil fuels during the lockdown period ucar 2020 ambient particulate matter pm 25 is reported to have declined within the short period when social distancing was enforced in asian and european countries gautam 2020 kasha 2020 carbon monoxide and aerosol concentration levels are observed to have declined in urban and industrial areas with high economic activities gautam and trivedi 2020 holthaus 2020 however no evidence exists regarding the impact of cremation of covid-19 death victims on sulphur dioxide emissions kasha 2020 it is reported that exposure to ambient air pollution increases morbidity and mortality sarkodie et al 2019 people with underlying conditions such as cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases are more susceptible to covid-19 meaning that the reduction in air pollution waterpipe and tobacco use reduces the risk of covid-19 who 2020d there are reports of medical and municipal waste generation linked to the covid-19 pandemic acrplus 2020 as much as six times of medical waste 240 metric tonnes were generated daily in hospitals in china calma 2020 hence china had to construct new medical waste disposal centres and mobile waste facilities to increase the waste disposal treatment from 50 tonnes to 263 tonnes daily mandy 2020 zhong 2020 social distancing and shutdown of the tourism industry are likely to improve biodiversity and enhance the regenerative capacity of the marine habitat fishing ground and forest reserve the reduction in road and railway transportation and shutdown of commercial power plants and manufacturing activities are likely to reduce ambient noise levels zambrano-monserrate et al 2020 we note that a temporary reduction in atmospheric emissions and environmental degradation in the time of global pandemic does not translate into total environmental sustainability but a transitory period that will experience a rebound effect during post-covid-19 the premise of the argument is centred on the grave economic damage caused by the observation of social distancing measures to mitigate the spread of covid-19 the introduction of welfare cost health system policies fiscal monetary and exchange rate measures are gradually leading many economies into recession hence many economies especially developing countries will utilize the scale effect approach  where resource depletion carbon and energy-intensive economic structure are given priority over environmental sustainability sarkodie and strezov 2018 however it is too early to conclude on the impact of the aftermath of covid-19 on environmental pollution the strategic objectives of who to combat the global pandemic include the interruption of human-to-human transmission prevent secondary infections and animal transmission and decline cross-boundary spread who 2020b other core objectives include the reduction in socio-economic impact via multi-sectoral partnership treatment opportunities enhanced diagnostics therapeutics and vaccines who 2020a several measures to support and significantly impact the health system have been instituted across countries to provide an immediate response to the covid-19 pandemic for example in albania 20 million euros was provided to procure medical equipment and support medical staff frontline nurses doctors and other health workers received 1000 euros as additional payment imf 2020 besides emergency law was instituted to fine private hospitals refusing to provide healthcare assistance with a tune of 40000 euros and 83000

to resident doctors 2000 beds and 6500 ventilators were hired for intensive care units and telemedicine and online consultations were initiated uol 2020 in china over 42000 medical professionals were sent to wuhan where the outbreak began islamuddin 2020 two new temporary hospitals were constructed whereas dozens of laboratories were equipped for rapid testing medical and pharmaceutical-related goods and services for covid-19 were exempted from fees whereas medical-related research into vaccines to combat the virus were supported oecd 2020b in dominican republic the government instituted no cost of testing covid-19 for people older than 59 years people with 2 or more health-related symptoms and those with weak health conditions two hospitals were designated for solely receiving and

the debt ceiling was increased from 30 to 50 of gdp whereas the fiscal debt is expected to increase from the projected 64 of gdp to 9 gulf today 2020 it is reported that the choice of a government to undertake strong fiscal stimulus depends mainly on sovereign credit ratings and economic stringency to salvage the deteriorating economic effect of social distancing policies to reduce the spread of covid-19 balajee et al 2020 the critical assessment presented in this study reveals a trade-off between environment health and economic development though the study is limited in terms of data due to the progressive nature of the covid-19 pandemic however the global pandemic has demonstrated the need to empirically assess the trilemma of environment-health-economic nexus while environmental pollution is reported to have declined due to shutdown in vital economic sectors such as transportation aviation and industries the health systems have been improved significantly to save lives at the expense of economic deterioration nevertheless a rebound effect is projected to occur across countries via rebooting of primary economic sectors to salvage economic loss based on both qualitative and quantitative assessment the post-covid-19 is expected to rekindle and intensify environmental degradation while improving and sustaining the health system to recover and sustain economic productivity on the contrary the aftermath of the covid-19 pandemic will have a long-lasting societal effect on workplaces public places and social events which will directly affect the economic transition thus governmental effort across countries is required to strike a balance between environmental sustainability health outcomes and sustained economic development due to the potential trade-off effects  unprecedented pandemic unprecedented shift and unprecedented opportunity zheng yan   the covid19 pandemic is currently spreading across the world in an unprecedented way as of march 24 20203 among 169 countries in the world the total accumulative confirmed cases are 387382 and the total number of death is 16767 johns hopkins university 2020 this pandemic has been compared to the second world war or the great depression in terms of its wide scope and broad impact one unique impact stands out among its various types of impacts on public heath economic political education and many others sectors of the modern society that is the covid19 pandemic forces humans to social isolations in order to control the extremely infectious coronavirus currently different countries have been using different methods of social isolations these methods include voluntary selfisolation mandatory quarantine travel restrictions stayathome order shutdowns of restaurants theaters churches sports venues museums and other social organizations closures of schools and universities working at home limits or closures of transportations such as airplanes trains buses and ships closures of country borders declaration of state of emergency and lockdowns of entire cities entire regions and entire countries nowadays social distancing has become the latest buzzword in the headlines of media covering the covid19 pandemic one recent example is that the worldrenowned opera singer plcido domingo has tested positive for the coronavirus on march 22 2020 and he is in selfisolation at home chen  lee 2020 another heartbreaking example is that a holocaust survivor arie even passed away on march 21 2020 as the first coronavirus death case in israel but his family was unable to be with him during his final days to avoid getting the virus estrin 2020 while it appears to be as novel as it is now social distancing actually is traditional public health measures used for decades during major influenza virus outbreaks wildersmith  freedman 2020 these public health measures typically include isolating ill persons contact tracing quarantining exposed persons school closures workplace closures and avoiding crowding technically the basic idea of social distancing is to reduce risks of persontoperson transmission by delaying the epidemic peak reducing the size of the epidemic peak and spreading cases over a longer time to relieve pressure on the healthcare system fong et al 2020 p 1 the widely implemented social distancing measures to control the covid19 pandemic have generated one unprecedented shift that is various types of human social interactions eg shopping banking learning meeting and entertaining are shifted from dominantly offline to dominantly online in other words the enforced social isolations in the physical world significantly increase humans social interactions in the cyber world this becomes a new normal in our daily life for example in the education sector thousands of universities including stanford harvard princeton yale and mit have moved regular facetoface teaching to online teaching this worldwide movement might be the largest online education practice in the human history the article published by dr wei bao in this issue documents such a case in the business sector online shopping has almost become the mainstream shopping behavior for people to buy foods groceries medicines and many other products from online stores such as httpamozoncom or online services of regular stores such as walmart in the entertainment sector many theaters eg metropolitan opera and museums eg various national museums in china have been offering a series of live stream online performances or virtual exhibitions in the public health sector specific mobile apps have been developed successfully for testing tracing analyzing and social distancing in china singapore korea uk and other countries in the world this week dr ashley mason at ucsf is running an experimental study with over 2000 san francisco emergency medical workers by asking them to wear the oura rings a wearable device to monitors body temperature breathing heart rate and other physical indicators in order to track their body temperature in the real time and identify the early onset of covid19 gafni 2020 with the unprecedented shift to the cyber world we are observing an accelerated diffusion of emerging digital technologies among ordinary people diffusion is the key concept of american sociologist everett rogers wellknown theory of diffusion of innovations rogers 2010 roger defined diffusion as a process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of certain social systems based on this theory different innovations may have different sshaped diffusion curves different community members can be categorized into five types innovators early adopter early majority later majority and laggards in the battle against the covid19 pandemic various emerging digital technologies may show much steeper diffusion sshaped curves and much more ordinary people might become early adopters and early majority rather than later majority and laggards eg more and more teachers are able to teach online via zoom effectively in contrary we are also observing various cases that reduce or limit diffusion of emerging digital technologies for example cybersecurity and privacy concerns have been increasing more than ever while countries began tracking those possibly exposed to the coronavirus individuals and organizations are suffering more from misinformation that has been spreading widely and quickly through online videos social media or personal emails the covid19 pandemic also provides an unprecedented opportunity for our research community of studying technologyrelated behavior to join the worldwide efforts to fight against and eventually win the current pandemic our research community can a explore and exercise how emerging technologies can be best used to help human beings directly fight against the current pandemic at this moment b observe study and understand various kinds of protective and risky human behavior under the current pandemic and c describe explain and predict human behavior with emerging technologies in the context of an extreme event like the current pandemic for future prevention and intervention the currently published research has been predominately focusing on medical and public health issues regarding diagnosis management and treatment of covid19 while researchers started to publish studies on using emerging technologies to tackle the pandemic eg pandey gautam bhagat  sethi 2020 wang ng  brook 2020 much more timely efforts should be made to conduct behavioral studies on how technologies can be used to guide peoples behavior one excellent example of behavioral research is a recent research report titled using behavioural science to help fight the coronavirus lunn et al 2020 in this report released on march 12 2020 pete lunn and his collaborators in ireland spent 1 week and reviewed the existing behavioral science literature on seven topics hand washing face touching entering and coping with isolation encouraging collective action avoiding undesirable behavior crisis communication and risk perception their review clearly indicates that while a wide variety of medical and public health strategies eg developing new vaccines or tracing contacts and movements can be used to fight against covid19 behavioral sciences and behavioral interventions can be used to change humans knowledge judgment decisionmaking and actual behavior eg improving handwashing and knowing how to selfisolate to seize this opportunity in 20212020 our journal will enthusiastically welcome behavior studies of using emerging technologies to deal with covid19 and various extreme events the possible manuscripts could concern case studies eg bao this issue literature review eg gaspar yan  domingos 2019 empirical studies eg pandey et al 2020 theoretical see human behavior and emerging technologiess hbet call for papers on a special issue on theoretical studies and methodological see hbets call for papers on a special issue on methodological studies we need to study what kinds of people eg elder and young patients have used emerging technologies to fight against the pandemic what specific emerging technologies eg social video games and zoom have been used how new humantechnology interactions eg binge screen viewing and largescale distance learning have been taking place and why various positive and negative behavioral impacts eg the cabin fever effect and the digital vision syndrome has been generated these efforts will help us understand human behavior with technologies in both extreme events and ordinary events and take us one step closer to answer the basic question of how humans behave with emerging technologies  suicide in the time of covid-19 a perfect storm sabrina brown donna schuman l   in this commentary we consider a convergence of suicide risk factors amid an international crisis and introduce a new approach in understanding and preventing suicidal behaviors our approach is a novel theoretical framework that can guide future research to include this added dimension suicide is a leading cause of death in the united states and kentucky in the us suicide rates have steadily risen over the past 2 decades by an estimated 30 1 between 2005 and 2017 suicide was the second leading cause of death in ages 25-34 and the third in 10-to 24- year-olds suicide rates in the us are consistently highest for white males between 25 and 34 2 in kentucky suicide was the second leading cause of death in ages 15-34 and the third in 10-to 14-year-olds 2 white males age 18-40 who used a firearm and lived in a rural kentucky county made up the group with the consistently highest suicide rate 13 of this group were known to have ever served in the military 3 precipitating suicide circumstances between 2005 and 2017 most often included depressed mood mental health intimate partner and physical health problems and substance misuse 3 on january 31 2020 health and human services secretary alex azar declared the novel coronavirus covid-19 a public health emergency 4 to reduce the viral spread to limit loss of life the white houses coronavirus task force recommended that persons aged 60 and over and those with serious underlying health conditions engage in social distancing social distancing is a traditional public health practice to reduce disease spread by reducing interactions between people in a community 5 in accordance with task force recommendations on march 7 kentucky governor andy beshear called for social distancing for high-risk persons 4 days later he extended stay healthy at home recommendations to encompass all kentuckians 6 in weighing his decision to reopen parts of the country out of concerns for the economic impact versus continued social distancing practices through april president donald trump warned of a potential uptick in suicide given the gravity of the covid-19 pandemic in terms of its suicidogenic potential it is critical to explore the commonwealth of kentuckys social distancing policy implications in terms of self-directed violence sdv fatal and nonfatal suicide-related outcomes encompassing intrapersonal eg comorbid physical and psychiatric illnesses interpersonal eg relationship and extrapersonal eg community cultural geographical determinants finkels i-cubed i 3  model not previously applied to suicide 7 offers enhanced explanatory potential over prevailing suicide theories for examining the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on suicide steelesmith and associates found that from 1999-2016 suicide rates were higher and increased more rapidly in rural than in large metropolitan counties 8 they attributed these findings to low social capital high social fragmentation an increasing percentage of the population without health insurance and an increasing percentage of veterans they recommended improving social connectedness health insurance coverage and meaningful contributions to community while limiting access to lethal means results from other studies show suicide rates for adolescents and young adults were higher in rural than in urban communities regardless of the method used and those disparities were found to increase over time 9 including elements of the interpersonal theory of suicide and durkheims suicide theory finkels i 3 model 7 is a novel and validated meta-theoretical framework that goes beyond these prevailing suicide theories and introduces modeling of multiple and interacting risk and protective factors these factors are operationalized as instigators impellors and inhibitors which increase or reduce the proclivity to suicide instigators are immediate environmental stimuli that produce context affording proclivity to enact sdv impellors are situational or dispositional qualities on proclivity to enact sdv the net strength of instigators and impellors determines the level of sdv proclivity inhibitors are forces that decrease or inhibit the likelihood of sdv whereas disinhibitors are those forces that increase or strengthen the possibility that sdv would occur perfect storm theory pst a midrange theory arising out of the i 3 model offers a way to test these 3-way interaction processes through a mediator sdv proclivity and an outcome sdv illuminating how at-risk individuals progress from thoughts of suicide to ending their lives according to pst pandemic sdv is more likely to result in death to the degree that instigators eg pandemic-related environmental factors such as increased social isolation due to social distancing and impellors eg dispositional or situational factors such as heightened severity in mental health problems from pandemicrelated dread and uncertainty are strong in the face of weak inhibitors eg availability of effective treatment and ready access to help and strong disinhibitors eg alcohol intoxication alternatively to the extent that instigation and impellance forces are weak and inhibition forces eg the ready availability of telehealth visits from physical and mental health providers are robust sdv would be less likely to occur 10 at the kentucky injury prevention and research center we have begun observing the convergence of multiple suicidogenic risk factors in kentucky and nationally since the onset of the covid-19 pandemic in the us extended social distancing increases social isolation for populations of concern evidence has linked social isolation and loneliness to mental health problems 10 and researchers have detected strong associations between social isolation and suicide 11 mental health problems depression and other mental health problems are strongly linked to suicide across all demographics around the country suicide hotlines and prevention services are reporting increased numbers of calls and hotline calls in kentucky have increased by at least 20 12 13 increased utilization of suicide hotlines and prevention services suggest mental health problems are growing in the face of amplified dread fear and uncertainty related to the pandemic increases in mental health problems among kentuckians could result in higher rates of suicide behavior alcohol and other substance misuse is often a factor in suicide deaths 14 and use has historically increased during economic downturns and national disasters 15 16 since the onset of the pandemic alcohol sales have spiked 17 governor beshears march 16 order closing non-essential businesses allowed liquor stores to continue operating 6 restaurants are also permitted to deliver beer or wine with takeout orders 18 the availability of alcohol in the absence of an ability to readily access positive coping outlets eg gyms and houses of worship could contribute to greater misuse during the pandemic suicide rates have historically increased during economic upheavals 19 20 according to the us department of labor a record number of kentuckians filed for unemployment benefits for the weeks ending march 21 and 28 due to layoffs and furloughs 21 relationship problems are associated with increased suicide risk for both men and women intimate partner violence ipv is related to intimate partner homicide-suicide 22 in kentucky and across the nation reports of ipv and visits to online domestic violence resources have increased since the onset of social distancing 23 access to lethal means according to federal bureau of investigation statistics on firearm background checks for march 2020 americans purchased firearms at record rates 24 years i the lower rate does not imply that the pandemic will not impact state and national suicide rates historically suicide rates decrease during the early phase-or honeymoon period-of a crisis and during periods of high community cohesion 25 following the honeymoon period however based on historical trends rates will likely increase established disaster recovery frameworks can be applied to help predict where we find ourselves as the response to and recovery from this pandemic continues indefinitely according to the substance abuse and mental health services administration the next phase in a disaster is -disillusionment as people realize the limits of assistance 26 as the crisis becomes chronic discouragement stress exhaustion and substance misuse may begin to emerge increasing gaps between those that return to business as usual and those that have continued needs lead to feelings of abandonment this phase can last months and even years the convergence of suicide risk factors related to the pandemic as well as points of intervention can be understood in terms of the i 3 model and pst the second-and thirdorder psychological and social effects of the novel coronavirus are only beginning to emerge in kentucky and across the nation most of the impact remains undiscovered at this time due to extended periods of social isolation from social distancing coupled with the extreme economic upheaval the covid-19 pandemic creates a perfect storm of antecedent conditions for suicide necessitating week-to-week monitoring of suicide trends in kentucky and the nation further study on the impact of the pandemic on suicide in special populations such as older persons veterans persons with chronic health conditions and those living in rural areas will be necessary as we acclimate to a new way of life we must be proactive in developing targeted pandemic suicide prevention efforts aimed at our most vulnerable populations endnote i the decrease could be due to incomplete reporting or investigation  implications of the covid-19 san francisco bay area shelter-in-place announcement a cross-sectional social media survey holly elser mathew kiang v esther john m julia simard f melissa bondy lorene nelson m wei-ting chen eleni linos   the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic began when clusters of pneumonia of unknown etiology were identified in december 201915 by may 2020 there were over 3 million confirmed cases globally one-third of these confirmed cases occurred in the united states us with over 60000 recorded deaths to date67 in the absence of vaccines or treatments8 the primary defense has been to reduce the risk of sars-cov-2 exposure through non-pharmaceutical interventions npis such as school closures social distancing isolation and quarantine and use of personal masks913 npis were shown to be effective during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov outbreak14 and quickly became the cornerstone of mitigation and intervention strategies for covid-19 globally1517 however the extent and level of enforcement of these measures vary widely9 on march 19 2020 california was the first us state to enact a statewide shelter-in-place order18 following an announcement on march 16 2020 of shelter-in-place orders for seven san francisco bay area counties effective on 1201 am on march 17 202019 in the following weeks 42 states and the district of columbia passed shelter-in-place orders20 potential subsequent sars-cov-2 wintertime outbreaks may necessitate repeated intermittent social distancing orders into 202217 given the unprecedented nature of these orders in the us it is critical that we understand the impact of shelter-in-place orders on the publics behaviors and perceptions for the present study we employed convenience sampling to rapidly ascertain and summarize how levels of social distancing difficulty related to daily activities such as obtaining food essential medications and childcare and levels of concern regarding the covid-19 crisis changed after the march 16 2020 shelter-in-place announcement among respondents living in the seven affected california counties compared with respondents living elsewhere in the us we conducted a cross-sectional online survey with convenience sampling through three social media platforms nextdoor twitter and facebook starting on march 14 2020 through april 1 2020 twitter and facebook posts were shareable to facilitate snowball sampling we included all respondents who completed at least 80 of the survey and excluded those missing both zip code and geoip location and those outside of the us the 21-item survey collected information regarding shelter-in-place behaviors experienced difficulty with daily activities level of

on the implications of shelter-in-place orders announced for six san francisco bay area counties san francisco santa clara san mateo marin contra costa and alameda and separately for santa cruz county made mid-day on march 16 2020 hereafter referred to collectively as seven bay area counties we classified survey responses collected before march 16 2020 as having occurred before the shelter-in-place announcement we did so in order to more precisely identify responses that occurred before the announcement as we anticipated that some respondents were aware of or suspected the shelter-in-place announcement several hours before it occurred we differentiated survey respondents living in the seven affected bay area counties from those residing elsewhere in the us using self-reported zip codes for invalid or missing zip codes we assigned participants locations based on latitude and longitude ie geoip location an estimation of the respondents location based on their ip address we considered three outcomes social distancing behaviors all of the time most of the time some of the time none of the time experienced difficulties with daily activities access to healthcare childcare transportation job loss or difficulty obtaining essential items including food medications and hand sanitizer and level of concern regarding the covid-19 crisis extremely concerned very concerned moderately concerned somewhat concerned not at all concerned we used linear probability models to assess changes in levels of social distancing the proportion of respondents experiencing difficulty with daily activities and level of concern regarding the covid-19 crisis after versus before the shelter-in-place announcement separately for respondents in the seven bay area counties and for respondents elsewhere in the us beta coefficients were transformed to reflect percent changes in each response level after the announcement was made we used a difference-in-differences did approach with linear probability models to estimate the impact of the shelter-in-place announcement2122 the did estimator compared the change in responses after versus before march 16 2020 among respondents in the bay area versus elsewhere in the us the did approach assumes that any changes that occurred outside of the bay area reflect background or secular trends under the assumption that these trends would have been parallel among respondents in the bay area and elsewhere had the shelter-in-place announcement not occurred the resulting did estimates correspond to the change in each outcome attributable to the announcement itself in the bay area we calculated did estimates in the study population overall and within subgroups defined by gender age and household composition at least one child at home at least one adult  65 years we considered three alternative approaches for the did analysis first we compared responses from the entire state of california to those of respondents elsewhere in the us because the announcement was highly publicized on mainstream news media channels and social media platforms survey respondents living in california outside of the seven bay area counties may have modified their behaviors we therefore repeated the main analysis comparing respondents in california to respondents in other us states second a similar announcement also occurred in washington state on march 16 2020 therefore we repeated the main analysis with respondents from washington state combined with bay area respondents finally we repeated the main analysis excluding responses after march 19 2020  when california announced a state-wide shelter-in-place order we conducted all statistical analyses using r version 323 r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria this study was approved by the institutional review board at stanford university in table 2 we present the change in level of social distancing difficulties experienced and level of concern following the march 16 2020 shelter-in-place announcement for respondents from the bay area and respondents living elsewhere in general we observed similar trends in the two groups we found an increase in the proportion of respondents practicing social distancing all of the time after the shelter-in-place announcement in the bay area 92 95 ci 66 119 and elsewhere 34 95 ci 20 50 we also observed increases in the proportion sheltering in place most of the time among survey respondents from the bay area 57 95 ci 23 90 and elsewhere 85 95 ci 68 103 the proportion of respondents sheltering in place some of the time and none of the time decreased both among respondents from the bay area and elsewhere respondents also reported more difficulty associated with activities such as obtaining food hand sanitizer and medications after the march 16 2020 shelter-in-place announcement versus before the increase in difficulty was largest for obtaining food for both respondents from the bay area 133 95 ci 104 163 and elsewhere 82 95 ci 66 97 similarly both groups reported greater difficulty obtaining hand sanitizer greater difficulty with wages was reported more frequently by respondents from the bay area following the shelter-in-place announcement 47 95 ci 26 68 and even more so by respondents living elsewhere 64 95 ci 52 76 respondents in both groups were also more likely to report difficulty related to job loss following the announcement bay area 12 95 ci 05 18 elsewhere 16 95 ci 11 20 we observed only small changes in level of concern regarding the covid-19 crisis after the march 16 2020 shelter-in-place announcement among respondents in the bay area among respondents living elsewhere we observed a decrease in the proportion of respondents reporting they were extremely concerned after the announcement  41 95 ci  57  24 in table 3 we present did estimates for the change in the proportion of respondents who were social distancing all of the time after the shelter-in-place announcement in the bay area versus elsewhere overall the proportion of respondents social distancing all of the time increased after the announcement in the bay area versus

respondents living with at least one child 620 95 ci 062 118 the proportion reporting extreme worry decreased in some groups including men those under age 25 and those living outside the bay area the overall pattern of results in all three sensitivity analyses was consistent with our main analysis effect estimates were slightly attenuated when we compared california respondents to respondents elsewhere in the us or when we combined washington state respondents with bay area respondents supplemental tables a3 a4 a5 and slightly accentuated when we excluded survey responses after march 19 2020 we examined changes in attitudes and behaviors as a result of the covid-19 crisis in a cross-sectional convenience sample of 17543 respondents recruited through three social media platforms differences in ey demographic characteristics level of insurance educational attainment raceethnicity preclude generalization of our findings to the bay area or to the us more broadly nevertheless the study data capture how social distancing behaviors difficulties with daily activities and levels of concern regarding how covid-19 may have changed in the days that immediately preceded and immediately followed the announcement of the nations first shelter-in-place order for seven bay area counties this announcement occurred at a point where the seriousness of the covid-19 pandemic for the us was increasingly recognized but the eventual impact on cities such as new york new orleans and detroit was yet to be realized2326 as such the results of this study offer some insight into our collective disposition towards the pandemic at a unique point in history as the very first shelter in place policy decisions were made overall we found that participants behaviors and attitudes regarding the covid-19 pandemic evolved even within our brief survey period after the shelter-in-place orders were announced for the bay area social distancing increased increases in level of social distancing were more pronounced among respondents in the bay area versus those living elsewhere in the us adults older than 46 years and those living with children or an adult over age 65 years this pattern may be explained by early suspicions that older adults were most vulnerable to covid-1927 consistent with media reports of food shortages28 respondents were most likely to report difficulty obtaining food with increases in difficulty obtaining food more pronounced in the bay area following the shelter-in-place announcement increases in difficulty with access to healthcare hand sanitizer and transportation were similar among respondents in the bay area versus those living elsewhere we detected the early impacts on job loss and wages which were followed by a national surge in unemployment after the study period2930 we anticipate that our findings may further underestimate the impacts of shelter-in-place on job loss and wages given the high levels of educational attainment in our study population as may respondents may have been able to transition more easily to remote work31 finally we found that approximately one-third of respondents were extremely concerned about the covid-19 crisis although we found little evidence to support the idea that levels of concern increased  among respondents in the bay area or elsewhere  following the announcement of shelter-in-place orders this raises the interesting question as to whether announcements regarding covid-19 lead to increased or decreased levels of concern and anxiety that should be considered further in more representative study populations and as the pandemic continues to evolve despite the large number of survey respondents older adults black respondents and men were underrepresented in this convenience sample similarly household structure of respondents suggests that a large number of respondents did not have children or elderly family members that may have required extra care recruitment was convenience sampling via three social media websites snowball sampling through re-posts on facebook and twitter may have further propagated participation among a more homogenous group of respondents our results therefore likely underrepresent the true extent of challenges associated with the pandemic across the us and precludes meaningful examination of the early impacts of shelter-in-place orders on economically marginalized and vulnerable population subgroups3233 the cross-sectional nature of this study represents an additional limitation because we did not observe changes in social distancing experienced difficulties and levels of concern in individuals over time it is possible that our findings are explained at least in part by compositional effects ie systematic differences in respondents who completed the survey before and after march 16th reassuringly we found limited evidence of systematic differences in measured characteristics before and after the march 16th cutoff with the exception of the gender breakdown among respondents who resided outside of the bay area finally the announcement of shelter-in-place orders for the seven bay area counties was covered extensively in the national media which makes spillover effects of the announcement to survey respondents living outside of the bay area  particularly elsewhere in california likely the assumptions of did are therefore unlikely to be met and our estimates are more appropriately interpreted as summary measures of the change in the bay area relative to the change elsewhere in the us rather than causal estimates of the impact of the announcement however in sensitivity analyses to examine spillover in washington state and california we found similar pattern of findings across subgroups of interest we found evidence of increased social distancing and difficulty with daily activities such as food and transportation in the wake of the announcement of the nations first shelter-in-place orders particularly among respondents in the bay area levels of concern remained fairly consistent throughout the study period among respondents in the bay area and elsewhere given that our study population was highly educated concentrated in one of the more affluent areas in the us and queried relatively early in the covid-19 pandemic we anticipate that our findings underestimate substantially the impact of county- and statewide shelter-in-place orders as such our study represents a first step towards understanding the social attitudes and consequences of this crisis further research that specifically examines social economic and health impacts of covid-19 especially among vulnerable populations is needed   fabrice kmpfen iliana kohler v alberto ciancio wndi bruine de

march worsening mental health was most strongly associated with concerns about the economic consequences of the pandemic while concerns about the potential impact of the virus on respondents own health and the practice of social distancing also predicted the presence of depression and anxiety symptoms albeit less strongly  among the myriad of consequences that the covid-19 pandemic has on the health care economic and social spheres in the us and worldwide experts and policy makers are increasingly urging to consider the mental health consequences of the pandemic 1 2 some observers even went as far as calling mental illness resulting from covid-19 the inevitable next pandemic 3 the importance and urgency to address the short and long term aftermaths of covid-19 on individual and population level mental health have been outlined in a recent policy brief issued by the united nations 4 despite this compelling need to generate knowledge about the covid-19 impact on mental health of individuals and populations research on the mental health consequences of the pandemic especially in the us is still sparse and the determinants and sociodemographic patterns of mental well-being during covid-19 are still not well documented prior evidence suggests that the experience of large scale disasters is associated with increases in depression and anxiety post-traumatic stress disorder ptd and a broad range of other mental disorders 1 5 6  in the context of covid-19 these mental health implications may be amplified by factors such as increased uncertainty related to individuals own health because of the exposure to a new highly infectious disease 6 7 8  the profound economic consequences of the pandemic in the us and globally the implementation of lock-down measures 9 10 11 12

with the virus was phrased as on a scale of 0 to 100 percent what is the chance that you will get the coronavirus in the next three months if youre not sure please give your best guess the question on the probability of dying if infected was phrased as if you do get the coronavirus what is the percent chance you will die from it if youre not sure please give your best guess finally the question about the probability of running out of money because of the covid-19 pandemic was the coronavirus may cause economic challenges for some people regardless of whether they are actually infected what is the percent chance you will run out of money because of the coronavirus in the next three months  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has

coefficient of standardized continuous variable can be interpreted as the effect of a one standard deviation increase in that variable on the outcome of interest on the other hand the coefficient associated to a dichotomous variable corresponds to a marginal increase in that variable from 0 to 1 which is usually larger in magnitude than a standard deviation increase in the continuous variable gelman 39 therefore suggests to rescale the continuous variable by more than just their standard deviation so that the marginal effect of the continuous variables can be more meaningfully compared to the marginal increase in the dichotomous variable in essence following the notation in the main text gelmans 39 idea is to choose  in such a way that the  standard deviation increase in the continuous variables correspond to the marginal increase in the dichotomous variable from 0 to 1 one can therefore use the dichotomous variable characteristic as a benchmark for rescaling the continuous variables gelman 39 suggests to use   2 which works well when the mean of the dichotomous variable is close or equal to 05 indeed if the mean of a dichotomous variable is equal to 05 then its standard deviation would be equal to 05 05 1  05 a two standard deviation increase in the continuous variable would therefore correspond to a marginal increase in the dichotomous variable from 0 to 1 as 1 is equal to two standard deviations of the dichotomous variables as well in our study because the mean of social distancing is equal to 0655 we choose  2103 indeed 2103times the standard deviation of social distancing equal to 1  2103 0655 1  0655 so that a x standard deviation increase in the continuous variables corresponds to an increase in the dichotomous variable from 0 to 1 the coefficients associated with the transformed continuous variables can then be meaningfully compared to the coefficient associated with the dichotomous variable  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made

yan wang wei wang shanlu zhao qianhui wu stefano merler ccile viboud alessandro vespignani marco ajelli hongjie yu   the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 epidemic caused by sars-cov-2 began in wuhan city china in december 2019 and quickly spread globally with 2063161 cases reported in 185 countriesregions as of april 16 2020 1 a total of 82692 cases of covid-19 including 4632 deaths have been reported in mainland china including 50333 cases in wuhan city and 628 cases in shanghai city 2 the epidemic in wuhan and in the rest of china subsided after implementation of strict containment measures and movement restrictions with recent cases originating from travel 3 however key questions remain about the age profile of susceptibility to infection how social distancing alters age-specific contact patterns and how these factors interact to affect transmission these questions are relevant to the choice of control policies for governments and policy makers around the world in this study we evaluate changes in mixing patterns linked to social distancing by collecting contact data in the midst of the epidemic in wuhan and shanghai we also estimate age differences in susceptibility to infection based on contact tracing data gathered by the hunan provincial center for disease control and prevention cdc china based on these empirical data we develop a mathematical disease transmission model to disentangle how transmission is affected by age differences in the biology of covid-19 infection and altered mixing patterns due to social distancing additionally we project the impact of social distancing and school closure on covid-19 transmission to estimate changes in age-mixing patterns associated with covid-19 interventions we performed contact surveys in two cities wuhan the epicenter of the outbreak and shanghai one of the largest and most densely populated cities in southeast china shanghai experienced extensive importation of covid-19 cases from wuhan as well as local transmission 4 the surveys were conducted from february 1 2020 to february 10 2020 as transmission of covid-19 peaked across china and stringent interventions were put in place participants in wuhan were asked to complete a questionnaire describing their contact behavior 5 6 on two different days i a regular weekday between december 24 2019 and december 30 2019 before the covid-19 outbreak was officially recognized by the wuhan municipal health commission used as baseline and ii the day before the interview outbreak period participants in shanghai were asked to complete the same questionnaire used for wuhan but only reported contacts for the outbreak period for the baseline period in shanghai we relied on a survey conducted in 2017-2018 following the same design 7 in these surveys a contact was defined as either a two-way conversation involving three or more words in the physical presence of another person or a direct physical contact eg a handshake details are given in the supplementary materials sections 1 and 2 we analyzed a total of 1245 contacts reported by 636 study participants in wuhan and 1296 contacts reported by 557 participants in shanghai in wuhan the average daily number of contacts per participant was significantly reduced from 146 for the baseline period weighted mean contacts by age structure 140 to 20 for the outbreak period weighted mean contacts by age structure 19 p0001 the reduction in contacts was significant for all stratifications by sex age group type of profession and household size table 1 a larger reduction was observed in shanghai where the average daily number of contacts declined from 188 weighted mean contacts by age structure 198 to 23 weighted mean contacts by age structure 21 although an average individual in shanghai reported more contacts than one in wuhan on a regular weekday this difference essentially disappeared during the covid-19 outbreak period a similar decrease in the number of contacts was found in the uk during the covid-19 lockdown period 8 the typical features of age-mixing patterns 6 7 emerge in wuhan and shanghai when we consider the baseline period fig 1 a and d these features can be illustrated in the form of age-stratified contact matrices provided as ready-to-use tables in the supplementary materials section 36 where each cell represents the average number of contacts that an individual has with other individuals stratified by age groups the bottom left corner of the matrix corresponding to contacts between school-age children is where the largest number of contacts is recorded the contribution of contacts in the workplace is visible in the central part of the matrix while the three diagonals from bottom left to top right represent contacts between household members in contrast for the outbreak period where strict social distancing policies were in place much of the above-mentioned features disappears essentially leaving the sole contribution of household mixing fig 1 b and e in particular assortative contacts between school-age individuals are fully removed as illustrated by differencing baseline and outbreak matrices fig 1 c and f overall contacts during the outbreak mostly occurred at home with household members 941 in wuhan and 785 in shanghai thus the outbreak contact matrix nearly coincides with the within-household contact matrix in both study sites and the pattern of assortativity by age observed for regular days almost entirely disappears see supplementary materials section 36 these findings are consistent with trends in within-city mobility data which indicate an 869 drop in wuhan and 745 in shanghai between early january and early february see supplementary materials section 4 such a large decrease in internal mobility is consistent with most of contacts occurring in the household during the outbreak period of note the strict social distancing measures implemented in wuhan and shanghai did not entirely zero out contacts in the workplace as essential workers continued to perform their activities as observed in our data see supplementary materials section 35 the estimated mixing patterns are based on self-reported contacts that can thus be affected by various biases in particular reported contacts for the baseline period in wuhan may be prone to recall bias since contacts were assessed retrospectively further due to retrospective nature of the baseline survey in wuhan we were unable to account for the lower number of contacts during weekends the more complete data from shanghai did not suffer recall bias and allowed us to weight contacts for weekdays and weekends  sensitivity analyses suggest that this has little impact on results supplementary materials section 83 another possible bias is that survey participants may have felt pressure to minimize reported contacts occurring during the outbreak given that social distancing was in place and strictly enforced by the government even if the anonymity and confidentiality of the survey were emphasized however results are robust to inflating reported contacts outside of the home several fold suggesting that these compliance and social acceptability biases linked to the outbreak period do not affect our main findings supplementary materials section 82 another caveat is that in parallel to population-level social distancing measures case-based interventions were implemented and could have affect contacts including rapid isolation of confirmed and suspected cases and quarantine of close contacts for 14 days only a small portion of the population in the two study sites was affected by contact tracing and quarantine however thus having little to no effect on average contact patterns in the general population next to understand the interplay between social distancing interventions changes in human mixing patterns and outbreak dynamics we need to consider potential age differences in susceptibility to infection this is currently a topic of debate as little information on the age profile of asymptomatic cases is available 9 10 to this aim we analyzed covid-19 contact tracing information gleaned from detailed epidemiological field investigations conducted by the hunan cdc supplementary materials section 5 briefly all close contacts of covid-19 cases reported in hunan province were placed under medical observation for 14 days and were tested using real-time rt-pcr those who tested positive were considered as sars-cov-2 infections we estimated the odd ratios or for a contact of a certain age group to be infected relative to a reference age group we performed generalized linear mixed model regression to account for clustering and potential correlation structure of contacts exposed to the same index case eg in the household we included age group and gender of a contact type of contact and whether the contact traveled to hubeiwuhan as regression covariates see supplementary materials section 5 we found that susceptibility to sars-cov2 infection increased with age young individuals aged 0-14 years had a lower risk of infection than individual aged 15-64 years or034 95ci 024-049 p-value00001 in contrast older individuals aged 65 years and over had a higher risk of infection than adults 15-64 years or147 95ci 112-192 p-value0005 these findings are in contrast with a previous study in shenzhen where susceptibility to infection did not change with age 9 next we explore how our data can inform control strategies for covid-19 a key parameter regulating the dynamics of an epidemic is the basic reproduction number r0 which corresponds to the average number of secondary cases generated by an index case in a fully susceptible population we estimated the impact of interventions on r0 relying on our age-specific estimates of susceptibility to infection and contact patterns before and during interventions we used the next generation matrix approach to quantify changes in r0 11 supplementary materials section 6 additionally to illustrate the impact of age-mixing patterns on the dynamics of the epidemic we developed a simple sir model of sars-cov-2 transmission supplementary materials section 6 in the model the population is divided into three epidemiological categories susceptible infectious and removed either recovered or deceased individuals stratified by 14 age groups susceptible individuals can become infectious after contact with an infectious individual according to the estimated age-specific susceptibility to infection the rate at which contacts occur is determined by the estimated mixing patterns of each age group the mean time interval between two consecutive generations of cases was taken to be 51 days assuming it aligns with the mean of the serial interval reported by zhang et al 3 in the early phases of covid-19 spread in wuhan before interventions were put in place r0 values were estimated to range between 20 and 35 1218 in this analysis we extended this range from 1 to 4 for the baseline period ie before interventions we find that the considerable changes of mixing patterns observed in wuhan and shanghai during the social distancing period led to a drastic decrease in r0 fig 2 when we consider contact matrices representing the outbreak period keeping the same baseline disease transmissibility as in the pre-intervention period the reproductive number drops well below the epidemic threshold in wuhan fig 2a and shanghai fig 2b this finding is robust to relaxing assumptions about age differences in susceptibility to infection the epidemic is still well controlled if sars-cov-2 infection is assumed to be equally likely in all age groups fig 2 a and b we also performed sensitivity analyses regarding possible recall and compliance biases of self-reported contacts as well as the definition of contact ie considering only contacts lasting more than 5 min the results are consistent with those reported here see supplementary materials section 8 in an uncontrolled epidemic without intervention measures travel restrictions or spontaneous behavioral responses of the population and for r0 in the range 2-3 we estimate the mean infection attack rate to be in the range 53-92 after a year of sars-cov-2 circulation with slight variation between wuhan fig 2c and shanghai fig 2d these estimates should be considered as an upper bound of the infection attack rate as they are based on a compartmental model that does not account for high clustering of contacts eg repeated contacts among household members if we consider a scenario where social distancing measures are implemented early on as the new virus emerges the estimated r0 remains under the epidemic threshold and thus the epidemic cannot take off in either location furthermore we estimate that the magnitude of interventions implemented in wuhan and shanghai would have been enough to block transmission for an r0 before the interventions up to 6 in wuhan and 78 in shanghai next we use the model to estimate the impact of preemptive mass school closure we considered two different contact pattern scenarios based on data from shanghai contacts estimated during vacations period 7 and contacts estimated during regular weekdays after all contacts occurring in school settings have been removed 7 both scenarios represent a simplification of a school closure strategy in fact school closures in response to the covid-19 pandemic in china have entailed interruption of all educational on-site services however mixing patterns measured during school vacations indicate that a fraction of children still attend additional educational activities as typical in chinese cities on the other hand when removing all contacts in the school setting we do not consider potential trickle down effects on the mixing patterns of other age groups for instance parents may need to leave work to take care of school-age children our modeling approach indicates that limiting contact patterns to those observed during vacations would interrupt transmission for baseline r0 up to 15 fig 3 a and c removing all school contacts would do the same for baseline r0 up to 12 if we apply these interventions to a covid-19 scenario assuming a baseline r0 of 2 - 35 we can achieve a noticeable decrease in infection attack rate and peak incidence and a delay in the epidemic but transmission is not interrupted fig 3 b and d for instance for baseline r025 and assuming a vacation mixing pattern the mean peak daily incidence is reduced by about 64 in the corresponding scenario where school contacts are removed we estimate a reduction of about 42 overall school-based closure policies are not sufficient to entirely prevent a covid-19 outbreak but they can impact disease dynamics and hence hospital surge capacity it is important to stress that individuals aged 5-19 years in shanghai represent 95 of the population 19 markedly lower than the mean in china 168 19 and other countries including western countries eg 197 in the us 20 the results of this study should be considered in the light of the following limitations in our simulation model we estimated the effect of social distancing alone combining social distancing with other interventions would have a synergistic effect to even further reduce transmission it is likely that population wide social distancing case-based strategies and decontamination efforts all contributed to achieve control in wuhan and shanghai and their effect is difficult to separate out in retrospective observational studies our estimates of age differences in susceptibility to infection are based on active testing of 7375 contacts of 136 confirmed index cases these data suffer from the usual difficulties inherent to the reconstruction of epidemiological links and detection of index cases contact data are useful but seroepidemiology studies will be essential to fully resolve population susceptibility profiles to sars-cov-2 infection and disease while the age patterns of contacts were similar in the two study locations during the covid-19 outbreak period these patterns may not be fully representative of other locations in china and abroad where social distancing measures may differ as reliable estimates of the contribution of asymptomatic sars-cov-2 infections to transmission are still lacking we did not explicitly model differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals we considered a serial interval of 51 days 3 based on a prior estimate from china at a time when case-based and contact tracing interventions measures were in place which tends to shorten the interval between successive cases however this choice does not affect the estimated changes in reproduction number between the baseline and outbreak periods modeling results may underestimate the effect of social distancing interventions as our results concentrate on number of contacts and ignore the type of social interactions eg increased distance between individuals while in contact or use of face mask which may have changed due increased awareness of the population 21 22 finally it is worth noting that our school closure simulations are not meant to formulate a full intervention strategy which would require identification of epidemic triggers to initiate closures and evaluation of different durations of intervention 6 nonetheless our modeling exercise provides an indication of the possible impact of a nation-wide preemptive strategy on the infection attack rate and peak incidence to generalize these findings to other contexts location-specific age-mixing patterns and population structures should be considered most importantly perhaps strict lockdown strategies of the kind implemented in wuhan shanghai and in other regions of the world are extremely disruptive economically and mentally and more targeted approaches to block transmission are preferable in the long run we do not necessarily endorse blunt lockdown policies here merely we describe their impact on covid-19 transmission based on the chinese experience our study provides evidence that the interventions put in place in wuhan and shanghai and the resulting changes in human behavior drastically decreased daily contacts essentially reducing them to household interactions this leads to a dramatic reduction of sars-cov-2 transmission as lockdown measures are put in place in other locations human mixing patterns in the outbreak period could be captured by data on within-household contacts which are available for several countries around the world 57 2325 moving forward it will be particularly important to design targeted strategies for long-term control of covid-19 including school- and work-based control strategies along with large scale testing and contact tracing 2628 research should concentrate on refining age-specific estimates of susceptibility to infection disease and infectiousness which are instrumental to evaluating the impact of these strategies  is lockdown bad for social anxiety in covid-19 regions a national study in the sor perspective lei zheng miao miao jiyoon lim maorui li shu nie xiaojun zhang   the new corona virus or covid-19 has become a pandemic with accelerating incidence since this disease has been confirmed to have interhuman transmission the chinese government actively adopted lockdown measures to cut off the channels of infection for virus prevention and control the crisis governance measures include ensuring resident registration before people leave their houses as well as the closing down of the roads railways and public transports consequently lockdown measures have been adopted by several countries and regions 12 in late february the italian government took lockdown measures to cope with the spread of the virus in some north italian areas 3 to date the measures exhibited their effect on infection prevention and control showing an obvious decrease in coronavirus cases in mainland china however as a crisis governance measure the widespread lockdown inevitably imposed psychological effects on social emotions 4 particularly anxiety in fact existing studies have demonstrated the increase in social anxiety in pandemic areas 567 which might lead to riots violence 8910 so do these crisis governance measures really have an impact on social emotions in pandemic regions what are the mechanisms underlying this process within the theory of the stimulus-organism-response sor the present study addressed the psychological effect of lockdown measures in a pandemic area from the perspective of psychological distancing the lockdown measures restricted traffic and outdoor activities by that the individuals perceived spatial distancing toward the disease increased viewing the disease as a high-level construal 11 conversely measures such as movement restriction prolonged home-stay which subsequently leaded to anxiety and depression 12 not only the psychological effect of lockdown measures regarding responses toward covid-19 remains unclear but also there is no current study investigating the mechanisms underlying certain processes  therefore this study will add empirical evidence regarding the psychological effect of the lockdown measures from the governmental level to the individual-level importantly crisis governance measures could be an approach to buffer the effect of a pandemic on social emotions also although numerous studies have confirmed the detrimental effects of pandemic diseases on anxiety there is no study that revealed the mechanisms underlying this process based on the sor theory this study will propose a conceptual model to explain how citizens evaluate a pandemic from the perspective of psychological distancing and why lockdown buffers the social anxiety caused by covid-19 threats such as the rapidly spreading virus often lead people to feel discomfort and tension 1516 in fact pandemic diseases were found to be associated with high-level anxiety for example the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars caused anxiety and social problems in several countries 567 similarly the influenza h1n1 also known as swine flu resulted in considerable public anxiety in 2009 especially after who declared it as a pandemic 17 a singapore study also demonstrated the detrimental effect of swine flu on public anxiety in which people reported high level of anxiety 18 in line with that another uk study confirmed that people who read or received the governments swine flu leaflet reported high levels of anxiety 6  these studies provide evidence on public anxiety caused by pandemics in fact the feelings of anxiety are highly associated with individuals perceived severity 19 subsequently people may perceive high levels of infection risk when there is an increasing number of covid-19 new cases nearby thus resulting in increased social anxiety therefore we hypothesize that although numerous studies tested social anxiety caused by pandemics the mechanisms underlying certain processes is still unclear previous studies suggested that the perceived distance toward the disease had an impact on subjects emotions 1120 psychological distancing is the subjective perception between self and others such as people future events or possibility therefore the individuals perceived psychological distanceing between the disease and themselves affect their psychological outcomes such as anxiety  this is in line with the construal level theory 2122 which claims that people develop different psychological representations of a disease based on their perceived mental distance towards it 11 in terms of the far psychological distance people tend to view objects as in ways of high-level construal conversely for the close psychological distancing a low-level construal is employed as the concept with concrete specific and contextualized features 2021 therefore when people perceive a high infectious risk toward a disease their psychological distance decreases which in turn leads to a low-level construal the existing research found that distance between people and the affected place could predict the levels of anxiety caused by an infectious virus 723 in particular medical students at the affected hospital reported higher anxiety than non-medical students of the same university 7 comparably students at another university situated 20 km away from the affected hospital reported the lowest level of anxiety when people perceived the virus at a remote distance they tend to construe the virus at a high level with less emotional responses thus exhibiting lower levels of anxiety conversely when people perceived the virus at a nearby distance they tend to be irrational with more emotional responses which in turn exhibit higher levels of anxiety given the different numbers of new covid-19 cases across provinces in china people might become more anxious if their province reports a comparatively larger number of new covid-19 cases than other provinces the reason might be that individuals perceive a larger number of new cases in nearby provinces as a higher possibility of being infected by covid-19 therefore we propose that lockdown measures have been adopted to contain infectious diseases in previous outbreaks in 2015 the sierra leone government ordered its citizens to remain indoors for three days for virus prevention and control these measures were thought to have played an important role in the ebola elimination 24252627 in china there are two main aspects of lockdown measures in the prevention and control of covid-19 traffic control and household quarantine advice since the local governments in china held different policies the extent of lockdown measures also differed among provinces  although the lockdown showed its impact on covid-19 control 192829 its psychological effect is still unclear the literature is very sparse in terms of the relationship between lockdown measures and social anxiety in fact people are intrinsically motivated to flee when they face threats which also results in anxiety 30 one research has demonstrated that prolonged homestays contribute to anxiety and depression 12 therefore people might have perceived an anxious feeling due to the movement restriction after lockdown consequently people in provinces with a high level of lockdown measures may report higher levels of anxiety than people under low levels of lockdown measures in this perspective lockdown may increase the anxiety level of people in provinces under a serious covid-19 situation thus we hypothesize that on the other hand people may feel less anxious when lockdown cuts off virus transmission and reduces the possibility of infection the research found that traffic control is an effective way to cut off the virus transmission limiting the spread of infection 3132 studies also demonstrated that household quarantine significantly limits the spread of infectious disease 333435 after lockdown measures the possibility of covid-19 infection will be reduced due to the decreased interpersonal interaction therefore lockdown measures may buffer the detrimental effect of the pandemic severity resulting in the reduction of social anxiety thus we propose that  todorov et al 2007 proposed that infection probability also changes the individuals psychological distance therefore when the infection possibility is perceived as low people might show an increase in subjective perception toward spatial distancing regarding covid-19 in other words the far distance would lower the anxiety 2035 thus since lockdown measures cut off the interpersonal contact people in provinces with high-level lockdown measures may perceive covid-19 as a remote disease which may protect them from anxiety thus we propose that there were 1847 participants enrolled in the present study their age ranged from 1866 years the mean age is 3064  919 years seven hundred sixty-seven of them were males their demographic information is represented in table 1 the research protocol was approved by the ethics committee of fuzhou university all participants were recruited by a widely used social platform ie wechat by online fliers which direct them to the online survey website each of them was first informed about the research online and they submitted the informed consent before starting the research all participants completed the survey within 10 min on 7 february 2020 the psychological distancing was assessed by two items with statements please indicate how far do you feel a sense of distance between you and the coronavirus and please indicate how far do you feel a sense of distance between you and the confirmed people 20 each item was responded to using a five-point scale 1extremely near 9extremely remote the cronbachs alpha was 090 anxiety was measured by a short version of the state anxiety scale which has been widely used in previous research 36 the scale included six items such as calm tense upset relaxed content and worry each item was responded to using a seven-point scale ranging from 1never to 7always the cronbachs alpha was 073 the severity of the pandemic was measured by the number of newly confirmed covid-19 cases the data were collected by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china the present study used the data on the day the survey was taken  the extent of lockdown measures was measured using the traffic control index collected from the baidu migration big data databaseqianxibaiducom we collected big data of migration for 14 days from chunjie chinese lunar new year to the day before the survey was taken for both 2019 and 2020 the extent of the lockdown measures was evaluated by comparing the averaged migration index difference between 20192020 a high difference value indicated that the local government adopted comparably strict lockdown measures within the province table 1 shows statistics regarding demographics pandemic severity lockdown psychological distancing and anxiety according to the correlations the severity of the pandemic had a negative correlation with psychological distancing r  014 p  0001 and a positive correlation with anxiety r  007 p  0004 lockdown had a negative correlation with anxiety r  010 p  0001 and was positively associated to psychological distancing r  010 p  0001 psychological distancing had a negative correlation with anxiety r  017 p  0001 this study conducted a hierarchical linear model in which regions as a cluster psychological distancing and anxiety were taken as within-level variables and pandemic severity as the between-level variable  this study employed model 1 with anxiety as the dependent variable and demographic variables as control variables next the pandemic severity was added in model 2 subsequently psychological distancing was included with either a fixed effect model 3 and random effect model 4 respectively last a mediation model was developed to estimate the mediating effect of psychological distance between pandemic severity and anxiety in model 5 as shown in table 2 the results of model 1 showed that females reported higher levels of anxiety compared to males b  024 se  005 p  0001 similarly highly educated people reported higher anxiety than low-educated people b  007 se  003 p  003 however neither age nor monthly income significantly predicted anxiety in the presented sample  furthermore in model 2 pandemic severity positively predicted anxiety b  007 se  001 p  0001 r2  004 indicating that people in the provinces with a larger number of new cases perceived a higher level of anxiety which is consistent with h1  in model 3 we found that psychological distancing negatively predicted anxiety b  017 se  002 p  0001 r2  003 by a fixed-effect approach after conducting a random effect model psychological distancing consistently predicted anxiety b  017 se  003 p  0001 r2  003 in model 4 lastly in model 5a and 5b we found that psychological distancing served as a mediator explaining the route from pandemic severity at the province-level to anxiety at the individual-level random effect size  002 se  0004 p  0001 as h2 hypothesized the results suggested that the pandemic severity impacted anxiety through psychological distancing  in order to test the moderation effect of the lockdown we first conducted model 6 with lockdown as the predictor next the interaction item of the lockdown and pandemic severity was included in model 7 subsequently we developed model 8 with psychological distance as the dependent variable and lockdown and pandemic severity as independent variables further an interaction item of lockdown and pandemic severity was included in model 9 last a cross-level moderated mediation effect of lockdown was conducted model 10  as shown in table 3 pandemic severity consistently predicted anxiety b  004 se  001 p  0003 in model 6 moreover lockdown also negatively predicted anxiety b  008 se  004 p  0056 indicating that lockdown reduced social anxiety in pandemic regions therefore our results support h4 instead of h3 in model 7 lockdown interacted with pandemic severity to predict anxiety b  011 se  005 p  0025 r2  0001 subsequently the results of a simple slope analysis showed that pandemic severity positively predicted anxiety in provinces with low levels of lockdown b  008 se  039 p  0036 than that in provinces with high levels of lockdown b  023 se  014 p  009 figure 2a  in addition lockdown consistently predicted psychological distancing in model 8 b  008 se  004 p  0037 subsequently the result also demonstrated the mediation effect of psychological distancing on the relationship between lockdown and anxiety random effect size  0013 se  0007 p  0024 furthermore the interaction of lockdown and pandemic severity positively predicted psychological distancing b  010 se  004 p  0027  the results of a simple slope analysis showed the negative prediction of the pandemic severity on psychological distancing in provinces with low levels of lockdown b  008 se  004 p  0038 compared to provinces with high levels of lockdown b  005 se  009 p  0555 figure 2b lastly the results of the cross-level moderated mediation model showed that lockdown buffered the detrimental effect of pandemic severity on anxiety through psychological distancing regulations specifically the mediation effect of psychological distancing on the relationship between pandemic severity and anxiety was not significant b  001 se  002 p  0557 in provinces with high-level lockdown but was significant in provinces with low-level lockdown b  002 se  001 p  0047 although the existing research demonstrated the detrimental effect of the pandemic on individuals mental health the mechanism underlying this process was still unclear given the theory of the sor model environmental factors could affect individuals reactions eg anxiety through the organismic variable eg psychological distance 1314 our results provide evidence that both pandemic severity and lockdown serve as environmental factors at the regional level which changed the perception of psychological distancing at a personal level thus increasing the individuals anxiety this supported and extended the sor model in a pandemic study in which environmental variables come from the regional level and organismic and response variables come from individual levels in addition environmental factors could also interact to affect individuals psychological variables the pandemic has been regarded as a detrimental factor that reduces the psychological distance toward covid-19 thus negatively predicting anxiety however as discussed before lockdown reduced psychological distancing which in turn relieved anxiety 112036 importantly our findings suggested that the crisis governance measures eg lockdown serves as an environmental factor that can buffer the effect of other environmental factors eg pandemic thus affecting on the individuals psychological variables therefore crisis governance measures could play an important role in both pandemic control and the publics mental health  this study confirmed the association between regional pandemic intensity and individuals anxiety in china which is consistent with other results regarding pandemic and anxiety 19 moreover psychological distancing was proven to serve as a mediator in the relationship between pandemic severity and social anxiety it is consistent with previous studies which reported that peoples psychological distance toward disease impacts their responses related to the disease 711 not only that but it also explains the mechanism of how the pandemic affects social emotions it is noteworthy that the present sample provided empirical evidence of the psychological effect of lockdown measures using a national sample the result showed that lockdown not only negatively predicted individuals anxiety but also buffered social anxieties against the detrimental impacts of the pandemic given the differential governance across provinces in china we found that lockdown in intensive pandemic regions reduced individuals anxiety levels  more importantly our findings suggested the buffer effect of lockdown in pandemic regions in china people residing in lockdown regions were required to stay at home which increased social distancing and reduced the possibility of infection as mentioned before when the possibility decreased psychological distancing increased 20 consistent with that we confirmed that lockdown predicted low levels of anxiety in ways of increasing psychological distancing this suggested that the crisis governance measures could affect peoples cognition and consequently their emotions therefore the lockdown measure served as a critical function for protecting people against the biological and psychological virus hence the measures tended to increase psychological distancing towards covid-19 which helped people cope with the threat  altogether our findings on lockdown and psychological distancing not only provided direct evidence about whether lockdown has psychological effects in pandemic regions or not but it also carried important implications for understanding why lockdown buffered social anxiety caused by covid-19 social psychology plays an important role in epidemic governance from the social psychology perspective the direct causation of behavior is the primary function of emotion 3738 people in a strong state of psychological stress will make a variety of irrational behavior and even coupled with the impact of events to cause secondary disasters the present study built a conceptual model based on the sor model in which lockdown interacted with pandemic severity to predict psychological distancing and thereby result in social anxiety  in addition the psychological effects of the lockdown play an important role in crisis governance our results revealed that pandemic severity negatively predicted anxiety in provinces with low levels of lockdown compared to the provinces with high levels of lockdown therefore when we take the lockdown measures region-specific situations and environmental risks should be considered in the society under risk the crisis governance measures could also induce other potential risks namely the risk of operation failure regardless of whether the society is risk or safety-oriented specifically the governments crisis governance ie institutionalization of risk also could become a new risk to the society ie institutionalized risk 39 consequently there might be other psychological effects that could hurt social stability especially in other countries therefore when we take action to contain the pandemic risk social psychology should be taken seriously to avoid the risk of human judgmental errors in response to major public health events a positive social mentality helps work together to overcome the epidemic the breeding and spreading of negative emotion conversely posed severe challenges to social governance in public emergencies our research discovered the interaction between lockdown and pandemic severity on social anxiety through psychological distancing this result offers several practical implications for both governors and citizens  the lockdown could be an effective measure to slow down the virus spread however peoples lives are greatly affected by this measure so governors should realize that it could also be an extreme measure that could trigger social anxiety where the emotional changes of individuals and groups should not be neglected as it may lead to successive economic and social problems considering the psychological mechanism governors should take measures to reduce psychological distancing collecting and publishing accurate information about pandemic severity enhancing personal prevention and control measures and looking into cognitive and emotional changes of individuals and groups at each node based on the main laws regarding the evolution of emergencies furthermore for crisis governance emergency living and medical supplies should not be neglected before lockdown the citizens need to stay calm learn about the infectious disease obey the government guidelines and take self-protection procedures at home the current research has several limitations first this study employed a cross-sectional design although the sample size for this research is relatively large it is impossible to determine the causal inference as well as whether people under lockdown measures in the long-term show similar results moreover the participants finished their online survey and were compensated after the study this may lead to sampling bias due to internet access issues besides their internal motivation and emotion may be affected by the compensation of this study further longitudinal studies should be conducted as a replication of this research to address this issue second the present study evaluated psychological variables relying solely on self-reported measurements although these inventories are widely used in previous studies self-reported measurements may run the risk of responses being influenced by participants moods  third even though lockdown is a complicated procedure this research only considered two main aspects of lockdowntraffic control and household quarantine advicein china in fact the lockdown measures include several aspects which were also conducted differently across countries in particular lockdown measures are the compulsory policy in most countries but not in all countries for example daegu the fourth largest city of korea has been declared as a special management zone due to the outbreak of corona virus however the korean government did not lockdown the city or citizens except for the facilities that were related to the outbreak 40 there should be a difference between the two policies in terms of their psychological effects therefore other aspects of the lockdown procedure need to be examined and fulfilled in future operations forth since china is a collectivistic society the cultural aspect might have played a factor that impacted the relationship between lockdown and anxiety as well as the moderating effect of lockdown this may restrict the generalization of the findings in this paper therefore future studies should consider cultural aspects of the psychological effects during the lockdown procedure and repeat our research in other countries with different cultural backgrounds in conclusion this study provided evidence that the lockdown measures buffered anxiety against the detrimental effect of covid-19 more importantly psychological distancing explained why a pandemic impacts peoples anxiety and how lockdown moderates the relationship between pandemic severity and anxiety in addition considering that some countries are starting to adopt similar measures this study suggests to consider the psychological effects of crisis governance measures in pandemic regions given that anxiety is often caused by uncertainty an objective description of the pandemic by the public government may minimize the negative psychological effects of the lockdown policy  when blackness does not fade after a pandemic an appeal to acknowledge the unequal burden of social isolation nia johnson   as the coronavirus disease ravages the world families have cancelled weddings countries have closed their borders and the number of individuals applying for unemployment benefits have skyrocketed 13 though there is much unknown about the virus one public health measure that is being recommended by the centers for disease control is containment through social distancing 4 5 though the centers for disease control is recommending this for large groups and gatherings there is a larger mass media discussion regarding the ethics of staying home 1 3 many are arguing that it ones duty to protect the immunocompromised and the elderly during this crisis and social distancing may be the only way to save lives in the face of a great unknown however this should also open the door to a thoughtful discussion about those who could reap the unintended consequences of social distancing after the virus has been slowed or mitigated if the moral message passed on during this time continues to be that one should be willing to engage in social distancing as benevolent behavior racially marginalized communities could be unmotivated to participate or have to reconcile with the consequences of forced participation due to the stigma that will follow them well after the pandemic has been addressed suppose there are a black employee and a white employee working at a largely populated company both have the same level of education salary and work experience both parties are also caring for elderly parents and have been given the option to socially distance themselves the white employee chooses to socially distance themselves and work from home because their priority is to not harm the loved ones in their proximity the black employee has more to think about they are concerned about the elderly but they are also concerned about their broader community the black employee could socially distance themselves to protect their parent as a caretaker but they are also concerned about their lack of visibility in the workplace contributing to negative stereotypes about black individuals such as stereotypes about laziness and sloth or having diminished productivity being attributed to their character 69 this employee also knows that if they continue to go to work it will put a loved ones life in danger but they are also concerned that if an evaluation of their performance occurs within even six months after this crisis the same benefit of the doubt that is given to another employee may not be afforded to them 10 they could also be concerned that if their workplace reopens and they choose to stay home that they could also incur harmful stereotypes about their work ethic both parties are concerned about their fellow man however the difference is that the perception of who is the most vulnerable is altered both parties races create a special type of freedom and bondagethe white employee can engage with their sense of national pride and benevolence freeing them from the concern of the consequences of that choice while the black employee is in bondage to that burden because of the potential consequences in the future next suppose there are two students who attend the same prestigious university both of the students are from unstable home environments and are required to return home to comply with social distancing policies they return home to engage in remote classes while also balancing the challenges of their home lives both students have a hard time retaining the information they learned in the remote classes both students are also given the opportunity to opt into a passfail system for their courses during this semesterleaving them with clean slates they are able to return to school in the fall and start the next step of their programs however both start to struggle in classes because their deficiencies from the previous semester are on full display the white studentrightfully understanding that they were victim to extenuating circumstancesgoes to their professor expresses that the coronavirus threw them into an unstable environment and that is why they are not performing well in class the black student however feels ashamed and is concerned about the new stereotype threat that has crept into their educational experience 6 9 10 they are aware that the professor could hold them to a different standard in spite of the virus but they also know that they have no chance at improvement if they do not speak up at all both are reaping very different consequences and burdens after it has passed what we actually see here are many short-sighted and worrisome assumptionsthe assumption of shared ethics based on income similar long-term goals and a shared sense of community benevolence for the white employee they could socially isolate themselves and bear the consequences of limited social interactions while aiding their country or choose to not socially isolate themselves and incur some broader societal shaming for the white economically disadvantaged student they have the opportunity to freely call back to the coronavirus as a time of hardship for their academics with minimal fear of stereotype threat and almost assured benefit of the doubt however for the black employee and student they may actually be in a lose-lose situation they could socially isolate themselves but could incur unforeseen consequences on themselves their families or a future black employee or student the employee could choose to not socially isolate themselves and incur the risk of being perceived as callous to the needs of the present vulnerable people in their liveswhile also carrying the aforementioned consequences for the student they could be perceived as unproductive if they ask for help if they call back to the coronavirus they could be viewed as insensitive for calling back to a national crisis as their academic undoing but if they say nothing they will not get the help that they need and where does that leave their choice often it is easy to forget that the american relationship with race and prejudice has long-term consequences that most did not expect when the usa codified the unequal treatment of black americans profiled the group as lacking in moral character and systemically disenfranchised them one could not have thought that there would be an instance where we need the entire nation to be motivated to socially isolate themselves as a way to protect the greater good however a consequence of the unethical treatment of black americans is the creation of two greater goods there is the greater good of benevolence to a more mainstream majority society and a greater good for a society that understands that when this has all ended they still will have to live under unfair conditions in this case whiteness has created and provided the freedom to worry about the immediate circumstances at hand however blackness has been subjugated into a duality of priorities they are not just worried about protecting the elderly the immunocompromised and themselves they are worried about protecting their own elderly immunocompromised children families and broader communitiesnot only from the coronavirus but also from life afterwards we have to free everyone to participate in the best health practices for this crisis without saddling them with the consequences of stereotyping and unconscious bias this starts with understanding how deeply racially marginalized groups understand and move in the face of oppression it is not enough to just absorb that the united states has a racist past this is also not just about combating coronavirus disease this is an extension of the general stresses of being a black individual in the united states this cognitive calculus that black americans do on a regular basis just happen to intertwine with new social expectations of how we protect ourselves and those vulnerable to illness we need to be willing to examine our biases well before this crisis is over will we have selective memories about the impact of coronavirus disease when it is time to evaluate workplace promotions or educational progress or will we actually commit to affording everyone a global pass for some the option to socially isolate may seem like the most moral and responsible choice but this choice is nuanced and may require a larger sacrifice from racially marginalized populations what is interesting is that some forums have referred to fighting the coronavirus disease as analogous to needing a wartime-like willingness to cooperate what we also know is that even when black americans have engaged in a wartime-like willingness to cooperategladly and willingly entering literal wars on the behalf of the united states they were shunned when the crisis was over 11 history has consistently shown that compliance does not always bear fruit for racially marginalized groups this is not advocating for lack of sacrificesocial distancing requires sacrifice to protect those who are at risk for contracting coronavirus disease however this is a call to remember that sacrifice has come at a larger expense for some more than others and when this inevitably ends and business as usual resumes that should be remembered  a modelling analysis of strategies for relaxing covid-19 social distancing george milne j simon xie dana poklepovich  background the ability of countries to contain and control covid-19 virus transmission via social distancing is critical in the absence of a vaccine early activation of robust measures has been shown to control the daily infection rate and consequential pressure on the health care system as countries begin to control covid-19 spread an understanding of how to ease social distancing measures to prevent a rebound in cases and deaths is required methods using covid-19 transmission data from the outbreak source in hubei province china prior to activation of containment measures we adapted an established individual-based simulation model of the city of newcastle australia simulation of virus transmission in this model with and without social distancing measures activated permitted us to quantify social distancing effectiveness optimal strategies for relaxing social distancing were determined under two settings with high numbers of daily cases as in new york and where early social distancing activation resulted in limited ongoing transmission as in perth australia  findings in countries where strong social distancing measures were activated after the covid-19 virus had spread widely our study found these measures are required to be maintained for significant periods before being eased to return to a situation where daily case numbers become low in countries where early responses to the covid-19 pandemic have been highly successful as in australia we show that a staged relaxation of social distancing prevents a rebound in cases interpretation modelling studies and direct observation have shown that robust and timely social distancing have the most effect in containing the spread of the covid-19 virus questions arise as to the duration of strong social distancing measures given they are highly disruptive to society and economic activity this study demonstrates the necessity of holding robust social distancing in place until covid-19 virus transmission has significantly decreased and how they may then be safely eased at the early stages of the covid-19 coronavirus pandemic first detected in wuhan china data on virus transmissibility and pathogenesis was uncertain as would be the case for a novel influenza virus 1 given this uncertainty chinese authorities adopted strict measures to contain covid-19 spread by continuing closure of schools and workplaces which were already closed for the chinese lunar new year activating measures to enforce significant community contact reduction and closing transport links between population centres this response was in contrast to the situation which occurred in 20023 with the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic where the sars coronavirus had spread widely before measures were effected to contain it 2 we used early transmission data from the unmitigated covid-19 outbreak in china 3 to adjust parameters in an established individual-based simulation model of an australian city to reflect these covid-19 characteristics and applied the model to evaluate the effectiveness of a range of social distancing interventions the results provide guidance to public health authorites as to the mitigating effect of individual social distancing measures such as school and workplace closure and reductions in community-wide contact and under alternative levels of robustness 4 similar modelling studies have also evaluated social distancing in mitigating covid-19 virus spread 5 6 7 8 9 public health authorities also require guidance as to how best to relax social distancing measures to allow an economy to restart while preventing a bounce back second peak in case numbers we thus evaluated how social distancing measures may be relaxed in an optimal manner that achieves the following two goals to allow the economy to grow again from a low activity base affected by workplace closures and to do this in a way that prevents a rebound in case numbers and deaths to determining the impact of relaxing social distancing we conducted analyses under two distinct settings new york city a high transmission setting where an exponential growth in cases occurred prior to social distancing activation on 22 nd march 2020 with a strengthening of measures occurringon 12 th april 2020 10 and a low transmission setting of perth australia where strict border closure and social distancing interventions were activated prior to significant within country covid- 19 virus transmission 11 in australia robust social distancing measures were adopted country-wide starting on 20 th march 2020 and further strengthened on 23 rd and 26 th march 2020 11-13 resulting in significant reductions in workplace and community-wide contact these measures resulted in very low levels of covid-19 virus transmission with almost all diagnosed cases being returing australians infected outside the country or those who had been in direct contact with such individuals in western australia closure of state borders coupled with rigorous contact tracing and testing prevented any significant outbreak occurring in metropolitan perth a conurbation with a population of approximately 22 million under a new york city scenario we evaluated the timing of social distancing relaxation to determine the earliest period when they may be eased without such changes causing an increase in the growth of infections for the perth australia scenario we analysed a staged relaxation of social distancing starting with schools reopening after the easter holidays then an increase in the limit of gatherings from two persons to ten and the opening of cafes and restaurants and increased return to the workplace we further analysed a scenario where there was a rapid increase in cases due to introduction of a number of asymptomatic individuals such as may occur when borders are reopened the results directly address questions related to the timing and scale of social distancing relaxation measures required with the aim of increasing economic activity while preventing a rebound in virus transmission a community-based simulation model capturing the demographics and movement patterns of individuals in a city together with the virus transmission characteristics of covid-19 was used to evaluate the effectiveness of a range of social distancing strategies the model is individual-based cf agent-based and represent each individual in a specific community matching recent census and other government data 1415 related individual-based simulation models for multiple population centres in australia and in south africa thailand vietnam and papua new guinea have been previously developed using the same underlying automata-theoretic modelling methodology to capture the dynamics of both pathogen transmission and population mobility 16 17 18 19 20 this approach to disease modelling has allowed us to explicitly simulate person-to-person virus transmission the probability of such transmission the location of transmission eg school workplace home community and determines each individuals infection status through time 17 18 19 21 such simulation models create a virtual world of individuals whose daily movement changing contact patterns and disease biology dynamics aim to replicate that of the real-world system in as much detail as data sources permit such as data from the polymod contact pattern study 22 as with the sars outbreak in 2003 no vaccine is available 23 and the population has no immunity at the outset reliance must be made on robust social distancing interventions contact tracing and early isolation of diagnosed cases the aim of social distancing interventions in the current covid-19 situation is to slow down transmission and reduce the growth rate in case numbers this approach aims to lessen the daily pressure on health care personnel and hospital facilities such as intensive care beds and to lower mortality rates this study used an established individual-based model of the city of newcastle new south wales australia this model matches the real-world counterpart with respect to population size  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international

basic reproduction number r0 of approximately 22 taken from work by li and colleagues 3 this basic reproduction number corresponds to that derived by kucharski and colleagues 26 this data provided virus transmission settings for the model corresponding to the spread characteristics in wuhan china prior to activation of social distancing measures on 23 rd january 2020 these parameter settings provided an unmitigated epidemic baseline with which to compare alternative social distancing sd strategies model outputs obtained by running the simulation software for the duration of an infectious disease outbreak gave the infection history of each individual in the modelled community this data was used to determine the total number of infectious individuals where and when infection occurs and may thus be used to quantify the resulting health burden ie hospitalisations and deaths 21 27 to determine the effectiveness of specific social distancing interventions we compared the number of daily infections generated by an unmitigated covid-19 outbreak with one which has specific social distancing measures in place modelling experiments were conducted for alternative social distancing strategies the difference in cases quantifying intervention effectiveness a transmission parameter is used to model the probability of covid-19 transmission following contact between a susceptible and

movement of individuals between as they move from households to schools and workplaces in a daytime cycle then return to their household in an evening cycle with each day split into a day and night

model represents the individual-to-individual contact patterns in as much detail as data sources provide to accurately describe how the movement of individuals allows virus transmission to spread over

have contact with household members during the daytime and also have contact in the community workplace non-attendance and thus contact reduction a percentage of all persons in the workforce are absent have contact within their household in the daytime and still having contact in the wider community increased case isolation 90 of adults and 100 of children withdraw to the home on becoming ill

daily case numbers have declined to a level which is sustainable by available health care facilities in terms of icu bed and staffing resources to analyse relaxation strategies we considered two distinct situations a where daily diagnosed case numbers are high and either increasing or leveling out and b where case numbers are very low and a localised epidemic is tending to elimination in this latter situation we analysed response strategies needed for a rapid increase in case numbers such as may occur when borders are reopened the department of health government of western australia

rebounds this rebound increases slowly up to 1000 additional infections per day with this rebound peak occurring approximately two months later assuming a 35 asymptomatic rate and a 50 diagnosis rate for symptomatic infections this 1000 additional infections translates into approximately 300 additional diagnosed cases per day a number that may be managed by available health care resources figure 2 presents results for alternative social distancing relaxation scenarios where the effect of the timing of reduction in strength of measures is determined we considered the same combined reduction as illustrated in figure 1  involving reopening of schools and increasing workplace attendance and community-wide contact from 50 to 65 the timing of this relaxation of social distancing was evaluated at six eight ten twelve and fourteen weeks after the measures were strengthened on 12 april 2020 it is apparent that the earlier the robust social distancing measures are relaxed the greater the period of sustained high transmission the six yellow and eight week pink relaxation curves illustrate that the rebound in daily infections is moderate and there is a significant period of where the infection rate is high between 7500 and 12000 new infections each day this situation contrasts with a continuous decline in infections if strong social distancing is maintained continuously the grey curve holding the strong social distancing in place for 12 or 14 weeks before relaxation gives a flat plateau effect in the daily infection rate the purple and brown curves these occur on 8 th and 23 rd july respectively with sustained infection rates between 2000 and 3000 per day for the six epidemic curves in figure 2  the cumulative number of infections occurring between 23 rd may 2020 day 137 and 29 th august 2020 day 236 are as in table 2   cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in

venues were closed people were encouraged to work from home if possible and restrictions on contact outside of households was restricted schools were not required to close though some independent schools did close and across all schools parents were able to keep children at home if they wished with home and on-line schooling occurring universities stopped in-person teaching with on-line lectures streamed to students these measures coupled with rigorous contact tracing testing and quarantining of diagnosed cases resulted in low levels of covid-19 virus transmission this has prevented

days in hotels the covid-19 virus in western australia is tending to elimination status to inform the government of western australia on strategies for the safe easing of social distancing we modelled a staged relaxation of physical distancing measures starting with schools reopening after the easter holidays then an increase in the limit of gatherings from two persons to ten then the opening of cafes and restaurants and increased numbers returning to the workplace we further analysed a scenario where there was a rapid increase in cases with a spike in infections being a possibility once

workplace attendance was reduced to 50 sc50 and wn50 community-wide contact was reduced by 80 ccr80 and increased case isolation ici occurred with 100 of children and 90 of adults isolated on case diagnosis the effect on the daily infection rate in perth following activation of such robust social distancing measures on 15 th march 2020 denoted by sc50ici wn50ccr80 is illustrated by the orange curve in figure 3  the initial unmitigated growth in infections blue has its increasing infection growth rate arrested by these robust social distancing measures the easter school holidays occurred on 9 th april 2020 with all schools closing and the impact of this slight change to the strong measures already in place is illustrated by the grey curve with a slightly reducing trend in infections the yellow and green predicted daily infections in figure 3 model the effect of a staged reopening of schools while holding all other social distancing measures in place these involve 25 of all students

50 diagnosis of symptomatic cases see table 1  this resulted in between 16 and four diagnosed cases per day with only a slight variation being due to the time-varying school attendance rates this rate of diagnosed cases corresponds closely to the situation in perth up to 20 th april 2020 29 to determine the impact of relaxing social distancing with the aim of increasing workplace participation and thus increasing economic activity we considered three alternative social distancing relaxation strategies to take effect on 1 st june 2020 as in  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made

lowering workplace non-attendance wn and with little effect on the infection rate settings b and c have higher community-wide contact reductions 50 a nd 65 respectively compared to a at 40 the timing of activation of social distancing measures has been a challenge facing public health authorities and the rapid growth in cases and deaths in certain countries during the first three months of the covid-19 pandemic highlights the criticality of early and robust responses as has been analysed in a prior modelling study by the authors 4 a further challenge is knowing when to initiate relaxation of strong social distancing measures once ongoing covid-19 virus transmission has declined to avoid a rebound in case numbers this study evaluated the easing of strong social distancing measures under two distinct settings 1 for countries with high transmission rates arising from delays in activating response measures as occurred in a number of european countries ie italy spain and the united kingdom and in new york state usa and 2 for countries which were able to rapidly respond to the initial ourbreak in china by closing borders activating robust social distancing measures had capacity to rapidly diagnose cases trace contacts and quarantine them countries such as australia were thus able to contain the initial growth in case numbers and in some states such as western australia be close to virus elimination 29 deciding on the timing and reduction in strength of social distancing measures as they are relaxed to ensure that case numbers have declined to levels where health system resources are sustainable is a challenge for governments there is a need to balance what may be necessary to reduce the daily infection rate and take pressure off health care resources with what a population can sustain such as a long duration of highly restrictive measures and the consequential negative impact this has on economic activity modelling studies 4 7 8 and direct observation 5 9 have previously shown that robust and timely social distancing has the most effect in containing the spread of the covid-19 virus this study provides guidance as to the timing of relaxation of robust social distancing measures in both high and low transmission settings for the cities of new york usa and perth australia respectively they provide quantification of the effect on case numbers under alternative timings of social distancing easing and how case numbers may be contained under a phased introduction of progressively weaker social distancing measures the results demonstrate how to

reduced social distancing once the epidemic peak has passed as discussed by di domenico and colleagues 6 lifting lockdown without an informed exit strategy in place risks a second wave in infections and its impact on healthcare resources and deaths ending robust social distancing measures prematurely risks overwhelming health care resources as is also suggested by our study in new york city social distancing measures were strengthened on 12 th april 2020 after those activated three weeks earlier failed to produce a significant decline in daily case numbers if these measures were partially relaxed after six weeks our modelling suggests that the total number of infections occurring over the following three months will be approximately one million which under asymptomatic and diagnosis percentage assumptions described in table 1  may translate into a total of 330000 diagnosed cases if these strict measures were held for an additional eight weeks before being partially relaxed our modelling suggests that 115000 diagnosed cases would occur over that 100 day period if strong social distancing was not relaxed we estimate that the number of diagnosed cases over the 100 day period would be 100000 for a city the size of new york with an 84 million population the above estimated case numbers under alternative durations of robust social distancing give guidance as to the impact on health services when social distancing measures are eased for example the very flat epidemic curves which result from relaxing social distancing between eight and ten weeks after introduction pink and green curves of figure 2  have estimated diagnosed case peaks of approximately 2500 per day city-specific data relating diagnosed case numbers to hospitalization rates may then be used to estimate ventilator and icu bed demand while this will be higher than if the robust social distancing measures were not relaxed if such estimated health care resource needs are within the capacity of the health care system then the decision to relax interventions becomes a tradeoff between managing infection numbers and increasing economic activity when transmission has significantly reduced relaxation of social distancing the allows schools and workplaces to safely reopen and community-wide activity to partly resume with a resulting increase in economic activity in australia the situation is quite different to that in the usa the uk france and italy for example early interventions including closing international borders and activating rigorous social distancing has resulted in very low rates of transmission with some states such as western australia tending to virus elimination as of 25 th april 2020 29 our model-based analyses indicate how social distancing measures may be successfully eased in a manner designed to increasingly restart the local economy while managing any significant increase in transmission such an increase in cases may occur from unseen spread among asymptomatic individuals or via movement of infected individuals due to the partial reopening of borders  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder

analyses show how robust australian social distancing measures have prevented arrival of introduced cases developing into a rapidly growing outbreak furthermore a previous modelling analysis by the

produced an unmitigated infection rate of 66 which includes both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases and a basic reproduction number of 22 higher or lower r0 settings will affect case numbers under all the social distancing intervention considered in the absence of definitive data on the proportion of infections which are asymptomatice we assumed a 35 asymptomatic proportion similarly if the infectious period is longer than the three days assumed the same caveat applies however sensitivity analyses indicate that changing the underlying model parameters to reflect these modifications does not affect the relative effectiveness of the social distancing measures the focus of this study is on measures to safely manage virus transmission within communities whether towns or large cities

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 1 the first outbreak reported was in december 2019 in wuhan china as pneumonia of unknown etiology linked to a seafood market exposure 2 on january 30 the world health organization who declared the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern pheic and a pandemic on march 11 3 the first case reported in saudi arabia was on march 7 at that time increasing numbers were seen all over the world with the majority of confirmed cases currently in the united states brazil and russia 4 after reporting the first case in saudi arabia the government response was swift and immediate started by launching a social media campaign encouraging people to stay at home and to follow the ministry of health instructions 5 on march 23 a lockdown was imposed on mecca medina and riyadh with travel restrictions all over the country and within the next ten days the curfew was extended to 24-hour 6 the fast climbing of cases of covid-19 all over the world and the rapid changes in people daily living have left people alarmed and frightened historically there have been multiple outbreaks over the years such as the sars epidemic when moderate to severe post-traumatic-stress symptoms were reported in the highly affected areas 7 during the swine flu influenza a h1n1 outbreak a study showed that 96 and 329 of the general population were either very or moderately worried about the possibility of being infected respectively 8 ebola mers and sars epidemics all showed an impact on mental health that includes depression and even substance abuse has been reported 9 during the mers outbreak in jeddah western saudi arabia a survey reported a significant association between the level of anxiety and avoiding behaviors 10 in the current pandemic a recent study carried out in china concerning covid-19 psychological impact revealed that 538 of respondents are showing moderate to severe psychological impact 165 and 288 reported moderate to high depressive or anxiety symptoms respectfully and 81 moderate to high levels of stress were reported 11 anxiety and depression symptoms showed no decline four weeks after the covid-19 pandemic 12 to the best of our knowledge there are no published studies assessing the general population response to the emerging coronavirus infections in saudi arabia therefore this study aims to measure the degree of psychological responses resulted from the covid-19 pandemic on saudi arabias general population this study followed a cross-sectional design to assess the general populations psychological impact on the covid19 pandemic at the time of curfew and lockdown in the kingdom of saudi arabia we used an online-based questionnaire distributed through social media apps like whatsapp and twitter participants were encouraged to distribute the survey physical distribution was not feasible due to the lockdown in the kingdom participants have received the survey request through whatsapps groups of colleagues family or friends in another platform twitter they received tweets or messages via different accounts in saudi arabia these messages showed the study purpose link and asked for participation the survey was titled psychological impact in saudi arabia after clicking on the link of the survey a cover page showing the studys title purpose and needed time for completion showed up if they agreed to participate they were asked to click start the survey and then they start answering the survey questions as mentioned earlier the survey was distributed during a period of curfew and practices of socialphysicaldistancing were promoted by the saudi ministry of health therefore we followed an online data collection technique the survey was done online by using a common platform google survey google llc mountain view california usa the study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of qassim university no1908-01 all participants were informed about study purposes and provided informed consent data were kept confidential and were not disclosed unless for study purposes data collected was conducted over four days april 25 april 2020 after cases in saudi arabia reached one thousand and while curfew and social distancing measures were implemented by health authorities the sample size was calculated using epi info 7 centers for disease control and prevention cdc atlanta georgia usa the calculated sample size was 1149 based on the assumption of anticipated  frequency p of 538 of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe in previous studies5 margin of error confidence interval of 95 and a design effect of 3 as we followed non-probability sampling 11 the survey developed based on a recent study conducted in 194 cities in china 11 the adopted questionnaire covers several aspects of participant sociodemographic knowledge concerns psychological impact and mental health status sociodemographic variables of participants included gender age education residential place in the preceding 14 days marital status employment status if they work in the medical field or one of their relatives monthly household income in saudi riyal parental status household size and type moreover participants were asked about physical symptoms they experienced in the preceding 14 days including fever chills headache myalgia dry cough difficulty in breathing dizziness nasal congestion sore throat diarrhea and others furthermore they were required to rate their physical health status 1 to 5 where 1 indicates poor health status and self-report any history of chronic medical or psychiatric illnesses if they existed the survey included parts on health service utilization in the preceding 14 days included consultation with a doctor in the clinic admission to the hospital being quarantined or isolated by health authorities and being tested for covid-19 contact history variables included close contact with an individual with confirmed covid-19 indirect contact with an individual with confirmed covid-19 and contact with an individual with suspected covid-19 case infected substance or surfaces the second part of the survey covered the participants knowledge and concerns about covid-19 and it included aspects related to the routes of transmission of sars-cov-2 level of confidence in covid-19 diagnostic tests level of satisfaction of health information about covid-19 if following up the trending news of cases and death in the country and potential treatment for covid-19 infection participants were asked to identify their source of information based on the provided list the actual number of confirmed cases of covid-19 and deaths in the country on the day of data collection concern about covid-19 included self and other relatives contracted sars-cov-2 perceived susceptibility to infection and survival if infected the third part covers precautionary measures against sars-cov-2 including avoidance of sharing of utensils during meals and handshaking cough etiquette covering mouth when coughing and sneezing hand hygiene wearing a mask regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms and if applying social distancing measures no handshaking and keeping a distance of one meter to assess their compliance with social distancing instruction they were asked the average number of hours staying at home per day to minimize the risk of contracting the infection during the last 14 days they were given certain statements and asked to rate their opinions on whether they felt too much unnecessary worry had been made about the covid-19 pandemic the last part of the survey assessed the psychological impact of covid-19 using the impact of event scale-revised ies-r and depression anxiety and stress scale dass-21 both scales used previously in assessing psychological impact related to sars and covid-19 1113 the ies-r is an easily self-administered questionnaire

 however a sizeable proportion had a chronic disease 173 and 105 had been diagnosed to have a psychiatric disorder at the time of data collection within the two weeks period preceding data collection 168 had visited hospitals for different reasons and only 08 of the total population needed to be admitted for serious illness thirty-three respondents were tested for covid-19 28 and 12 respondents 10 were quarantined within the previous 14 days across the three subscales of the dass and the ies-r having a poor health status was found to be significantly associated with high scores participants with poor or very poor health were several times more likely than those with good health to have poor psychological health with a b coefficient of 1510 on the ies-r 95 ci 9372084 1495 on the stress subscale of the dass 95 ci 1094 to 1895 1218 on the anxiety subscale of the dass 95 ci 923 to 1512 and 1383 on the depression subscale of the dass 95 ci 10021764 having a chronic disease was only significantly associated with lower scores on the stress subscale of the dass with b coefficient of 208 and 95 ci of 377 to 039 having a psychiatric disorder was significantly associated with higher scores on all the scales ies-r b  843 95 ci 553 to 1133 dass-stress b  883 95 ci 680 to 1085 dass-anxiety b  827 95 ci 678 to 975 and dass-depression b  983 95 ci 792 to 1175 within the immediate period before the study some of the participants had experienced a wide range of symptoms that have been associated with covid-19 table 3 these most reported symptoms were headache 238 and sore throat 111 it is important to note that 608 of the participants indicated that they had not experienced any of these symptoms within the same period however participants who had experienced any of dizziness difficulty breathing muscle pains headache nasal congestion sore throat and diarrhea were significantly more likely to have high scores on the ies and all three subscales of the dass not experiencing any of the above-listed symptoms was significantly associated with lower scores on all the scales ies-r at a 95 confidence interval table 3 participants were tested to know their level of knowledge confidence and satisfaction with regards to the covid-19 pandemic table 4
 the majority of them believe that transmission of the disease is through exposure to air droplets released by an infected person via sneezing and coughing and direct contact 966 similarly the majority of them were very 306 or extremely 444 confident about the effectiveness of the methods used in diagnosing the disease and a total of 787 were veryextremely satisfied with the amount of information available on the disease on probing further to understand the sources of information for the participants the majority sourced their information from the saudi ministry of health 872 the world health organization 409 and non-official social media applications and platforms such as whatsapp twitter youtube etc 403 across all the information sources participants who sourced their information from the world health organization were significantly more likely to have worse scores across both the ies-r b  260 95 ci 078 to 443 and dass stress b  306 95 ci 177 to 435 anxiety b  137 95 ci 040 to 233 and depression b  238 95 ci 115 to 362 subscales relying on local news was significantly associated with lower scores on the dass-anxiety b  106 95 ci -210 to 002 all other information sources had no significant associations with the scores on either the ies-r or dass only 15 of the total population have had a relative diagnosed with covid-19 when asked about their perceivability of contracting sars-cov-2 during the current outbreak the majority believed they had lower chances of being infected with 416 saying it was not likely and another 239 believed it was only slightly likely however if infected the majority believed their chances of recovering was very likely 331 or extremely likely 434 having relatives who have tested positive for covid-19 or being diagnosed with the disease had no significant impact on the scores on the ies-r and dass participants who believed they have a slight chance of recovering if they should contract covid-19 were significantly more likely to have higher scores across all the scales - ies-r and dass stress anxiety and depression similarly those who believed they were very likely to have the disease were more likely to have higher scores across all the scales ies-r b  981 95 ci 580 to 1383 dass-stress b  941 95 ci 660 to 1222 dass-anxiety b  690 95 ci 480 to 900 and dass-depression b  954 95 ci 685 to 1222 also participants were asked what they thought about the statement i feel that there is much unnecessary worrying regarding covid-19 the majority of them disagreed that there is much unnecessary worrying regarding the disease 715 however those who strongly disagreed were significantly more likely to have higher scores on the stress subscale of the dass b  267 95 ci 017516 some of the participants had had indirect contact with someone diagnosed with covid-19 05 or direct contact with someone diagnosed with the disease 02 having direct or indirect contact with a diagnosed case of covid-19 had no significant association with ies-r and dass scores table 5
 about 17 of the participants had had direct contact with someone suspected to have covid-19 and this group appeared to have significantly high scores on the anxiety b  439 95 ci 074 to 805 and depression b  627 95 ci 158 to 1096 subscales of the dass the majority of the participants did not have any contact history suggestive of contact with the infectious agent of covid-19 814 and this set of people were found to have significantly lower scores on the ies-r b  299 95 ci -530 to 068 the majority of the participants had maintained strict self-isolation not going out at all as a result of the coronavirus outbreak 564 table 5 another 381 were indoors for more than 12 h per day however the amount of time spent indoors intensity of self-isolation had no significant impact on scores on the ies-r and dass probing into how participants had protected themselves from covid-19 over the previous 14 days the majority of them had been washing and disinfecting their hands regularly 897 other measures adopted include avoiding handshakes 670 distancing themselves physically from others for at least one meter 589 avoiding the sharing of utensils during meals 234 and using face masks even when without any symptoms 169 also 72 of the respondents said they had not done anything specific to protect themselves with regards to the psychological impact of these precautionary measures those who washed and disinfected their hands frequently were significantly associated with lower scores on the depression subscale of the dass b  243 95 ci -444 to 042 those who maintained at least one meter of social distancing were also significantly associated with lower scores on the stress b  149 95 ci -279 to 019 and anxiety b  153 95 ci -250 to 057 subscales of the dass this study aimed to assess the psychological impact of covid-19 pandemic on the general population of saudi arabia our results suggest that concerning the early psychological impact of the general public236 of respondents reported moderate or severe psychological impact of the outbreak and severe symptoms of stress were experienced by 137 which is similar to the 139 who experienced severe symptoms of anxiety and 164 who experienced severe symptoms of depression our findings are in line with previous findings of a study conducted during the pandemic in iran where it reported the level of severe anxiety to be 191 and another study in spain where it reported the level depression stress anxiety to be 99 78 116 respectively 18 19 contrary to the findings of our study a recently published study in china where 538 reported their psychological impact of the outbreak moderate or severe 165 and 28 reported depressive and anxiety symptoms ranged from moderate to severe while 81 reported moderate to severe stress levels 11 the lower prevalence in our study could be attributed to that in the early days of the outbreak only a few cases have been reported in saudi arabia with the majority of cases are imported from abroad and the lower perceived likelihood of being infected during the current outbreak as we found in this study among participants 117 worked in a medical field and 279 had a family member working in a medical field those participants had a higher score in the stress and anxiety and depression subscale and this is in agreement with previous studies published recently and during mers outbreak in saudi arabia and studies conducted during the current covid-19 pandemic in singapore and india 20 21 22 23in addition to that we found that females and students had higher scores across all dass subscales as was consistent with a previous study done in china 11 this could be attributed to the uncertainty of used methods in continuing the educational process after closing up the campuses and schools furthermore earning less than 5000 sar was significantly associated with higher scores on the ies-r the depression subscale the economic impact of the pandemic cannot be overlooked which had left families with lower-income fearing of losing their jobs and homes to mitigate this damage the saudi government has released several initiatives including offering free health care for everybody and financial incentives for the private sector 24 respondents with poor self-rated health status found to have a greater psychological impact and poorer mental health compared to the majority of the respondents 866 who view their health status to be good or very good moreover the most reported physical symptom were headaches sore throat muscle pain symptomatic respondents had poorer psychological status when compared to non-symptomatic similarly this was seen in the study carried out in mainland china during the covid-19 pandemic 11 this may be explained by the fact that the novel coronavirus found to be more aggressive on people with comorbidities and below-optimal health status which may result in more psychological burden and excessive worry 25 people with mental disorders are also more susceptible to stress compared to the general public and such outbreaks can provoke relapses or even worsen the already existing psychological disorder 26 in our study participants with reported mental disorders 105 showed high scores on all dass and ier-s scales our finding is in alignment with a recent study comparing people with and without psychiatric illnesses during the current covid 19 pandemic where people with psychiatric illnesses were more likely to exhibit higher levels of ptsd depression anxiety and stress 27 this finding stresses the need to support this particular population especially during the lockdown where access to psychiatric services is difficult through expanding the telepsychiatry services and home delivery of medications besides that173 of the participants reported having a chronic disease which was associated with lower scores on the stress subscale which is inconsistent with the study conducted in the mainland china 11 within the two weeks preceding data collection 168 had visited hospitals for different reasons and they score high on anxiety subscale respondents who have been quarantined and tested for covid-19 show no significant association with any of the subscales and this might be explained by the assurance they received from the negative results of the screening and showing no symptoms during the quarantine period overall the majority of the respondents 95 showed an excellent level of knowledge on the mode of transmission of the coronavirus contact droplet which indicates a satisfactory level 85 of information about the disease being delivered to the general population those levels showed better rates compared to the study conducted in mainland china 11 the overwhelming majority of respondents indicated some level of confidence in available testing options however those with lesser degrees of confidence low moderate were likely to be associated with a higher level of depression anxiety stress and psychological impact as reported by wang et al 11 the current study shows the general population confidence in local health authorities as shown to be the dominant source of information on covid-19 related matters 88 followed by who and non-official news circulating social media platforms like whatsapp and twitter it worth noticing that our samples population was approached using those platform however the non-official sources were not the primary source of information this shows the importance of delivering timely evidence-based information by the official health authorities through all platforms respondents demonstrated high levels of application of evidence-based preventive measures ie hand hygiene and social distancing which indicate a sufficient level of information as discussed earlier moreover respondents display a high level of optimism in recovery in case they have the infection which is consistent with their age group and the fact that 80 of the infected population will have mild disease 3 similar to the finding of alnajjar et al an increase in perceived susceptibility to the infection was associated with higher psychological impact 28 besides that only 5 reported very high susceptibility of contracting the disease compared to 13 amid mers infection in jeddah sa 28 hand hygiene and other precautionary measures were found to have protective psychological effects which is consistent with the finding reported in china during the earlier stages of the pandemic 11 on the contrary those who avoided sharing utensils showed a high ies-r score this could be attributed to the direct relation of utensils to the primary mode of transmission also using a protective mask regardless of the presence of the symptoms was associated with worse ies-r score in contrary to findings by a recent study where they found that mask-wearing was associated with lower levels of anxiety and depression 12when comparing our results to a previous study during the outbreak of influenza a h1n1 in saudi arabia about 61 of the population reported that they did not take mild or minimal precautions to prevent infection 29 there is an increase in using precautionary measures right now which can be attributed to social media campaigns that are focused on boosting public awareness and emphasizing the importance of wearing masks to prevent spreading of the virus in the community 30 moreover the saudi government adopted new regulations mandating masks wearing in public places 31 the findings of this study emphasize the need for governments to adopt new strategies to improve psychological services for community and individuals level by focusing on delivering accurate evidence-based information to minimize the effect of fake news and to identify and support high-risk groups especially those with preexisting mental illness by expanding telepsychiatry services promoting mental wellness and psychological interventions nationwide limitations of the study include the time of data collection where the outbreak in saudi arabia was at its early stage with reported cases less than two thousand which may have underestimated the psychological impact of the outbreak for the time-sensitivity of the outbreak and with a curfew in place we adopted a snowballing sampling strategy which is a non-probability sampling technique however we assumed a study design effect of 3 in the sample calculation to compensate for the used sampling technique oversampling of particular regions eg qassim region where we approached the initial sampled group and the limitations to reach less educated people and non-social media users led to less generalizable results also as a limitation of the study design the survey provides only a snapshot of psychological responses at a particular point in time and a longitudinal study is required to provide information on whether the observed impact will last for longer periods the self-reported psychological impact anxiety depression and stress may not adequately represent the mental health status assessed in an interview thus for the outcome to be determined prospective studies are necessary to provide more accurate data to support the need for focused public mental health strategies lastly the number of respondents who have been quarantined tested for covid-19 and had a contact history with infected persons was minimal and our result could not be generalized on them despite all the above limitations our study provides information about the immediate psychological responses of saudi arabias general population on the covid-19 pandemic it covers many factors that can influence mental health and provides a broader vision of the issue for future researches our results give an idea about the magnitude of the psychological burden on the community during such outbreaks and offer ways to minimize the impact throughout the early stage covid-19 pandemic in saudi arabia the results showed that one-fourth of the general population experienced moderate to severe psychological impact working in the medical field females students and having a mental disorder are all associated with high scores in stress anxiety and depression subscales following specific precautionary measures appeared to have a protective effect on the individuals mental health our findings can be used to construct a psychological intervention directed toward the general and vulnerable population and to implement public mental health strategies in

social distancing measures on covid-19 burden in the us a simulation modeling approach oguzhan alagoz ajay sethi k brian patterson w matthew churpek nasia safdar   the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic poses unprecedented challenges for communities and policy makers sars-cov-2 the virus that causes covid-19 is spread mainly through respiratory droplets and following contact with contaminated surfaces but limited knowledge of transmission dynamics make effective control of the disease tailored to specific communities challenging in the absence of an effective vaccine or treatment non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing measures which require one to maintain a 6-foot physical distance from non-household members are the only means of reducing the spread of covid-19 examples include closures of schools ceasing recreational activities cancellation of large public gatherings and shelter-in-place policies when these measures are implemented and followed daily counts of new covid-19 cases decrease flattening the curve1 the negative economic and societal consequences of social distancing warrant a dialing back of such policies when it is safe to do so however the effect of easing social distancing on the transmission of sars-cov-2 is unclear a set of indicators have been proposed by the current administration to guide communities on when they might consider easing rigorous mandated social distancing2 however these lagging indicators such as hospitals having the capacity to treat patients without crisis care are not ideal because once the number of new infections increases re-implementation of social distancing is not as effective as a mitigation option due to exponential growth in the case of transmissible infectious diseases such as covid-192 the ability to predict the effect of easing of social distancing is important to provide leading indicators for the right time to do this for a particular community using the best information available mathematical modeling of sars-cov-2 transmission dynamics allow scientists to forecast the effect of social distancing on the covid-19 pandemic in particular agent-based models provide a flexible and simulation-based method to better represent transmission dynamics in a complex system while other models are available including those providing predictions for every state in the us these models have several limitations that severely limit their generalizability37 for example they assume a closed population and ignore imported infections into the region do not consider imperfect adherence levels to the dynamic social distancing measures accurately and most do not incorporate the effect of limited testing capacity into the number of confirmed cases36 we present an agent-based model that represents the social network and interactions among the people in a region considering local population demographics population density daily number of contacts in the absence of social distancing measures and adherence to social distancing measures our model referred to as covid-19 agent-based simulation model covam allows transmission from asymptomatic patients allows both community spread and transmission in the hospitals accounts for the imported cases at the early days of the pandemic and considers the possibility that some patients with mild to moderate symptoms never receive confirmatory testing for covid-19 this study demonstrates how covam can inform decision-making in three unique urban communities as to how social distancing measures might be adjusted to control the spread of sars-cov-2 and prevent a return to exponential growth in the number of covid-19 cases to maximize model generalizability we derived input parameter estimates from relevant results in peer-reviewed literature and used data from dane county wisconsin to calibrate several parameters table 1 covam has two different sets of parameters governing the transmissibility of sars-cov-2
number of close contacts per day without any intervention which represents the social network effect and is independent of the respiratory agent that is transmitted this parameter depends on population density and is estimated using literature and calibration as explained belowprobability that contagious exposed patients transmit sars-cov-2 to a susceptible individual when a close contact occurs the theoretical basic reproduction number r0 corresponding to these parameter estimates is 334 for dane county without any social distancing measures which was within the range of r0 values reported in the literature 15 to 651314 in particular a recent study based on the covid-19 epidemic in italy reported an r0 value of 347 for the early days of the epidemic15 similarly a recent study estimated the median r0 value for the wuhan region as 5716 therefore we concluded that our transmission parameters were within acceptable ranges the effectiveness of social distancing measures depends on how closely a population follows such measures and the type of measures that are implemented at different times for example in the state of new york mass gathering restrictions started on march 12 2020 initial business closures were recommended on march 16 2020 educational facilities were closed on march 18 2020 and finally non-essential services closed along with a statewide stay-at-home order on march 22 20205 covam represents the adherence to social distancing explicitly by adjusting the number of contacts per person using cell-phone mobility data published by several sources1719 for instance the average number of daily close contacts per person in new york city nyc is estimated as 20 therefore a 70 adherence level reduces the number of such contacts to 6 per day per person leading to the slowing of transmission note that adherence to social distancing measures in covam is a proxy for several behaviors that reduce the transmissibility of sars-cov-2 including less frequent traveling keeping at least 6-feet distancing during person-to-person interactions as well as frequent hand washing and wearing masks several model input parameters involve a high level of certainty including disease transmission rates probability of testing for covid-19 and adherence to social distancing measures we used a simple calibration procedure using earlier surveillance data from dane county to fine-tune these parameters table 1 we used the reported data for covid-19 from dane county until may 15 2020 to test whether our initial parameter estimates replicated the number of cases accurately we did not change any of the parameters except the adherence to social distancing input after may 15 2020 we stopped adjusting adherence input as of may 15 2020 for nyc and may 26 2020 for dane county and milwaukee compared the models projections to actual number of cases after this date input parameters that are used for the computational experiments for dane county are presented in table 2 briefly we incorporated the population demographics in terms of age groups number of individuals who are imported into dane county from outside of dane county and adherence to social distancing measures the model has the ability to add different numbers of imported cases on a daily basis however we kept the number of initial imported cases the same to prevent overfitting we considered that adherence to social distancing measures in dane county dropped on may 14 2020 since wisconsin supreme court struck down the stay-at-home order of the governor in the state of wisconsin on this date20 we assumed that adherence to social distancing remains the same after may 21 2020 we adapted covam to milwaukee to cross-validate our model and test its predictive accuracy our objective was to modify as few parameters as possible to prevent overfitting we used the same simulation settings as those in dane county except four changes table 2 1 epidemic was initiated with three exposed patients instead of one exposed patient 2 six imported cases were added to account for the larger population 3 population demographics using milwaukee population was adjusted and 4 adherence to social distancing measures was adjusted proportionate to cell phone mobility data which indicated lower adherence in milwaukee as compared to dane county1719 we assumed that adherence to social distancing remains the same after may 26 2020 new york city ny nyc was among the first epicenters for the covid-19 pandemic in the us thus the relative maturity of the epidemic in nyc made it a good test case to evaluate covams predictive accuracy for later stages of the pandemic as before to maximize generalizability and avoid overfitting we used the same simulation settings as those in dane county except four changes table 2 1 160 imported cases were added between march 5 2020 and april 4 2020 and 80 imported cases were added after april 4 2020 to account for the greater number of visitors to nyc 2 population demographics using the nyc population information was adjusted 3 adherence to social distancing measures was adjusted as mobile phone data showed that adherence was higher in nyc as compared to dane county171921 and 4 number of contacts per person in each day was set to 20 due to significantly higher population density 438square mile in dane county vs 27755square mile in nyc as social network analysis literature reports that population density increases the number of close contacts2223 these parameters correspond to a theoretical r0 value of 668 we compared the case that social distancing is not implemented schools are openclosed to the case that social distancing is implemented at the beginning of the simulation and adherence to social distancing is consistently at a level of 25507590 we tested the scenario that social distancing is implemented 1 week earlier and 14 weeks later than the actual implementation date we assumed that social distancing measures in nyc end on june 1 and adherence thereafter does not become zero but drops 20 percentage points due to heightened awareness of the community in nyc a drop of 20 percentage points in adherence to social distancing reduces the adherence level from 90 to 70 after easing social distancing measures for dane county and milwaukee we did not change adherence to social distancing after may 21 2020 and may 26 2020 respectively we tested the scenario that social distancing measures are eased on june 1 june 15 and july 1 we assumed that after social distancing measures are eased due to the heightened awareness of the community adherence to social distancing drops by 10 and 20 percentage points compared to the adherence levels before easing social distancing measures in each region for example in nyc a drop of 10 percentage points in adherence to social distancing reduces the adherence level from 90 to 80 after social distancing measures are eased this is consistent with the adherence levels observed in dane county and milwaukee after wisconsin supreme court struck down the stay-at-home order of the governor in the state on may 13 202020 we conducted these experiments only for nyc we conducted a sensitivity analysis for nyc region on two parameters probability of testing given a patient experiences mild to moderate symptoms and transmission rates testing has been severely limited especially in the early days of epidemic in the us therefore it is likely that our initial calibration may not have estimated the input parameters correctly for example recent data from nyc suggest that one of every five residents tested positive for antibodies for covid-1924 for this purpose we replaced our base estimate of 75 for the probability of testing with 25 and 50 and recalibrated model parameters and reevaluated all of the scenarios described above similarly we reduced the transmission rate by 50 from a base estimate of 00418 to 00209 for the probability of transmission from a patient experiencing mild to moderate symptoms to a susceptible patient when a close contact occurs recalibrated model parameters and reevaluated all of the scenarios we ran 100 replications for each experiment and report only mean values since the standard errors were very low covam replicated the observed number of covid-19 cases and thus sars-cov-2 transmission dynamics over time in the short term accurately figure 2 our first set of experiments showed that adherence to social distancing has a significant effect on the cumulative number of cases figure 3 and appendix table 1 for example compared to social distancing at a 50 adherence level no social distancing while closing schools increases the total number of cases from 55592 to 480630 in nyc in just 26 days by march 31 figure 4 presents how various outcomes associated with covid-19 would change when social distancing measures are implemented earlier or later than the actual implementation date we found that even a 1-week delay in implementing social distancing interventions would have had a significant impact on the total number of confirmed infections over time in each of the three urban communities figure 4 for example implementing social distancing measures one week earlier in nyc would have reduced the number of cases by 77 from 191984 to 43968 by may 30 whereas a 1-week delay in initiating such measures could have increased the number of confirmed cases by more than six-fold to 1299420 figure 4 and appendix table 2 the impact of implementing social distancing measures depends highly on the region as each region has different levels of adherence to social distancing and are experiencing different levels of transmission appendix table 2 for example implementing the measures on march 19 instead of march 12 in dane county increases the number of cases by 240 as of may 15 498 to 1693 while the same scenario in nyc increases the number of cases by 576 191984 to 1299420 these results demonstrate the differential impact of implementing social distancing measures in urban communities a delay in implementation has a differential effect on the number of cases in the milwaukee as compared to dane county indicating that the impact of a delay in implementing social distancing measures varies significantly even within the same state table 2 shows that earlier easing of the social distancing measures would have major detrimental effects on the total numbers of covid-19 cases in nyc premature easing of social distancing measures on june 1 instead of june 15 would increase the total number of confirmed cases from 275587 to 379858 as of july 31 table 2 also shows that in nyc after easing social distancing measures on june 15 increasing the adherence level by just 10 percentage points would reduce the number of cases from 711792 to 275587 as of july 31 demonstrating the importance of practicing personal behaviors that prevent the transmission of sars-cov-2 after the social distancing measures are eased the sensitivity analysis on the probability of testing and transmission rates showed that even if a lower probability of testing or a lower rate of transmission were to be used the overall trends in base-case runs would still hold appendix figures 16 and appendix tables 311 in this simulation study we estimated the impact of the timing of implementing and easing of and adherence to social distancing measures in three unique urban communities using agent-based simulation modeling we found that the timing of implementing social distancing and adherence to social distancing significantly affected the number of cases the impact of the timing of implementation of social distancing measures varied widely by region in nyc the impact was large compared to dane county and milwaukee this finding illustrates the importance of considering implementing and reopening policies at the regional level as the results in dane county and milwaukee differed considerably despite being in the same state we further found keeping a high level of adherence after easing social distancing measures has a major impact on the number of cases implying that cities and regions should strongly encourage the community to maintain behaviors that reduce the transmissibility of sars-cov-2 such as wearing masks the accuracy of covam for predicting the current outbreak and its ability to estimate the impact of easing social distancing measures at the regional level demonstrates its unique value for informing current and future policies our findings clearly show that one-size-fits-all strategies are suboptimal and that context- and region-specific policies are needed when considering implementing and easing social distancing measures some opponents of stay-at-home policies are motivated by the prospects of achieving herd immunity as a reason for easing current social distancing measures that are in place25 however herd immunity is only possible if infection with sars-cov-2 results in solid immunity which is unknown at this time moreover the correlates of protective immunity to sars-cov-2 have yet to be identified25 in the absence of this understanding social distancing is the most effective tool to prevent further spread of sars-cov-2 to date social distancing measures and adherence to those measures have resulted in halting exponential growth in the daily case counts of covid-19 however sars-cov-2 continues to spread and major cities and urban communities in the us have yet to return to pre-exponential growth levels of transmission covam demonstrates that premature easing of social distancing measures and adherence to these measures will result in rapid return to exponential growth of covid-19 cases and negate progress made to date in slowing the spread of sars-cov-2 in communities managing the healthcare capacities of health systems and preventing larger numbers of deaths our study has limitations most of which are due to limited available data and uncertainty regarding sars-cov-2 we make simplifying assumptions such as asymptomatic patients transmit the disease at the same rate as symptomatic patients and weather does not affect sars-cov-2 transmissibility whereas several studies suggest otherwise2627 furthermore covam uses adherence to social distancing as a proxy for several factors contributing to the disease transmission including fewer close contacts due to limited travel and precautions that prevent transmission during a close contact such as wearing masks therefore covam may not be accurately estimating the impact of personal precautions on transmission to overcome this limitation we assumed a high level of adherence after the easing of social distancing measures to provide a conservative estimate on the effect of easing social distancing measures there are also several limitations related to the modeling approach our calibration procedure used a simple trial-error approach as opposed to a full-scale calibration in which all possible combinations of the input parameter values within a plausible range are tested28 due to the computational intensity of a more formal and detailed calibration procedure our calibration process may have not identified the best parameter combinations to represent the pandemic additionally we used mean parameter estimates instead of probability distributions for input parameters to reduce computational time although we do not expect this simplification to substantively change our results in conclusion our model demonstrates that the delayed implementation lower adherence to and premature easing of social distancing generally result in increased cases of covid-19 in urban areas of the us the magnitude of impact however varies significantly by region these findings highlight the importance of region-specific considerations and ideally modeling as inputs to making policy decisions for a given region  police stress mental health and resiliency during the covid-19 pandemic john stogner bryan miller lee kyle mclean   covid-19 refers to the infectious disease that results from a novel coronavirus that was not identified until an outbreak in wuhan china in december of 2019 pathogens in the coronavirus family may cause acute respiratory infections and difficulty breathing the illness resulting from the novel coronavirus covid-19 is marked by respiratory symptoms congestion cough difficulty breathing as well as hyperthermia and exhaustion covid-19 effects seem to be exacerbated by underlying conditions such as hypertension diabetes and cardiopathy at the time of writing covid-19 has infected over 6 million people including 17 million in the united states who 2020 covid-19 has spread quickly as interpersonal transmission can occur through respiratory droplets and contaminated surfaces as a result many jurisdictions have enacted stay-at-home orders limited work to essential functions and created social distancing directives these decisions have seemingly slowed the spread of covid-19 still over 350000 have died due to complications connected to the illness including over 100000 americans who 2020 these figures are projected to double by the end of july 2020 the 2020 covid-19 pandemic impact on policing strategies and mental health in criminal justice settings is matched in magnitude by only a limited number of events in the past century as research on covid-19 and the interrelated public policy and health ramifications of both the disease and the coordinated response is still in its infancy reference to earlier crises that significantly altered law enforcement practices namely the start of the hiv epidemic in the 1980s and the attacks of september 11 2001 provide reference context these previous large-scale distressing events affected perceptions of safety job stress and standard practices of law enforcement officers including the need to address traumatized members of the public the covid-19 pandemic is likely to also affect these domains but the form of those effects may be distinct per the unknown nature and already comparatively longer duration of the pandemic than some prior national traumatic events one of the closest analogies to the current law enforcement climate is the spread of hiv in the 1980s while hiv is manageable today uncertainty reigned three decades ago law enforcement officers were tasked with enforcing policies in an environment of misunderstood risk flavin 1998 describes a pervasive fear of hiv among officers who generally overestimated their occupational risk a perceived inability to manage hiv risk intensified fear jermier gaines  mcintosh 1989 officers of that era had limited and evolving information about transmission leinen 1993 much like those policing during the height of covid-19 perhaps law enforcement officers today are not dissuaded from assisting injured citizens proximate to the prior fear of contracting hiv but encounters with the public no doubt generate similar stress as reports already describe officers dying after contracting covid-19 thompson and marquarts 1998 study indicated that hiv risk was a significant stressor among law enforcement officers although training diminished these concerns while robinson sigman and wilson 1997 suggest it may have contributed to ptsd among officers assuming policing prior to heightened understanding of hiv serves as a valid analogy for law enforcement stress during covid-19 it is clear that an exploration of how covid-19 has affected officer stress and behavior is warranted similarly officers may benefit from increased resources directed towards assisting them and their family with stress management during this time of crisis the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 also may serve as reference for how broader world issues impact officer stress throughout the country following the attack on the world trade center and the pentagon numerous police and other first responders risked their safety and rushed into unknown danger to assist the public similar results from samples of these heroes indicate mental health concerns resulted from this service one-third of the officers responding from the arlington county police department reported significantly heightened post-traumatic stress disorder ptsd symptoms years after responding to the pentagon robbers  jenkins 2005 over 20 of new york responders reported ptsd symptoms with 54 reaching diagnostic thresholds over four years after the attack 40 of these officers reported needing mental healthcare pietrzak et al 2012 suicidal ideation among officers also increased violanti castellano orourke  paton 2006 however that days event affected stress levels of officers beyond these locations studies demonstrate increases in police stress in other cities in the year following the incident as well as a shifting of perceived major sources of stress whereas data collected prior to 911 reported that harming a civilian and the safety of fellow officers were prime concernsstresses data from similar respondents collected a year after 911 indicated that police felt dealing with terrorist or hate groups and being prepared for riots were foremost among their concerns stevens 2004 further the attacks prompted numerous organizational changes within police forces which exacerbated stress marks  sun 2007 terrorist threats may not on the surface appear an apt comparison for a viral pathogen like covid-19 but the psychological connection is clear both are invisible dangers officers can no more see the intention of citizens than they can sars-cov-2 which causes covid-19 in each case threats can come from anywhere  the person with the bulging backpack standing in front of the museum could be carrying a bomb or the person clearing their throat could be showing the initial signs of a covid-19 infection each concern requires hypervigilance as one exposure or one missed threat can be deadly for a large number of citizens in each situation there has been distrust for organizations providing data police viewed limited information from federal sources as a source of stress following the 911 attacks stevens 2004 and the integrity of the centers for disease control and prevention and the world health organization have been challenged during the covid-19 pandemic this analogy also provides context to expect that the covid-19 pandemic may disproportionately affect stress levels of women in law enforcement as large gender differences in police stress resulted from 911 bowler et al 2010 it also suggests that strong social integration may minimize occupational stress and mental health issues resulting from covid-19 as officers that were better connected to others were less affected by terrorist threats and showed greater resiliency schwarzer bowler  cone 2014 reactions of the law enforcement community to covid-19 thus far have been near ubiquitous efforts were made to procure and utilize protective personal equipment ppe and officers have encouraged and enforced social distancing depending on the size of the agency and the available resources police departments have marked off briefing rooms with spots for officers to sit six feet away from each other or even held briefings outside  where the virus is thought to be less likely to spread discretion when dealing with the public is at a premium as is avoiding physical proximity in situations where a response or arrest can be avoided for example many urban agencies have instructed officers to conduct fewer traffic stops and avoid unnecessary interpersonal interactions mohler et al 2020 overall calls for service may have slightly decreased during the height of the covid-19 pandemic campedelli aziani  favarin 2020 mohler et al 2020 but certain offenses have been increasingly reported including vandalism and domestic violence mohler et al 2020 as well as theft of medical equipment hulett 2020 though service calls may have decreased per shelter-in-place guidelines the burden on individual officers ostensibly increases as indicated by over 1000 virus cases within the nypd - 15 of the workforce reporting being sick and unavailable to serve abc 2020 in addition to carrying the burden for stricken colleagues covid-19 presented officers with novel and exacerbated stressors first they were expected to implement new policies to ensure social distancing while stay-at-home directives were challenged on political economic and legal grounds as the agents of new and unpopular restrictions officers may have experienced additional anxiety and disapproval from the citizenry served shirzad abbasi farajzadeh hosseini zijoud  farnoosh 2020 second they were required to adapt existing practices to virus reality community and offender programs service call responses and patrol practices had to be adapted to limit exposure and ensure enough officers remained healthy to maintain public safety these adaptations oft centered on limiting interpersonal contact potentially created cognitive dissonance in instances where officers avoided serving the public or making a minor arrest to limit their own exposure third agencies clearly suffered from shortages in ppe panic following covid-19s spread cleared masks gloves sanitizer and other needed supplies from inventory officers likely experienced stress through the limited availability of ppe or by using items they understood to be needed by the general public the lack of these resources per the extension of the logic of a general resource shortfall is more problematic in disadvantaged rural areas fourth the covid-19 pandemic itself was a traumatic event presenting consistent risk of bodily harm and requiring officers to be increasingly hypervigilant of their own environment the daily exposure to stress safety protocols and social distancing policies may have limited their capacity to engage in positive coping strategies the threat of covid-19 and the challenges of social distancing policies presents a particular problem for small rural law enforcement agencies these groups have fewer resources and are less likely to employ individuals that specialize in health policy mental health management and information distribution to guide both the workforce and population it serves through the pandemic large urban agencies have partnered together to share information during the coronavirus pandemic through the police executive research forums perf daily covid-19 reports httpswwwpoliceforumorgcoronavirusdaily and resources like the american society for evidence-based policings asebp covid portal for sharing response strategies and new policies httpswwwamericansebpcovidorg while rural agencies can also gain access to these resources their smaller size means they are less likely to have officers with connections to these organizations law enforcement training in rural agencies is also likely less dynamic and adaptive to developing needs larger workforces allow training that has smaller incremental costs and there is specialization of activities thus an emerging issue like the need to adapt to a global viral pandemic is likely to put a disproportionate strain on officers in rural jurisdictions with ritualistic agency culture their organizational size limits leverage for acquiring resources such as personal protective equipment and tools to enforce social distancing protocols further it may hinder the resiliency and the adaptation of existing programs to the evolving needs of citizens during windows of social upheaval the pandemic paired with limited training and resources to deal with its consequences are likely to have an extensive and long-term impact on rural law enforcement officer mental health while rural jurisdictions may lack the resources and specialized work forces that can assist with reactivity to a threat like covid-19 urban areas are disproportionately the site of protests riots and social unrest during a period of extreme stress tension related to stay-at-home orders escalated throughout the early stages of the pandemic with many citizens becoming concerned about the financial repercussions of lockdowns large groups descended on state capitals and other large cities to protest for the opportunity to work and earn an income this created a demand for law enforcement to manage potentially violent groups without curtailing their first amendment rights ensuring safety during large scale protest is generally a stressful challenge but is enhanced during a viral pandemic law enforcement was responsible for both providing a presence to deter violent and unruly behavior but also to encourage social distancing and use of face masks and other protective wearan unprecedented dual responsibility further racial tension towards police escalated during the pandemic due to the deaths of breonna taylor and george floyd at the hands of officers in kentucky and minnesota respectively urban centers drew crowds protesting rioting and looting officers in large agencies became both the focus of acrimony and responsible for ensuring unruly crowds safety from a viral threat while not intended to describe the behavior of police slocums 2010 exploration of behavioral continuity in the context of strain theories provides a framework for how the covid-19 may influence officer stress mental health and performance long after any vaccine is introduced first slocum 2010 describes the negative impact of past and existing stressors on individuals ability to deal with new stressors and challenges a reasonable inference would be that officers dealing with stressors associated with covid-19 response are less ready to deal with new stressors while covid-19 policing stressors may impair officers functions from a psychological perspective the omnipresent stress of policing during an uncertain pandemic is likely to impact neurotransmitter and stress hormone levels resulting in increased susceptibility to stress and overreactions eg fishbein 2001 put simply dealing with evolving regulations ever-changing departmental policies enforcing unpopular shutdowns and the fear of contracting covid-19 likely diminish officers ability to deal with the numerous other stresses that characterize their profession second slocums 2010 stress proliferation arguments can be applied to covid-19 policing in both primary and secondary forms dealing with covid-related demands and uncertainty itself presents as a source of stress but also clearly exacerbates other job stressors that may impact mental health dealing with an unruly citizen becomes increasingly challenging due to social distancing expectations and protective gear another example of primary proliferation is covid-19 affecting shift schedules and work rotations in an atypical manner meant to minimize the chance of numerous officers being infected at once when inconsistent work schedules already serve as a significant source of officer stress and fatigue secondary stress proliferation also likely occurs in situations where covid-19 policing precautions affect family life officers exposed to the public may have chosen to avoid extended contact with family in case they contracted covid-19 and be limited in their options to cope with stress in the manner they did prior to covid-19 thus covid-19 policing potentially impacts officer stress in domains outside of the work intensifying the potential need for stress management and mental health assistance while covid-19s largest impact on policing has likely been on organizational protocols and officer mental health the stress endured during the pandemic has likely had a deleterious effect on officer productivity efficiency and ability to perform social outreach functions moon and jonson 2012 indicate that officer stress is inversely linked to job commitmentthose that experience more job-related stress are less committed to their position as a law enforcement officers wolfe rojek manjarrez and rojek 2018 similarly found that uncertainty over the future of policing was a significant factor in understanding officers job satisfaction an extended increase in stress as well as uncertainty surrounding the future of policing during the covid-19 pandemic likely impacted the dedication and resiliency of current officers further job stressors directly impact performance indicators shane 2010 suggesting that covid-19 may have impaired some officers ability to respond to calls for service it remains to be seen whether the pandemic will result in increased officer turnover but as extant research points to stressors facilitating burnout among officers russell cole  jones iii 2014 it is likely jurisdictions will employ a less experienced workforce in the upcoming years acknowledging the potential relationship between covid-related officer stress and productivity performance is further impacted by safety protocols that limit interaction or simply require officers attention each moment that officers spend stocking preparing donning and discarding personal protective equipment is a moment that is not spent completing essential functions equipment may impair field of vision breathing and grip on objects hindering officer functions the expectation that uniformed officers will encourage social distancing and enforce lockdown directives requires time that distracts from other obligations as such performance measures such as clearance rates may suffer during the covid-19 pandemic in addition to reduced police productivity we are likely to see more incidents of police misconduct by the nature of the occupation police officers must uphold high standards of ethical behavior but police misconduct is associated with increases in organizational stressors bishopp worrall  piquero 2016 these are likely to increase during the uncertainty and increased protocols during a pandemic furthering these challenges police officers are the face of the government on the street that is they are likely the only direct representative of the government and its laws that many people interact with as community tensions have increased and citizens voice greater resistance to stay-at-home mandates and business restrictions police officers are forced to deal with implementing unpopular rules that they did not create one of the more stressful roles assumed by law enforcement is crowd control in an unplanned and unrehearsed situation while a planned political function with detailed organization may not introduce large amounts of stress on officers a more chaotic event without clear boundaries drills and for which citizens have no awareness of normative procedures is likely to be seen as extremely stressful garbarino et al 2012 sporting celebrations unforeseen weather emergencies and riots each present challenges that accumulate stress on officers and may encourage or facilitate misconduct the stress-creating unknown and unrehearsed nature of these events was compounded by the lack of precedentprotests of social distancing and shutdown orders are unlike any other of the modern era groups assembling to vie for their right to interact with others were violating orders that regulated assembly and group size additionally due to the stated position of these protests most ignored best practices for reducing the spread of covid-19 by not leaving six feet of distance between themselves and police officers as well as not wearing a mask in one iconic photo a protestor at the state capitol in michigan leans in and screams in the face of two michigan state police officers it is easy to see how these officers would be stressed that in performing their duties they were potentially exposing themselves to the virus police were forced to adapt to protect protestors from their compatriots viral loads while large protests were common in larger cities they also appeared in other areas across the country in the form of challenges to governmental directives eg non-essential business remaining openreopening in opposition to state mandates further exacerbating officer stress was the aforementioned protests of racial injustice directly following those focused on governmental intrusion into business just as general strain theory predicts that individuals placed under severe strain will respond with maladaptive coping mechanisms such as crime officers facing continued stress through repeated protests and potential viral exposure coupled with serving in the low control environment that characterized by rioting may engage in maladaptive deviant behaviors in the form of police misconduct officers targeted as a result of other officers behavior or governmental lockdowns are likely to feel angry and act to protect themselves some organizational strains can be reduced by administrators but increased community tension and the fear and uncertainty related to covid-19 creates additional stress and opportunities to engage in problematic coping behaviors and misconduct police misconduct has been the focus of researchers and policy makers prior to covid-19 and additional efforts to reduce stress and increase training to promote ethical conduct have already been implemented by a number of agencies for example there are some police training programs designed to combat ethical violations and promote officer wellbeing to address widespread corruption and misconduct the new orleans police department nopd created the ethical policing is courageous epic peer intervention program which encourages active bystandership with the goal of reducing negative behaviors and officer misconduct in the nopd aronie  lopez 2017 morgan murphy  horwitz 2017 staub 2019 the main focus of the training is to encourage active bystander peers to step in when officers first start down a path of deviance staub 2018 staub 2019 this intervention is intended to encourage officers to stop their fellow officer from engaging in misconduct that could potentially cost their job and erode public trust in the police department additionally the training also focuses on wellbeing to encourage prosocial coping mechanisms and active bystandership can help to reduce alcohol abuse and other unhealthy habits resulting in a positive impact on officers mental health although this training is promising and could help stem misconduct and increased stress caused by a pandemic it has yet to be evaluated several initiatives have been undertaken to improve officer mental health which continues to be a funding priority for the national institute of justice among the promising avenues for improving mental health are programs that target organizational fairness officers routinely report treatment at the hands of command staff and immediate supervisors as a primary source of stress in policing brown  campbell 1990 collins  gibbs 2003 crank  caldero 1991 furthermore in the face of increasing uncertainty improved treatment at the hands of supervisors can improve police officers job satisfaction wolfe et al 2018 thus programs that improve leaderships ability to increase fairness in the workplace should have positive effects on officers mental health and job satisfaction other methods of improving officer mental health include programs that encourage officers to positively cope through activities such as yoga and meditation eg tactical yoga yoga for first responders and cop to yoga other programs have encouraged officers to talk to therapists regarding the mental strain of policing however these programs are often criticized as the hyper-masculine culture of policing discourages officers to seek external help accordingly programs that target positive scoping skills from within the department or through peer networks is often recommended as officers continue to deal with the stress of potential viral exposure of the coming months it will be important for departmental leadership to reduce stress as much as possible and for officers to identify positive coping strategies resilience is the ability to withstand adapt to and recover from adversity and stress and return to a positive state of mental health and well-being through coping strategies us department of health  human services 2015 resiliency requires a holistic approach to wellness with a focus on the body mind and spirit goerling 2012 police officers are often exposed to a variety of life-threatening experiences including natural disasters accidents fires and violent crimes arnetz nevedal lumley backman  lublin 2009 these events can have a detrimental impact on first responders and result in mental health problems and ptsd hartley et al 2011 even more challenging if the traumatic circumstance isnt a singular event but daily reinforced occupational stress over time due to a prolonged crisis resiliency becomes a sustained process to try and maintain healthy prosocial behaviors there is evidence that police training has the potential to promote resilience and reduce stress for example in an experimental design police training prior to critical incident police work simulations found through biomarkers and self-report evaluations that officers who received prior training had significantly less negative mood less heart rate reactivity a larger increase in antithrombin and better performances than those without prior training arnetz et al 2009 although this training showed a physical reduction in stress and benefits in the short run long term benefits were not assessed covid-19 will have long lasting impacts on society and police departments will likely have to permanently alter some policing protocols as a result as people start getting out in public more police departments will need to reestablish community relationships and develop strategies to deal with individuals who have been economically impacted and address increased mental health issues in the general population a strong focus on community policing and crisis intervention training will be essential in successful post-pandemic policing a global crisis like the covid-19 pandemic undoubtedly affected law enforcement practices and the mental health of law enforcement officers as such it is critical to quantify the scope of these impacts in order to justify and properly target the provision of resources that allow agencies and individuals to weather the storm further an understanding of covid-19 effects will enable a more informed response to future crises in order to retain law enforcement effectiveness and avoid detrimental effects on law enforcement mental health while covid-related precautions are being labeled the new normal it is imperative that steps be taken to ensure that pandemic worsened job stress levels not become the new normal for law enforcement officers we offer a number of recommendations for researchers to help understand this phenomenon first the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on officer stress must be quantified as the events of 2020 were unforeseen it was impossible for researchers to have planned a longitudinal study of the pandemics effects beginning before its onset as such it is necessary to replicate data collected on law enforcement stress mental health and performance before the pandemic care must be taken to ensure a comparable sample or to draw data from the same sampling frame within such studies it is not only relevant to determine if an event increased law enforcement stress but also if it shifted the source of job-related stressors eg stevens 2004 additionally stress in other life domains as well as healthy and unhealthy coping should be quantified as major stressors as the covid-19 response may proliferate into other areas of officers lives slocum 2010 second identification of officer characteristics and behaviors linked to successful coping following this traumatic event is key certain psychological traits or skills developed during trainings related to mental health may have empowered more positive responses to stressors the provision of similar training programs may assist other officers in dealing with future unforeseen pandemics while awareness of traits linked to successful stress responses may provide insight in hiring processes more importantly the identification of characteristics linked to less effective management of covid-related stress may assist departments in directing resources towards their officers in most need of mental health services third studies should focus on agency responses to the covid-19 pandemic while numerous studies of this type are likely underway the general focus is likely on physical health issues and response to calls for service an understanding of how law enforcement groups looked to protect their own members mental health during a time of crisis is needed so that the actions of successful agencies can be replicated by others across the country in addition to researching the impact of covid-19 on officer wellbeing this information should be utilized to adapt and develop future training protocols to help first responders and police officers in the wake of this unprecedented situation it is likely that many agencies were caught unprepared for the mental stress that their officers would experience however with scientists already discussing second waves and future outbreaks now is the time to prepare officers for these situations in our view this requires two primary paths forward for policing agencies 1 departments must focus on being logistically prepared for viral outbreaks through the stockpiling of ppe and the development of emergency plans for how to police during a pandemic and 2 departments must provide officers with training to improve skills for positive coping in the face of extreme stress as noted above uncertainty can be a major source of stress by ensuring that the department is logistically prepared for an outbreak with ppe and plans for altering policing strategies in future pandemics officers should experience less uncertainty and less stress furthermore while it is impossible to completely remove stress from these types of situations providing training on positive coping skills should help officers to deal with the stress they do face without the side effects of increased burnout poor mental health and unhealthy behaviors such as alcoholism  coronavirus on social media analyzing misinformation in twitter conversations a preprint karishma sharma sungyong seo chuizheng meng sirisha rambhatla yan liu  the ongoing coronavirus disease covid-19 pandemic highlights the interconnected-ness of our present-day globalized world with social distancing policies in place virtual communication has become an important source of misinformation as increasing number of people rely on social media platforms for news identifying misinformation has emerged as a critical task in these unprecedented times in addition to being malicious the spread of such information poses a serious public health risk to this end we design a dashboard to track misinformation on popular social media news sharing platform -twitter the dashboard provides visibility into the social media discussions around coronavirus and the quality of information shared on the platform updated over time we collect streaming data using the twitter api from march 1 2020 to date and identify false misleading and clickbait contents from collected tweets we provide analysis of user accounts and misinformation spread across countries in addition we provide analysis of public sentiments on intervention policies such as socialdistancing and workfromhome and we track topics and emerging hashtags and sentiments over countries the dashboard maintains an evolving list of misinformation cascades sentiments and emerging trends over time accessible online at httpsusc-meladygithubiocovid-19-tweet-analysis  as social media becomes the primary source of information for people around the world it has become increasingly critical and challenging to curb misinformation according to pew research report social media outpaced print

surrounding covid-19 pandemic is especially damaging since any mis-steps can pose a serious public health risk by leading to exponential spread of the disease and accidental death due to self-medication vigdor 2020 accessed march 24 2020  the risk of misinformation surrounding the pandemic has motivated the world health organization who to launch a mythbuster page who 2020 accessed march 20 2020  however these counter measures face challenges with the fast-paced evolution and spread of news on social media as a result it is extremely important to identify and potentially curb the spread of misinformation as close as possible to its point of origin to this end we present a dashboard to provide insights about the nature of information that is currently shared through social media regarding the covid-19 pandemic the dashboard provides an analysis of topics sentiments and trends assessed from twitter posts along with identified false misleading and clickbait information spreading on social media related to covid-19 here we focus our analysis on twitter since it has the highest number of news focused users hughes and wojcik 2019 accessed march 20 2020 and provides access to public tweets data social media plays a pivotal role in information dissemination and consumption during the pandemic godfrey 2020 accessed april 20 2020  more so with increasing social distancing and growing reliance on online communication social media has both positive and negative social impacts during the crisis for instance safety tips such as wash your hands and stay home are shared widely to gain community support in fighting the covid-19 pandemic godfrey 2020 accessed april 20 2020  on the other hand misinformation and hate speech are growing problems that can adversely impact the safety of individuals and society the indirect and direct impacts such as instances of 5g towers being burned down due to conspiracy theories linking them to coronavirus parveen and waterson 2020 accessed april 17 2020 make it imperative to address the problem of misinformation in this work we attempt to analyze both the positive and negative aspects of social media during the pandemic and utilize computational techniques to process information shared on social media related to covid-19 we collect twitter conversations from march 1 2020 to date and provide analysis results on the dashboard the purpose of the dashboard is to provide transparency into twitter conversations surrounding the pandemic which is an important step towards curbing misinformation and increasing awareness about the overall nature and quality of information being consumed towards this end we use topic modeling to identify prominent topics from social media posts on covid-19 we also extract emerging hashtags in each country over time to understand the evolution of conversations as the pandemic situation changes in a given region or in association to important events or occasions that are impacted by the pandemic in addition we utilize social media posts to understand the sentiments over time in each countryregion we also leverage sentiment analysis to estimate the public perception on twitter towards policies related to social distancing and work from home towards the goal of curbing misinformation we extract information cascades on social media -that correspond to the sharing of news articles through retweetsreplies on twitter and identify misinformation cascades based on the source information in this work we define misinformation to include four types of information namely unreliable conspiracy clickbait and politicalbiased each of these types can have negative societal impact on public health intervention policies and elections in addition we analyze user accounts and activities to characterize the nature of spread on misinformation on social media the dashboard provides the list of misinformation cascades identified from march 1 2020 to date and misinformation spread across countries for prominent cascades the research on misinformation analysis related to healthcare and pandemics is important and understudied this work on covid-19 aims to provide new insights and analysis on social media and misinformation related to global crisis and pandemics in the following sections we will discuss the data collection analysis and results and future work we collect social media posts on twitter using the streaming api service starting from march 1 2020 to date we use keywords related to covid-19 to filter the twitter stream and obtain relevant tweets about the pandemic the dataset from march 1 2020 to march 30 2020 contains 308m tweets from 182 countries the subset of english tweets equals 205m the data collection is ongoing and will be used to update the analysis on the dashboard dataset statistics table 1 provides details about the tweets collected and the user accounts associated with the tweets the english tweets are utilized for further analysis and therefore the table reports the details about what fraction of english tweets contains geolocation information and count of unique user accounts associated with the tweets as well as the percentage of twitter verified accounts among those user accounts geolocation we obtain geolocation information at the country-level based on dredze et al 2013  the extracted geolocation based on dredze et al 2013 is not always available the information is available if the user has geo-enabled feature on twitter or if the user mentions a valid location in his public profile based on the extracted geolocation information we provide the distribution of english tweets among countries and states in the united states in table 2  misinformation forms an important aspect of our online world due to social distancing measures the reliance on information available online has become critical to address this challenge we identify misinformation and provide the list of identified posts propagating such information on the dashboard the task of distinguishing legitimate vs false misleading and clickbait content is challenging from both a human and machine perspective in fact this increases the importance of eliminating such information from social media platforms because the general public is easily manipulated into believing false information which in this case can be detrimental to public health and have dire consequences vigdor 2020 accessed march 24 2020  parveen and waterson 2020 accessed april 17 2020  misinformation detection poses new challenges in the domain of healthcare and pandemics there are numerous existing datasets on misinformation sharma et al 2019  labeled based on information collected from fact-checking websites the existing labeled datasets are either on general events reported during a period in time ma et al  2018  or domain specific events such as the syrian civil war or hurricane sandy salem et al 2019  gupta et al 2013  we focus on building a domain specific dataset on covid-19 to provide real-time identification of misinformation on the pandemic and in the future to improve research in misinformation analysis related to healthcare and pandemics information cascades in order to identify misinformation we first extract retweetreply links between tweets using the twitter api we found 19m edges ie retweetreply links between the 20m english tweets collected between march 1-30 2020 we cluster the retweet graph to identify source tweets propagating or being shared over the social network of the 19m tweets 217m are identified as source tweets and 172k have at least 10 retweets each source tweet has associated tweet text and user account features as well as the propagation related information available in the form of retweets and reply tweets the source tweet along with its propagation information is referred to as an information cascade yang and leskovec 2010  in this work we focus on identifying the list of misinformation cascades from the collected dataset detection misinformation is defined to incorporate false and misleading information of varying degrees of falsehood sharma et al 2019  disinformation more specifically refers to false information with a deliberate intent whereas misinformation is defined to include false information which might not have a deliberate malicious intent however varying degrees of falsehood and varying intents such as promotion of clickbait and political influence make it important to expose different kinds of malicious information therefore we construct four categories of information which can have negative societal impact and use the term misinformation to broadly encompass the four categories categorization we categorize information into four types -unreliable conspiracy clickbait and politicalbiased using news sources compiled from fact-checking websites namely media biasfact check 1  and list of news websites provided in zimdars 2016  we define the categories as follows  unreliable this category is defined to include false questionable rumorous and misleading news in addition we include satire based on the consideration that satire has the potential to perpetuate misinformation zimdars 2016 or be used as a cover for misinformation publication sharma et al 2019   conspiracy this category is defined to include conspiracy theories and scientifically dubious news  clickbait this category includes clickbait news ie exaggerated or misleading headlines andor body purposed to attract attention for reliable andor unreliable information  politicalbiased this category includes political and biased news written in support of a particular point of view or political orientation for reliable andor unreliable information such as propaganda note that a tweet can belong to more than one of the above mentioned categories as can multiple types be associated with a news source to label tweets we identify source tweets that contain external links to news articles using tweet metadata based on the news article links we extract the news source publisher information similar to  we construct labels for each source tweet containing external links based on the news source information misinformation during pandemics can impact public health intervention policies and future elections therefore we maintain separate categories of unreliable conspiracy clickbait politicalbiased and provide the list of source tweets identified under each category on the dashboard in the future we will update our analysis to include detection based on source and social context information extracted from the network the 625m user accounts engaging in twitter conversations from march 1-30 2020 in the collected dataset are studied to provide information about the spread of covid-19 related tweets we extract user account features using the twitter api the account creation date provides important information about the engagement of users on the social network discussion in figure 2  the distribution of user accounts with respect to the account creation date is visualized the user accounts engaging in covid-19 tweets include accounts created between 2006 to 2020 ie from when the twitter platform was introduced to date the trend shows a spikeincrease between december 2019 and march 2020 new accounts tweeting about covid-19 provides information about the changing social network structure during the pandemic in the future we will investigate the activity patterns of new user accounts to identify the role or function they play in either dissemination of useful information about the pandemic or towards misinformation propagation the misinformation spread across countries for sample tweets identified from the collected dataset is shown in figure 5  the figure shows the information cascade corresponding to each source tweet the points indicate the retweet or replies of the source tweet over the time scale tweets containing geolocation information are visualized based on the extracted latitude and longitude information the identified misinformation in the four categories -unreliable conspiracy clickbait and politicalbiased were found to contain both healthcare and political misinformation we provide and discuss examples of source tweets and their propagation patterns across countries discussion in fig 3a  a false claim circulated about nevada governors chief medical officer banning the use of hydroxychloroquine treatments was seen to circulate through social media in this case the observed geolocation of source tweet is in the united states the country with the highest twitter usage and it propagates to other countries within minutes in other cases source tweets are also observed to originate from other countries and travel to united states and other countries for example in fig 3b  for a false claim that the virus was found to transmit through toilet paper the source tweet geolocation was observed in australia with retweets traveling to several other countries in cases where the geolocation information of the source tweet is unobserved the geolocation of other tweets in the information cascade still provides estimates of the exposure and spread in different countries of the misinformation claims propagated through the source tweet for instance in fig 4a the spread of the conspiracy promoting that the virus is a bioweapon is observed over multiple countries whereas in fig 4b the spread of the claim that the pandemic is less deadly than the flu is observed within the united states misinformation of varying degree of falsehood and biasedclickbait news reporting can mislead and influence public perception especially with widespread propagation we observe that the largest cascade in the collected dataset has over 10 000 retweets spanning multiple countries shown in fig 5a it corresponds to a political clickbait news article published on the discussion surrounding affordability and price control on vaccines being researched for the virus we also find other cases of political misinformation with false claims regarding political figures maliciously attempting to worsen the crisis as shown in fig 5b  as seen these cases of misinformation have the potential to harm public health and effectiveness of health intervention policies country-wise sentiments we analyze the evolving country-wise sentiments related to the covid-19 pandemic the public perceptions constitute an important factor for gauging the reactions to policy decisions and preparedness efforts in addition they also reflect the nature of news coverage and potential misinformation we extract sentiments from social media posts at the country-level and over time to study the evolving public perceptions towards the pandemic using lexical sentiment extraction based on hutto and gilbert 2014 we obtain the valence positive or negative along with its intensity for each tweet based on its textual information the sentiment is aggregated over tweets to estimate the overall sentiment distribution the distribution of sentiments was found to vary over time and country social distancingwork from home sentiments in addition we analyze the public perception of emerging policies such as social distancing and remote work these disease mitigation strategies also provide unprecedented glimpse into the effect of remote work and isolation on mental health although the option to work remotely is limited to the white collar workforce nevertheless absence of child and dependent-care has emerged as an important challenge furthermore this forced remote work will impact workdays of white collar workers beyond the pandemic in order to understand public sentiment and opinion about different social issues we extract hashtag information from the collected tweets and filter based on keywords workfromhome wfm workfromhome workingfromhome wfhlife and socialdistance socialdistancing the filtered tweets are analyzed to obtain positive and negative sentiments and ranked and visualized based on valence and intensity the analysis is shown in fig 6 for sentiments on social distancing and on work from home policy interventions topic clusters we analyze twitter conversations to identify topics and trends in the twitter data on covid-19 we use topic modeling based on character embeddings joulin et al 2016 extracted from social media posts nguyen et al 2015 li et al 2016  we identified 20 different topics from the collected english tweets we found that the prominent topics of discussions during early march were centered around global outbreaks wuhan italy iran travel restrictions prevention measures such as hand washing and masks hoarding symptoms and infections immunization event cancellations testing kits and centers government response and emergency funding the topic clusters along with the most representative tweets in each cluster are provided on the dashboard the representative tweets of each cluster are obtained based on word similarity of the tweet to the tf-idf word distribution of the cluster the label to each cluster of tweets was assigned by manual inspection of the word distribution and representative tweets of the cluster emerging trends the emerging trend on twitter highlight changes in perception or importance of topics as the pandemic situation changes we extract hashtags from the tweet text for all tweets in the dataset for march2020 the hashtags with emerging popularity are estimated based on fitted linear regression curves on the usage counts of hashtags over the period on the dashboard fig 7 fig 8  we provide the top-30 emerging hashtags to show trendy interest in social media over the world as the hashtags also reflect spatial characteristics eg country-level policy or trend the top-10 emerging hashtags of each country for last 10 days are also visualized on the dashboard and regularly updated the countryregion-based emerging hashtags are particularly important to track peoples interest for instance the line chart in fig 7 shows which hashtags emerged in terms of a slope of usage counts in the united states from march22 to march31 while the use of some hashtags eg coronavirus and trump continuously dominates the conversations other hashtags eg coronalockdown coronavirustruth and nationaldoctorsday are temporally significant the end of march is when most of states announced lockdown on many business and a stayat-home order and it causes people to use lockdown-related hashtags coronalockdown moreover it shows that people get more and more interested in facts on coronavirus finally the slope-based extraction easily detects spike pattern of some hashtags nationaldoctorsday which are only used in a particular day in germany fig 7  we could detect that people are interested in wearing masks maskenpflicht mask required from the end of march in france fig 8 have counted the containment day confinementjour everyday and their patterns show time lags as expected finally the plot is also useful to see what trendy issues are coronajihad nizamuddin in india fig 8  geoinformation trends we also analyze the geographical distribution of daily counts of tweets and its trend using the extracted geolocation information the dashboard provides 1 the geographical distribution of the daily count of tweets over countriesregions 2 the daily increment of the count of tweets for each countryregion 3 the time for each countryregion when it encounters its peak of daily counts of tweets 1 shows a steady distribution of daily counts of tweets users in united states contribute more than half of the total daily counts of tweets around the world and users in europe india oceania and south america are also active 2 reveals that the daily counts of tweets of most countriesregions are steady during the time of our observation 3 illustrates the spatio-temporal pattern of which day each countryregion achieves it highest activity over the observation time period there are several critical directions of future work to address this large-scale infodemic surrounding covid-19 the proportion of twitter users in the united states is higher than in other countries like china with alternate social media platforms since the pandemic is at a global scale social media analysis for other platforms and languages is critical towards curbing misinformation the second important factor is that the annotation for misinformation is a challenging task and requires expert verification therefore research in unsupervised or distant supervision are important towards alternate forms of labeling to improve classification and handle the imbalance in the distribution of misinformation vs legitimate information we also plan to include social context information towards improving misinformation detection in addition we plan to analyze sentiments about other emerging topics and moreover to study the impact of public perception as well as misinformation on policy interventions on curbing the pandemic  testing for covid-19 willful ignorance or selfless behavior linda thunstrm madison ashworth jason shogren f stephen newbold david finnoff   covid-19 rapidly developed into a pandemic and by 26 march 2020 the usa had the highest reported number of infected people in the world a general message from public health experts is that effective control of the spread of covid-19 requires widespread medical testing who 2020 the testing will serve to determine whether people are infected or not and ideally also if they have been infected and have reached immunity status three reasons motivate widespread testing first if a person learns that they are infected they can take appropriate measures to reduce the probability of infecting others such as the recommended 14-day self-isolation harvard medical school 2020 second the data provided by widespread testing will better inform the need for the current social distancing policies eg sheltering at home avoiding gatherings of 10 or more people keeping at least 6 feet away from other people and temporarily closing schools universities daycare centers major sports leagues cultural events and public spaces stock 2020 third testing provides data about the asymptomatic rate in the usa the share of infected people who show no or very mild symptoms and insight into how close americans are to developing herd immunity to covid-19 this information is useful in order to determine when and where it makes sense to relax these costly social distancing measures while the usa has increased its capacity to conduct more testing around 18 of the population had been tested by 30 april 2020 covid tracking project 2020 the effectiveness of testing in controlling covid-19 depends largely on how the tests are conducted the ideal scenario is to test everyone but that is infeasible a second-best scenario is random sample testing stock 2020 but for random testing to be effective all sampled people would either need to voluntarily agree to be tested which is unlikely as we explain or be forced to do so which is illegal in the usa the third-best and first-best feasible strategy is voluntary random testing this strategy however could lead to a systematic selection bias  we will only test those individuals who prefer to learn their health status regarding covid-19 a significant fraction of people might not want to know these individuals might find that their private costs outweigh any social benefits from not infecting others this implies that they might want to avoid testing if their private costs include above-average opportunity costs of social interactions then individuals who decline to be tested may also be disproportionately likely to become super-spreaders to understand why this might happen consider the ongoing literature on willful ignorance of health information also called strategic ignorance while standard economic theory suggests people never ignore information that enables them to adjust behavior stigler 1961 many new studies find that people willfully ignore medical diagnoses even when such knowledge would enable them to adjust behavior to better accommodate their health condition sharot  sunstein 2020 for example we see willful ignorance in many people at risk for breast cancer thompson et al 2002 alzheimers disease cutler  hodgson 2003 hiv hightow et al 2003 and huntingtons disease oster et al 2013 the study by ganguly and tasoff 2017 is particularly relevant they observe people will avoid a costless test for herpes  a disease for which there is currently no cure but for which information is useful in that it helps adjust behavior people have also been found to willfully ignore health risk information such as calories in food thunstrm et al 2016 woolley  risen 2018 sunstein 2019 thunstrm 2019 nordstrm et al 2020 willful ignorance of health outcomes is likely to arise when people are torn between what they think they should do and what they want to do thunstrm 2016 woolley  risen 2018 or when ignorance allows them to form optimal expectations downplay the probability of a bad health outcome oster et al 2013 nordstrm et al 2020 for instance a person may think she should eat healthy but want to indulge in ice-creamshe might then choose to avoid learning about the exact amount of calories in the ice-cream in order to avoid either her inner pressure to reduce the ice-cream consumption or the guilt from consuming it despite being aware of the calorie content in this paper we explore self-selection in covid-19 testing in the usa we examine if people willfully avoid getting tested for covid-19 and if so what individual or household characteristics and circumstances are associated with testing avoidance given that random voluntary testing is not yet available in the usa there are no observational data to rely on for our analysis we therefore design a hypothetical randomized controlled trial rct we recruit a nationally representative sample of 1000 participants the study entails two treatments across which we vary information about the potential emotional cost of testing before asking if participants would agree or disagree to a financially costless covid-19 test in the baseline treatment we inform participants that if they are found to be infected they are urged to self-isolate at home for 14 days in the high-cost treatment we tell participants that those who test positive are strongly urged to self-isolate which may be in a self-quarantine site away from home we assume the test itself is costless and that the only cost incurred from a covid-19 test is the recommended self-isolation for 14 days should the test come back positive if people are concerned only with their private benefits and costs from taking a covid-19 test those with large private benefits and low private costs from knowing that they are infected will be the most likely to get tested private benefits are significant for people at elevated risk for severe health consequences if they contract the virus or with family members at higher risk while private costs are low for those who generally live a solitary life professionally and in private we expect elderly and those who have  or have a family member that has  pre-existing conditions to be more willing to test furthermore we expect those at the lowest risk of losing out financially eg risk to labor income or health care costs or emotionally from self-isolating ie if they are introverts who attach a low value to social interactions to be the most willing to get tested for covid-19 in contrast if people are concerned only with social benefits and costs we would expect those most at risk of exposing others to be the most likely to get tested eg potential super-spreaders ie people with jobs that entail mixing with other people people living in urban areas young people and people who are extroverts and attach a high value to social interactions people with the potential to be super-spreaders might be torn about learning whether they are infected by covid-19 both private costs and social benefits from being urged to self-isolate for the next 14 days harvard medical school 2020 might be high for this group and so influence their testing decision in opposite directions for example consider the behavior of an extrovert who values social interactions highly if unsure of being infected the extrovert behaves just as if she is not infected eg as found for huntingtons disease by oster et al 2013 self-isolation means this person needs to give up highly valued social interactions  a factor that might deter them from a voluntary test for covid-19 at the same time their self-isolation provides particularly meaningful private and social health benefits from reduction in exposure to and spread of the disease these benefits to learning whether they are infected might encourage them to voluntarily test it is an open question if the benefits outweigh the costs causing the extrovert to take a costless covid-19 test similarly imagine a store clerk who risks losing income if self-isolating for 14 days the potential private loss of income would deter them from testing while the social benefits from reducing disease spread would encourage taking the test again the decision to test becomes an open question previous studies show that willful ignorance arises when prosocial behavior is privately costly dana et al 2007 conrads  irlenbusch 2013 onwezen  van der weele 2016 gigerenzer  garcia-retamero 2017 grossman  van der weele 2017 in this study we find that around 70 of people want to take a costless covid-19 test as might be expected people who worry more about their health are particularly likely to want to take the test we also find that those most likely to want to take the test are those most likely to spread the virus if unaware of their infection including young people and extroverts with a preference for socializing extroverts might also be at the highest risk for being infected but even when we control for personal risks amount of social interactions and worry about own health we find they are more willing to test the ability to afford to self-isolate for 14 days does not seem to affect the willingness to test our results suggest that there is a significant amount of selflessness in the decision to test people appear to be highly concerned about the social benefits from testing for covid-19 and little concerned about private costs in addition we do not find the expected treatment effect of our experimental manipulation of the private cost to testing ie the location of self-isolation at home or in a facility away from home does not seem to matter to the testing decision our expectation was that willful ignorance would be higher if self-isolation might take place away from home since we assume self-isolation away from home is perceived as more costly one interpretation of the lack of expected treatment effect is that it lends further support to the idea that private costs play a negligible role in the decision to test for covid-19 our results matter because they underscore the value of widespread covid-19 testing even if such testing cannot be done randomly our findings suggest that widely available and costless voluntary testing will target rather than scare off those most likely to be super-spreaders to test peoples willingness to take a financially costless covid-19 test we designed a hypothetical field experiment the experiment is a rct with a between-subjects design consisting of two treatments in the first treatment treatment baseline participants were told they would be urged to self-isolate at home if having tested positive in the second treatment treatment high cost they were told they might be urged to self-isolate at a special site away from home participants n  1000 were recruited by the research firm qualtrics and the sample was required to be nationally representative along the dimensions of gender age education race income and residential region east west north or south while the recruitment costs from qualtrics are higher than when recruiting from amazon mechanical turk or turk prime qualtrics continuously quality checks participants which enabled us to avoid many issues that may otherwise contaminate online panels eg see chandler  paolacci 2017 sharpe wessling et al 2017 participants received standard qualtrics compensation to participate in a survey the sequence of the experimental study was as follows
step 1 all participants were asked screening questions at the front end of the survey about their gender age education race income and region in order to ensure the sample met us national quotas for those characteristicsstep 2 participants were asked whether they had already been tested for the covid-19 if yes they were asked why they got tested the outcome of the test how many days prior to survey participation they had taken the test and if the test was costly if no they were randomized into one of the two treatments and asked about their willingness to take a test specifically if in treatment baseline they received the following information
currently us authorities are working to test more people for the coronavirus legislators are urging people who test positive ie are found to be infected by the virus to self-isolate at home for 14 daysif in treatment high cost they were instead told
currently us authorities are working to test more people for the coronavirus legislators are urging people who test positive ie are found to be infected by the virus to self-isolate for 14 days some states have started building self-quarantine sites  sites where people who have the virus would be isolated for 14 days if people stay at those sites it is easier to ensure they comply with the guidelines to self-isolatethereafter participants in both treatments were asked
if you were given the opportunity to take a coronavirus test for free within the next 3 days would you take the test default alternatives to get or not get information have been shown to affect observed choices of ignorance grossman 2014 to avoid nudging participants toward any particular answer there was no default alternative participants needed to choose either yes i would take the test or no i would not take the test step 3 all participants were asked about their current level of social distancing how many people outside their household they had been within 6 feet of in the last 3 days how many gatherings with more than 10 people they had participated in and self-assessed level of compliance with social distancing they were also asked whether they supported the public recommendations for social distancing in general step 4 participants were asked questions about factors that might affect the perceived cost of a positive covid-19 test implying social isolation for 14 days as well as the perceived benefits from being able to make behavioral adjustments they were asked about their job situation job security and possibility of the main income provider in the household taking sick leave risk factors for contracting the virus eg living in a urban area working in a health care facility working in a grocery store or pharmacy risk factors for self or any children for suffering severe health consequences if contracting the virus eg underlying health conditions that increases the risk such as cancer obesity diabetes etc level of extraversion francis et al 1992 and social lifestyle step 5 participants were asked about religious belonging religiosity political affiliation and social and fiscal conservatism everett 2013 the full survey can be found in the online supplementary material of our total sample 103 participants stated that they had already been tested while 897 stated that they had not already been tested we asked those who had been tested for the primary reason they had taken the covid-19 test table 1 shows their answers as expected given the current prevailing strategy in the usa of focusing the limited testing on people who are symptomatic most people got tested because they themselves showed symptoms almost 55 or because someone close to them either showed symptoms or was diagnosed with covid-19 around 35 summary statistics for the 103 participants who had been tested before participating in our study are shown in the online supplementary material
 our analysis focuses on the 897 participants who stated that they had not been tested for covid-19 due to a coding error in the survey at the beginning of the data collection seven participants did not respond to the question on whether they were a business owner employed or unemployed we dropped these seven participants from our analysis and we were left with 890 observations table 2 presents the summary statistics for these participants unless otherwise stated all of the remaining analysis focuses on the results for this group of participants
 table 2 shows that 53 of participants who had not yet been tested for covid-19 are female the variable age describes a participants age in years and the mean age in our sample is 47 years the variable high-risk age is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if a person is aged 65 years or older table 2 shows that 16 of our participants are aged 65 years or older the variable rural area takes a value 1 if participants stated that they live in a rural area and 0 if they live in an urban area table 2 shows that 35 of our participants live in a rural area the variables emotional tolerance and financial tolerance are dummy variables that take the value 1 if the participant answered that the maximum time from the time of taking the survey heshe would be able to emotionally or financially sustain social distancing was 14 days or longer given the 14-day recommended time to self-isolate if you test positive for covid-19 these variables take the value 0 if their stated maximum time was 13 days or less table 2 shows that 84 of participants stated that they can afford to continue their current level of social distancing for 14 days or more while 87 stated that they can emotionally tolerate another 14 days or more of their current level of social distancing the variable lifestyle impact  healthy is an index that measures the extent to which social distancing has changed participants behavior in a healthier direction participants were assigned a value 1 for each of the following if they stated that social distancing had a increased consumption of vegetables b decreased in-between-meals snacking excluding fruits and vegetables c increased time spent in green spaces d increased time spent doing strenuous or e moderate exercising and f reduced stress this variable could take a value between 0 and 6 where higher values represent healthier changes the variable lifestyle impact  unhealthy is an index that measures the extent to which social distancing has changed behavior in an unhealthy direction participants were assigned a value 1 for each of the following if they stated that social distancing had a decreased consumption of vegetables b increased in-between-meals snacking excluding fruits and vegetables c decreased time spent in green spaces d decreased time spent doing strenuous or e moderate exercising and f increased stress this variable could also take a value between 0 and 6 where higher values represent a higher number of unhealthy changes the summary statistics in table 2 suggest that social distancing has led to more unhealthy behavior than it has healthy behavior as implied by the lower mean value of lifestyle impact  healthy we note however that these variables are crude measures of the lifestyle impact from social distancing where each change is given equal weight although some changes might have a more important health effect than others1 the variable business impact takes a value 1 if a participant is a business owner whose business has experienced negative impacts due to covid-19 such as their operation losing income going out of business or being at risk of going out of business the variable employer impact takes a value 1 if a participant is an employee and hisher employer has experienced a negative impact due to covid-19 such as their employer losing income or being at risk for going out of business if they had experienced pay cuts reduced working hours or were on unpaid leave as a result of the virus2
table 2 shows that of participants who are business owners or where until a month ago n  89 64 had experienced a negative impact on their business from covid-19 of participants who are employees or were until a month ago n  477 57 had experienced a negative impact on their job security payment or employer revenues the variable social distant compliant  6 feet measures how many people a participant has been close to in the last 3 days participants could state none 1 person 23 people 45 people 69 people 1015 people 1625 people 2650 people or more than 50 people we assigned participants the midpoint of the range they picked for those in the highest range 50 and more we assumed the same size interval as the second to highest interval ie we assumed an endpoint of the last interval equal to 75 people table 2 shows that the average number of people that participants had been close to during the last 3 days besides their household members was 576 although not reported in the table 2 the median was 25 the variable social distant compliant  groups measures how many times during the last 3 days a participant has been in a room with 10 or more people participants could state a value anywhere between zero and 5 or more times the median of this variable is 0 table 2 shows that participants on average had been in a room with 10 or more people around 05 times during the last 3 days the variable self health risk measures the sum of 10 underlying health conditions that would put the participant at higher risk for developing severe health consequences if becoming infected with covid-19 these health conditions include chronic respiratory conditions heart disease neurological conditions diabetes and obesity cdc 2020 the variable child health risk measures the same sum of underlying health conditions for a child in the household the variable worry about own health is based on the stated extent to which participants worry about their own health due to covid-19 where the value 0 indicates not at all and the value 3 indicates a lot the dummy variable insurance takes a value 1 if a participant states that heshe has private health insurance or is covered by medicare or medicaid and 0 if the participant stated not having any coverage table 2 shows that 69 of participants have insurance or medicare or medicaid coverage the dummy variables republican democrat and other political party take a value 1 if a participant identifies as republican democrat or neither and 0 otherwise about 34 of participants identify as republican 43 as democrat and 23 as other the variable extrovert is based on the extraversion scale developed by francis et al 1992 and includes participants answers to questions such as are you a talkative person and can you easily get some life into a rather dull party in addition to the extraversion scale we also asked participants to indicate their level of agreement with statements about their general social lifestyle such as my social life is very important to me and in my spare time my favorite thing to do is to spend time with friends if the participant answered yes to three or more of these questions they were assigned a 1 for the extrovert dummy variable the answers to these statements were however highly correlated with the extraversion scale so they were excluded from our analysis because they provided little or no additional information when we pool participants from both treatments who had not been tested prior to participating in our study n  897 we find that 69 of participants would be willing to take a costless covid-19 test3 we find no difference in shares of participants willing to test across treatments pearson 2 1619 p  0203 suggesting that the location of self-isolation at home or in a facility away from home in the event the test comes back positive is not an important determinant of peoples willingness to test for covid-19 not only is the treatment effect small it is also of the unexpected sign  the share of people willing to test if self-isolation would happen at home is smaller 67 than the share of people willing to test if self-isolation might happen at a facility away from home 71 if anything people might be slightly more inclined to test if a positive result could lead to isolation away from home potentially due to this also signaling the greater severity of the covid-19 situation but the size of the effect is too small for us to detect with our sample size we have ruled out that this absence of identifiable average effect masks any potentially rational heterogeneity in the population ie we have explored whether there exists a treatment effect for subgroups of the population such as those with children higher-quality homes as measured by income or health anxiety as measured by underlying health conditions one interpretation of the absence of treatment effect is that people assign little weight to the personal cost associated with the location of self-isolating when they decide on whether to take a covid-19 test we pool participants from both treatments and examine the determinants of willingness to test we estimate a probit model table 3 shows the resulting average marginal effects
 concerns about own health are captured by the variable worry about own health the results in table 3 imply that the more a person worries about their health due to covid-19 the more likely they are to take a test the inclusion of this variable in our model also renders the coefficient for the variable that measures underlying health conditions ie self health risk small and statistically insignificant if worry about own health is excluded from the regression self health risk has the expected positive and statistically significant effect on willingness to test we do not find that people with children who have underlying health conditions are more likely to take the test perhaps due to the expectation that people of young age are less affected this result remains robust if we recode the variable child health risk into a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if any child in the household has one or more underlying health conditions variables that affect a persons financial situation do not seem to matter to the willingness to take a covid-19 test in particular we do not find an effect from business impact or employer impact we examine the robustness of these findings to alternative measures of business and employer impact first we instead include the multitude of variables underlying business impact and employer impact in the regression model see footnote 2 but we do not find an effect from any of those variables that is close to statistically significant at even the 10 level furthermore we do not find an effect on willingness to test from financial tolerance second we recode the variables such that they range from little impact to severe impact ranging from if a business owner or employee has experienced no adverse effects from covid-19 to one or multiple effects again we find no statistically significant effects from these variables on the willingness to test taken together these results suggest that people do not consider their own private costs from a positive test when deciding on taking a covid-19 test similarly we find no effect on the willingness to test from emotional tolerance implying that the private emotional cost from social isolation in the event of a positive test might not affect the decision to take a covid-19 test we find that healthy younger people are more likely to take a test than healthy older people as implied by the negative parameter estimate for high-risk age this age effect is consistent with findings in other studies that observe older people avoid health-related information more than younger people thunstrm et al 2016 gigerenzer  garcia-retamero 2017 while this result could imply that older people are more likely to be willfully ignorant it is also in line with the idea that those with more social interactions younger people are more likely to get tested studies find that people below 60 years old have more social contacts and therefore are more likely to transmit infectious diseases mossong et al 2008 furthermore we find that those who have met more people during the last 3 days are more willing to take the test as suggested by the negative parameter estimate for social distance compliant  6 feet furthermore the potential super-spreaders  the extroverts  are more likely by 8 to take a test compared to the introverts taken together this suggests that social benefits weight heavily in peoples decisions to test those most at risk to spread covid-19 are the most willing to get tested we find that republicans are 13 less likely than democrats to get tested we speculate that this might be due to different information sources and because the risks of covid-19 might be portrayed differently in liberal and conservative popular and social media we examined the robustness of this result by including a conservatism scale everett 2013 in the probit regression and the result remains the same people who are more conservative are less likely to want to take a covid-19 test the conservatism scale is however not included in the final model given its high correlation with the political dummy variables finally we find that people with health insurance or coverage from medicare or medicaid are around 8 more likely to take the test this result might suggest that people who lack health care coverage use willful ignorance as a means to reduce anxiety about how to deal with a diagnosis this would be in line with previous studies that suggest willful ignorance of health diagnoses may be motivated by the drive to reduce anxiety about the future eg oster et al 2013 our results are robust to the inclusion of other explanatory variables such as race education income and profession with high exposure to infected people health care worker store clerk etc but these variables lack explanatory power or are highly correlated with other explanatory variables included in table 3 the tests conducted prior to participating in our study were neither randomly offered to people so far testing for covid-19 in the usa has been primarily of individuals who showed symptoms nor costless 52 of those who had tested prior to participating in our study stated the tests were financially costly and 60 said testing was time consuming the value of data on observed testing is limited when it comes to helping us understand whether people might purposefully ignore such tests while acknowledging that we still compare our identified determinants of testing in table 3 to the determinants of having taken a test before participating in our study see online supplementary material while the levels of statistical significance vary all coefficients are of the same sign as those in table 3 except for four variables having taken a test before participating in our study seems to be positively affected by having spent more time in groups with 10 or more people ie social distance compliant  groups as well as by a child having underlying health conditions ie child health risk employer impact has a weakly statistically significant positive effect on testing prior to participating in our study while it is not statistically significant in table 3 insurance is not a statistically significant determinant of having been tested prior to participating in our study while it does have an effect in table 3 widespread testing is one of the most important actions that us governments at any level can undertake to help slow down the spread of covid-19 given budget and testing supply constraints it is likely that random but voluntary testing will be the most effective policy we design a survey to examine the risks from self-selection into taking a covid-19 test overall we observe that around 70 of people would agree to a costless covid-19 test we find that people who are more worried about their own health due to covid-19 are more likely to test as are young healthy people relative to older healthy people ability to afford self-isolation for 14 days does not seem to affect the decision to test furthermore people who worry more about their health and people with health insurance or health coverage through medicare or medicaid are more likely to take the test as are people identifying as democrats compared to republicans contrary to our expectation we also find that potential super-spreaders are more likely than other individuals to agree to a costless covid-19 it could be that extroverts are more willing than expected to take a covid-19 test because their private cost of doing so is unusually low due to the broadly implemented social distancing at the time of data collection for this study if extroverts are already relatively isolated ie due to a stay-at-home order and mandated closures by the state governor of public spaces such as gyms restaurants and bars the personal cost of testing might be low furthermore extroverts might be more likely to get infected if they socialize more which could be a selfish motivation to get tested however we control for the current level of compliance with social distancing which should address both of these private motivations for increased probability of testing and we find that people who comply more are less motivated to take the test we also control for their worry about own health due to covid-19 even so the positive effect on willingness to test from being an extrovert persists we therefore conclude that the positive effect of being an extrovert on willingness to test for covid-19 is likely due to social health benefits weighing more heavily in their decision than their private costs from potential self-isolation for 14 days should the test come back positive the importance of the prosocial motive in determining covid-19 testing is consistent with the results of the study by jordan et al 2020 who find that prosocial messages are more effective than self-interested messages in promoting behavior that prevent the spread of covid-19 eg hand washing hand shaking hugging our results suggest that the risks of adverse selection in terms of failing to target the people most likely to spread the virus in testing for covid-19 might be fairly low this underscores the value of widespread testing even if it cannot be truly random and the importance of making such testing available nationwide in the usa as soon as possible an important shortcoming of our analysis is that it builds on hypothetical survey data it is well documented that survey answers may be affected by a hypothetical bias meaning that people answer one way in a survey and behave in a different way when faced with real incentivized decisions this risk pertains to our study as well and the hypothetical bias might be particularly pronounced if the choice to test for covid-19 is regarded as prosocial several studies suggest that a hypothetical bias is particularly likely when measuring prosocial behavior  people often exaggerate the extent to which they engage in such behavior eg murphy et al 2005 vossler et al 2012 jacquemet et al 2013 furthermore it is possible that personal costs to the testing decision are less salient in a hypothetical context once testing is more widespread in the usa it will be important to examine who actually chooses to get tested and the extent to which they deviate from the general population that said hypothetical and incentivized behavior generally correlate such that an analysis like ours can provide important insights into the potential pitfalls of voluntary testing prior to the actual testing this is useful information to have on hand when designing an efficient and cost-effective testing strategy  human mobility restrictions and the spread of the novel coronavirus 2019-ncov in china  hanming fang long wang yang yang jere behrman xi chen ming li xincheng qiu yao zeng  for useful comments and suggestions all remaining errors are our own we quantify the causal impact of human mobility restrictions particularly the lockdown of the city of wuhan on january 23 2020 on the containment and delay of the spread of the novel coronavirus 2019-ncov we employ a set of differencein-differences did estimations to disentangle the lockdown effect on human mobility reductions from other confounding effects including panic effect virus effect and the spring festival effect we find that the lockdown of wuhan reduced inflow into wuhan by 7664 outflows from wuhan by 5635 and within-wuhan movements by 5415 we also estimate the dynamic effects of up to 22 lagged population inflows from wuhan and other hubei cities the epicenter of the 2019-ncov outbreak on the destination cities new infection cases we find using simulations with these estimates that the lockdown of the city of wuhan on january 23 2020 contributed significantly to reducing the total infection cases outside of wuhan even with the social distancing measures later imposed by other cities we find that the covid-19 cases would be 6481 higher in the 347 chinese cities outside hubei province and 5264 higher in the 16 non-wuhan cities inside hubei in the counterfactual world in which the city of wuhan were not locked down from january 23 2020 we also find that there were substantial undocumented infection cases in the early days of the 2019-ncov outbreak in wuhan and other cities of hubei province but over time the gap between the officially reported cases and our estimated actual cases narrows significantly we also find evidence that enhanced social distancing policies in the 63 chinese cities outside hubei province are effective in reducing the impact of population inflows from the epicenter cities in hubei province on the spread of 2019-ncov virus in the destination cities elsewhere 3 with a population of over 11 million wuhan is the largest city in hubei the most populous city in central china and the seventh most populous city in china the city is also a major transportation hub with dozens of railways roads and expressways passing through and connecting to other major cities and home to 82 colleges and more than 1 million college students  human mobility contributes to the transmission of infectious diseases that pose serious threats to global health indeed in response to pandemic threats many countries consider and impose measures that restrict human mobility flows as one of their response plans bajardi et al 2011 wang and taylor 2016 charu et al 2017  however restrictions on human mobility are controversial not only because of their negative economic impacts but also because of the uncertainty about their effectiveness in controlling the epidemic even if restricting human movement could lead to improvements in disease control and reductions in health risks it is empirically challenging to quantify the impact of human mobility on the spread of infectious diseases and to understand the detailed spatial patterns of how the infectious disease spreads both granular disease occurrence data and human mobility data charu et al 2017  are hard to obtain moreover it is difficult to disentangle the impact of human mobility from other potential contributing factors in the spread of epidemics hollingsworth et al 2006  in this paper we exploit the exogenous variations in human mobility created by lockdowns of chinese cities during the outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019-ncov and utilize a variety of high-quality data sets to study the effectiveness of an unprecedented cordon sanitaire of the epicenter of covid-19 and provide a comprehensive analysis on the role of human mobility restrictions in the delaying and the halting of the spread of the covid-19 pandemic 1 the fast-moving 2019-ncov that infected 266073 people and claimed 11184 lives as of march 21 2020 is deteriorating into one of the worst global pandemics 2 the virus emerged in the city of wuhan in the hubei province of china in early december of 2019 spread mainly through person-to-person contact chan et al 2020  and rapidly reached more than 183 countries as of march 21 2020 3 currently there are no licensed vaccines or specific therapeutics to combat covid-19 the lockdown of 11 million people in wuhan from january 23 2020 represents by then the largest quarantine in public health history and offers us an opportunity to rigorously examine the effects of the city lockdown and understand the relationship between human mobility and virus transmission specifically this paper studies five research questions first how does the lockdown of the city of wuhan amid the novel coronavirus outbreak affect population movement second how do population flows among chinese cities particularly outflows from wuhan and other cities in hubei province affect virus infection in the destination cities third is there evidence of and if so what is the magnitude of undocumented cases of covid-19 cases in wuhan and other cities in hubei province during the early stages of the epidemic and how does the extent of undocumented infection cases evolve over time fourth how many covid-19 cases elsewhere in china were prevented by the unprecedented wuhan lockdown fifth are social distancing policies in destination cities effective in reducing the spread of the infections we utilize reliable datasets on population migration among pairs of chinese cities and the within-city population movements of each city at the daily level from baidu migration and the city-level daily numbers of confirmed covid-19 cases recovered patients and death tolls from the chinese center for disease control and prevention ccdc during a sample period of january 1-february 29 2020 covering 22 days before and 38 days after the city lockdown on january 23 2020 as well as the matched data from the same lunar calendar period in 2019 we first employ various difference-in-differences did estimation strategies to disentangle the effect of wuhan lockdown on human mobility reductions from other confounding effects including panic effect virus effect and the spring festival effect-the spring festival of the chinese new year is on january 25 2020 table 2  we find that the lockdown of wuhan reduced inflow into wuhan by 7664 outflows from wuhan by 5635 and within-wuhan movements by 5415 we also estimate the dynamic effects of up to 22 lagged population inflows from wuhan and other hubei cities the epicenter of the 2019-ncov outbreak on the destination cities new infection cases  figure 4  we discover that the estimated effects of the different lags of inflows from wuhan and hubei both show a clear inverted u -shape with respect to the lags with the largest impact on the newly confirm cases today comes from the inflow population from wuhan or other cities in hubei about 12 to 14 days earlier we find using simulations with these estimates that the lockdown of the city of wuhan on january 23 2020 contributed significantly to reducing the total infection cases outside of wuhan even with the social distancing measures later imposed by other cities we find that the covid-19 cases would be 6481 higher in the 347 chinese cities outside hubei province and 5264 higher in 16 non-wuhan cities inside hubei in the counterfactual world in which the city of wuhan were not locked down from january 23 2020 we also find that there were substantial undocumented infection cases in the early days of the 2019-ncov outbreak in wuhan and other cities of hubei province but over time the gap between the officially reported cases and our estimated actual cases narrows significantly we also find evidence that imposing enhanced social distancing policies in the 63 chinese cities outside hubei province is effective in reducing the impact of population inflows from the epicenter cities in hubei province on the spread of 2019-ncov virus in the destination cities elsewhere by providing a rigorous estimation of the impact of within and cross-city migration on the spread of the 2019-ncov virus in china our study contributes to fast-growing literature on 2019-ncov infection mostly in the medical and public health fields huang et al 2020 describe high rates of respiratory distress intensive care admission and abnormal findings on chest computed tomography ct in the first 41 patients hospitalized from december 16 to january 2 in wuhan as well as a 15 death rate chan et al 2020 investigate a family cluster and confirm the human-to-human transmission of this novel coronavirus within hospitals and families the basic reproduction number r0 for covid-19 in 12 studies has a mean of 328 and a median of 279 liu et al 2020  compared to 3 for sars wto 2003  this study is also related to disaster-induced migration which has often occurred during flooding gray and mueller 2012  drought munshi 2003  earthquake lu et al 2012  and other destructive climatic phenomena given that the 2019-ncov has rapidly spread worldwide due to human travel and caused severe illness and significant mortality it is therefore essential to understand the impact of various control measures on human mobility and the virus transmission qiu et al 2020 apply machine learning tools and use exogenous temperature wind speed and precipitation in the preceding third and fourth weeks as the instruments to show that the massive lockdown and other control measures significantly reduced the virus transmission their results highlight that the population outflow from the outbreak source city poses higher risks to the destination cities than other social and economic factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions our results are also in line with the results of the latest modeling exercises which mostly rely on model calibrations of various parameters such as generation time incubation period detection rates and changes in travel flow using the global epidemic and mobility model chinazzi et al 2020 project the impact of travel limitation on the national and international spread of the 2019-ncov the study finds that only 244 of infected cases were reported as of february 1 and the wuhan lockdown reduced the cases by 10 in cities outside wuhan by january 31 the study most closely related to ours is li et al 2020  which shows that contagious but undocumented covid-19 cases facilitated the geographic spread of the epidemic in china using a networked dynamic meta-population model and bayesian inference li et al 2020 find that 86 of all infections were undocumented before the wuhan lockdown and reported infections would have been reduce by 787 in china without transmission from undocumented cases between january 10 and january 23 lai et al 2020 build a travel network-based susceptibleexposed-infectious-removed seir model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland china they use epidemiological parameters estimated from the early stage of outbreak in wuhan to parameterize the transmission before the non-pharmaceutical interventions npi were implemented the npis they consider include travel bans and restrictions contact reductions and social distancing early case identification and isolation through their sim-ulations they find that the npis deployed in china appear to be effectively containing the covid-19 outbreak but the efficacy of the different interventions varied with the early case detection and contact reduction being the most effective moreover deploying the npis early is also important to prevent further spread relative to our study it is important to point out that in their simulations they assumed that the pattern of population movements was the same in years when there were no outbreaks and interventions to the best of our knowledge this paper is the first to provide a causal interpretation of the impact of city lockdown on human mobility and the spread of 2019-ncov and to clearly disentangle the lockdown effects from other potential contributing factors such as panic and virus effect as well as the seasonal spring festival effect see section 3 the remainder of the paper is structured as follows in section 2 we describe the data sets used in our analysis in section 3 we present different difference-in-difference estimation strategies to separate the lockdown effect panic effect virus deterrence effect and the spring festival effect on population movements in china in section 4 we estimate the distributed lag effects of inflows from the epicenter cities of the 2019-ncov outbreak on destination cities daily infection cases in section 5 we study how the enhanced social distancing policies or lockdown policies in the destination cities impact the effects of the population inflows from the epicenter cities in section 6 we conclude population migration data we obtain inter-city population migration data from baidu migration a travel map offered by the largest chinese search engine baidu 4  the baidu migration data set covers 120142 pairs of cities per day for 364 chinese cities between january 12 and march 12 in 2019 and between january 1 and february 29 in 2020 note that by the lunar calendar the data covers the same period of 24 days before and 36 days after the spring festivals respectively for year 2019 and year 2020 the daily inter-city migration data consist of 2977899 city-pair observations each year in addition baidu provides the daily within-city mobility data for each city in the sample period which is a panel consisting of 21655 city-day level observations each year the baidu migration data is based on real-time location records for every smart phone using the companys mapping app and thus can precisely reflect the population movements between cities 5 for each of the 364 cities baidu migration provides the following informa- tion 1 the top 100 origination cities oc for the population moving into the city and the corresponding percentages of inflow population that originated from each of the top 100 oc 2 the top 100 destination cities dc for the population moving out of the city and the corresponding percentages of the outflow population that go into each of the top dc in the data the cumulative percentages of the inflow population from the top 100 origination city and the cumulative percentages of the outflow population into the top 100 destination cities reach 97 per city on average this ensures that the baidu migration data capture near complete inflows and outflows for each of the 364 cities in the data in addition the baidu migration data provides three migration intensity indicators the daily in-migration index imi of a city the daily out-migration index omi of a city and the daily within-city migration index wcmi the intensity indicators are consistent across cities and across time to convert the index to the number of people we use the actual number of inflow population into shanghai by airplanes trains and busescars and the number of within-shanghai trips using subways buses and expressways collected by the national earth system science data center for the period of february 6 to february 22 2020 using this data we estimate that one index unit in the imi and omi corresponds to 90848 person movements and one index unit in wcmi corresponds to 2182264 person movements we are thus able to calculate the number of daily inflow and outflow migrants in each city-pair as well as the number of within-city population movements 6 table 1 presents the summary statistics of the population flows at the city-pair-day level and city-day level it shows drastic declines in the average inflows average outflows and average within-city migration in 2020 compared to a sample period in 2019 matched by the lunar calendar date the plummeting of the migration statistics due to the wuhan lockdown is also depicted in figure 2  the three figures on the top show the inflows into wuhan outflows from wuhan and within-wuhan flows for year 2020 solid line and year 2019 dashed line matched by the lunar calendar and the bottom shows the corresponding figures for the national city averages the first vertical line indicates the date of january 20 2020 when experts confirmed that 2019-ncov could transmit from human to human and the second vertical line indicates the date of january 23 2020 when wuhan was locked down it is clear that while the flows in 2020 tracked that of 2019 well until january 20 the 2020 level dropped to a fraction of their corresponding 2019 levels particularly after the lockdown of wuhan  table 1 about here  figure 2 about here 6 it is important to emphasize here that the mobility data is about the movement of people from one city to another based on geo-location services of the smartphones as such a person flowing out of city a to city b is not necessarily a resident of city a but heshe must have been to city a before moving to city b  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in

dead and recovered covid-19 cases in each city 7 from january 11 to february 29 2020 the data covers 77105 laboratory-confirmed covid-19 cases 2778 death cases and 39392 recovered cases in 296 cities in china panel b of table  1 presents the summary statistics of covid-19 data and figure 3 plots the trends of daily statistics of covid-19separately for the epicenter city of wuhan for other cities in hubei province and for cities outside of hubei 8 there are many possible reasons for us to treat the officially reported numbers of confirmed cases in wuhan and other cities of hubei with more caution and to treat them differently from the data of cities outside of hubei as the epicenter of covid-19 the health care systems in wuhan and other cities in hubei were overwhelmed by the sheer number of patients who needed laboratory testing especially in the early phases of the virus outbreak as such the over-extended medical system in wuhan and other cities in hubei might have caused delays in the testing of the patients who contracted covid-19 and because of the delay some patients who contracted covid-19 might have self-recovered or might have died before being officially tested and some who were infected with the virus might be asymptomatic there is also a possibility that government officials in the epicenter cities had incentives to downplay the severity of the outbreak at least initially these considerations impact how we use the outbreak data in section 4 the incubation period of 2019-ncov is long in comparison with sars moreover the virus can transmit while the person is still asymptomatic which increases the probability a person with the novel coronavirus will travel and unknowingly spread the virus to others 9 to suppress the spread of 2019-ncov the central government of china imposed an unprecedented lockdown in wuhan starting from 10 am of january 23 2020 and in other hubei cities several days later as of february 29 2020 80 cities in 22 provinces issued different 7 source http2019ncovchinacdccn2019-ncov 8 the spike of confirmed cases observed on february 12 in hubei province is for the most part the result of a change in diagnosis classification for which 13332 clinically rather than laboratory confirmed cases were all reported as new cases on february 12 2020 even though they might have been clinically diagnosed in the preceding weeks also on february 12 2020 a new communist party secretary of hubei province was appointed who started his position on the next day 9 the range of the incubation period for 2019-ncov is estimated to be 2-14 days or even as long as 24 days the median incubation period is about 5 days see lauer et al 2020  in contrast the incubation period for sars is 2-7 days in addition sars transmits only after showing symptoms  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the

mobility control in different cities we also plot the geographic distributions of sample cities and cases in figure 1   figure 1 about here there are several confounding factors in our attempt to causally quantify the impact of lockdown on human mobility and on the spread of infectious viruses first the virus outbreak happens right before the spring festival of the chinese lunar new year which causes the largest annual human migration every year 11 second the virus itself even in the absence of a mandatory lockdown may lead to curtailed human movement as people attempt to avoid exposure to the virus in the journeys and public spaces we refer to this deterrence effect as the virus effect third for the city of wuhan and other cities in hubei that are close to wuhan there is also the possibility of a panic effect in reaction to the virus the panic effect can lead to an increase in the population outflow from the epicenter of the virus outbreak and a decrease of the population inflow to the epicenter particularly the city of wuhan the panic effect is likely to peak when the government officially confirmed on january 20 2020 that the novel coronavirus can transmit from person-to-person in our analysis below we create a specific pre-lockdown period before 2t  which includes the threeday period between january 20 and january 22 202 to capture the panic effects 12 note that while the virus effect applies to movement into and out of all cities the panic effect is more specific to the cities in the epicenter especially wuhan and can have a positive effect on outflows and a negative effect on inflows 10 within hours of the wuhan lockdown travel restrictions were imposed on the nearby cities of huanggang and ezhou and were eventually imposed on all 14 other cities in hubei affecting a total of about 57 million people on february 2 the city of wenzhou implemented a partial lockdown in which only one person per household was allowed to exit once every two days and most of the highway exits were closed following wenzhou another six cities hangzhou zhumadian ningbo haerbin fuzhou and zhengzhou also launched similar partial lockdowns on february 4 in another 56 cities surveillance and tighter controls applied to each neighborhood in the provinces of liaoning and jiangxi as well as major cities such as shenzhen guangzhou nanjing ningbo chengdu and suzhou checkpoints have been set up to control the inflow population 11 the migration across china which officially begins from about two weeks before and ends about three weeks after the lunar new year is often referred to as chunyun meaning spring movement in 2019 approximately 3 billions trips were made during chunyun see httpswwwcnncomtravelarticle lunar-new-year-travel-rush-2019indexhtml 12 the large outflow from wuhan is possible because many people in wuhan are migrant workers and college students with hometowns elsewhere  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  we first examine the impact of city lockdown on inter-city population mobility including inflow and outflow between a city pair i j to disentangle the contributions of these confounding factors on human mobility we exploit many unique sources of variations in the data and employ several did estimation strategies by comparing different treatment and control groups the did specification can be described as follows where i j and t respectively index the destination city origination city and date the dependent variable lnflow ijt  is the logarithmic population flows received by city i from city j at date t the definition of treat varies by specific did designs and we will be explicit about its definition below the city-pair fixed effect  ij is included to absorb the city-specific and the city-pair specific heterogeneities that may contaminate the estimation of our interested coefficient  3  we also control for the date-fixed effect  t to eliminate the time-specific impact including the spring festival travel effect the standard errors are clustered at the daily level in equation 1 we include two pre-lockdown period indicators before 1t is a dummy that takes value 1 for the period from january 11 to january 19 2020 4 to 11 days before the wuhan lockdown which can be used to examine the parallel trend assumption in the did analysis before 2t is a dummy that takes value 1 for the period from january 20 to january 22 2020 three days before the unprecedented wuhan lockdown but after the official announcement that the novel coronavirus can spread from person to person 13 before 2t allows us to capture the panic effect finally after t is a dummy that takes value 1 for the sample period after the wuhan lockdown between january 23 and february 29 2020 the omitted benchmark period is from january 1 to january 10 2020 13 on january 20 2020 an expert at china cdc confirmed that the novel coronavirus can spread from human to human the confirmation highlighted the increasing risk of an epidemic prior to the january 20 announcement the experts assessment of the virus was that it was preventable and controllable and at this time there is no evidence of person to person transmission 8  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  we also estimate the effect of lockdown on the within-city population movement utilizing the city-level data and a variety of did specifications where i and t index the city and date lnwithincityflow it  is the logarithmic within-city population mobility measure for city i at date t similar to equation 1 treat will be defined according to the did design before 1t  before 2t and after t are defined in the same way as in equation 1 we include the city fixed effects  i and date fixed effects  t  the standard errors are clustered at the daily level  table 2 about here in table 2  we report the results from three sets of regressions specified according to equation 1 for inter-city inflows panel a and outflows panel b and according to equation 2 for within-city movement panel c we implement three models that differ in the estimation sample and the definition of the variable treat model 1 wuhan 2020 vs 284 unlocked cities in 2020 the estimation sample used in the regressions reported in column 1 is the 2020 data for wuhan and 284 cities that were never locked down during the coronavirus outbreak 14 in panel a when we examine the inflow population treat takes value 1 if the destination city i is wuhan in panel b when we examine the outflow population treat takes value 1 if the origination city j is wuhan the control group consists of 284 cities that are not subject to any mobility restrictions in panel c when we examine the within-city mobility treat takes value 1 if city i is wuhan we interpret the coefficient estimate of treat  before 2t as measuring the panic effect of wuhan relative to the unlocked cities and the coefficient estimate of treat  after t as measuring the lockdown effect 15 the coefficient estimate of treat  before 1t allows us to examine whether the parallel trend assumption for did is 14 recall that baidu migration data covers 364 chinese cities 80 cities implemented some level of mobility restrictions see table a1  15 if the virus effect is stronger in wuhan than in the unlocked control cities then the coefficient estimate of treat  after t also includes the excess virus effect on the population in wuhan over the average virus effect experienced by the population in the control cities  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  satisfied it is important to note that the possibly time-varying spring festival effects and the virus effects are both absorbed in the day fixed effects based on the coefficient estimate of the term treat  after t  we find that wuhans lockdown reduces the inflow population to wuhan by 8806  1  exp2215 the outflow population from wuhan by 7444  1  exp1364 and within-city population movements in wuhan by 7379 1  exp1339 relative to all other unlocked cities in the post-lockdown period in 2020 in panel c we also find that the coefficient of treat  before 2t is significantly negative at -0323 suggesting that the official confirmation of the person-toperson transmission reduces the within-city movement in wuhan by 276 from jan 20 to jan 22 in 2020 this points to a panic effect for the within-city population flow in wuhan but we do not observe a significant panic effect for inter-city flows in and out of wuhan in model 1 model 2 wuhan 2020 vs wuhan 2019 model 1 could be criticized on the ground that wuhan may not be comparable to the 284 unlocked cities -after all these 284 cities that never imposed any mobility restrictions in the covid-19 outbreak could be very different from wuhan in model 2 we compare the population movements of wuhan in 2020 to itself in the same matched lunar calendar period in 2019 during which wuhan is free of lockdown and coronavirus outbreak thus the estimation sample in model 2 is the daily inflows into and outflows out of wuhan as well as the daily within-city movements in wuhan for years 2019 and 2020 under model 2 in panel a when we examine the inflow population treat takes value 1 if the destination city i is wuhan and year is 2020 in panel b when we examine the outflow population treat takes value 1 if the origination city j is wuhan and the year is 2020 the control group is wuhan 2019 in panel c when we examine the within-city mobility treat takes value 1 if the year is 2020 under model 2 the coefficient estimate of treat  before 2t measures the panic effect related to the virus outbreak in wuhan and the

for did is satisfied the day fixed effects absorb the possibly time-varying spring festival effects notice that the interpretation of the coefficient estimate of the term treat  after t differs from that in model 1 because of the differences in the treatment and control groups under model 2 the estimated coefficients on treat  after t  which as we explained above capture both the lockdown and the virus effects remain negative and economically and statistically significant in all panels the estimates suggest that the lockdown of wuhan together with the deterrence effect of the virus the virus

exp1871 respectively relative to the same lunar calendar days in 2019 we also find that the coefficient on treat  before 2t is significantly positive in panel b and significantly negative in panel c suggesting that the official confirmation of person-to-person spread of covid-19 creates a panic effect causing an increase of outflow from wuhan of 10709  exp0728  1 and a decrease of within-city movements in wuhan of 2419  1  exp0277 during the three days after the announcement but before the city lockdown however we do not observe a statistically significant panic effect for the population inflow into wuhan suggesting that people in other cities were not yet sufficiently concerned about the virus outbreak in wuhan and did not avoid traveling to wuhan even after the official confirmation of the personto-person transmission finally we should also point out that the coefficient estimates for treat  before 1t are all statistically insignificant which suggests that the parallel trend assumption for the dids are plausible model 3 wuhan 2020 vs seven other lockdown cities 2020 in model 2 the coefficient estimates of treat  after t provide us with an estimate of the sum of the lockdown and the virus effects in order to isolate the lockdown effect from the virus effect we consider model 3 where the estimation sample consists of data of the city of wuhan and seven other cities that went into partial lockdown on february 2 and february 4 2020 12 to 14 days after the lockdown of wuhan in an effort to curtail the spread of the virus 16 as we show in table a2 in the appendix these seven cities are more comparable to wuhan than other unlocked cities in terms of the epidemic situation and other economic indicators and thus provide a reasonable control group to partial out the virus effect in particular it is much more plausible than in model 1 where the control cities are cities that were never locked down to assume that the deterrence effect of the virus on human mobility in the seven cities is similar to that in wuhan the estimation sample for model 3 consists of data from wuhan and the seven cities for the period between january 1 and february 2 2020 note that during this period none of the seven control cities were locked down yet even though they were soon eventually locked down the definition for treat variables are as follows in panel a treat takes value 1 if the destination city i is wuhan in panel b treat takes value 1 if the origination city j is wuhan in panel c treat takes value 1 if city i is wuhan the control group consists of the 16 these seven cities are wenzhou which was partially lockdown from february 2 2020 and ningbo zhumadian hangzhou zhengzhou haerbin and fuzhou which were partially locked down on february 4 2020 as summarized in table a1 in the appendix partial lockdown includes closed-off management on highways railways and public transport systems and sets up checkpoints to control the inflow population and implements surveillance and tighter controls in each neighborhood  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  seven cities under model 3 the coefficient estimate of treat  before 2t measures the panic effect related to the virus outbreak in wuhan relative to the seven control cities and the estimate of treat  after t measures the lockdown effect only the coefficient estimate of treat  before 1t still allows us to examine whether the parallel trend assumption for did is satisfied the possibly time-varying spring festival effects and the virus effects are both absorbed in the day fixed effects we find that the wuhan lockdown significantly reduces the inflow into outflow from and within-city movements in wuhan by 7664  1  exp1454 5635  1  exp0829 and 5416  1  exp0780 respectively we interpret these as the pure lockdown effect on population mobility related to wuhan summary based on our preferred estimation models which are models 2 and 3 table  3 summarizes our estimates of the panic effect the virus effect and the lockdown effect on inflows into outflows from wuhan and within-city population movements in wuhan  table 3 about here in table 3  the lockdown effects are directly calculated from the corresponding coefficient estimates of treat  after from model 3 discussed above the panic effects are from the coefficient estimates of treat  before 2 in model 2 for the virus effect we recognize that the coefficient estimates of treat  after in model 2 incorporate both the lockdown and the virus effects thus we calculate the virus effect on inflows into wuhan to be exp2522  1454  1  6563 on the outflows from wuhan to be exp1287  0829  1  3675 and on the within-city flow in wuhan to be exp187107801  5415 because our models assume that the different effects enter exponentially in explaining the flows -recall the natural log specifications in equations 1 and 2-when we would like to calculate the impact of two or more effects on the population flows we should not simply add the individual effects for example the joint impact of the panic and virus effects on outflows out of wuhan is 1  10709  1  3675  1  3098 instead of the simple sum of 10709  3675  7034  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  we now examine the impact of human mobility on the transmission of 2019-ncov considering that almost all the new covid-19 cases outside the city of wuhan were confirmed after the wuhan lockdown while almost all inter-city population flows occurred prior to the wuhan lockdown see figures 2 and 3  we investigate the imported infections by specifically looking at the impact of population inflows from cities in the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak namely wuhan and other cities in hubei province on the new cases in the destination cities recognizing that 2019-ncov has a long incubation period we estimate a dynamic distributed lag regression model taking into account that inflows from wuhan with different lags may have differential impacts on the current new cases in the destination cities most of the medical literature states that the 2019-ncov virus has a median incubation period of five days and some can have an incubation period of 14 days or more see lauer et al 2020  eg luckily our data allows us to incorporate the possibility that contact with an infected person from wuhan or other cities in hubei can result in confirmed infections in the destination city for up to 22 days the analysis focuses on the daily new confirmed covid-19 cases in the post-wuhan lockdown period from january 23 to february 29 2020 for cities i that are outside of hubei province specifically we run the following regression 17 where i indexes the cities outside of hubei and t  23  60 indicate the date 18   1  22 indicates the time lapsed from the inflows from wuhan or other hubei cities till the current date t ln1newcase it  is the logarithm of the number of new confirmed cases in city i at date t inflow iwht and j ij whjhb inflow ijt are the inflows from wuhan and the inflows from the 16 other cities in hubei to city i respectively  days prior 17 our log-log specification is based on the classical susceptible-infectious-removed sir model

effects  i and date fixed effects  t  note that in this regression we include only cities outside of hubei province for two reasons first wuhan and other cities in hubei province are the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak and we are interested in how population outflows from these cities to other cities outside hubei affect the destination cities covid-19 cases second the confirmed covid-19 cases in wuhan and other cities in hubei province are likely to be inaccurate for the following reasons first as widely reported the health care systems in wuhan and other cities in hubei were totally overwhelmed by the sheer number of covid-19 patients this made it impossible to conduct laboratory tests on all patients which can lead to delayed confirmation of infected patients second during the delay some of the infected may have healed on their own or have died before being confirmed third local government officials may face strong incentives to under-report the number of infected cases in section 42 we will evaluate the possible downward biases of the officially reported cases in wuhan and other cities in hubei based on our estimates in contrast the confirmed cases in other cities are likely to be accurate as their numbers are not large enough to overwhelm their local health care system and the incentives to under-report are much weaker in cities outside of hubei the estimated coefficients  1 and  2 in equation 3 respectively represent the impact of the inflows from wuhan and other cities in hubei   1  22 days ago on the destination cities new cases today they are respectively plotted in the top and bottom panels of figure  4  we also fit a spline smoothed curve of the estimated effects of the different lags of inflows from wuhan and hubei which both show a clear inverted u -shape with respect to the lags interestingly both graphs show that the largest impact on the newly confirm cases today in chinese cities outside hubei comes from the inflow population from wuhan or other cities in hubei about 12 to 14 days ago the pattern exhibited in figure 4 is consistent with the hypothesis that the incubation period of the 2019-ncov is up to 12 to 14 days but also consistent with a shorter incubation period coupled with secondary infections  figure 4 about here anecdotal evidence suggests the official statistics of covid-19 cases in wuhan may have been under-reported due to the shortages of testing equipment and other medical resources with the estimated dynamic effects as shown in figure 4  which is estimated under the plausible assumption that the reported cases outside hubei province are reliable we can estimate the actual number of infection cases in wuhan and other cities in hubei 14  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  to estimate the actual number of infection cases in wuhan using the estimated equation 3 we technically need to impute a value for inflow whwht  that is inflows from wuhan to wuhan we proxy these inflows by the daily within-wuhan population movement from january 1 to february 29 ie by withincityflow wht  similarly to estimate the actual number of infection cases in other cities in hubei we need to replace the inflow from city j to itself by the corresponding daily within-city-j population movements we need to make an additional assumption about the city fixed effects recall that cities in hubei province were not included in the estimation sample for equation 3 as such there are no city fixed effects estimated for cities in hubei luckily it is plausible to assume that the city fixed effects in hubei is the average of the city fixed effects of all chinese cities outside hubei according to world banks respectively imfs method of estimating per capita gdp hubeis per capita gdp in 2018 was usd 10067 respectively usd 10054 and the average per capita gdp of mainland china was usd 9769 respectively usd 9750 hubei is not only geographically and demographically in the center of mainland china it is also economically the average of china thus we believe it is defensible to proxy the fixed effects of hubei cities by the average of the city fixed effects outside of hubei  figure 5 about here in figure 5  we plot the estimated daily new cases according to the above-described method using the estimated equation 3 as well as the corresponding cumulative cases for wuhan panel a and 16 other cities of hubei panel b for the period of january 23 to february 29 2020 we also plotted the corresponding daily and cumulative officially reported ie documented cases we find a persistent gap between the estimated and reported laboratory-confirmed cases in wuhan before february 11 2020 just before the announcement of a new party secretary for hubei province on february 12 2020 the estimated actual number of infection cases is 248 times the reported cases during the first 20 days after the wuhan lockdown on average in particularly we estimate that on january 23 2020 the day of the wuhan lockdown 4217 of our estimated infections in wuhan were undocumented in the sense that the number of officially reported cases on that day was only 5783 of our estimated infection cases this gap widened over time possibly as a result of the overwhelmed health care system and peaked at 8003 on january 26 the proportion of undocumented infections started to decline gradually afterward when more medical support and resources were mobilized across china to support wuhan as of february 29 we estimate that there were 54689 total covid-19 infections in wuhan which is 1133 higher than the official reported statistics for wuhan -a total of 49122 cases the 1133 discrepancy can be plausibly be explained by the unaccounted for self-healing and death that might have occurred during the early periods of the outbreak between january 23 and early february  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  thus we are led to conclude that the almost all infection cases in wuhan were able to be treated over time as the stress on the health system was relieved and moreover the official statistics were mostly accurate as can be seen from the left figure on the daily new cases in panel a in figure 5  it is useful to note that the general pattern of the undocumented covid-19 infections in wuhan before and after the lockdown based on our estimates is consistent with that reported in li et al 2020  they use a networked dynamic meta-population model and bayesian inference to estimate the proportion of undocumented infections in the epicenter of the outbreak as well as the respective inflection rates for documented and undocumented cases they estimate that 86 of all infection cases as of january 23 2020 were undocumented our interpretation of these undocumented cases is broader than the asymptomatic cases ie covid-19 cases that do not show symptoms we believe that some of the undocumented cases were due to the lack of ability to test the rapidly increasing infection cases in the early period of the outbreak most of the undocumented cases become documented over time as the care capacity was strengthened in wuhan in the bottom panel of figure 5  we plot our estimated daily new confirmed cases and total infection case for 16 cities other than wuhan in hubei province together with the officially reported series we find that in the 16 cities infections were more seriously underreported in the first week after the wuhan lockdown when our estimated infected cases are 187 times of the reported cases our estimate reveals a very high rate of undocumented infections on the first day of wuhan lockdown 798 the gap narrowed gradually with more medical resources provided and more stringent control measures implemented in those cities by the end of our study period on february 29 2020 the estimated actual number of infections is 17999 cases in 16 other cities in hubei which is 174 higher than the officially reported cumulative cases 15 330  again the discrepancy between the estimated and officially reported cumulative cases can at least be partially attributed to the unaccounted for self-healing and death that might have occurred during the early periods of the outbreak locking down wuhan a city of 11 million residents was an unprecedented measure to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus an important policy-relevant question is then how many covid-19 cases were actually prevented by the wuhan lockdown in china to answer this question we must estimate the counterfactual number of covid-19 cases that would have occurred in other cities in the absence of wuhan lockdown which would in turn  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  require a counterfactual estimate of the outflows from wuhan to other chinese cities had there been no lockdown of wuhan in section 3 we provided the estimates of how panic effect and virus effect will separately affect the outflows from wuhan to other cities in china separate from the lockdown effect these effects are summarized in table 3  it suggests that in the absence of the wuhan lockdown the virus effect and panic effects would have led to a 3675 decrease and a 10709 increase in the outflow population from wuhan respectively based on these effects therefore in the absence of wuhan lockdown we would expect that the outflows from wuhan in days after january 23 -the date of wuhan lockdown -to be 1  03675  1  10709  131 4 times higher than the normal outflows from wuhan to other cities we use the daily level of outflows from wuhan to a city in 2019 on the same lunar calendar day as a measure of the normal outflow and multiple the number by 131 to obtain the daily counterfactual inflows from wuhan to the city had there been no lockdown of wuhan from january 23 2020 using this estimation method we find that on average the estimated counterfactual outflows from wuhan to 16 other cities in hubei between january 23 and february 29 2020 would be 16568984 a level that is 597 times the actually observed inflow population observed in the data in 2020 with the lockdown which is 2774793 similarly the average inflows from wuhan to the 347 other cities outside hubei in china would be 2274455 314 times the actual inflow population to those cities during the same period in 2020 which is 723574 19 we denote the counterfactual inflows from j  wuhan into city i at date s  23  60 from the above calculation as inflow iwhs  we assume that the wuhan lockdown did not impact the population movements within other cities and population flows among other cities we also assume that all the control measures implemented by other cities after the wuhan lockdown remain in place thus the parameter estimates of the dynamic lag effects of inflows from wuhan and other cities in hubei estimated in equation 3 remain valid as an epidemiological diffusion equation that is not affected by human mobility restrictions that result from the wuhan lockdown the lockdown only affected the human flows with these considerations in mind we simulate the counterfactual number of covid-19 cases had there been no wuhan lockdown on date t  23  60 ie from january 23 to 19 recall that outflows from wuhan are not just residents of wuhan any travelers who entered wuhan for whatever reason and then leave wuhan would be included in the wuhan outflows measured by baidu migration data  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international

february 29 2020 in cities i outside hubei province by the following equation inflow ijt  i 5 where 1 and 2 are coefficient estimates obtained from regressions specified in equation 3 and reported in figure 4  and and i are the estimated city fixed effects from the same regression note that in predicting the counterfactual covid-19 cases without wuhan lockdown we use the counterfactual inflows from wuhan to city i for days after january 23 inflow iwhs discussed previously we are also interested in predicting the counterfactual cases in other non-wuhan cities in hubei province using the same method as that described above with two differences first since hubei cities are not included in the estimation of equation 3 we do not have the city fixed effects for the hubei cities as we argued in section 42 it is plausible to assume that the fixed effects of hubei cities are the average of city fixed effects of the cities outside hubei we maintain this assumption as well in this counterfactual exercise second following the same strategy of section 42 for a non-wuhan city j in hubei province we use the within-city-j population movement at date t to proxy for the inflow to city j from city j when we implement equation 5 for non-wuhan hubei cities in figure 6  we present the counterfactual estimates of covid-19 cases had there been no wuhan lockdown in solid curve and the officially reported cases in dashed curve for cities outside hubei province panel a and non-wuhan cities of hubei panel b the left figure in each panel depicts the models counterfactual prediction and the actual of daily infection cases and the right figure depicts the evolution of cumulative cases from january 23 to february 29 2020 the gap between the estimated counterfactual number of infection cases the solid curve and the officially reported cases the dashed curve on the right figure represent the number of covid-19 cases prevented by the wuhan lockdown as of february 29 2020 the officially reported number of covid-19 in the 347 cities outside hubei province was 12626 but our counterfactual simulation suggests that there would have been 20810 cases had there been no wuhan lockdown similarly the officially reported number of covid-19 cases in the 16 non-wuhan cities in hubei was 15330 by february 29 2020 but our counterfactual simulation suggests that the number of infection cases would have been 23400 had there been no wuhan lockdown that is the covid-19 cases would be 6481 higher in 347 cities outside hubei and 5264 higher in 16 other cities in hubei as of february 29 in the counterfactual world in which the city of wuhan were not locked down from january 23 2020 our findings thus suggest that the lockdown of the city of wuhan from january 18  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  23 2020 played a crucial role in reducing the imported infections in other chinese cities and halts the spread of 2019-ncov virus our model also allows us to project when the new infection cases would have peaked in other cities in the absence of wuhan lockdown as shown by the solid curves in the left figures of each panel our model projects that in the absence of wuhan lockdown the new daily infection cases in the 16 non-wuhan cities in hubei would have peaked on february 2 the 9th day after the lockdown of wuhan at a level of 1466 daily new cases and elsewhere in china it would have peaked on february 3 2020 the 10th day after the lockdown of wuhan at a level of 1082 daily new cases we also find that the estimated daily new cases in the counterfactual world gradually converge to the reported daily cases from february 22 suggesting that the social distancing measures implemented elsewhere in china would have worked eventually to contain the spread of 2019-ncov virus even if the city of wuhan was not locked down on january 23 2020 but the initial onslaught on the medical system in all cities in china would have been much more severe and the total number of infection cases elsewhere would have been significantly higher  figure 6 about here as the 2019-ncov virus spread throughout the world many countries are also implementing lockdown measures and mandate social distancing as a policy response to contain the spread of the virus up to now our analysis has focused on the events of the lockdown of wuhan -the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak it would also be interesting to study the impact of lockdowns andor the social distancing measures in the destination cities in reducing and containing the spread of virus indeed chinazzi et al 2020 point out that travel restrictions to and from mainland china impact the global pandemic of the covid-19 only if transmission within the community is simultaneously reduced by 50 or more which suggests that social distancing at the destination cities is crucial in preventing the possibly asymptomatic transmission from the source city moreover quantifying the effect of social distancing on virus transmission is especially relevant to the stage of pre-epidemic community spread when a person who is not known to have traveled to affected countries or to have had contact with an infected person becomes infected as shown in table a1 in the appendix within the few weeks after the wuhan and hubei lockdowns various human mobility restrictions were imposed on 63 other chinese cities outside hubei as described in table a1  the lockdowns in destination cities varied in their 19  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  degree of strictness from building entrances checkpoints to establishing quarantine zones and from public transit shutdowns to strict limits on the inflows into the city outflows out of the city as well as within-city population movements we interpret the human mobility restrictions in the destination cities as an enhanced social distancing policy because the lockdown rules in the destination cities are not as strict as those implemented in wuhan in this section we use the variations in the destination cities lockdown policies to study how the effects of inflows from wuhan and other cities in hubei province on the spread of covid-19 cases in the destination cities are impacted by the changes in the destination cities lockdown policies which would drastically impact the within-city population movements in the destination cities 20 specifically we estimate the following specification that is a modified version of the regression specification described by equation 3 where the new variable lockdown it is a dummy that takes value 1 if time t is a date after destination city is lockdown date if at all and 0 otherwise where the lockdown dates of the 63 cities outside hubei are listed in table a1  if city i never implemented any formal lockdown policy the dummy is always 0 therefore the coefficients  1 and  2  respectively measure the impact of the lagged inflows from wuhan and hubei  days earlier on the destination cities current new cases before the citys imposition of its lockdown while  1 and  2 represent the effect on destination cities of wuhan and hubei inflows after the imposition of the citys lockdown if enhanced social distancing that comes from the lockdown policies imposed at the 63 chinese cities outside hubei is effective in reducing the spread of the virus from population flows from the epicenter of the virus then we expect that  1 and  2 to be smaller than  1 and  2  respectively 20 see panel c of table 2 for the evidence from wuhan lockdown on within-wuhan population movement  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  in figures 7 respectively figure 8  we plot the estimated coefficients  1 and  1 respectively  2 and  2  in panel a and their differences in panel b for the lagged effects of inflows from wuhan respectively 16 non-wuhan cities in hubei on the daily new cases in destination cities outside hubei province we find that the estimated lagged effects of inflows from wuhan and other cities in hubei before the destination citys lockdown if any show little change compared to the coefficients in figure 4 however the coefficient estimates of lagged inflows after the destination citys lockdown policies appear to be insignificant and indifferent from zero on almost all lags in panel b of figures 7-8  we plot the differences between the estimated effects pre and post the destination cities lockdown policies we find that the differences between the estimated coefficients pre and post destination city lockdowns are positive and statistically significantly at at-least 10 level for 7 respectively 5 of the first ten lagged population inflows from wuhan respectively 16 other cities of hubei and the other differences in lagged estimates are statistically insignificant these results suggest that the enhanced social distancing policies in the destination cities are effective in reducing the impact of population inflows from the source cities of wuhan and other cities in hubei on the spread of 2019-ncov virus in the destination cities this in turn implies that population inflows from the epicenter contribute to the spread of infection in the destination cities only before the social distancing measures are applied it appears that after implementing their various control measures cities adopting an extended lockdown can flatten the upward trajectory of the virus in this paper we quantify the causal impact of human mobility restrictions particularly the lockdown of the city of wuhan on january 23 2020 on the containment and delay of the spread of the novel coronavirus and estimate the dynamic effects of up to 22 lagged population inflows from wuhan and other hubei cities the epicenter of the 2019-ncov outbreak on the destination cities new infection cases we find that the lockdown of wuhan reduced inflow into wuhan by 7664 outflows from wuhan by 5635 and within-wuhan movements by 5415 using counterfactual simulations with these estimates we find that the lockdown of the city of wuhan on january 23 2020 contributed significantly to reducing the total infection cases outside of wuhan even with the social distancing measures later imposed by other cities we find that the covid-19 cases would be 6481 higher in the 347 chinese cities outside hubei province and 5264 higher in 16 non-wuhan cities inside hubei in the counterfactual world in which the city of wuhan were not locked down from january 23 2020 we also find that there were substantial undocumented infection cases in the early days of the 2019-ncov outbreak in wuhan and other cities of hubei province 21  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  but over time the gap between the officially reported cases and our estimated actual cases narrows significantly we also find evidence that imposing enhanced social distancing policies in the 63 chinese cities outside hubei province is effective in reducing the impact of population inflows from the epicenter cities in hubei province on the spread of 2019-ncov virus in the destination cities elsewhere the results from our analysis provide valuable causal evidence on the role of human mobility restrictions on the containment and delay of the spread of contagious viruses including the 2019-ncov virus that is now ravaging the world enhanced social distancing in the destination cities and if an epicenter can be identified as was the case for the city of wuhan in china a lockdown can play crucial roles in flattening the daily infection cases curve giving the stressed medical system a chance to regroup and deal with the onslaught of new infection cases although our study focuses exclusively on the effect of human mobility restrictions on the spread of 2019-ncov virus in china our estimated results can have general implications to other countries in their fight against the novel coronavirus  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in

coronavirus disease 2019 is spreading throughout the world and all healthcare systems are loaded beyond its capacity the virus is named as sars-cov-2 in this situation rational decisions need to be made on how the care is provided for patients with covid-19 the incidence report general symptoms and readily available testing kits different control strategies the basic compartmental model and some of the current research on the epidemiology of the disease are discussed and previously published models are reviewed modeling this disease helps in understanding the spread and predict its future to evaluate different control strategies social distancing contact tracing and hospitalization compartmental modeling framework is used in this work the non-linear equations are formulated and fitted to the cumulative case and mortality data analytical analysis along with uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis is performed and the conditions to achieve disease free equilibrium is evaluated finally different control strategies are simulated to show their importance this paper aims to shows the advantage of mathematical modeling and their simulations in times like now during which the covid-19 spreading like wildfire it also includes pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in the modeling the simulations are performed for the model fit to cumulative case and mortality data in the united states of america the reproduction number is found to be 271914  medrxiv preprint hands should be cleaned with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water our hands mostly touch different surfaces when we go out virus sticks to ones hands and can infect us therefore it is important to wash our hands regularly to prevent the infection elderly people are affected the most compared to the young population mortality rate for people in 75 to 84 years is in the range of 4-10 and the rate goes up to an average 20 for people who are more than 85 years old 22 4  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international

model the epidemiology and stop the spread of the novel coronavirus which is causing huge detrimental effects all around the world the ultimate goal is to slow the spread of the virus using evidence based public health interventions which includes early case recognition isolation and contact tracing this disease has grown from being a small cluster of pneumonia in china to a global pandemic causing huge loss of life therefore there is a huge need for modeling the disease and simulation of various control strategy implementation is necessary to make well informed decisions incidence is the number of new cases of coronavirus in a particular population in a period of time in general incidence is reported for each countrys population the table below gives the incidence of all the country that has been affected majorly 27 april 2020 1 the incidence per 1million calculated in the table gives a better picture than the number of cases on how the country is affected for example by comparing india and singapore india has twice the number of cases than in singapore and it does not mean that india more is affected the incidence per 1 million for singapore is more than 100 time to that of indias it is because the population of singapore is far less than india the death per 1million data also gives the information on how each country is handling the infected cases among all the countries spain is in a very bad state with a mortality rate of 1116 the united states of america has the most number of cases 12 million as of may 8th 2020 and has more than 75000 deaths the coronavirus spreads mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets from an infected person via coughs or sneezes these droplets can go into people who are nearby it spreads when people are near to each other the droplets do not hang around in the air and can not go more than six feet from the source about two meters covid-19 spreads sustainably in a community in many affected regions people are getting infected with the virus mostly without knowing where they are infected people also get infected when they come in contact with an infected surface and then touches their eyes or face symptoms for covid-19 is not constant and ranges from mild disease to severe illness symptoms usually appears 14 days after being exposed to the virus major indications of covid-19 are cough shortness of breath or difficulty breathing fever chills muscle pain sore throat new loss of taste or smell 2  medical attention should be sought immediately if the following symptoms are noticed trouble breathing persistent pain or pressure in the chest new confusion or inability to arouse bluish lips or face 2  with the restricted availability of testing kits not everyone is eligible for being tested if it only causes mild illness people are asked to recover at their home itself decisions on who to be tested are made by health departments and healthcare providers by the end of april a viral test has been authorized by the us food and drug administration fda that lets people to collect a respiratory sample a swab inside of the nose at home and send it to a laboratory for analysis in most areas the collection kits were made available via healthcare workers 3   things to do to implement social distancing avoid contact with people who could be at risk avoid public places gathering and crowds avoid clinics and hospitals and avoid restaurants it is every individuals responsibility to prevent this virus from spreading and social distancing is a way collective effort in stopping the spread of this disease in case of 3 emergencies in which we can not avoid going to different places one should maintain at least a distance of 6 feet from one another contact tracing is carried out by a public health staff they get data from the patients with coronavirus to help everyone they have had contacted during the previous weeks while they were infectious the identity of the patient is not revealed for their privacy traced individuals are given information on the risk of being infected and are asked to separate themselves from other susceptible people and check for symptoms and illness they are asked to monitor their body temperature twice a day and if they have symptoms they should isolate themselves and report to a health care worker hospitalization or isolation is the process of separating the sick people from the non sick ones with a steady rise in new cases of coronavirus hospitals are working at maximum capacity and infected individuals are admitted only when they show severe symptoms or have extreme illness temporary medical clinics can be setup in areas where most infections occur can reduce the spread of the disease quarantines are used by governments to prevent the spread of the virus it is especially for individuals have no symptoms but were exposed to the sickness it is important to keep them separated from susceptible people so that they dont infect others without their knowledge quarantines are used during an outbreak or an epidemic or during a pandemic it has been debated whether masks are effective or not the truth is that it works the effect of face masks is illustrated very clearly in the paper to mask or not to mask 14  both hands should be cleaned before wearing the mask there should be no gaps between ones face and the mask never touch the mask and discard them in a closed bin quickly once they are damp masks are effective only if the hands are washed properly and the used masks are disposed properly individuals with medical conditions like heartlung disease or diabetes are at a greater risk for developing serious illness due to the disease 4  people who are most affected are ones with the following conditions asthma immunocompromised conditions severe obesity chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis and liver diseases the kermack-mckendrick model 5 is a sir epidemiological model it explains the rapid rise and fall in the number of infected cases reported in an epidemic the model assumes that there is no change in the total population size ie no vital dynamics and deaths due to disease and that there is no incubation period the model has three nonlinear odes where s is the number of susceptible people i is the number of infected people r is the number of recovered people who gained immunity  is the infection rate and  is the recovery rate the reproduction number of this model is was called as epidemiological threshold to control the disease outbreak r 0 should be less than 1 this basic model structure first published in 1927 have been developed into many complex epidemiological models over a century and currently there are thousands of published models this paper also uses the same type of modeling methodology as there are many uncertainties in hoe the corona-virus is spreading there is is a huge need for modeling the spread of the disease many papers are being published once the pandemic began the most predominant modeling papers are discussed here a mathematical model for simulating the transmission of wuhan novel coronavirus 6 is a different paper than other modeling papers being published they have developed a bats-hosts-reservoir-people transmission network model they have simplified their model as reservoir-people transmission network it is a brief paper with the modeling framework the nonlinear equations and the first generation method derivation for the reproduction number  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity a mathematical model for the novel coronavirus epidemic in wuhan china 7  the model is a basic seir compartments with a v compartmentconcentration of the coronavirus in the environmental reservoir at the end the model also includes the vital dynamics of the population they got a high reproduction number estimate of 425 the inclusion of the vital dynamics in the model seems to have increased the ability of the disease to spread more it is also noticeable that they have modeled three different transmission rate for every class that can be infectious the paper is concentrated towards wuhan and therefore the dynamics vary a little from other modeling papers report 9 impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions npis to reduce covid19 mortality and healthcare demand 16 this report is a very important because many policies in the uk and other countries are made based on it it discusses about various non-pharmaceutical interventions that are aimed at reducing contact rates in the population and the conclusion was that no intervention can impact the contact rate if they are implemented separately all interventions should be implemented to achieve a synergistic effect forecasting the impact of the first wave of the covid-19 1 pandemic on hospital demand and deaths for the usa and 2 european economic area countries 8  this paper used data identification tools and statistical modeling to model the disease they have predicted a huge demand for hospital and icu bed-days and their estimation of the number of deaths of around 1584737 in usa from the first wave of seems unlikely this gives us an idea on how compartmental modeling is better than statistical data analysis for epidemiological models flattening the curve before it flattens us hospital critical care capacity limits and mortality from novel coronavirus sars-cov2 cases in us counties 9  this paper concentrates on the relation between available critical care and deaths that occurs when critical care bed limits are exceeded they have devised for 4 critical care surge response scenarios their concern is that the mortality data does not include normal patients with injury who could not get treated due to suddenly overloaded healthcare system to mask or not to mask modeling the potential for face maskuse by the general public to curtail the covid-19 pandemic 14  this paper considers the importance of face mask in the prevention of the disease two models one with no mask use and the other with mask use and control strategies are created simulations are done in both these models and the results are compared it talks about inward efficiency prevention from catching the disease and outward efficiency preventing the transmission of the disease the model for the exponentially decaying infectious contact rate in this work is inspired from this paper the model is parameterized for the data for new york and washington they found that the usage of masks have a huge impact than what we already believed it to have a case study of the covid-19 coronavirus mathematical modeling of epidemic diseases 10  this paper deals with simple models but demonstrated the effects of various control strategies it begins with an explanation of the basic sir model cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available

seir models for the coronavirus the paper also compares two scenarios where in one the recovered people gets lifetime immunity and the other has re-susceptible factor in the model other simulations such as short lock down and healthcare system saturation is also presented refined compartmental models asymptomatic carriers and covid-19 11  this paper talks about the various possible compartmental models which can be used as the base model for the novel coronavirus a discussion on these models modified seir splitting the exposed group into different compartments and including asymptomatic population explains them well this paper is highly illustrative with many simulations construction of compartmental models for covid-19 with quarantine lockdown and vaccine interventions 12  many epidemiological models are formed and the dynamics are analysed they also explore the transmissibility of the viral infection during different control strategies like quarantine lock-downs and vaccinations the dynamics of coronavirus is simulated for the data in ghana it is interesting to see that the basic reproduction number is less than 1 and they expect that the disease will be gone in two to four months the graphical representation of the model framework used in this work is inspired from this paper modeling the spread of covid-19 with comsol multiphysics 13  comsol multiphysics is a virtual dynamical simulation software they have used the software to simulate the compartmental models with an aim to flatten the curve they have presented a basic seir model an a seir model with many sub-compartments of exposed and infectious class it is amazing how a physics simulation software can be used to simulate dynamics of epidemiology  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made

hospitalized icuand recovered with the classes respectively denoted st et pt it at ht ct and rt in addition a cumulative death class is also included and is denoted as dt after the incubation period in exposed class they become infectious but they are pre-symptomatic for a period a part of them eventually become symptomatic and the others asymptomatic a fraction of detected infectious individuals by symptoms for it class by contact tracing for at class are moved to the hospitalized class non-icu ht where they are isolated from general public some fraction of hospitalized patients ultimately require critical care and they are moved to hospitalized icu class some fraction recover and some die in the classes it at ht and ct based on these assumptions the deterministic model for the transmission dynamics of covid-19 is given by the framework in figure 1  and the corresponding deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations is given below where n is the total population n

during when they started to implement preventive measures it decreases to  min as the time passes at the rate of r  min required to get to disease free equilibrium is calculated from conditions for the basic reproduction number the  min and r are fixed during the model fitting process  the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic carriers compared to symptomatic carriers and it is assumed that symptomatic individuals are 50 more infectious than the asymptomatic people 16  the value is set to 044  is the transition from exposed to pre-symptomatic class where 1  is the incubation period average 5 days 17 for coronavirus so the value of  is 1 5   p is the transition from pre-symptomatic to infectious class i or a calculated similar to  the period of stay in this class is an average 3 days this virus continues to spread across the country because we have asymptomatic transmitters and we have individuals who are transmitting 48 hours before they become symptomatic -cdc director 19  f is the fraction of pre-symptomatic individuals who eventually becomes asymptomatic there is a lot of uncertainty in this fraction 20  the average value is set to be 05  i h is the rate of hospitalization of symptomatic people the median interval from symptom onset to admission was 7 days interquartile range iqr  3-9 days 21  the percentage of hospitalization is 20 22  so  i h  1702  0028  a is the rate at which asymptotic individuals are detected using contact tracing and hospitalized it is the product of the percentage of contact-tracing execution and the rate of asymptomatic hospitalization contact tracing reduced the time taken to identify and isolate patients after onset of symptoms to 27 days 23  ct ia control variable varied in the simulations default ct is taken to be 01 therefore default  a is 12701  0037  h c is the rate of icu admission from hospitalization in a study by chen wang et al 25  of the patients hospitalised 32 required admission to an intensive care unit in another report from imperial college 24  they calculate bed demand numbers assuming a total duration of stay in hospital of 8 days if critical care is not required and 16 days with 10 days in icu if critical care is required with 30 of hospitalised cases requiring criticalcare they obtained an overall mean duration of hospitalisation of 104days slightly shorter than the duration from hospital admission to discharge observed for covid-19 cases internationally therefore if someone needs critical care on an average they stay in the hospital for 6 days before moving to icu so  h c  16032  00533 also  h  the recovery rate of hospitalized people for whom critical care is not required is 18 and  c  the recovery rate of hospitalized in need of icu is 19 26  both  i  the recovery rate of symptomatic individuals and  a  the recovery rate of asymptomatic individuals is on an average found to be 17 it is because on an average the people in these classes recover in 7 days  i  the death rate of symptomatic individuals it is found that the average duration between the onset of symptoms and death is 22 days 26  the mortality rate among the cases found is 34 28  so  i  1220034  000154  a is the death rate of the asymptomatic population is assumed to be half of  i 29 so  a   i  2  000077  h death rate hospitalized -non icu it is found that the average duration between hospitalization and death is 8 days 26  with the mortality rate of 34  h  180034  000425  c death rate hospitalized -icu it is found that the average duration between icu admission and death is 7 days

is fitted to be 116562 even though the model fits the death data nicely the the number of cases through the time simulated is underestimated and the initial case number i0 is overestimated therefore

models this spectral radius is called as the basic reproduction number of the model r 0  therefore in order to get the corona-virus to disease free equilibrium the r 0 given above should be less than 1 currently the  value is found to be approximately 05 therefore by using all the default values given in table 2  r 0 is found to be 271914 in the r 0 equation after taking  out as a common factor it has three parts summed up together which needs to be decreased in order to bring r 0 to be less than one the first part    p  is a constant term since both  and  p is fixed and can not be controlled using the default values this fraction is calculated to be 132  i h  i  i  with default values for the uncontrollable variables f  i and  i  the only controllable variable is  i h the rate of hospitalization of the symptomatic people to reduce the value of this whole fraction  i h needs to be increased by reducing the number of days it takes to admit individuals after symptom onset this can be implemented by increasing the number of temporary hospitalization facilities in places where the cases are increasing steadily and by increasing testing speed and availability if the maximum possible  i h 0033 is considered the second part is calculated to be 27846 the third part f cta h  a  a  with default values for the uncontrollable variables  f  a   a  and  a h  the only controllable variable is ct the percentage of contact tracing execution if ct is implemented at maximum capacity 07 the third part is calculated to be 05446 therefore when the maximum possible rate of hospitalization is executed and contact tracing is implemented in full capacity 14  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a

even when the hospitalization rates are increased and the contact tracing is implemented at full potential as presented in the report from the center of evidence based medicine 20  the percentage of people remaining asymptomatic varies drastically in many different case studies therefore analyzing uncertainty in f is important as seen in the figure 4  even 10 deviation of f from the default value causes a huge difference in the model simulation it is always better to expect the worst case scenario in situations like this and make decisions so that many lives can be saved it can also be observed that the actual data till 427 lies well within the range and the future data is expected to be within the limits till 0828 as shown in the simulations the infectiousness vary from person to person this factor is very sensitive and affects the predictions hugely therefore analyzing uncertainty in  is also important as seen in the figure 5  even 4 to 6 deviation of  from the default value causes a huge difference in the model simulation it is always better to expect the worst case scenario in situations like this and make decisions so that many lives can be saved it can also be

important to analyze how changes in control parameters of our mathematical model affects the whole model this can be done by analyzing correlation of the parameters with reproduction number the correlation between r 0 and  is clear from the r 0 equation they are positively correlated all the parameters in the equation is positive therefore r 0 and  has a positive correlation when  is increased r 0 is also increased therefore to keep the reproduction number as low as possible the infectious contact rate must be maintained as low as possible this can be done by implementing various control strategies such as social distancing the correlation between r 0 and ct all the parameters in the equation is positive therefore 16  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available

implementation of contact tracing of asymptomatic individuals is crucial and it must be maintained as high as possible the correlation between r 0 and  i h all the parameters in the equation is positive therefore r 0 and  i h also has a negative correlation when  i h is increased r 0 decreases therefore to keep the reproduction number as low as possible the hospitalization rate should be be maintained as high as possible one key difference between isolation by contact tracing and hospitalization is that when people are traced they dont even know that they could be sick but for hospitalization a patient need to have a severe illness simulations of the epidemiological model is performed in matlab the differential equations are solved using the function called ode45 which solves non-stiff differential equations using medium order method the sample code is given in the appendix for reference three control strategies social distancing contact tracing asymptotic population and increasing hospitalization rate are simulated and the parameters responsible for implementing these strategies are varied and plotted together to analyze and compare these kind of simulations helps in making decisions during a pandemic strict rules on social distancing should be implemented and followed to prevent the spread of the disease the simulation in figure 6 shows that if strategies to increase social distancing are implemented that is reducing  the number of new cases can be reduced and the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is quicker the number of estimated deaths also decreases by a significant amount in the order of 10 5  two new conditions with   1 and   05 are simulated along with previously simulated model and the plots are shown in figure 6 for comparison the time taken to reach reasonably low number of cases is reduced by at least two weeks considering that the control measures are implemented continuously the best possible time to remove social distancing without getting the disease back again would be by early august of 2020  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv

the government stuggling to handle the economy the social distancing control measure is expected to be stopped in may2020 bringing a lot of concern on how to stop the spread the plot of simulations in 7 shows what will be the situation if that happens say from 0520 the number of cases will start to rise again this eventually will force us to maintain social distancing again therefore there will be a bigger peak in the number of reported cases and it will take 5 more months to get out of this situation the number of deaths will also increase as it takes longer to stop the spread of the disease

this version posted may 18 2020  the plot of simulations in 8 shows what will be the situation if the same thing happens from 0609 the number of cases will start to rise again this eventually will force us to maintain social distancing again even though the peak in the number of reported cases is not increased more than what was already reached it will take more than 8-9 months to get out of this situation this shows us how important social distancing is  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 18 2020  distancing at all after 0609 the simulation is frightening as the number of cases goes upto 40 million the majority of new infections are created by infected people who is showing no symptoms they can either be totally asymptomatic or presymptomatic to reduce the spread through them contact tracing should be implemented it is done by finding about all the people who were contacted by symptomatic individuals in the last two weeks if they are tested to be positive of the disease then they are hospitalised it is also possible that the person traced was the one actually who got infected when they got in contact with this symptomatic person either way contact tracing is a way to find and isolate people who could potentially carry the virus around and causing new infections this process of isolating those who could potentially carry the disease around is not executed at full potential because not everyone who are exposed or asymptomatic can be found out by tracing previous contacts the simulations in figure 10 shows the predictions for two new values for the percentage of contact tracing implementation  ct  03 and ct  07 along with the default value of 01 there is significant reduction in the number of cases over the month of may and after it can also be seen that the number of recorded death estimate increases this is because the people who will die from this disease without knowing they had the disease are now found and tested using contact tracing and their deaths are recorded hospitals are struggling to handle the load of new cases therefore it is reasonable to increase the number of temporary facilities and in many areas as possible this will reduce the time taken from symptom onset to hospital admission and thus the hospitalization increases  i h is increased in the simulations as shown in figure 11  two new rates - i h  004 in which takes 5 days to hospitalize someone and  i h  005 in which takes 4 days to hospitalize someone are simulated it can be seen that there is a decrease in the number of reported case estimate increasing  i h did not impact the number of cumulative deaths very much as seen in the simulations below from the simulations of the three control strategies social distancing seems to have a bigger reduction in the number of diagnosed cases no single control meothod will give the best result it is only when all the control strategies are implemented the considerable change is seen a good compartmental framework of the model is designed by including all major classes of people the most unnoticed classes during the modeling process of the coronavirus are the pre-symptomatic people and those that are in need of critical care they are included in the model and the model parameters are defined using the data from various research papers official reports and interviews once the parameters are fixed model is fitted to the cumulative case and mortality data given by john hopkins university the fit gave the values for  0 to be 133877 and i0 to be 5849 which actual infected cases in the us on march 1 2020

this version posted may 18 2020  different aspects of the model have been analyzed and the effect of various control strategies have been simulated the disease free equilibrium is discussed and using the threshold analysis basic contact rate to achieve dfe is calculated to be 0215 the basic reproduction number is also calculated using the default values and is found to be 271914 which is in the range similar to what most modeling papers produce uncertainty in the fraction of the infectious people being asymptomatic and in the infectiousness of people with no symptoms are simulated and the worst case scenarios are found in the worst case the number of cases can go up to 19 million by second week of march 2020 the death toll can go up to 05 million by the end of august 2020 basic sensitivity analysis is performed and the correlation between different control parameters and the basic reproduction number are found  0 is the positively correlated and therefore should be reduced the contact tracing implementation and hospitalization rate of symptomatic people are inversely correlated and therefore they must be increased as much as possible the control strategies are simulated and the results are analyzed the social distancing strategy seem to be best possible one right now with the absence of vaccines it is better to prevent the disease if the social distancing strategy was highly implemented as shown in the simulations the number of cases during the peak can be reduced up to 11 million the duration of the implementation is also reduced by at least two weeks other simulations have also been added to discuss what will happen if the social distancing is stopped in mid of may 2020 or june 2020 and then the control measure is followed again if the distancing is stopped in may and implemented again it will take till the end of the year to recover from the disease if the distancing is stopped in june and implemented again it will take us to first few months of next year which is not a welcomed situation another simulation in which the social distancing is stopped totally on 0609 is plotted and the results are alarming the peak will drastically rise up to 40 million and the death toll will go upto 45 million fortunately this will not happen because the control measure can not be stopped abruptly as done in the simulations and the government will take actions before something like that happens another control strategy is contact tracing of asymptomatic individuals the simulations shows that the number of cases can be decreases though the change is not as predominant as it was in the case of social distancing anyhow implementing contact tracing along with social distancing will produce a good improvement of the control of the disease the last control measure simulated was the hospitalization rate increasing this rate is difficult  but even minor changes can bring a huge change the current time it takes to hospitalize someone showing symptoms is 7 days the simulation shows the effect of reducing this time to 5 and 4 days as the rate increases to 005 that is 4 days for  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available

coronavirus that emerged from wuhan city of china in late december 2019 continue to pose devastating public health and economic challenges across the world although the community-wide implementation of basic non-pharmaceutical intervention measures such as social-distancing quarantine of suspected covid-19 cases isolation of confirmed cases use of face masks in public and contact-tracing have been quite effective in curtailing and mitigating the burden of the pandemic it is universally believed that the use of an anti-covid-19 vaccine is necessary to build the community herd immunity needed to effectively control and eliminate the pandemic this study is based on the design and use of a mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of a hypothetical imperfect anti-covid-19 vaccine on the control of covid-19 an analytical expression for the minimum number of unvaccinated susceptible individuals needed to be vaccinated to achieve vaccine-induced community herd immunity is derived the epidemiological consequence of the herd immunity threshold is that the disease can be effectively controlled or eliminated if the minimum herd immunity threshold is achieved in the community simulations of the model using baseline parameter values obtained from fitting the model with mortality  in december 2019 the wuhan municipal health commission china reported a cluster of a pneumonia-like illness caused by a coronavirus sars-cov in wuhan hubei province of china 1 2 3  the disease rapidly spread to many countries resulting in the world health organization declaring the novel coronavirus covid-19 as a pandemic on march 11 2020 1 2 4  as of may 8 2020 covid-19 has caused over 4 million confirmed cases 19 vaccine on the transmission dynamics of the covid-19 pandemic the model will be parametrized using available covid-19 mortality data for the us the state of new york and the state of florida to estimate important parameters related to vaccination and other control intervention notably the parameter related to the reduction in community contacts we develop a basic model for assessing the population-level impact of a potential hypothetical anti-covid-19 vaccine the model is developed by splitting the total human population at time t denoted by n t into the mutually-exclusive compartments of unvaccinated susceptible s u t vaccinated susceptible s v t exposed et symptomatically-infectious i s t asymptomatically-infectious i a t hospitalized i h t and recovered rt individuals thus it should be emphasized that the epidemiological compartment i a also contain individuals who may show mild symptoms of the disease furthermore the compartment i h for hospitalization also includes those with clinical symptoms of covid-19 who are self-isolating at home the model is given by the following deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations where a dot represents differentiation with respect to time t a flow diagram of the model is depicted in figure 1  the state variables and parameters of the model are described in tables 1 and 2  respectively in the model 21 the parameter  s  a  represents the effective contact rate ie contacts capable of leading to covid-19 transmission for symptomatically-infectious asymptomaticallyinfectious individuals 0  c m  1 is the proportion of members of the public who wear face-masks correctly and consistently in public and 0  m  1 is the efficacy of the face-masks this formulation ie  s   a  allows us to account for the possible heterogeneity in the contact rates of infectious with i s  or without i a  clinical symptoms of covid-19 unvaccinated susceptible individuals are vaccinated at a per capita rate  v  it is assumed that the hypothetical anti-covid-19 vaccine is imperfect ie it allows for breakthrough infected in vaccinated susceptible individuals who became infected with covid- 19  with a protective efficacy 0   v  1 against covid-19 the parameter  represents the progression rate of exposed individuals ie 1 is the intrinsic incubation period of  a proportion 0  r  1 of exposed individuals show no clinical symptoms of covid-19 and move to the class i a  at the end of the incubation period the remaining proportion 1  r show clinical symptoms and move to the i s class the parameter  s  a  h  represents the recovery rate for individuals in the i s i a i h  class similarly  s is the hospitalization or self-isolation rate of individuals with clinical symptoms of covid-19 finally the parameter  s  h  represents the covid-induced mortality rate for individuals in the i s i h  class it should be mentioned that since not much data is available on the expected properties of a future anti-covid-19 vaccine we do not assume that the vaccine offers any therapeutic benefits further we do not assume that the vaccine wanes during the one-year time period we would choose for the numerical simulations of our model the model 21 is an extension of numerous deterministic models for the transmission dynamics of covid-19 pandemic such as those in 4 11  by explicitly incorporating an imperfect anti-covid-19 vaccine to

1020097428 doi medrxiv preprint it is convenient to define the quantity r c by where  is the spectral radius the quantity r c is the control reproduction number of the model 21 it measures the average number of new covid-19 cases generated by a typical infectious individual introduced into a population where a certain fraction is protected eg vaccinated with the hypothetical vaccine against covid-19 it is the sum of the constituent reproduction numbers associated with the number of new cases generated by symptomatically-infectious humans r is  and asymptomatically-infectious r ia  individuals the reproduction number r c will now be interpreted epidemiologically below as stated above the reproduction number r c is the sum of the two constituent reproduction numbers r is and r ia  the constituent reproduction number r is is given by the product of the infection rate of unvaccinated and vaccinated susceptible individuals by symptomatically-infectious humans near the dfe  the proportion of exposed individuals that survived the incubation period and moved to the symptomaticallyinfectious class 1r   1  r and the average duration in the asymptomatically-infectious class  the proportion that survived the exposed class and moved to the asymptomatically-infectious class r   r and the average duration in the i a class 1 a  the sum of r is and r ia gives r v  the result below follows from theorem 2 of 17  the epidemiological implication of theorem 31 is that a small influx of covid-19 cases will not generate a covid-19 outbreak if the control reproduction number r c  is less than unity the basic reproduction number of the model 21 denoted by r 0  obtained by setting the control-related parameters and state variables ie c m   m   v and s  v  to zero in 31 is given by the quantity r 0 represents the average number of secondary infections generated by a typical infected individual introduced into a completely susceptible population during the duration of the infectiousness of the individual some of the parameters for model 21 were extracted or estimated based on covid-19 information from the literature table 3 a while the rest see table 3 b were estimated using mortality data for the entire us the state of new york and florida 19 20 21 22  a nonlinear least squares method was used to determine the set of parameters that minimizes the sum of the squares of the differences between the cumulative death predictions of the model  and cumulative covid-induced mortality with increasing effectiveness of social-distancing as expected for instance while figure 3 shows that up to 120000 cumulative mortality can be recorded in the us if social-distancing measures were not implemented the cumulative mortality dramatically decreases to about 64000 representing about 47 reduction in cumulative mortality if strict social-distancing measures were implemented figure 3 b similarly 80 and 70 reductions in cumulative mortality are respectively obtained for the states of new york figures 3 c and d and florida figures 3 e and f these results are consistent with those reported by ngonghala et al 4  which was based on using a novel mathematical model that incorporates the main nonpharmaceutical interventions against covid-19 ie the model in 4 does not incorporate an anti-covid-19 vaccine this article is a us government work it is not subject

vaccine-preventable diseases not all susceptible individuals can be immunized for various reasons such as they are too young to be vaccinated vaccinating infants or young children can sometimes harm the infantschildren they have co-morbidities and weakened immune system and vaccinating may make their prognosis worse they are of advanced age or they opt out for cultural traditional or religious reasons the question then is what is the minimum proportion of those we can vaccinate that we need to vaccinate so that those that we cannot vaccinate can be protected from developing severe disease or dying of the disease the notion of herd immunity in the transmission dynamics is associated with the indirect protection against acquisition of a communicable disease members of the community receive when a large percentage of the population has become immune to the infectious disease due to natural recovery from prior infection or vaccination 30 31  the consequence of herd immunity is that individuals who are not immune eg those who cannot be vaccinated or those who have not been infected yet receive some protection against the acquisition of the disease the safest and fastest way to achieve herd immunity is obviously vaccination it should however be mentioned that sweden employed the other mechanism for achieving herd immunity in the context of covid-19 dynamics in sweden 32  in other words the swedish public health agencies aimed to build herd immunity by not implementing the basic community transmission reduction strategies eg social-distancing community lockdowns use of face masks in public contact tracing etc implemented in almost every country or community that is hard-hit with the covid-19 pandemic opting instead to allow individuals to acquire infection and hopefully recover from it although some level of this natural herd immunity has been achieved in sweden the covid-induced mortality recorded in sweden far exceed those recorded for neighbouring scandinavian countries that implemented the aforementioned non-pharmaceutical interventions 32  in this section a theoretical condition for achieving community-wide vaccine-induced herd immunity is derived let f v be the fraction of unvaccinated susceptible individuals that have been vaccinated at the disease-free steady-state that is further let it follows from 31 34 and 35 that the control reproduction number r c  can then be re-written in terms of f v and g v  as follows which can be simplified as setting r c  1 in 37 and solving for f v  gives the following vaccine-induced herd immunity threshold for the model 21 it follows from 37 and 38 that r c  1 whenever f v  f c v  hence we achieved the following results theorem 32 consider the model 21 the use of an imperfect anti-covid-19 vaccine will have the following the result of theorem 32 is numerically-illustrated in figure 4  showing an increase in the cumulative covidinduced mortality when f v  f c v and a decrease when f v  f c v  in order to compute the community herd immunity thresholds for the us new york state and florida state we compute the respective values of r 0  using 38 with the baseline values of the community contact rates parameters  a and  s  reduced by 30 to account for the effect of the implementation of effective social-distancing measures 4  that is we set  a  08400  s  04971 for us  a  05648  s  03871 for new york state and  a  07675  s  04621 for the state of florida in equation 38 to obtain the values of the basic reproduction number r 0  for the us new york state and the state of florida this gives r 0  358 304 and 312 respectively substituting these values of r 0 for each of the three populations in equation 37 and noting that the vaccine efficacy is assumed to be 80 ie  v  08 shows that the respective vaccine-derived community herd immunity thresholds for the entire us the state of new york and the state of florida are 90 84 and 85 respectively as tabulated in table 4  the epidemiological implication of these analyses is that the pandemic can be effectively controlled andor eliminated in the us and the states of new york and florida if at least 90 84 and 85 of the respective unvaccinated susceptible populations are vaccinated using the hypothetical imperfect vaccine with the assumed protective efficacy of 80 it should be mentioned that these vaccine-derived community herd immunity percentages significantly decrease if the vaccination program is complemented with a public face mask use strategy in particular table 4 shows that the herd immunity threshold for the us reduced to about 78 if half the us population wears mask in public  face mask usage with compliance of 30 to 50 decreases the herd immunity thresholds for the states of new york and florida to between 70 to 78 these are reasonably attainable in the two states thus these simulations show that combining a vaccination program using the hypothetical anti-covid-19 vaccine with assumed efficacy of 80 with a public mask use strategy significantly enhances the prospect of covid-19 elimination in the states of new york and florida and the in entire us nation albeit elimination is easier to achieve in either of the two states than in the entire us nation table 3 with  a  08400  s  04971 for us  a  05648  s  03871 for new york and  a  07675  s  04621 for florida corresponding to an assumed 30 reduction in the baseline value of  a and  s  to account for the effect of the implementation of social-distancing measures  the model 21 is now simulated to assess the population-level impact of the hypothetical imperfect anti-covid-19 vaccine in the entire us and the us states of new york and florida the population-level impact of the vaccination rate  v  on the burden of the pandemic is monitored first of all in these simulations the public face mask use strategy is not implemented the model 21 is then simulated using the baseline parameter values in table 3 with c m   m  0 and various values of  v  the results obtained depicted in figure 5  show that for the worst-case scenario without vaccination and public mask usage ie the model 21 with  v  s v   m  c m  0 the us could record up to 4000 daily deaths at the pandemic peak  figure 5 a  while the states of new york  figure 5 c and florida  figure 5 e could record up to 2000 and 1500 daily deaths at the pandemic peaks respectively the corresponding projected cumulative mortality for the entire us the state of new york and the state of florida for the period february 21 2020 to september 20 2020 are 120000 66473 and 47000 respectively these simulations show a dramatic reduction in the daily and the cumulative covid-induced mortality in comparison to the worst-case scenario without vaccination and mask usage with increasing values of the vaccination rate  v from its baseline value in particular a 10-fold increase in the baseline value of  v for the 10 for use under a cc0 license this article is

the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 14 2020   other parameter values used are as given in table 3  us resulted in a decrease in the daily number of deaths at the pandemic peak from 4000 to 2800 representing a 30 reduction  figure 5 a  furthermore this corresponds to a decrease in the projected cumulative mortality from 120000 to 98000 similarly a 30-fold increase in the baseline value of  v resulted in a marked reduction of the daily deaths at the pandemic peak to 800 corresponding to a decrease in the projected cumulative mortality from 120000 to 50000 it is evident from figure 5 that a 10-fold increase in the baseline value of the vaccination rate  v  for the states of new york figures 5 c and d and florida figures 5 e and f will bring the respective daily deaths at the peak and the projected cumulative mortality to very low levels ie low levels that essentially imply the effective control or elimination of the pandemic thus these simulations suggest that while a significantly large increase in vaccination rate from baseline is necessarily needed to eliminate covid-19 from the entire us only a small increase as low as 10 in the baseline vaccination rate will be needed to eliminate covid-19 in the states of new york and florida these simulations further show that the prospect of disease elimination using the vaccine with the assumed protective efficacy of 80 is more promising in the states of new york and florida than nationwide where much larger vaccination coverage will be needed to bring and maintain the control reproduction number r c  to a value less than unity simulations were also carried out to assess the impact of vaccine efficacy and coverage on this disease dynamics this is done for the special case of the model in the absence of the use of masks in the public ie the model 21 with c m   m  0 specifically a contour plot of the control reproduction number r c  of the model as a function of coverage f v  and vaccine efficacy  v  is depicted in figure 6  this figure shows a decrease in the value of the reproduction number with increasing coverage and efficacy of the vaccine as expected for the assumed 80 efficacy of the hypothetical vaccine ie  v  08 in table 3 a the simulations depicted in figure  6 a show that nationwide elimination of covid-19 can be achieved ie r c can be brought to a value below unity if at least 90 of the us populace is vaccinated for the state of new york it is shown that such elimination can also occur if the state-wide vaccination coverage is at least 84 figure 6 b  similarly figure 6 c shows that the hypothetical anti-covid-19 vaccine can lead to the elimination of the pandemic from the state of florida if at least 85 of the residents of the state are vaccinated the effect of the combined implementation of vaccination and social-distancing strategies on the control reproduction number of the model 21 is also monitored for the us and the two us states of new york and florida by generating contour plots of r c  as a function of vaccine coverage and efficacy for three levels low moder-11 for use under a cc0 license this article is a

covid-19 elimination measured in terms of bringing r c to a value less than unity is feasible even if social-distancing is implemented at a low level of effectiveness left panels of figure 7  in particular figure 7 a shows that with the assumed 80 efficacy of the vaccine the implementation of social-distancing at low effectiveness level will lead to the elimination of covid-19 in the us if the nationwide vaccination coverage is at least 88 this vaccination coverage needed to achieve such elimination decreases with increasing effectiveness of the social-distancing measures figures 7 b and c  for the state of new york for instance vaccination program combined with social-distancing at low effectiveness level will lead to covid-19 elimination if at least 80 of the residents of the state are vaccinated figure 7 b  the vaccination coverage needed for elimination decrease to 67 and 61 respectively if the social-distancing measures are implemented at moderate figure 7 e and high  figure  7 f effectiveness levels finally for the state of florida combining vaccination with social-distancing at low effectiveness level will lead to covid-19 elimination in the state if at least 80 of the residents of the state are vaccinated figure 7 g  the coverage needed for covid-19 elimination in florida decrease to 70 and 47 respectively for moderate figure 7 h and high figure 7 i effectiveness levels of the social-distancing strategy additional numerical simulations were carried out to assess the community-wide impact of the combined impact of vaccination with a public mask use strategy as measured in terms of reduction in the value of control reproduction number r c  the results obtained depicted in figure 8  show a decrease in r c with increasing vaccine efficacy and compliance for the fixed vaccine efficacy at 80 the minimum vaccine coverage needed to eliminate covid-19 in the entire us if public mask use compliance is fixed at 10 30 and 50 is 90 86 and 82 respectively figures 8 a b and c similarly covid-19 elimination can occur in the state of new york if the corresponding vaccine coverage are 82 80 and 71 respectively figures 8 d  e and f the numbers corresponding to elimination in the state of florida are 86 80 and 73 respectively figures 8 g  h and i thus the simulations in figures 7 and 8 also emphasize the fact that the prospect of covid-19 elimination using a vaccine is greatly enhanced if the vaccination program is complemented with another public health intervention such as social-distancing or the use of face masks in public particularly if the complementary intervention is implemented at moderate or high effectiveness level a novel coronavirus covid-19 emerged in china in december 2019 the virus which is caused by sars-cov-2 rapidly spread to over 210 countries causing over 4 million confirmed cases and 275000 deaths globally as of may 8 2020  although there are currently no safe and effective vaccine for use in humans numerous concerted global efforts are underway aimed at developing such vaccine in fact a number of candidate vaccines are undergoing advanced stages of clinical trials one of the most promising of these efforts is the candidate vaccine being developed by a research group at oxford university which is expected to be available as early as january 2021 or latest by the spring of 2021 we developed a mathematical model for assessing the the potential community-wide impact of a hypothetical imperfect vaccine against the covid-19 pandemic in the us the model we developed which takes the form of a deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations was parametrized using covid-19 data for the entire us as well as for the us states of new york and florida the hypothetical vaccine was assumed to offer imperfect protective efficacy against the acquisition of covid-19 infection the model we developed was rigorously analysed to gain insight into its dynamical features these analyses reveal that the continuum of disease-free equilibria of the epidemic model is locally-asymptotically stable whenever a certain epidemiological threshold known as the control reproduction number denoted by r c  is less than unity the epidemiological implication of this result is that the covid-19 pandemic can be effectively controlled whenever r c  1 if the initial sizes of the sub-populations of the model are small enough in other words for this setting the routine vaccination against covid-19 in the us can lead to the effective control of the pandemic if the efficacy and nationwide coverage of the hypothetical vaccine are high enough in particular if the vaccine efficacy and coverage are able to bring and maintain the reproduction number r c  to a value less than unity furthermore threshold quantities for the community vaccine-induced herd immunity were calculated for the entire 12 for use under a cc0 license this article is a us government work it

the us state of new york c the us state of florida parameter values used are as given in table 3 with m  cm  0 us and for the states of new york and florida we computed these thresholds for the case where social physicaldistancing is also implemented and that the social-distancing is implemented at an effectiveness level that reduces the baseline values of the community contact rate parameters  a and  s  by 30 our computations show using the baseline values of the parameters of the model that at least 90 of the entire us population needs to be vaccinated in order to achieve nationwide vaccine-derived herd immunity similarly at least 84 and 85 of the total susceptible population in the states of new york and florida respectively need to be vaccinated to achieve such herd immunity in the states these vaccine coverage numbers are certainly on the high side and may not be easily attained for so many reasons ranging from the expected insufficient stockpile of the vaccine during the early stages of their deployment general apathy towards vaccination and the sizable percentage of people that cannot be vaccinated for medical personal and other reasons our simulations showed that if the vaccination strategy is complemented with other public health interventions such as a public mask use strategy for instance the minimum herd immunity threshold required to effectively control the covid-19 pandemic significantly reduces to a more realistically-attainable level for example if vaccination using a vaccine with the assumed efficacy of 80 is combined with a public face mask strategy with 30 mask compliance nationwide the herd immunity threshold for the entire us decreases from the 90 for the mask-free scenario described above to 78 thus the prospect of the effective control of covid-19 using routine vaccination is enhanced if it is combined with a public mass use strategy especially if the effectiveness and coverage of the mask use strategy are high enough we also carried out numerical simulations to measure the population-level impact of the rate at which the hypothetical vaccination is administered the results obtained showed that the covid-19 burden as measured in terms of daily and cumulative covid-induced mortality decreases with increasing vaccination rate as expected our simulations showed that while significantly high increases in the vaccination rate from its baseline value was necessarily needed to achieve significant reduction in disease burden in the entire us a relatively small increase in the vaccination rate from its baseline value as low as 10 increase will be sufficient to lead to the effective control or even elimination of covid-19 pandemic in the states of new york and florida in other words the prospects of eliminating covid-19 using the hypothetical vaccine are more promising in the states of new york and florida than nationwide owing to the unrealistically high vaccine coverage needed to curtail or eliminate the pandemic in the latter we also simulated the combined effect of implementing the routine vaccination program with social-distancing in the absence of face mask usage we showed that covid-19 can be effectively controlled using the two interventions even if the effectiveness level of social-distancing is low as long as the vaccine coverage is high in particular our simulations showed that the control reproduction number r c  can be reduced to a value less than unity needed for the effective control of the disease in line with the local-asymptotic stability property of table 3 15 for use under a

for low moderate and high effectiveness levels for the social-distancing strategy implemented in the state of new york covid-19 elimination is feasible if the vaccine coverage is at least 80 67 and 61 respectively the corresponding figures for the us state of florida are 80 70 and 47 thus these figures suggest that covid-19 elimination using the combined vaccination and social-distancing strategy is more likely in the us state of florida followed by the us of state of new york and then nationwide we assessed the population-level impact of combining the routine vaccination strategy with a public mask use strategy our simulations show a decrease in the burden of the covid-19 pandemic again as measured in terms of reduction in the value of the reproduction number r c  with increasing efficacies and compliance of the vaccine and mask usage it was shown that for the case of the entire us if the vaccine efficacy is fixed at the assumed 80 and mask compliance is fixed at the low value of 10 covid-19 can be eliminated in the us if the vaccine coverage is at least 90 the vaccine coverage decreases to 86 and 82 respectively if mask use compliance is increased to 30 and 50 nationwide the numbers for us state of new york corresponding to the aforementioned mask use coverage are 82 80 and 71 respectively similarly the numbers for the us state of florida are 86 80 and 73 respectively again these result confirmed that covid-19 elimination is more feasible is vaccination is combined with another intervention mask use in public in this case and that such elimination is more easily attainable in the us states of new york and florida than nationwide in summary this study shows that the prospect of effectively controlling covid-19 in the states of new york and florida as well as nationwide is promising using the hypothetical imperfect anti-covid-19 vaccine the prospect of such effective control andor elimination is greatly enhanced if vaccination is combined with other interventions that limit community transmission such as social-distancing and mask use in public furthermore elimination is more likely to be achieved using a vaccine in the states of new york and florida than nationwide since the latter requires much higher and probably realistically-unattainable vaccination coverage to achieve elimination for use under a cc0 license this article is a us

interventions on the dynamics of novel coronavirus with optimal control analysis with a case study saif ullah muhammad khan altaf   the novel coronavirus infectious disease caused by the coronavirus is commonly known as covid-19 it has become the greatest challenge the history has ever seen started from wuhan city of china earlier this year it spread to the rest of the world in a few months and was declared a pandemic by the un it has paralyzed life across the globe the main cause of the virus is yet to be discovered but it is presumed that it has emerged in one the biggest animal market in the chinese city of wuhan 1 2 3 so far it has engulfed more than 210 countries of the world and according to who statistics the virus has affected around 6 million people across the world and more than 300 thousand people have died so far 1 2 3 the recovery rate is higher than the mortality rate however the ratio varies from country to country and region to region usa is the most affected country which is the epicenter of the virus followed by europe 2 scientists are struggling to discover or invent a vaccine for the treatment but it is yet to be discovered the question how long it will last is on everyones lips although research is in a very early stage and with the passage of time things will unfold the scientists are trying to dig out the main symptoms and causes of transmission however according to the information available the main symptoms are high fever severe chest pain continuous dry coughing body aches headache and difficulty in the respiratory system the spread according to available information is droplets produced by an infected person during coughing and sneezing and physical contacts etc 4 covid-19 pandemic has caused great damage not only to human lives and health it has multidimensional effects it not only exposed the weak health infrastructure even in the most advanced countries of the world but also badly affected the world economy almost the entire world is on lockdown and all the economic and business activities are halted it has shocked the largest economies of the world ie china and usa where the economic slowdown is observed since the outbreak of coronavirus the third world countries particularly pakistan are the prime targets of the economic devastation millions of people have lost their jobs in the past few months poor countries are unable to repay their debts they are even unable to support poor citizens who cannot earn their livelihood the social and political lives of the nations are affected badly people across the world have severed social relations they avoid meeting each other even in the gravest times governments of all the countries have diverted their attention and resources to cope with the challenge of this mysterious disease and thus no political activity is visible like other countries in the world covid-19 pandemic poses a huge threat to both humans health and economy in pakistan this infection is even more devastating in pakistan because the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions ie make social-distancing and community lockdowns are certainly very tough for a society like pakistan the government is unable to afford a strict nationwide lockdown the covid-19 first case was reported on 26 february 2020 in karachi which was a student come back from iran later only within three weeks the infection spread in all four provinces gilgit-baltistan azad jammu and kashmir and the federal territory of islamabad the total number of confirmed infected cases raised to 2291 across the nation and 252 new cases were reported on 1 april due to the rapid growth of infected people across the country the government of pakistan decided to put the whole nation under strict lockdown and later extended twice until 9 may due to a worse situation currently the situation in pakistan is worse and the number of confirmed cases crossed the cases reported in mainland china pakistan is placed 17th in the list of highly reported infected cases and deaths by countries territories or areas 5 6 with a total of more than 100000 confirmed covid-19 cases about 31000 patients are fully recovered and 1900 people lost their lives due to this deadly infection 7 8 mathematical models are very useful in helping us to understand the transmission dynamics and control of emerging and re-emerging communicable diseases one of the main challenges that mankind is facing nowadays is predicting the severity and suggest suitable public health intervention strategies to curtail the covid-19 pandemic recently a number of mathematical models have been proposed to explore the transmission patterns of covid-19 pandemic in 9 the authors formulated a deterministic model to explore the impact of various public interventions on the dynamic and mitigation covid-19 in ontario canada in 10 a mathematical model based on nonlinear differential equations is presented to study the dynamics of covid-19 infection in highly affected countries that are china italy and france a fractional-order covid-19 model with the atangana-bleanu-caputo operator is proposed by khan and atangana 11 and implemented the model to analyze the infection in wuhan the role of lockdown in the absence of effective vaccines and treatment in order to mitigate the covid-19 pandemic is analyzed in 12 the author has used the novel fractional-fractal operators to formulate the proposed mathematical model 12 in 13 a transmission model is formulated to predict the cumulative covid-19 cases in italy uk and usa the transmission dynamics of covid-19 in mexico are studied using mathematical and computational models in 14 the influence of non-pharmaceutical controls including quarantine hospitalization or self-isolation contact-tracing and the use of a face mask on the dynamics of covid-19 pandemic in the population of new york state and the entire usa is studied in detail in 15 the present study proposes a new transmission model to analyze the dynamics and impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the covid-19 in pakistan initially we develop the model without optimal control variables and provide a good fit to the reported cases and then estimate the model parameters using a nonlinear least square curve fitting approach further the model is reformulated by adding two times dependent control variables the rest of the manuscript is organized as the mathematical formulation of the covid-19 model is presented in section 2 basic mathematical analysis including stability results of disease-free equilibrium is explored in section 3 the model fitting to reported cases and estimation of parameters is done in section 4 the simulation results of without optimal control model are shown in section 5 the global sensitivity analysis and its graphical interpretation are depicted in section 6 the optimal control problem and its analysis of the covid-19 infection is presented in 7 finally a brief concluding remarks are given section in 8 this section presents a brief description of the proposed model to study the dynamics and possible control of the covid-19 pandemic the model is developed by dividing the whole human population at any time t denoted by nt into eight mutually exclusive sub-groups depending on the disease status  these sub-groups are  susceptible   st  exposed or latent   et infected with the disease symptoms or symptomatically infectious it  asymptotically infectious   having    no clinical symptoms iat quarantined qt hospitalized iht critically infected or intensive care patients ict  and the recoveredremoved individuals   rt so that    ntstetitiatqtihtictrt the  infected individuals showing mild symptoms of the disease are also placed in the epidemiological class iat the quarantine and isolation should be either at home or the specific centers or hospitals designated by the government further the group  ih  stand for the patients admitted into hospital also contains those with clinical symptoms of the disease who are self-isolating at home  we further assume that hospitalized people may also transmit the infection after interacting with susceptible people the transmission dynamics of the covid-19 disease is expressed through the following system of the nonlinear differential equation1dsdtiiaihnssdedtiiaihnsedidte11idiadt1e2iadqdte1qdihdtiq22ihdicdtih33icdrdt1i2ia1q2ih3icr

 the propose model 3 has a disease free equilibrium dfe given byw0s00000000000000
 next we investigate the most important and crucial threshold quantity known as the basic reproduction number and generally denoted by r0 this parameter measures the average number of new covid-19 infected cases generated by a typical infected individual when introduced into a completely susceptible population the most common approach used to obtain r0 is the next-generation method presented in 16  the next generation  matrices obtained from the model 3 are  given as followsfiiaihsn00000vk1ek2iek3ia1ek4qek5ihiqk6icihthe corresponding jacobian matrices f and v evaluated at dfe is given as belowf000000000000000000000000000000000vk100000k2000010k300000k40000k500000k6
 hence utilizing the definition r0fv1 where  represents the spectral radius we derived the following expression for the basic reproduction numberr0k4k3k51k2k5k2k3k1k2k3k4k5
 in order to interpret the basic reproductive quantity we split the expression for r0 as followsr0r0ir0ar0hwhere7r0ik1k2r0a1k1k3r0hk4k2k1k2k4k5the first term r0i in 7 shows the average number of new  covid-19 infections generated by symptomatically-infectious individuals in the i class  this term  contains  the product of the infection rate in the i class the disease transmission rate  the fraction of exposed people  that completed the incubation period and move to the symptomatic stage k1 and  the average period spend  in the i compartment 1k2   the second constituent reproduction number r0a represents the number of new covid-19 infection cases generated by asymptomatically-infectious individuals in class ia  it is the product of infectious rate due to asymptomatic coivd-19 individuals    the fraction of latent people that completed the incubation period and move to the asymptomatic stage 1k1 and the average period spent in the asymptomatic class  1k3 similarly the third constituent reproduction number r0h expresses the new covid-19 infection cases generated by hospitalizedisolated individuals  in particular the first term in  r0h represents the contribution into the hospitalized class by symptomatic infectious individuals in class i it is the product of infectious rate due to hospitalized individuals   the fraction of latent individuals that completed the incubation period and move to the asymptomatic stage 1k1 the portion of individuals that left the symptomatic class  i  and move to the hospitalized class ih k2 and the average duration in the hospitalized class 1k5 finally    the second term in   r0h expresses the contribution of quarantined individuals into the hospitalized class in this part we will prove the local and global stability of the model around the dfe the epidemiological implication of the stability result of dfe case is that a small influx of covid-19 infections cases will not generate a covid-19 outbreak if r01theorem 1

 in order to present the main theme of the algorithm  firstly   the model 3  can be comprehensively expressed as10dydtftyyt0y0
 the function f depends on time t the vectors of dependent or state  variables  y and unknown parameters  to be estimated the purpose of using the least square technique is to estimate  the best values  of model  parameter which is obtain   by minimizing the error between   the reported  data points ytl and the solution of the model ytl associated with the model parameters  the objective function used in the minimization  procedure   is given as11l1nytlytl2
 where n denotes the  available actual data points to obtain the model parameters  we aimed to minimize the following objective function12minsubjecttoeq10for more detail about this technique please see 19 21 and reference therein we investigate the proposed model fit to the reported covid-19 infected cases in pakistan using the above approach the reported cases are shown in figure 1  the model is solved using ode45 rk4 technique package which is a solver for the initial value problem in matlab then we implemented the   lsqcurvefit package to fit the model to real data and to estimate the parameters the best fit to the reported data via our model is depicted in figure 2
  it can be seen that the model simulation is in good agreement with the real data the estimated and fitted parameters are given in table 1
   the approximate value of the reproduction number based on the estimated parameters is  r0187 this section is devoted to  perform the simulation results of the covid-19 transmission model 3 the model is solved numerically using fd45 package in matlab which is base on the range-kutta fourth-order method the estimated parameter values given in table 1  are utilized in the simulation process in order to study the impact of various possible non-pharmaceutical interventions against the spread of covid-19   in pakistan      in the graphical results the various non-pharmaceutical control parameters are taken at their baseline values given in table 1  unless otherwise stated in captions   the effect of parameter   that represents the impact of effective contacts is shown in figure 3
 we have analyzed the impact of baseline social-distancing mild social-distancing 10 reduction in    moderate social-distancing  30 reduction in   and comparatively strict social-distancing  35 reduction in  on the disease transmission  it is observed from figure 3 that the enhancement in social-distancing significantly reduced the burden of cumulative new infected cases it is further observed that the implementation of a highly-effective social-distancing strategy ie at least 35 reduction in  dramatically reduces the cumulative new infected cases thus this graphical interpretation suggests that strict social-distancing measures that reduces the contacts between people including staying 2 meters apart or more preferably staying at home should be implemented by the government the impact of parameter  representing  the infectiousness rate due to asymptomatically-infected individuals is depicted in figure 4
 it can be seen that the reduction in    also significantly reduces the cumulative number of newly confirmed covid-19 infected cases this interpretation shows that the people who do not even know that they are infected ie those with mild or no symptoms are significantly contributing the disease burden  further the influence of parameter   the infectiousness rate due to covid-19 patient admitted in the hospital are depicted in figure 5
  it is observed that the reduction in this parameter has no reasonable impact on disease transmission   obviously the hospitalized covid-19 patients are isolated and no one is allowed to meet him the health care facilities are also supposed to follow strict standard operating procedure sop   during the treatment and look after of hospitalized patients therefore these infected individuals do not contribute greatly to the disease burden we further simulate the covid-19 model 3 by using the baseline parameter tabulated in table 1 and various of  by increasing with different level ie mild moderate and strict rates the resulting behavior is depicted in figure 6
showing that a strict quarantine or contact-tracing policy up to 70 enhancement to its baseline is needed to reduce the disease burden in pakistan  finally the impact of hospitalization or self-isolation of tested positive cases  is plotted in figure 7
  it is observed that this strategy is comparatively less effective than social-distancing and quarantine interventions these graphical  interpretations emphasize that  once a covid-19 infected case is diagnosed via testing that case must be rapidly isolated and hisher contacts quickly traced via effective contact-tracing and placed in quarantine global sensitivity analysis is one of the important aspects of mathematical modeling not only for epidemic models but in all sciences the global sensitivity analysis of the threshold quantity r0 is used to measure the effect of changes in the dominant factors of the model and to point out the most influential parameters of the model that greatly influence the prevalence of infection furthermore the sensitivity results provide a pathway to set effective and suitable control strategies to curtail the disease in a community more specifically this analysis is helpful to explore how the initial inputs to the model contribute to the system outputs a latin-hypercube sampling approach lhs coupled with the partial rank correlation coefficient prcc is commonly used for this purpose 22 this technique provides prcc and the corresponding p-values for each parameter the use of which can help estimate the level of uncertainty in an epidemic model the higher  prcc and smaller  p-value of a parameter indicating that it has a substantial effect on simulation behavior   the graphical prcc results of the covid-19 model associated parameters taken in this analysis are shown in   figure 8
  while the numerical values of prcc and corresponding p-values  are placed in table 2
  it is observed from table 2 and  figure 8 that  is considered to be the most sensitive parameter with high prcc value with a positive sign followed by    and   moreover   and

 we present and discuss the graphical results of the covid-19 model 3 with constant quarantine and hospitalizationisolation control measures and the model 13 with time dependent control interventions and compared both results to perform the simulations both models are solved numerically using the rk4 technique the estimated and fitted parameters given in table 2 are used in the simulation results the time level is considered up to 150 units days the weight and balancing constants are chosen as a10001

a4300 and a5200 it should be noticed that the weights constant values taken in the simulations are theoretical as they were chosen only to carried out the control strategies developed in this study in figure 9
a-d we have depicted the impact of hospitalization control only and keeping the quarantine or case tracing control inactive ie u10 and u
2  0 the control profile for this strategy is shown in 9 e it is observed that although the control u
2 is kept 100 for the first 70 days but still it has no significant impact on the different infected individuals as seen 9 a-d thus only the hospitalization or self-isolation intervention is not enough for the control of covid-19 pandemic in pakistan the impact of only quarantine optimal control by keeping the hospitalization control zero ie u
1  0 and u20 is shown in 10
a-d the corresponding control profile for this case is depicted in 10 e it can be seen that by maintaining a strict quarantine control is very effective in minimizing the spread of the covid-19 infection finally the impact of both optimal controls on the dynamics of covid-19 burden is analyzed the graphical results are depicted in figure 10 a-d while the control profile is shown in 10 e it can be observed from 10 a-d that the number of exposed symptomatically-infected asymptomatically-infected and critically-infected individuals are decreasing very significant when the optimal quarantined and hospitalization controls are applied rather than the constant case the effectiveness can be viewed from the difference between the peaks of the two graphs from the control profile depicted in figure 10 e it can be seen that the control u
1 is kept initially at 100 for 140 days and gradually reduces towards the end of the intervention while the control u
2 is set to 55 and then immediately increases to 90 in the initial days and then gradually reduced during the rest of the intervention the covid-19 pandemic has rapidly spread out to most of the regions of the world and has severe public health and socio-economic burden in developed and devolving countries including pakistan the number of reported cases in pakistan is increasing and more than 100000 confirmed cases have been reported till 05 june 2020 in the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or antiviral the whole humans community is being focused on the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions against the covid-19 pandemic in this study we formulated a mathematical model in order to study the dynamics of covid-19 pandemic in pakistan and used it to assess the community-wide impact of the various control and mitigation strategies initially we developed the model and presented some mathematical analysis including positivity and stability results of the disease-free equilibrium it is proven that the disease-free equilibrium is stable both locally and globally when r01 the model is parameterized from the covid-19 confirmed cases reported till may 28 2020 in pakistan while some parameters are estimated from literature the findings show that the model predicted infected curve is in good agreement to the real infected cases the estimated numerical value of the basic reproduction is obtained as r0187 showing the alarming situation of the pandemic in pakistan the control and mitigation strategies should be implemented to bring the threshold quantity r0 to a value less than unity after the estimation of model parameters we simulated the model to explore the effectiveness of various control strategies implemented in pakistan firstly we presented the impact of three effectiveness levels ie low or mild moderate and strict of social-distancing in curtailing the burden of covid-19 the simulation results revealed that although the implementation of mild social-distancing decreased the covid-19 burden significantly as measured in terms of shifting and lowering the peak of daily infected cases still a strict social-distancing measures should be implemented and maintained for an extended period of time to avoid a significant outbreak in pakistan further we simulated the model to assess the effect of various levels of quarantine and hospitalization or self-isolation interventions with a highly-effective quarantine intervention enhanced by 70 to its baseline value a dramatic reduction in the pandemic peak was observed on the other hand increase of hospitalization intervention of confirmed cases had no significant influence on the pandemic burden finally the proposed covid-19 model is reformulated by the inclusion of two time-dependent control variables in order to assess the impact of optimal control measures on disease dynamics we simulated the control model and compared the effect of constant and optimal time-dependent control measures on disease burden it is observed from the simulation results of the control covid-19 model that the infected individuals significantly decrease with the implementation of both time-dependent control measures although it is impressive that pakistan ramps up daily diagnostic covid-19 testing and contact tracing to have a realistic measure of the burden of the nationwide pandemic and emphasize personal hygiene and hand washing physical-distancing wearing face masks in public still this study suggests that the implementation of basic non-pharmaceutical interventions particularly social-distancing quarantine or self-isolation or stay at home should be strictly observed in the future to avoid the worse scenario in pakistan it is also believed that the present study will be beneficial to the decision-making in combating the disease in the near future we will extend the present model by introducing the fractional operators with local and nonlocal kernel to gain more insights about the dynamics of covid-19 pandemic

sars-cov-2 can remain on some type of surfaces like plastic and stainless steel for a few days 3 infected individuals with coronavirus disease covid-19 do not develop symptoms immediately upon contracting the virus indeed one of the main features of covid-19 is the relatively important period of incubation the median value for covid-19 incubation period was estimated at 51 days 4 however a recent study suggested pre-symptomatic transmission of covid-19 5 in other words infected individuals start transmitting the disease a few hours or days before the end of the incubation period this mode of silent transmission could be a driver of the disease spread sars-cov-2 causes moderate to severe clinical outcomes in 20  of infected patients 6 in the absence of effective vaccines or therapeutics non-pharmaceutic interventions npis were adopted as a strategy to slow down the disease propagation some of these control measures aim to reduce the probability of infection transmission during direct contact for example by promoting hygiene practices and cough etiquette other measures like social distancing and the closing of schools and workplaces reduce the opportunities of human-to-human transmission the rest of the interventions like the disinfection of public areas aim to reduce the chances of indirect transmission while all of these measures slow down the propagation of the epidemic 7 the impact of each of these npis on the epidemic dynamics of covid-19 remains hard to quantify mathematical modelling can be used to gain a deeper understanding of the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases compartmental models provide a theoretical framework to study disease transmission in a population of individuals 8 these compartmental models can be implemented using a wide range of modelling methods the simplest form of compartmental models uses ordinary differential equations to describe population dynamics during an epidemic susceptible-infected-recovered sir models are one of the most commonly used compartmental models 9 they describe the evolution of the number of infected individuals in a closed population a recently published sir model was used to quantify the effect of quarantine on the spread of covid-19 10 another class of widely used models consider four population classes susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered seir models 11 these models are most suitable to describe the spread of diseases with a long incubation period which is the case of the covid-19 outbreak in this context an seir was recently developed and used to conduct a data-driven analysis of covid-19 spread 12 other recent studies used seir models to estimate the basic reproduction number of this pandemic 13 14 a more complex compartmental study was used to evaluate the capacity of the healthcare system in responding to covid-19 propagation 15 the impact of the control measures that were adopted to mitigate the covid-19 outbreak in china was evaluated using another compartmental model 16 while another study assessed the effect of unreported cases 17 on the outbreak dynamics compartmental models implemented using odes can be studied both analytically and numerically partial differential equations pdes can be used to implement compartmental models to study the spatio-temporal dynamics of an epidemic in this context systems of reaction-diffusion equations can be used with to describe the spatial densities of populations such that the diffusion term represents the motility of individuals in a computational domain 18 numerical simulations of these models show the propagation of the disease in the form of travelling waves multi-agent systems represent another framework which was extensively used to study the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases the advantage of this approach is the possibility to accurately capture the interactions between individuals in these models each individual is represented as an agent that can communicate with the neighbouring individuals and with the environment sometimes inter-agents communication is described using a dynamic network 19 20 other times the motion of agents is modelled and communications occur between neighbouring individuals in this case population movement and inter-agent communication can be described using cellular automata 21 22 social force models provide a more accurate description of pedestrian motion 23 in these models each agent aims to reach its desired velocity while keeping a certain distance from other agents the effect of neighbouring individuals on the agent is described using a socio-psychological force this approach can be used to describe the complex dynamics of crowds which involve several interacting individuals social force models can be applied to study the dynamics of infection spread in crowds and under realistic conditions for example a social force model was used to describe the infection propagation in airplanes 24 although more complex agent-based models can yield results which are in a good agreement with simpler odes models 25 multi-scale modelling is a mechanism-based approach which aims to integrate the effects of regulatory mechanisms across multiple scales of space and time 26 hybrid discrete-continuous model benefits from the advantages of both the agent-based framework and the equation-based representation 27 these models were developed to describe biological systems 28 29 in multi-scale models infection dynamics are represented at the host and the population levels 30 the advantage of this approach is the possibility to integrate available data and knowledge across multiple scales of description in this context collected data was used to calibrate several multi-scale models of the foot-and-mouth epidemic 31 multi-scale models provide a rich description of the infection dynamics at the individual and environment levels than multi-agent models 32 as of april 27 2020 sars-cov-2 is a newly discovered coronavirus the available data and knowledge about covid-19 epidemics remain insufficient as a result it is hard to quantify the effectiveness of each non-pharmaceutical intervention in slowing down the spread of the pandemic to gain a better understanding of the epidemic features of covid-19 we develop a hybrid multi-scale model that describes the transmission dynamics of this disease at both the individual and population levels we represent individuals as agents that move in a square computational domain their displacement is described using a social force model infective agents can transmit the virus through direct contact with susceptible individuals they can also contaminate the neighbouring surfaces by secreting droplets which contain the virus the concentration of stable sars-cov-2 on hard surfaces is described with a partial differential equation infected individuals do not develop symptoms until the end of the incubation period however they can start transmitting the virus before the onset of symptoms the chances of survival of patients depend on their age and health conditions we use the model to study the early transmission dynamics of covid-19 in italy where control measures were relaxed next we study the risk of virus transmission in crowds moving under panic then we investigate the impact of pre-symptomatic transmission on the spread of the disease after that we quantify the effect of the effect of sars-cov-2 persistence on hard surfaces on the epidemic curve finally we use the model to assess the potential of restricted population movement in slowing down the epidemic progression we study the dynamics of virus transmission in a population of agents that move in random directions each agent is represented by a circular particle of mass mi and radius ri as represented in figure 2

 infective individuals secrete droplets which contain sars-cov-2 when they cough or sneeze these droplets transmit the virus if they get inhaled by other individuals directly they can also contaminate neighbouring surfaces which can lead to the subsequent infection of susceptible persons we consider both of these modes of transmission in our model to describe direct contact transmission we consider that each infective agent will probably transmit the virus to susceptible agents if the distance between them is less than one meter direct transmission depends on certain events such as sneezing coughing or handshaking thus we can assume that person-to-person transmission follows a bernoulli distribution we consider that the susceptible agent has a probability pd of being infected upon contact with the contagious one this probability can depend on the compliance with non-pharmaceutical measures such as the wearing of mask handwashing and cough etiquette indirect transmission occurs when infective individuals contaminate the neighbouring hard surfaces these individual transmit the virus to the surrounding surfaces by touch or through secreted droplets if they cough or sneeze to simulate indirect contact we first describe the normalized concentration of stable sars-cov-2 on hard surfaces4ctwcwhere c is the normalized concentration of deposited sars-cov-2 on hard surfaces w is the averaged rate of sars-cov-2 secretion by contagious agents  is the decay rate of the virus the daily probability of contracting the virus by indirect trnasmission is estimated as5pincxiwhere  is a positive constant taken smaller than one note that for each agent indirect transmission can occur only once every day it is evaluated at a random moment of the day for each agent we solve equation 4 on a computational grid of 250    250 nodes using the euler explicit scheme before solving this equation we spread the production rate of secreted virus by infective individuals w to the computational grid using a radial basis functiond141cosdd0ifdd00ifdd0where d is the distance between the node and the center of the agent d
0 is the characteristic distance which describes the extent to which secreted droplets can infect the neighbouring surfaces we take d02m to simulate indirect transmission we evaluate the local concentration of stable sars-cov-2 at the center of susceptible agents we compute this value using bilinear interpolation default values of transmission parameters are provided in table 2
 infected individuals develop symptoms as soon as the period of incubation is elapsed however they become contagious and start spreading the disease a day before the end of this period 38 the incubation period falls within the range of 2-14 days with a mean of 51 days we use a log-normal distribution fitted using clinical data 4 to sample the values of the incubation period for each agent after the development of mild symptoms agents keep moving in the computational domain and transmitting the disease for a few days until the symptoms become more severe then they become isolated and go into quarantine at home or in a hospital we model this period of isolation by considering that the patient stops moving transmitting the virus and interacting with other agents the outcome of this period will be either the death or the survival of the patient if the agent survives then it becomes immunized to infection and starts moving again the considered covid-19 epidemiological characteristics in the model are provided in table 3
 the mortality rate of each agent depends on the characteristics of the agent age risk factors as described below the median time from hospital admission to death is 13 days 39 the median time from hospital admission to discharge for surviving patients is approximately 202 days we have represented the clinical used course for infected patients in figure 3
 in our model the mortality risk by covid-19 depends on the age and health conditions of each patient children are not considered in the present study because they rarely develop symptoms upon contracting covid-19 we assign an age to each individual agent for this purpose we use a distribution representing the age structure of a population of sampled agents the age of the agents determine the risk of covid-19-related mortality as shown in table 4
6 each agent can also have one or many of the following risk factors cardiovascular diseases blood pressure diabetes cancer and chronic respiratory diseases the prevalence of each of these risk factors and the corresponding death probability are given in table 5
7 one of the core assumptions of the model is that we consider the maximum among the probabilities of death caused by the age and the risk factors for example if a patient is aged 82 and has diabetes the death probability will be 148 which corresponds to the rate of mortality by old age and not because of diabetes the code was written in c in the object-oriented programming oop style the gnu scientific library gsl was used for the sampling of random variables the average cpu time for numerical simulations of transmission dynamics in 90 days is around 35 hours on a computer with four cores and 6 gb of ram results were post-processed using the software paraview and python scripts the code is available and can be accessed at httpsgithubcommps7sim-cov we begin by considering the case of low-dense population 1pedm2 the socio-psychological force is not taken into account as we do not consider social distancing we begin by validating the model by considering a case where npis are relaxed to do this we reproduce data of covid-19 outbreak in calabria italy 40 by fitting the probabilities of direct and indirect transmission in the model pd and pin the values of transmission probabilities which give a good agreement are pd004 and 0002 the number of covid-19 tests in this region is estimated to be around 7500 tests figure 4
shows a comparison of the simulated number of cases and the reported ones in calabria after model calibration the model displays a similar growth factor as the reported one in data of active infected cases in calabria as well as the other regions of italy after model calibration we study the dynamics of disease transmission under relaxed epidemic control measures we run a numerical simulation and we study the evolution of agent populations the mean age of the sampled population is 4505 and 53  of sampled individuals have at least one of the five risk factors considered in the model the simulation starts by introducing one infected agent to the computational domain the exponential growth of infected agents begins approximately 14 days after that in this phase the cumulative number of infected agents doubles in approximately every four days we have represented the evolution of the active and cumulative fraction of infected agents in figure 7
 a the peak of the outbreak is reached in day 31 at this time the fraction of simultaneously active infected agents reached 80  64  of them are symptomatic and 37  are quarantined figure 7 b the outbreak is resolved by day 67 at this time only one quarantined patient remains and 916  of agents are immunized as shown in figure 7 c the model predicts that in the absence of any control intervention the disease will infect 984  of the system population by the of the simulation time the model predicts that the case fatality rate cfr is 65  note that these values can slightly change from one simulation to another because of the stochastic noises caused by the relatively low number of agents snapshots of numerical simulations showing the different stages of the epidemic are provided in figure 6 the concentration of stable sars-cov-2 on hard surfaces reaches its maximal value during the peak of the outbreak this suggests that indirect tranmission become more frequent as the diseases propagates social distancing or physical distancing is a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions which aim to increase the minimal distance between people social-distancing is effective in slowing down the epidemic progress because it prevents contacts between individuals however it is hard to accurately estimate that minimal distance that should be kept between individuals to avoid contacts in crowds and especially in panic situations indeed keeping a distance from everyone becomes hard when an individual is moving inside a crowd of panicking people to assess the risk of infection spread in crowds we run numerical simulations of high-density crowds and we estimate the frequency of person-to-person contact first we study the effect of density on crowd dynamics in the absence of the socio-psychological force we define a contact as the situation where the distance between the two agents is smaller to the sum of their radius figure 7 a shows the exponential growth of the contact frequency as the agent density increases then we introduce the socio-pyschological force and we study the impact of its magnitude  on the contact frequency in the crowd the magnitude of the socio-psychological force quantifies the tendency of individuals to comply with social distancing measures figure 7 b illustrates the evolution of the contact frequency as a function of the magnitude of the socio-psychological force for two density values as expected the contact frequency decreases as the magnitude grows however this frequency can still be important for average magnitudes of the socio-psychological force in high-density crowds in normal situations the amplitude of the desired velocity vd is sampled from a normal distribution with an average of 134ms1 and a standard deviation equal to 026ms1 usually agents keep the desired minimal distance between them if they walk at this speed in uncrowded areas on the other hand contact frequency increases significantly when agents are under panic vd3ms1 or if they move in a dense crowd 15pedm2 in this case the number of contacts can be minimized only if the magnitude of the socio-psychological force is very high figure 7 c shows the contact frequency as a function of both amplitudes of the desired velocity and the socio-psychological force in a crowd with a density equal to 15pedm2 these findings suggest that individuals will no longer keep the minimal distance between them as a safety measure when they are under panic this scenario was observed in train and metro stations for example in italy and in india when a large number of people attempted to travel a few days before the start of the curfew therefore it is important to think about other control measures such as the use of restricted access and obstacles to reduce the flow of people next we consider a fixed value for the magnitude of the socio-psychological force taken equal to 2000kgms2 and we change the desired distance that agents aim to keep between them d
0 in figure 7 d we represent the contact frequency as a function of the amplitude of the desired speed and the distance that agents wish to keep between them d
0 as before we notice the contact frequency decreases when the desired distance is higher than 15 m this indicates that the measures which aim to maintain a distance of one metre between individuals may not be sufficient to prevent contacts in dense crowds under panic in the remainder of this paper we study the effect of transmission dynamics in uncrowded areas with a density equal to 1 pedm2 we do not consider the socio-psychological force as we no longer consider social distancing several studies have suggested the possibility of pre-symptomatic transmission in covid-19 5 41 42 however it is not clear if this pre-symptomatic transmission significantly affects the dynamics of the epidemic to investigate this hypothesis we suppose that infected individuals start transmitting the disease before the onset of symptoms we run three simulations reflecting different periods of pre-symptomatic transmission h no pre-symptomatic transmission 24 h and 48h simulations predict that adding twenty-four hours to the period of pre-symptomatic transmission accelerates the onset of the exponential growth by approximately five days decreasing the period of pre-symptomatic period also flattens the epidemic curve of covid-19 as shown in figure 8
 this suggests that the early diagnostic for covid-19 will flatten the epidemic curve the isolation of pre-symptomatic carriers should significantly slow down the spread of the disease an important feature of sars-cov-2 is its ability to persist for a few hours to a few days on hard surfaces in fact sars-cov-2 is more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard 3 the half-life time of the virus varies from 2 hours to 10 hours depending on the surface type to evaluate the effect of sars-cov-2 persistence on its transmission dynamics we compare the output of three numerical simulations we run each simulation with the same parameter set except for the sars-cov-2 decay rate  which corresponds to three values of sars-cov-2 half-life times on hard surfaces 2 h 4 h and 8 h the results show that the epidemic dynamics remain the same except for the value of infected individuals reached during the peak of the outbreak figure 9
 to further investigate this effect we count the number of direct and indirect transmissions in each simulation in the normal case where the half-life time is 4 h the percent of indirect transmissions was 23  most of these transmissions took place during the peak of the outbreak because the virus concentration is high at this moment increasing the persistence of the virus resulted in a higher proportion of indirect transmission to 281  while reducing the half-life time of the stable virus decreases the rate of indirect transmission to 198  disinfection of public areas reduces the concentration of stable sars-cov-2 on hard surfaces therefore we expect it to decrease the number of indirect transmissions and to reduce the reached number of infected individuals during the outbreak peak lockdown is an emergency control measure which aims to reduce the movement of the total or a part of the population it can be used to mitigate the spread of highly infections diseases such as covid-19 however a full lockdown is a costly solution as it causes the arrest of all economic activities we investigate the effect of partial lockdown on disease spread by considering that only a proportion of the population can move the model predicts that higher the number of motionless agents is the flatter the epidemic curve will be figure 10
 a in other words the slope of the exponential growth decreases as the number of immobile agents grows the cumulative fraction of infected patients is also reduced as shown in figure 10 b restricted population movement also decreases the proportion of infected agents figure 10 c and the number of infected individuals reached during the peak of the outbreak figure 10 d as a result partial lockdown measures reduce the number of deceased patients as shown in figure 10 e we compare the model predictions with the reported data of the cumulative number of hospitalized patients in wuhan china 43 to achieve this we fit both the percent of immobile agents and other model parameters we notice that reducing the percent of mobile agents flattens the epidemic curve however it does not delay the onset of the exponential growth in a similar way to the reported epidemic curve for the case of wuhan china therefore we have reduced the probabilities of transmission by approximately four times to observe roughly the same epidemic curve figure 11
 this paper is devoted to the study of covid-19 transmission dynamics using a specific multi-scale model we calibrated the model using available data on the cumulative number of reported cases in two situations one for relaxed control measures calabria italy and the other with strict non-pharmaceutical interventions wuhan china the proposed model has several features which makes it suitable for the quantification of the effects of control measures on both the individual and population levels first we have used a microscopic social force model to describe the motion of agents as a result we were able to properly study the effect of social distancing in crowded areas numerical simulations with this model revealed that these measures do not prevent the transmission of the disease in high-density areas especially when agents move under panic next we considered the mode of indirect disease transmission which depends on the virus concentration on contaminated surfaces this transmission mode is important in covid-19 as sars-cov-2 can remain viable on various surfaces for a few days 3 another important feature of the model concerns the integration of measured characteristics of the clinical course of covid-19 the incubation period was sampled using a log-normal distribution which was fitted using clinical data 4 mean values for the periods from symptom onset to hospitalization discharge and death were taken the literature 39 finally the realistic distributions of demographic and clinical factors allows the accurate prediction of the population-specific cfr we can tune the model to predict the response of different countries with different age structures and risk factors prevalence to the spread of covid-19 several conclusions can be drawn from the present study concerning the effect of epidemic control interventions first we have shown that panic situations could result in the spread of the disease despite the adherence of individuals to social distancing measures numerical simulations with the social force model suggests that social distancing is not fully respected in crowded areas especially when individuals move under panic situations such as panic-buying could result in the rapid spread of the virus therefore control strategies for covid-19 should aim to avoid the formation of dense crowds and should prevent the spread of panic furthermore we have demonstrated that keeping a minimal distance of one metre between individuals is not sufficient to prevent person-to-person contacts in crowded areas next the model have shown that pre-symptomatic transmission significantly shapes the outbreak dynamics therefore modelling works devoted to the study of covid-19 spread should take into consideration the effect of pre-symptomatic carriers besides increasing the number of tests for covid-19 is expected to significantly slow down the propagation of the epidemic as many pre-symptomatic carriers will get quarantined before they transmit the disease after that we speculate that the disinfection of public areas would result in a decrease in the number of patients reached during the peak of the outbreak this is because we observe the same thing when we increase the decay rate of sars-cov-2 on hard surfaces finally fitting the model to reproduce epidemiological data on the case of wuhan china suggests that measures that are stricter than social distancing and lockdown were adopted to control the epidemic spread we can speculate that the early wearing of masks the washing of hand and the following of cough etiquette not only flatten the epidemic curve but also delay the onset of the exponential growth note that the model relies on a few key assumptions first the effect of unreported cases and asymptomatic transmission were not considered in the present work the role of these silent transmitters of infectious diseases was investigated in a previous work 44 we did not introduce them in the present work as there are no sufficient data on the infection dynamics of covid-19 in asymptomatic individuals we will study the effect of unreported cases using our model in a forthcoming work second the model considers a relatively low number of agents this is because of the high computational cost of the model we have used periodic boundary conditions to approximate systems with a higher number of individuals we expect the results to be similar for larger systems but with less stochastic noises finally the study is devoted to the transmission dynamics in closed systems the transport of people between the studied area and other locations could impact the epidemic dynamics in the future we will apply the model to investigate the transmission dynamics of covid-19 in crowds in urban areas with realistic configurations the authors declare that they do not have any financial or nonfinancial conflict of interests  spreading of covid-19 in brazil impacts and uncertainties in social distancing strategies diego volpatto t anna claudia m resende lucas dos anjos joo silva v o claudia dias m regina almeida c sandra malta m c  brazils continental dimension poses a challenge to the control of the spread of covid-19 due to the country specific scenario of high social and demographic heterogeneity combined with limited testing capacity lack of reliable data under-reporting of cases and restricted testing policy the focus of this study is twofold i to develop a generalized seird model that implicitly takes into account the quarantine measures and ii to estimate the response of the covid-19 spread dynamics to perturbationsuncertainties by investigating the projections of cumulative numbers of confirmed and death cases as well as the effective reproduction number we show that the model parameter related to social distancing measures is one of the most influential along all stages of the disease spread and the most influential after the infection peak due to such importance in the outcomes different relaxation strategies of social distancing measures are investigated in order to determine which strategies are viable and less hazardous to the population the results highlight the need of keeping social distancing policies to control the disease spread specifically the considered scenario of abrupt social distancing relaxation implemented after the occurrence of the peak of positively diagnosed cases can prolong the epidemic with a significant increase of the projected numbers of confirmed and death cases an even worse scenario could occur if the quarantine relaxation policy is implemented before evidence of the epidemiological control indicating the importance of the proper choice of when to start relaxing social distancing measures  at the end of 2019 the world was taken by the news about the outbreak in china of a new coronavirus called sars-cov-2 which stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 the associated disease called covid-19 by the world health organization who rapidly spread around the world and is currently considered a pandemic as of may 26 there have been 216 countries and territories with confirmed cases the majority of them with local transmission 1  coronavirus belongs to a group of viruses that are common in humans and are responsible for 15 to 30 of cases of common cold 2  the sars-cov-2 has spread rapidly and has already affected a significant part of the worlds population 3  the within-host dynamics seem to be very heterogeneous and the severity of the disease varies widely based on currently available information elderly people and people of any age with comorbidities such as hypertension cardiovascular disease and diabetes are among those at most risk of severe illness from covid- 19  in most locations the burden of covid-19 cases requiring medical intensive care exceeds the available medical resources worsening the situation a great effort has been made worldwide to better understand the disease and possible mechanisms to control it measures such as widespread testing and reducing social contacts for some age segments or for the wider population are known to decrease the speed of the disease spread and the case fatality 4  however countries often have to deal with limit testing capabilities for covid-19 which increases the uncertainty associated with how the disease behaves and is likely to complicate the management of the policies to mitigate and control it one form to deal with this lack of information is through mathematical modeling using diversified modelling techniques see 5 for a review population-based models that split individuals into classes are widely used and is the approach followed in this work who has already recognized that testing for covid-19 is a key way to know how the virus spread and to provide insights on how to respond to it although widespread testing is low in most countries in the world current brazilian policy is to test only severely ill and healthcare practitioners people even so there is great uncertainty in the released data sub-notification of infected cases is a major problem br currently conducts around 4000 tests per million of the population 3  one of the lowest rates in the world likewise the number of deaths may be underestimated for the same reason according to 6  only 8 of the infected cases are reporteddiagnosed overall one of the main difficulties in developing predictive mathematical models of the covid-19 in brazilian localities is the lack of reliable data to support parameter choices 7 8  in the face of the current scenario we developed a seven-compartment model that implicitly considers the social distancing policy that isolates individuals from the infection for a period of time we focus on understanding the model response to perturbationsuncertainties we perform sensitivity analysis and quantify the uncertainties in model outcomes mainly the cumulative numbers of confirmed and death cases and the effective reproduction number we also investigate how to obtain a desired effectcontrol via a modification to the system subject to uncertainties we first apply the model to the whole br scenario and then investigate its behavior for the state of rio de janeiro rj which was one of the first states in br to recommend and implement social distancing policy beginning on march 17 2020 9  we consider a generalized seird mathematical model containing the following epidemiological compartments susceptible s exposed e asymptomatic infected a symptomatic infected i recovered or removed r positively diagnosed individuals p  10  and cumulative dead d there is also a variable that is not part of the dynamical system and corresponds to the cumulative number of confirmed cases c due to the current brazilian policy only severely ill and healthcare practitioners people are tested therefore it is important a separation in p individuals most likely to need hospitalization in contrast to a limited number of hospital beds moreover a proportion of s e a and i individuals are removed at a fixed rate to the r compartment which corresponds to quarantine measures and recovered individuals as proposed in 11  this mathematical model is denoted seairpd-q in which q stands for the quarantine materials and methods in order to address the understanding of quarantine policies in the next sections we analyze different scenarios related to quarantine measures through modifications in the aforementioned removal rate  to properly perform projections and study the quarantine scenarios of interest we fitted the seairpd-q model materials and methods to the data of br and rj separately we employed a bayesian calibration of some model parameter values with remaining parameter values gathered from the literature considering the maintenance of current social distancing policies the predictions for the covid-19 pandemic in br is showed in fig 1  according to the result of fig 1a  the peak of compartment p will occur on the simulation day 81 95 ci 78-83 with around 757 thousand 95 ci 677-858 people simultaneously infected denoted active cases hereinafter and d is expected to be around 347 thousand 95 ci 324-373 in the considered time range materials and methods according to fig 1a  c in the considered time range will be around 3642 thousand 95 ci 3257-4148 the basic reproduction number r 0  is a parameter that indicates how fast the disease will spread in an epidemic early stage caused by secondary infections after one individual is infected 12  we calculated this quantity and the corresponding effective reproduction number rt si-sappendix a3 the r 0 calculated by means of map for br is 409 and the distribution of rt along time is displayed in fig 1b black  if the current quarantine measures continue rt  1 is expected to be around the simulation day 71 95 ci 69-73 which indicates that the disease is controlled 12  we also fitted the model with the available data for rj considering the current social distancing policy the projections for covid-19 infection in rj are showed in fig 2  according to fig 2a  the peak of active cases will occur on the simulation day 80 95 ci 76-85 with around 73 thousand 95 ci 63-87 active cases and d is expected to be around 70 thousand 95 ci 58-87 in the considered time range fig 2a also shows that c in the considered time range will be around 450 thousand 95 ci 377-555 the r 0 is 283 for rj and the distribution of rt along time 3  cc-by-nc-nd 40

scenario if the quarantine measures in rj continue rt  1 is expected to be around the simulation day 72 95 ci 67-76 we address the sensitivity materials and methods for both c and d qoi 1 t as well for rt qoi 2 t our first order sensitivity coefficient results suggest that uncertainties on ics can drive significant changes in the early epidemic dynamics however the influence of such uncertainties diminishes as the epidemic evolves indicating that other involved infectious mechanisms have more impact in the long term indeed notice that parameter uncertainties have strong impact on both epidemic numbers qoi 1 t and qoi 2 t along the dynamics the importance of the recovery and the quarantine removal rates increase as the time evolves with respect to qoi 1 t overall the most influential parameter is the quarantine removal rate  and its impact increases as the dynamics evolves the second more influential parameter is the proportion of i with symptoms  we remark that the latter parameter is fixed due to the limited testing capacity in br we have shown that the rate at which s e and i are removed due to quarantine measures significantly affect rt c and d such average values under the actual social distancing policy are an idealization since actual values are dynamic and spatially heterogeneous in order to study the qualitative effects of changes in social distancing policies we propose to model  as an exponential decay function which can represent different social distancing relaxation scenarios materials and methods we consider three cases i a sudden

release policy is at simulation day 100 after the first time stamp considered in the calibration dataset fig 3 shows the consequences of relaxing social distance measures in terms of c and d for br additional results are displayed in si-sappendix a6 and si-sappendix a7 for both br and rj scenarios remarkably a sudden release can induce an increase in c extending the crisis duration due to a slower decrease in active cases this effect can be noted in figs 1b and 2b social distancing release policies make the decrease of rt far slower implying in a slow control of the disease thus determining an appropriate moment to begin a social distancing release policy demands special care since applying such policies in inappropriate times can maintain a crisis status for a longer-term moreover due to the small changes in rt for a longer time more cases of c and d will occur worsening the health damage in the total population we also remark the importance of the quarantine release date in the following less favorable scenario considering that social distancing is released 20 days before the peak of active cases for br simulation day 61 disease spreading can yield a critical scenario even when a smooth and gradual release strategy half-life as t 12  20 days is adopted causing an increase in c and d and a drastically longer epidemic period as shown in fig 4  in this case the peak of active cases will occur on the simulation day 95 95 ci 88-107 with around 857 thousand 95 ci 734-1050 active cases and d is expected to be around 843 thousand 95 ci 696-1059 in the considered time range with c around 08915 million 95 ci 06834-1246 as in other countries that adopted isolation measures the spread of covid-19 in br had a slow start despite that after about two months since the first confirmed case on may 20 2020 br reaches second place among the countries that present more confirmed cases of the disease only behind the united states of america 3  the results shown in this work point to the necessity to quantify the effectiveness of social distancing interventions for the control of the disease in br specifically in its most affected localities

disease control the present paper aims to contribute to the development of a model framework to investigate the expansion of covid-19 in brazilian locations and the impacts of different measures of social distancing we apply the developed approach to model the covid-19 dynamics in br and rj this high populated brazilian state was one of the first states to adopt mitigation actions such as the suspension of classes cancellation of events and home isolation 13  according to the current data released by the brazilian ministry of health rj is one of the most affected states both in the number of registered cases of covid-19 and in the number of deaths for this reason the present study analyzes the spread in this state as well as in the country as a whole in order to assess the particular characteristics of the pandemic at those different spatial scales extensive research for the spread of covid-19 in br with multiple perspectives has been reported eg 7 13 8  the present work takes into account factors that are predominant in the brazilian reality such as the current limited testing capacity and the policy to test only severely ill hospitalized individuals we hope that the present investigation brings some insights or guidelines for public health and policy-makers due to data paucity parameter identifiability is a major difficulty to overcome this issue only four model parameters were calibrated using a bayesian approach other parameters as well as model ics were set based on available information on covid-19 si -table a 3 our simulation forecasts that the peak of active cases occurs on may 24 2020 95 ci 21-26 and may 28 2020 95 ci 24-2 for br and rj respectively this difference can be explained due to the discrepancy of the spatial scale and the way the disease has spread along the different brazilian locations considering for instance the different political measures taken and the social and demographic structure of each state the social measures implemented in rj at the beginning of the pandemic seemed to be able to flatten the epidemic curve and postpone the peak of active cases 13  aiming to evaluate the influence of uncertainties in hard-to-track populations such as undiagnosed infected individuals i and a as well those who carry the disease and are unable to transmit e we performed a sensitivity analysis to understand which model factors parameters and ics play important roles at the various stages of the epidemic for both br and rj the analysis confirms that a proper understanding of how the disease spreads can provide insights and aids to elaborate containment decisions in order to reduce rt in this sense considering both br and rj sensitivity analysis suggests that the most influential parameter for a long term perspective is the quarantine removal rate parameter  we have shown that the rate at which s e i and a individuals are removed due to quarantine measures significantly affects rt c and d such average values under the actual social distancing policy are an idealization since actual values are dynamic and spatially heterogeneous as mentioned in the last paragraph in order to study the qualitative effects of changes in social distancing policies we propose to model  as an exponential decay function which can represent different social distancing relaxation scenarios when more abrupt social distancing relaxation is implemented after the occurrence of the peak of active cases it accompanies a longer extension of the duration of the disease with approximately 19 increase in the projected numbers of c and d if implemented before the peak the consequences can be devastating as indicated by our results the hypothetical scenario built by considering a slow and gradual release implemented 20 days before the original peak indicates a delay of 14 days in the occurrence of the peak of active cases with more than 890 thousand c and about 85 thousand d accumulated over less than nine months of the presence of the disease in br our simulations highlight the importance of relaxing social distancing measures only under a very careful follow-up we note that the analysis performed in this paper should be viewed from a qualitative perspective the conclusions for the considered hypothetical scenarios with and without distancing relaxation are based on model predictions and current employed policies model simplifications and the calibration procedure of model parameters can explain potential quantitative discrepancies between our predictions and data such simplifications include i homogenization of age social and spatial structure ii some model parameters are fixed with values obtained from the literature and iii model parameters are constant along time except  that in some simulations varied in time moreover data have limited information due to sub-notification since only hospitalized cases are tested in br these simplifications are inherent of the modeling procedure and should be viewed as part of the scientific process of the understanding of the natural phenomena the present paper can be extended in forthcoming studies for example by considering models with spatial heterogeneity parameter dependence in time and space and also analysing data considering sub-notification data considering other br states could also be analyzed employing the same procedure adopted in the present paper another possible extension could be related to the determination of limit thresholds in the number of p cases under different relaxation social distancing measures it is important to highlight the impacts of social distancing relaxation in order to control the epidemic adoption of this type of measure directly affects the evolution of rt as shown in our results for both br and rj it implies a much slower stagnation or decrease in rt from the time the measures are implemented since rt is in a controlled situation for both scenarios ie rt  1 a direct consequence is that the disease would need more time to be eradicated our analyses suggest that policies based on short-term social distancing are not enough to control 7  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it

evolution of the pandemic if social distancing policy measures are released before the optimal time a second peak should be experienced 7  some authors argue that longer or even intermittent social distancing will be necessary to avoid recurrent outbreaks specifically 14 examined a range of likely virus transmission scenarios until 2025 and assessed non-pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate the outbreak they concluded that if the new coronavirus behaves in the same matter to similar viruses we can expect the disease to return in the coming years depending on the level and duration of immunity an aspect that remains to be clarified in the future the discovery of a vaccine or new treatments coupled with the testing of the population could alleviate the need for severe social distancing measures to control the disease until then the need to maintain even if intermittently social distancing measures must be carefully addressed the seairpd-q model here we consider a generalized seird model that includes protective quarantine measures and whose development is based on the following assumptions i the analysis time is small enough such that natural birth and death are disregarded ii all positively diagnosed individuals are hospitalized the reason is that only badly ill infected individuals are subject to tests in br iii only symptomatic infected and positively tested diagnosedhospitalized individuals may die due to complications from the disease iv the hospitalized individuals are under treatment and remain isolated so that they are considered not infectious v quarantine measures are restrictive so that quarantined individuals are isolated and are not likely to be infected and vi the recoveredremoved individuals acquire immunity the previous assumptions reflect our current knowledge of the covid-19 and are the base of our seairpd-q model that has seven compartments including the population of positively diagnosed p  individuals who are under medical treatment and the dead d individuals the infected class is modeled as two separate compartments encompassing individuals with and without symptoms denoted by i and a respectively the removed compartment includes the recovered individuals as well as those under social distancing measures the mathematical description differential equations of the seairpd-q model and its schematic representation are shown in fig 5 while model parameters and related meanings are exhibited in table 1 and si-table a2 information regarding the numerical differential equation solver employed can be seen in si-sappendix a2 susceptible individuals become exposed to covid-19 when in contact with infected people the rate at which this happens may vary depending on whether the infected individual has symptoms or not after an incubation period exposed individuals become infected the fraction of infected people who present symptoms can vary widely due to the reduced testing capacity in br asymptomatic individuals as well as symptomatic infected individuals with mild symptoms are not likely to be hospitalized and therefore will not be diagnosed those who present symptoms are either isolated or hospitalized we assume that only symptomatic infected individuals with stronger symptoms are diagnosed quickly and require hospitalization this assumption better reflects the brazilian policy on only testing severely ill individuals following the who guideline on social distancing most brazilian localities are adopting social distancing policies at some extent an interesting feature of our model is the assumption that susceptible exposed and infected individuals can be removed due to quarantine policy thus the removed individuals compartment includes individuals who have recovered from the disease as well as those put in quarantine at a removal rate  quarantined individuals are removed and kept isolated it is known that a quarantine period above 14 days is sufficient to recover exposed and infected individuals who are idealized immune after such period asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals can recover 8  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available

method the cascading adaptive transitional metropolis in parallel 16  a transitional markov chain monte carlo available in pymc3 for the sake of reproducibility code and scripts are publicly provided

function assumes a normal distribution considering these observed quantities as its mean values the standard deviation for c  c  and d  d  are tuned as hyperparameters within the calibration procedure since brazilian policy for testing in covid-19 is still restricted to severe cases model fitting aims at matching c and d without accounting the recovered outflow from p  we gathered data for c and d from 18 br and 19 rj we assessed the epidemiological data of 63 days for br ranging from march 5 2020 to may 6 2020 and 53 for rj ranging from march 10 2020 to may 1 2020 these data ranges were chosen considering a minimal requirement of at least five individuals in the c compartment at the initial date in order to quantify how changes in the model parameters and some ics affect certain quantities of interest qoi we apply the elementary effects method 20 present in the salib library 21  this method allows a global sensitivity analysis si-sappendix a5 by sampling initial points over all parametric space computing for each of them how the qoi varies along generated trajectories which are changes in the paramaters and computing the associated sensitivity coefficients the first order

epidemic in 2002-2003 generated several publications using diversified modeling techniques see 5 for a review some of these publications employed mathematical models to provide some understanding of the propagation pattern and ultimately to infer control measures for the disease 22 23 24  similar mathematical models were employed for other diseases for example i the 1918 influenza pandemic using data from cities of the usa 25 26  england and wales 27  ii the 2009 influenza pandemic was modeled in local regions in japan 28  and iii the 2014-2016 ebola epidemic was modeled for the west african countries with reported cases of the disease 29 30  overall the modeling efforts for representing virus spreading share common challenges that have been pointed out in the literature recently 31 32  including those related to the emergence of novel infectious agents 33  issues like virus genetic diversity within-host variability social demographic and spatial heterogeneity among others can have a significant impact on model predictions and control programs in any case model granularity and ability to capture the desired phenomena are linked to available data for model calibration which may hinder the development and practical use of more complex models several mathematical models have already been published to better understand the disease spread and the effectiveness of different mitigation programs two variations of the susceptible-infectious-recovered sir model are used in 7 to describe the early evolution of covid-19 in brazil br using data from february 25 2020 to march 30 2020 short and long term forecasts are performed which highlight the need of keeping social distancing policies for longer periods to actually flatten the epidemic curve and the necessity of testing to have a better picture of the amplitude of the peak of symptomatic infected individuals in 34  an eight compartment model with nine age stratification groups was developed to investigate the effect of social distancing policies specifically those related to specific older age groups starting from a 60 lockdown scenario and many predefined parameterizations based on available references their analysis indicates the ineffectiveness of older age group confinement policy as a way of controlling the confinement exit a similar model approach is developed in 35 to investigate the transmission and isolation measures in so paulo state they found that both young and older people must be isolated to reduce hospitalization the two latter studies explicitly included quarantined individuals either due to confinement of susceptible individuals or because of a positive testing isolation measure more recently the work 36 develops a model that accounts for either reported and unreported cases besides analyzing the impact of different public health mitigation measures the work suggests the use of a mixture approach for estimating model parameters at the early onset of the disease confirmed reported cases are assumed to follow an exponential law to ease getting initial conditions ics later on a bayesian approach is used for model calibration since the unreported infected cases are major issue to control outbreaks the approach for identifying them seems promising and has already been successfully applied to the hong kong seasonal influenza epidemic in new york city in 1968-1969 for a sir model 37  another class of compartmental models widely used to describe the spread of virus diseases worldwide is seir that consider the total population n  is split into sub-groups of susceptible s exposed e infected i and recovered or removed r individuals such that s e i r  n  the compartments s and i contain all individuals likely to be infected and those already infected respectively e individuals are usually considered to have low viral load and are not likely to be infectious while r individuals can or cannot be infected again depending on the virus disease this class of dynamical model may be used to ultimately identify the processes that interplay in pandemic waves and has been largely used recently to assess the dynamics of covid-19 in many countries

in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted june 3 2020  38  jia et al 47 employed the seairpq model with seven compartments for modeling the chinese outbreak of covid-19 including populations of positively diagnosed p  individuals who are under medical treatment and of quarantined q individuals a schematic description of the seairpq is shown in fig a6  with its mathematical formulation given by the following system of ordinary differential equations model parameters are non-negative constants and most of them are described in table a 2 the three remaining are the fraction of infection rates between a and i  the time required for an individual to be quarantined 1p and the quarantine period 1 an interesting feature of the seairpq model is the explicit inclusion of a compartment for q individuals longer periods of isolation yields a decrease in s population ultimately decreasing the infected population s individuals may be exposed to contact with a and i individuals for the chinese considered scenarios it was assumed that a individuals are less likely to spread the disease so that   1 the seairpq model assumes that both a and i individuals are eventually positively diagnosed at rates  a and  i  respectively they can also recover without medical treatment at rates  a and  i  respectively although seairpq model was able to describe quite well the outbreak in china the brazilian reality may prevent its use in brazilian localities br testing capacity is still very limited one of the lowest in the world in april 2020 br tested around 296 per million people according to 3  this number increased to 4104 in may 2020 although it can be significantly lower in some brazilian localities due to huge demographic and social heterogeneities thus available data on testing is very scarce the present brazilian policy is to test only people with severe symptoms such evidence has driven the development of the model proposed in this paper here we consider a modification of model a1 taking into account protective quarantine measures as an implicit variable the proposed model called seiarpd-q has also seven compartments since it includes the compartment of dead d individuals to explicitly keep track of them the notation used indicates that q individuals are not separated in a specific compartment instead quarantine mechanisms are implicitly considered with individuals in isolation included in r compartment likewise seiarpq model the infected class is modeled as two separate compartments encompassing i and a individuals r compartment includes individuals who have recovered from the disease as well as those who have been removed to this compartment as a result of isolation measures for completeness we repeat here the mathematical formulation of the seairpd-q model which is given by the following set of differential equations 12  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted june 3 2020  the model is schematically shown in fig a7  all model parameters meanings are described in ta looking at the mathematical description of model a2 it is important to note that the transformation of s into e individuals occurs through interaction with individuals from the infected groups i and a according to  and  rates respectively the remaining mechanisms are linear depending only on the corresponding transfer rates as already mentioned an important mechanism introduced in the model describes the application of social distancing measures individuals from compartments s e a and i are removed to compartment r at a rate  in this way it is possible to exclude r individuals from the infection dynamics a similar approach was adopted in 11  we emphasize that we have chosen an implicit quarantinesocial distancing approach that is we do not model a specific compartment of q individuals unlike other studies 47 38  the advantage of this implicit representation is to obtain a simpler model with less computational cost and fewer parameters the previous assumptions reflect our current knowledge of the covid-19 in br we remark that the adaptive immunity to sars-cov-2 of people who recovered from the disease has not been established yet as well as how long the immunity could eventually last actually a follow-up study on 262 recovered patients in china revealed that 15 were tested positively for sars-cov-2 they were all younger than 14-years old and had mild and moderate conditions at the time of the primary infection during the follow-up they did not show clinical symptoms and it is speculated if either more sensitive test is required or indicates a sign of relapse rather than reinfection another study performed in previously infected rhesus macaques found that reinfection of sars-cov-2 could not occur 48  overall the current understanding based on what is known on coronaviruses in general is that antibodies produced by infected patients may give them immunity to the specific virus for short term or even years for example previously infected sars patients can become susceptible to reinfection only after around three years 49  the mathematical formulation of the seairpd-q model described by the system of seven ordinary differential equations a2 is solved using the lsoda method 50 from scipy 51  this package provides an interface for such routine from odepack 52  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is

37 despite the fact that we have mentioned which observed data are used as observations for the calibration procedure a proper definition of such quantities is absent the estimate of c is calculated from the model as which is the cumulative value of inflow individuals in the p compartment since only diagnosed individuals are recorded on brazilian confirmed case databases due to the lack of large-scale testing in the overall population using eq a10 we can estimate the amount c at t days after day t 0  analogously in order to compute the d from seairpd-q we calculate which is the integration of see system a2 for reference over the time range of interest c and d time-stamps are gathered from data sources specified in the materials and methods section such quantities are used as observed data in the calibration procedure as previously stated in the main text we employ the elementary effects method 20 to carry out this analysis in contrast to local sensitivity methods which evaluate how small changes around a singular point affect a qoi 55  the elementary effects method is a global sensitivity method considering the   r k as the set of analysed parameters we construct a sample of m initial points  1       m from a k-dimensional p-level grid afterwards a metric defined as an elementary effect ee i  i  1     k is computed for every parameter where    1 p1   1  1 p1  is the magnitude of change in the ith parameter in the k-dimensional p-level grid values of p as an even number and   p 2p1 are usual suggested choices to ensure an equal sampling probability in the parametric space and are the default option in the salib 21 library used after computing the elementary effects the process ends by calculating the global sensitivity coefficients for each parameter

social distancing  on both qois is notable more importantly its influence increases with the evolution of time which emphasizes the need for care when establishing social distancing relaxation measures on the other hand the proportion of i individuals is also one of the most influential parameters on both qois although it is more relevant considering c and d this points out the need of having a more widespread testing policy regarding the rj scenario fig a 14 reveals very similar scores one noteworthy distinction is the rank of influence of e0 and i0 associated with qoi 2 t the

httpsdoiorg1011012020053020117283 doi medrxiv preprint  the socio-economic determinants of the coronavirus disease covid-19 pandemic  viktor stojkoski zoran utkovski petar jolakoski dragan tevdovski ljupco kocarev  the magnitude of the coronavirus disease pandemic has an enormous impact on the social life and the economic activities in almost every country in the world besides the biological and epidemiological factors a multitude of social and economic criteria also govern the extent of the coronavirus disease spread in the population consequently there is an active debate regarding the critical socio-economic determinants that contribute to the resulting pandemic in this paper we contribute towards the resolution of the debate by leveraging bayesian model averaging techniques and country level data to investigate the potential of 35 determinants describing a diverse set of socio-economic characteristics in explaining the coronavirus pandemic outcome  this is a preliminary report which includes data gathered up to 11th april 2020 it will be updated weekly so as to only include results based on data that is not older than two weeks  the coronavirus pandemic began as a simple outbreak in december 2019 in wuhan china however it quickly propagated to other countries and became a primary global threat it seems that most countries were not prepared for this pandemic as a consequence hospitals were overcrowded with patients and death rates due to the disease skyrocketed in particular as of the time of this writing 11th april 2020 there have been over 15 million cases and over 100 thousand deaths worldwide as a cause of the coronavirus induced disease covid-19 1  figure 1  histogram based on probability density estimation for the cases and deaths per million population using country level data the x-axis describes the observed value whereas the y-axis is the estimated probability density data taken on 11th april 2020 in order to reduce the impact of the disease spread most governments implemented social distancing restrictions such as closure of schools airports borders restaurants and shopping malls 1 in the most severe cases there were even lockdowns -all citizens were prohibited from leaving their homes this subsequently lead to a major economic downturn stock markets plummeted international trade slowed down businesses went bankrupt and people were left unemployed while in some countries the implemented restrictions had a significant impact on reducing the expected shock from the coronavirus the extent of the disease spread in the population greatly varied from one economy to another as illustrated in fig 1 a multitude of social and economic criteria have been attributed as potential determinants for the observed variety in the coronavirus outcome some experts say that the hardest hit countries also had an aging population 2 3  or an underdeveloped healthcare system 4 5  others emphasize the role of the natural environment 6 7  in addition while the developments in most of the countries follow certain common patterns several countries are notably outliers both in the number of documented cases and in the disease outcomehaving in mind the ongoing debate a comprehensive empirical study of the critical socio-economic determinants of the coronavirus pandemic would not only provide a glimpse on their potential impact but would also offer a guidance for future policies that aim at preventing the emergence of epidemics motivated by this observation here we perform a detailed statistical analysis on a large set of potential socio-economic determinants and explore their potential to explain the variety in the observed coronavirus casesdeaths among countries to construct the set of potential determinants we conduct a thorough review of the literature describing the social and economic factors which contribute to the spread of an epidemic we identify a total of 35 potential determinants that describe a diverse ensemble of social and economic factors including healthcare infrastructure societal characteristics economic performance demographic structure etc to investigate the performance of each variable in explaining the coronavirus outcome we utilize the technique of bayesian model averaging bma  bma allows us to isolate the most important determinants by calculating the posterior probability that they truly regulate the process at the same time bma provides estimates for their relative impact while also accounting for the uncertainty in the selection of potential determinants 8 9 10  based on the current data we observe patterns that suggest that there are only few determinants factors that have explanatory power for the coronavirus outcome as we will discuss in more detail in the sequel we observe that some of these factors are strongly related to the level of economic development and to the effect of population size in social interactions however we stress that at this point in time our observations require a careful interpretation for several reasons including the following i the analysis is based on aggregate quantities ie averages across geographic locations as such it does not include spatial inhomogeneity and hence can not capture potentially significant interactive local dynamics ii the parameters governing the time evolution of the disease spread and pandemic outcome are themselves dynamic and depend on the stage of the countrys epidemic and on the changing social response efforts while being aware of these potential shortcomings of our formulation in the absence of realistic models that adequately cover all relevant aspects this study provides the first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of the socio-economic factors of the coronavirus pandemic we expect that with the availability of new data and the improved understanding of the dynamics of the coronavirus pandemic some of these shortcomings will be overcome yielding a more reliable interpretation of the results in a formal setting both the log of registered covid-19 cases and the log of covid-19 deaths are a result of a disease spreading process 11 12  the extent to which a disease spreads within a population is uniquely determined by its reproduction number this number describes the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population in which all individuals are susceptible to infection 13 14  obviously its magnitude depends on various natural characteristics of the disease such as its infectivity or the duration of infectiousness 15  and the social distancing measures imposed by the government 1 also it depends on a plethora on socio-economic factors that govern the behavioral interactions within a population 16 17  in general we never observe the reproduction number but instead its outcome ie the number of casesdeaths hence we can utilize the known properties of the reproduction number to derive a linear regression model m m for the coronavirus outcome as where for simplicity we denote both the log of registered covid-19 cases per million population and the log of covid-19 deaths per million population of country i as y i  we focus on registered quantities normalized on per capita basis for the dependent variable instead of raw values 3 as a means to eliminate the bias in the outcome arising as a consequence of the discrepancies in the sizes of the studied countries in the equation x m i it is a k m dimensional vector of socioeconomic explanatory variables that determine the dependent variable  m is the vector describing their marginal contributions  0 is the intercept of the regression and u i is the error term the s i term controls for the impact of social distancing measures of the countries and  is its coefficient finally we also include the term d i  with  capturing its marginal effect that measures the duration of the pandemics within the economy this allows us to control for the possibility that the countries are in a different state of the disease spreading process a central question which arises is the selection of the independent variables in m m  while the literature review offers a comprehensive overview of all potential determinants in reality we are never certain of their credibility in order to circumvent the problem of choosing a model and potentially ending up with a wrong selection we resort to the technique of bayesian model averaging bma bma leverages bayesian statistics to account for model uncertainty by estimating each possible model and thus evaluating the posterior distribution of each parameter value and probability that a particular model is the correct one 18  the bma method relies on the estimation of a baseline model m 0 that is used for evaluating the performance of all other models in our case m 0 is the model which encompasses only the effect of government social distancing measures and the duration of the pandemics in the country we measure the duration of pandemics in a country simply as the number of days since the first registered case whereas in order to assess the effect of government restrictions we construct a stringency index mathematically the index quantifies the average daily variation in government responses to the pandemic dynamics as a measure for the daily variation we take the oxford covid-19 stringency index 2  the oxford covid-19 stringency index is a composite measure that combines the daily effect of policies on school closures reduction of internal movement travel bans and other similar restrictions for each country we construct a weighted average of the index from all available data since their first registered coronavirus case up to the last date of data gathering to emphasize the effect of policy restrictions implemented on an earlier date in calculating the average value we put a larger weight on those dates this is because earlier restrictions have obviously a bigger impact on the prevention of the spread of the virus the procedure implemented to derive the average government stringency index is described in greater detail in section s21 of the supplementary material sm fig 2 visualizes the results from the baseline model we observe that the countries which had stringer policies also had less covid-19 cases and deaths as expected in addition the countries with longer duration of the crisis registered more cases and deaths per million population though the effect of this variable is negligible 2 more about the index developed by the oxford group can be read at wwwbsgoxacukresearchpublicationsvariation-government-responses-covid- 19 4  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is

version posted april 17 2020  it is apparent that the baseline model can explain only a certain amount of the variations in registered covid casesdeaths a fraction of the rest we believe can be attributed to various socioeconomic determinants present within a society to derive the set of potential determinants we conduct a comprehensive literature review from the literature review we recognize a total of 35 potential socio-economic determinants listed in table 1  for a detailed description of the potential effect of the determinants we refer to the references given in the same table and the references therein in what follows we only describe in short the potential determinants on the basis of the socio-economic characteristic they exhibit healthcare infrastructure the healthcare infrastructure essentially determines both the quantity and quality with which health care services are be delivered in a time of an epidemic as measures for this determinant we include 4 variables which capture the quantity of hospital beds nurses and medical practitioners as well as the quality of the coverage of essential health services on the one hand studies report that well structured healthcare resources positively affect a countrys capacity to deal with pandemic emergencies 19 20 21 22 23 24 25  on the other hand the healthcare infrastructure also greatly impacts the countrys ability to perform testing and reporting when identifying the infected people in this regard economies with better structure are able to easily perform mass testing and more detailed reporting 26 27 28  national health statistics the physical and mental state of a person play an important role in the degree to which the individual is susceptible to a disease it is expected that a nation composed of unhealthy individuals should also experience greater consequences of an emergent epidemics 29 30 31 32  specifically metabolic disorders such as diabetes may intensify pandemic complications 33 34  whereas it has been observed that communicable diseases account for the majority of deaths in 5  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted april 17 2020  complex emergencies 35  in addition there is empirical evidence that adequate hygiene greatly reduces the rate of mortality 36 37  to quantify the national health characteristics we include 6 variables that asses the level of healthiness among the studied countries economic performance we evaluate the economic performance of a country through 6 variables this performance often mirrors the countrys ability to intervene in a case of a public health crisis 38 39 40 41 42  variables such as gdp per capita have been used in modeling health outcomes mortality trends cause-specific mortality estimation and health system performance and finances 43 44  for poor countries economic performance appears to improve health by providing the means to meet essential needs such as food clean water and shelter as well access to basic health care services however after a country reaches a certain threshold of gdp per capita few health benefits arise from further economic growth it has been suggested that this is the reason why contrary to expectations the economic downturns during the 20th century were associated with declines in mortality rates 45 46  observations indicate that what drives the health in industrialized countries is not absolute wealth or growth but how the nations resources are shared across the population 47  the more egalitarian income distribution within a rich country is associated with better health of population 48 49 50 51  nevertheless it is also known that in better economies the trade interactions and mobility of people is faster which may enhance the propagation of an transmitted disease 17 19 42 52 53  societal characteristics the characteristics of a society often reveal the way in which people interact and thus spread the disease in this aspect properties such as education and media usage reflect the level of a persons reaction and promotion of self-induced measures for reducing the spread of the disease 54 55 56 57 58  governing behavior such as control of corruption rule of law or government effectiveness further enhance societal responsibility 59 60  there are findings which identify the religious view as a critical determinant in the health outcome 61 62  evidently the religion drives a persons attitudes towards cooperation government legal rules markets and thriftiness 63  finally the way we mix in society may effectively control the spread of infectious diseases 17 53 64 65 66  to measure the characteristics of a society we identify 9 variables demographic structure similarly to the national health statistics the demographic structure may evaluate the susceptibility of the population to a disease certain age groups may simply have weaker defensive health mechanisms to cope with the stress induced by the disease 67 68 69  in addition the location of living may greatly affect the way in which the disease is spread 70 71  to express these phenomena we collect 6 variables natural environment a preserved natural environment ensures healthy lives and promotes well-being for all at all ages in contrast countries where natural sustainability is deteriorated and observables such as air pollution are of immense magnitude are also more vulnerable to epidemic outbreak 6 7 72 73  however healthy natural environments also attract a plethora of tourists and thus may help in an easier transformation from epidemic to a pandemic we gather the data for 4 variables which capture the essence of this socio-economic characteristic 26 6  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license

distinct bma models in the first model the dependent variable is the log of covid-19 cases per million population whereas in the second model we investigate the critical determinants of the log of the mortality rate due to the coronavirus the data gathering and preprocessing procedure is described in section s1 whereas the mathematical background of bma together with our inference setup is given in section s22 tables 2 and 3 display the respective results in both tables the determinants are ordered according to their posterior inclusion probabilities pip given in the second column pip quantifies the posterior probability that a given determinant belongs to the true linear regression model besides this statistic we also provide the the posterior mean post mean and the posterior standard deviation post std post mean is an estimate of the average magnitude of the effect of a determinant whereas the post std evaluates the deviation from this value in the estimation procedure we a priori assume that the true model consists of the baseline model and 3 additional independent variables this implies that the prior inclusion probability of each potential determinant is around 009 hence we can divide the determinants into four groups according to their posterior inclusion probability value 74  determinants with strong evidence pip  05 the first group describes the determinants which have by far larger posterior inclusion probability than the prior one and thus there is strong evidence to be included in the true model we find two variables for which there is such evidence in explaining the coronavirus cases population size and gdp per capita pc the population size is negatively related to the number of registered covid-19 cases per million population whereas the gdp pc exhibits a positive effect on the same variable in the situation of coronavirus deaths however only the gdp pc remains a strong predictor with a positive magnitude determinants with medium evidence  05  pip  01 one variable displays medium evidence for being a crucial socio-economic determinant of the registered covid cases 19 -the government health spending with a positive impact when looking at the bma estimation of covid-19 deaths besides this determinant government effectiveness also shows a medium pip size determinants with weak evidence 01 pip 001 these are determinants which have a lower posterior than the prior probability to be included in the true model but still may account for some of the variations in the coronavirus outcome for the cases per million population there are 5 such determinants out of which 2 have a negative impact the percentage of the population using internet and the mortality rate from lack of hygiene the results suggest that life expectancy population density and a population consisting of majorly catholic population have a low evidence for having a negative marginal effect on the observed covid-19 cases there are 7 determinants for which there is low evidence to be included in the true model describing the coronavirus deaths four of them have a negative post mean population size rule of law control of corruption and mortality rate from lack of hygiene whereas the presence of catholic religion and the number of physicians pr capita exhibit a positive post mean value  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the

this version posted april 17 2020  both coronavirus cases and coronavirus deaths is the level of economic development wealthier countries display larger susceptibility to the disease interestingly besides the level of economic development the population size is also a credible predictor of the registered coronavirus cases per million population with more populated economies showing greater resistance to being infected by the virus a plentiful of reasons can be used as a possible interpretation for these results for instance it is known that in structured populations the degree of epidemic spread scales inversely with population size 75  this is because everything else considered in larger populations it is easier to identify and target the critical individuals that are susceptible to the disease 76  in a similar fashion various explanations can be found for the observed effect of economic development such as increased population mobility and aging population however it could also be the case that more developed countries have a bigger testing power and provide better evidence for the coronavirus situation in fact this may be suggested by our discovery that there is a medium evidence for past government health expenditure to be positively associated with the coronavirus outcome clearly the interpretation of our analysis requires a more detailed background due to several reasons among these reasons is the fact that we include several potential determinants only through crude approximations in particular the level of social mixing is given simply as the average number of persons in a household or the dominant religion in the country we do not follow the exact social network structures within a population it is evident that the inhomogeneous nature of these spatial patterns has an essential role in propagation of diseases 17  in this regard in future versions of this study we aim to incorporate more detailed measures which capture the essence of social connectedness 77 the degree of individualism 78 andor community mobility data 3  in addition the spread of the coronavirus is obviously still in a transient regime even though we include a proxy for the duration of the coronavirus pandemic in each country this essentially hinders the development of a coherent modeling framework these underexpressed effects may play a significant role in the final outcome of the coronavirus pandemic nonetheless in the absence of a unifying framework covering all relevant aspects our investigation acts as the starting point for the development of a more comprehensive understanding of the socio-economic factors of the coronavirus pandemic we believe that with the availability of new data and the improved understanding of the dynamics of the coronavirus pandemic some of these shortcomings will be overcome yielding a more reliable interpretation of the results 1 neil ferguson daniel laydon gemma nedjati gilani natsuko imai kylie ainslie

baseline model m 0  in our case this is the model including government social distancing measures and the length of the coronavirus crisis in the country with this setup we can define the posterior distribution of  as a weighted average of the posterior distributions of the parameters under each model using the posterior model probabilities as weights g y   posterior inclusion probabilities offer a more robust way of determining the effect of a variable in a model as opposed to using p-values for determining statistical significance of a model coefficient because they incorporate the uncertainty of model selection according to equations s3 and s4 it is clear that we need to specify priors for the parameters of each model and for the model probability itself to keep the model simple and easily implemented here we use the most often implemented priors in other words for the parameter space we elicit a prior on the error variance that is proportional to its inverse p 2   1 2  and a uniform distribution on the intercept p  1 while the zellners g-prior is used for the  m parameters and for the model space we utilise the beta-binomial prior to estimate the posterior parameters we use a markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampler and report results from a run with 200 million recorded drawings and after a burn-in of 100 million discarded drawings the theoretical

covid-19 is rapidly changing examining public perceptions and behaviors in response to this evolving pandemic holly seale anita heywood e julie leask meru sheel susan thomas david durrheim n katarzyna bolsewicz rajneesh kaur wen-jun tu   in the course of four months since the first reports about a novel strain of coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 emerging in december 2019 1 2 countries around the world have introduced a range of community mitigation strategies with the aim to lower the trajectory of this pandemic by reducing transmission and avoid overwhelming health services community mitigation strategies refer to measures that people and communities can take to slow the spread of infection during a period when vaccines andor medical treatments that are not available 3 they include the use of personal protective measures for everyday use eg voluntary home isolation of ill persons respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene community measures aimed at increasing social distancing eg maintaining a physical distance of 1520 meters between people staying at home and postponing or cancelling gatherings and environmental measures eg routinely disinfecting surfaces in some settings these strategies are voluntary whereas in others they are now enforced such as via fines andor jail time governments are implementing strategies at large-scale that have previously been used in limited ways and for limited time periods ie during ebola avian influenza outbreaks and sars this means a large proportion of the population do not have prior experience undertaking these strategies peoples ability to comply with recommendations during emergency situations is influenced by a range of modifiable and nonmodifiable factors including 1 what people perceive their susceptibility to infection to be 4 2 whether they perceive the infection to be serious if acquired 3 whether they have the necessary capacity confidence and resources to comply with the strategies 5 and 4 their sociodemographic status 6 effective control of this pandemic requires an understanding of peoples perceptions about their willingness motivation and abilitycapacity to adopt strategies and how this relates to their perceived risk 7 perceived costs perceptions about the benefits of the behaviors and the perceived impact of an individuals behavior on anothers health will also influence engagement with these behaviors 8 9 in australia the government has recommended specific behaviors that can be classed as hygiene-related and avoidance related to engage in these behaviors people will weigh up the perceived costs and benefits related to themselves and others it is therefore important to understand community perceptions and behaviors in order to develop effective messages accordingly we carried out a cross sectional online survey of a large demographically representative sample of the population of australia in march 2020 we conducted an online survey of australian residents via a market research company quality online research qor between 18 and 24 march 2020 this sample size provided us with a sample error of 3 proportional quota

who felt they could not manage self-isolation at home n  122 8 the main concerns were centered around carers responsibilities for children elderly parents and disabled family members our results suggest that a large proportion of respondents have adopted one or more of either the hygiene-related andor avoidance-related behaviors that had been recommended by the australian government considering the intense media coverage and government information it is not surprising that there was a gravitation towards actual or willingness for adoption of hygiene strategies including hand washingsanitizing while anxiety levels were moderate concerns were raised about accessing food and medical supplies if placed into self-isolation given the limited community behavioral covid-19 studies published we have compared our findings to two ongoing community surveys firstly results from an online poll of 14000 respondents from 14 countries conducted at the same time point as our study reported that their respondents in 814 countries expressed a belief that social distancing measures such as travel bans and self-isolation would not prevent the spread of the virus including participants from australia 52 12 secondly a german survey conducted a week earlier then our study identified that respondents had high levels of knowledge but adoption of important protection behaviors was very low and risk perceptions were especially low among the elderly 13 lastly a survey from malaysia reported that a high proportion of respondents were already adopting precautions such as avoiding crowds 834 and practicing proper hand hygiene 878 at the time of their study in late march however the wearing of face masks was less common 512 14 amongst our participants perceived susceptibility to covid-19 was at an intermediate level this aligns with results found in a similar study conducted in the uk which reported that just under half of their cohort n  2108 were likely to acquire covid-19 while 56 felt that it would have a moderate impact ie would require them to self-care and rest in bed 15 in addition a separate survey of australian residents also found that two thirds of respondents were at least moderately worried about a widespread covid-19 outbreak in australia in early march 16 risk perceptions were also found to be moderate median 5 out of 10 based on an online poll of us residents undertaken in early february 17 there may be several factors at play here that account for the perceived level of risk firstly people may be unaware of true risk since little reporting has focused on attack rates during the time of the study secondly people may be subject to optimism biasa phenomenon where people downplay their own risk of an outcome 18 thirdly it is likely that some people assess their risk as being low due to already factoring in a change towards anticipated or already accomplished protective behavior 19 during events that people deem familiar we often see unrealistic optimism because the risk is perceived to be under control as was the case in 2009 with the influenza pandemic when adoption of precautions was low and there was a sense of personal security 4 however covid-19 presents as an unfamiliar risk for the large majority of the population had not experienced outbreaks of sars or mers making the risk less tolerable for those who perceive the situation as uncontrollable 20 when it comes to perceptions of risk there are numerous studies documenting how they are associated with the uptake of preventive andor avoidant behaviors studies conducted duringafter the 2003 sars outbreak reported that higher levels of perceived risksusceptibility of sars was associated with the adoption of preventive behaviors and also avoidance behaviors 2124 while understanding a persons perception of risk is important it is not the only condition needed for engagement higher risk perceptions may only predict protective behavior when people believe that effective protective actions are available response efficacy and when they are confident that they can engage in such protective actions self-efficacy 25 according to bandura social cognitive theory an individuals self-efficacy plays a crucial role on the individuals likelihood to engage in a desired behavior if an individual does not believe that heshe can carry out the behavior ie physically distance themselves there is little motivation to engage 26 three-quarters of the study respondents agreed that they could adopt the avoidance-related strategies with lower scores for working from home and self-isolation at home when asked whether they had adopted any of the hygiene related strategies washing or sanitizing hands were the most common responses these findings have also been replicated in an online survey of 5974 residents from the us and uk that found that 92 of the cohort would adopt hygiene related behaviors 27 these represent more readily adoptable strategies as people in the community understand how to engage in them believe that the strategy will protect them and usually have the resources to carry them out these easy to adopt actions have also been a focus of government mass media messages when it came to avoidance behaviors our respondents were less inclined to rate them as being effective or to have adopted them in comparison to the preventive behaviors listed above perceptions regarding the efficacy of the strategy as opposed to self-efficacy have also been found to impact on intentionslikelihood to adopt or actual uptake 23 28 it is not surprising that some strategies including social distancing scored low as people may not understand what the strategy entails the rationale for its use or what impact it may have on ones health it should also be noted that individuals may not have the capacity or resources to comply with physical distancing measures because they 1 have extended families living in their households 2 they have a responsibility to provide care for someone outside of their home 3 they may reside in share accommodation 4 may not have access to internetcomputer in the home setting or 5 because of the type of job they have they cannot simply shift to working from home in these settings providing mass media education is not going to suffice what is needed is pragmatic solutions that support people financially and socially to participate examples including increases in social support and charities to assist with delivery of groceries and meals home delivery from chemists telehealth consultations bulk billed drive through vaccine clinics etc it has been suggested that we start to prime people about what additional strategies may still need to be introduced 29 this would entail talking with them about why the strategy would be implemented the end-goal of implementing it what could be the potential impacts how members of the public engage and the criteria for its de-escalation in order to promote cooperation with social physical distancing strategies governments may need to use realistic portrayals community stories and role modelling by influential actors in social networks observing competent role models perform actions that result in success conveys information to observers about the sequence of actions to use to be successful 30 motivation may be helped by creating media campaigns that foster awareness of the recommended behaviors and encourage people to share their strategies for complying with self-isolation and working from home amongst our respondents older age was associated with the adoption of precautionary behaviors which aligns with the findings from singapore and hong kong during the 2003 sars outbreak 7 23 and some studies during the 2009 h1n1a pandemic 31 32 however the pattern of age is not straight forward in contrast to the above studies others have reported higher levels of adoption of preventive behaviors amongst younger people 1824 years in the context of the 2009 influenza pandemic when it comes to gender we found that females were more likely to report uptake of both preventive and avoidance behaviors consistent with studies during sars and h1n1 pandemic influenza 4 7 23 33 earlier studies have indicated that women are more likely to perceive themselves to be susceptible and hence adopt the behaviors 21 34 when it comes to country of birth we found that people born outside of australia were less likely to adopt behaviors this finding may relate to the capacity to access information which at the time was being disseminated in english and largely through mainstream media conferences and health department websites rather than community and language groups further work is needed to explore the associations between country of birth and pandemic-related behaviors when asked what would motivate respondents to comply with a social distancing strategy they nominated i believe it is the right thing to do as the primary response while this answer did not have any significant relationship with the outcome measures reviewed it is still relevant when it comes to planning communication messages it suggests that respondents may be influenced by a desire for social approval from others an idea linked to the model of moral motivation the model developed by brekke et al 2003 assumes that individuals have preferences for achieving and maintaining a self-image as a socially responsible person 35 in brekke et als model self-image improves when the individuals actual behavior gets closer to herhis view of the morally ideal behavior ie the behavior that would maximize social welfare if chosen by every member of society however individuals participation can be conditional on whether they think others are also contributing 36 mass media campaigns that frame their messages around a social collective actionpower or the inclusion of the general public within a team to assist the community response may be effective the promotion of prosocial behaviors has been shown to be effective in vaccination uptake and could be adapted in promoting covid-19 mitigation behaviors such as how ones actions can contribute to protecting their grandparents 37 this idea has been picked up by celebrities and the wider community on twitter under the lockdownforlove with people nominating who they are social distancing for whether these strategies work needs to be further examined early results from a study conducted across the us uk and germany has suggested that inducing empathy for those most vulnerable to the virus promotes the motivation to adhere to physical distancing 38 the use of empathy in messaging is not a new concept and has been applied in a range of ways from the promotion of testingtreatment for stis through to increasing our acceptance of robots 39 40 empathy is a skill which enables understanding of another persons experience here people could be asked to imagine the perceptions needs and impact health financial social of pandemic covid-19 amongst our family membersfriends our study includes a large representative cross-section of the adult australian population people who could not communicate in english were excluded from the sample which may have affected representation of ethnic minorities we also had under-representation of aboriginal australians and torres strait islanders and from those in remote settings secondly as participation in our study was on a voluntary basis this study has potential for self-selection bias by community members who are particularly concerned about this pandemic we relied on self-reports of behaviors which may have led to over-reported social desirability bias however this may have minimized as the survey was self-complete and anonymous lastly we did not collect information about income level and so unable to comment on variations in behaviors by income based on the available data it appears that older individuals aged 60 years and people with chronic underlying health conditions are particularly susceptible to severe disease this presents a challenging situation in the media there is reporting that covid-19 is causing mild illness in the majority but its in the best interest of the country to stay home in order to flatten the curve this will cause two responsesthose who continue with their normal practice not adopting or complying with the recommendations around social distancingmitigation strategies as identified in a proportion of our respondents motivating this group especially those less likely to be at risk or suffer the health impact of covid-19 to adopt behaviors that require marked change in their routines beyond those related to personal hygiene it may prove difficult unless people understand the required behavior the rationale for it are given clear and sufficient information about how to comply and they believe the strategy will have an impact and are motivated to act 9 23 41 they also need to have capacity and opportunity to comply with new behaviors for another 4 to 6 months in order to engage a community they need to feel like they are a valued part of a team and that their contributions are valued and key to the response lastly it is essential that governments ensure that resources legalization and support measures are in place in order to facilitate community participation in community mitigation strategies  age profile of susceptibility mixing and social distancing shape the dynamics of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in china juanjuan zhang maria litvinova yuxia liang yan wang wei wang shanlu zhao qianhui wu stefano merler cecile viboud alessandro vespignani marco ajelli hongjie yu  strict interventions were successful to control the novel coronavirus covid-19 outbreak in china as transmission intensifies in other countries the interplay between age contact patterns social distancing susceptibility to infection and disease and covid-19 dynamics remains unclear to answer these questions we analyze contact surveys data for wuhan and shanghai before and during the outbreak and contact tracing information from hunan province daily contacts were reduced 7-9 fold during the covid-19 social distancing period with most interactions restricted to the household children 0-14 years were 59 95 ci 7-82 less susceptible than individuals 65 years and over a transmission model calibrated against these data indicates that social distancing alone as implemented in china during the outbreak is sufficient to control covid-19 while proactive school closures cannot interrupt transmission on their own they reduce peak incidence by half and delay the epidemic these findings can help guide global intervention policies the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 epidemic caused by sars-cov-2 originated in wuhan city china in december 2019 and quickly spread nationally and globally with 179111 cases reported in 159 countriesterritoriesareas as of march 17 2020 1 a total of 80894 cases of covid-19 including 3237 deaths have been reported in mainland china including 50005 cases in wuhan city and 361 cases in shanghai city the epidemic in wuhan and in the rest of china slowed down after implementation of strict containment measures and movement restrictions 2 however key questions remain about the age profile of susceptibility symptoms and infectivity with this disease how social distancing alters age-specific contact patterns and how these factors interact to affect transmission these questions will have a profound effect on the choice of control policies in locations where covid-19 transmission is now intensifying in this study we evaluate changes in human mixing patterns brought about by social distancing by conducting contact surveys in the midst of the epidemic in two wuhan and shanghai we all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission perpetuity  also estimate age differences in susceptibility to infection and clinical disease based on contact tracing information gathered by the hunan provincial center for disease control and prevention cdc china based on those findings we develop a mathematical transmission model to disentangle how transmission is affected by age differences in the biology of covid-19 infection and disease and altered mixing patterns due to social distancing in turn we project the impact of social distancing and school closure on covid-19 transmission to estimate changes in age-mixing patterns associated with covid-19 interventions we performed contact surveys in two cities wuhan the epicenter of the outbreak and shanghai one of the largest and most densely populated cities in southeast china shanghai experienced extensive importation of covid-19 cases from wuhan as well as local transmission 3  the surveys were conducted from february 1 2020 to february 10 2020 as transmission of covid-19 peaked across china and stringent interventions were in place participants in wuhan were asked to complete a questionnaire describing their contact behavior 4 5 on two different days i a regular weekday between december 24 2020 and december 30 2020 before the covid-19 outbreak was officially recognized by the wuhan municipal health commission used as baseline and ii the day before the interview outbreak period a similar survey was conducted in shanghai to obtain information on contacts during the covid-19 outbreak period contacts for the baseline period were based on a survey using the same design conducted in the same city in 2017-2018 6  details are given in the supplementary material we analyzed a total of 1245 contacts reported by 636 study participants in wuhan and 1296 contacts reported by 557 participants in shanghai in wuhan the average daily number of contacts per participant was significantly reduced from 146 for a regular weekday weighted mean contacts by age structure 140 to 20 for the outbreak period weighted mean contacts by age structure 19 p0001 the reduction in contacts was significant for all stratifications by sex age group type of profession and household size except for pre-school children aged 0-6 years old tab 1 a larger reduction was observed in shanghai where the average daily number of contacts declined from 206 weighted mean contacts by age structure 217 to 23 weighted mean contacts by age structure 21 although an average individual in shanghai reported more contacts than one in wuhan on a regular weekday this difference disappeared during the covid-19 outbreak period the typical features of age-mixing patterns5 6 emerge in wuhan and shanghai when we consider the regular baseline weekday period  fig 1a and 1d  these features can be illustrated in the form of age-stratified contact matrices provided as ready-to-use tables in the supplementary materials where each cell represents the average number of contacts that an individual has with other individuals stratified by age groups the bottom left corner of the matrix corresponding to contacts between school age children is where the largest number of contacts is recorded the contribution of contacts in the workplace is visible in the central part of the matrix while the three diagonals from bottom left to top right represent contacts between household members in contrast for the outbreak period where strict social distancing was in place much of the above-mentioned features disappears essentially leaving the sole contribution of household mixing  fig 1b and 1e  in particular contacts between school-age individuals are fully removed as highlighted by differencing baseline and outbreak matrices  fig 1c and  1f  overall contacts during the outbreak mostly occurred at home with household members 941 in wuhan and 785 in shanghai thus the outbreak contact matrix nearly coincides with the within-household contact matrix in both study sites and the assortativity by age feature observed for regular days almost entirely disappear see supplementary materials all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission perpetuity preprint which was not certified by peer review is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in the copyright holder for this this version posted march 20 2020  to understand the interplay between social distancing interventions changes in human mixing patterns and outbreak dynamics we also need to consider potential age differences in susceptibility to infection this is currently a topic of debate as little information on the age profile of asymptomatic cases is available 7 8  to this aim we analyzed contact tracing information from detailed epidemiological field investigations conducted by the hunan cdc supplement we calculated the age-specific relative risk of infection for close contacts of confirmed covid-19 index cases briefly all close contacts of covid-19 cases reported in hunan province were placed under medical observation for 14 days and were tested using real-time rt-pcr those who developed symptoms and tested positive were considered as symptomatic confirmed cases while contacts who tested positive without exhibiting symptoms were considered as asymptomatic infections the total of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections was used to estimate the relative susceptibility to infection by age the ratio of symptomatic cases to total infections was used to estimate the relative probability of developing symptoms see supplementary material we found age differences in susceptibility to sars-cov2 infection where young individuals aged 0-14 years had a lower risk of infection than individual ages 65 years and over or041 95ci 018-093 p-value0026 there was a weak non-significant trend towards lower susceptibility in middle-aged adults relative to seniors or076 95ci 046-124 tab 2 these findings are in contrast with a previous study in shenzhen where susceptibility to infection did not change with age 7 moreover we found that the relative probability of developing symptoms also increased with age however the difference was not statistically significant tab 2 based on the estimated age-specific mixing patterns and susceptibility to covid-19 infection we developed a sir model of sars-cov-2 transmission and tested the impact of social distancing measures on disease dynamics in the model the population is divided into three epidemiological categories susceptible infectious and removed either recovered or deceased individuals stratified by 14 age groups susceptible individuals can become infectious after contact with an infectious individual according to the estimated age-specific susceptibility to infection because we did not see age differences in the probability of developing symptoms upon infection we assumed equal infectivity across all age groups the rate at which contacts occur is determined by the estimated mixing patterns in each age group a key parameter regulating the dynamics of the model is the basic reproduction number r0 which corresponds to the average number of secondary cases generated by a primary case in a fully susceptible population the mean time interval between two consecutive generations of cases was taken to be 51 days 2  details are reported in the supplementary materials for baseline r0 values in the range 20-35 associated with a regular weekday contact patterns corresponding to the early phase of covid-19 spread in wuhan 9-15 we find that the profound alteration of mixing patterns of the magnitude observed in wuhan and shanghai leads to a drastic decrease in r0 when we consider contact matrices representing the outbreak period keeping the same baseline disease transmissibility as the pre-intervention period the reproductive number drops well below the epidemic threshold both in wuhan and shanghai  fig 2a  in an uncontrolled epidemic without intervention measure travel restriction or spontaneous behavioral response of the population we estimate the mean infection attack rate to be in the range 64-92 after a year of sars-cov-2 circulation with slight variation between wuhan and shanghai variations of about 5-12 fig 2b  on the other hand if we consider a scenario where social distancing measures are implemented early on as the new virus emerges the estimated r0 remains under the threshold and thus the epidemic cannot take off in either location furthermore we estimate that the magnitude of interventions implemented in wuhan and shanghai would have been enough to bring the reproduction number below 10 for baseline r0 up to 7 in wuhan and 115 in shanghai fig 2a  we also conduct sensitivity analyses on assumptions about the susceptibility profile of infections since there is still uncertainty about this parameter see supplementary material our conclusions are robust to assuming equal susceptibility in all age groups finally armed with a carefully calibrated model we turn to assess the impact of a preemptive mass school closure we used the same estimates of relative susceptibility to infection by age as in our main analysis see supplementary material for a sensitivity analysis assuming equal susceptibility to infection we considered two different contact pattern scenarios based on data from shanghai contacts estimated during vacations period 6 and contacts estimated during regular weekdays after all contacts occurring in school settings have been removed 6  either one of these scenarios represent a simplification of a school closure strategy as during vacations children can still attend additional education while removing all contacts in the school setting does not take into account that for instance parents may need to leave work to take care of children we estimated that limiting contact patterns to those observed during vacations would interrupt transmission for baseline r0 up to 15 fig 2c  removing all school contacts would do the same for baseline r0 up to 12 if we apply these interventions to a covid-19 scenario assuming a baseline r0 of 2 -35 we can achieve a noticeable decrease in infection attack rate and peak incidence and a delay in the epidemic but transmission is not interrupted fig 2d  for instance for baseline r025 and assuming a vacation mixing pattern the peak daily incidence is reduced by about 57 in the corresponding scenario where school contacts are removed we estimate a reduction of about 20 overall school-based policies are not sufficient to entirely prevent a covid-19 outbreak but they can have a significant impact on disease dynamics and hence on hospital surge capacity this study suffers from several limitations first the estimated mixing patterns for a regular weekday in wuhan may be affected by recall bias since contacts were assessed retrospectively for shanghai we relied on a survey conducted in december 2017 -may 2018 using the same design as the one conducted during the outbreak period thus avoiding recall bias it is also important to note that changes in contact patterns were measured in a context where social distancing was applied together with rapid isolation of infected individuals including suspected cases and quarantine of close contacts for 14 days only a small portion of the population in the two study sites was affected by contact tracing and quarantine thus having little to no effect on the average contact patterns of the general population however in reconstructing the observed epidemics in wuhan and shanghai it is not possible to separate the effects of case-based strategies from population wide social distancing in our simulation model we estimated the effect of social distancing alone combining social distancing and case-based interventions would have a synergistic effect to further reduce transmission further our estimates of age differences in susceptibility to infection and probability of developing symptoms are based on active testing of contacts of 57 primary confirmed cases these data suffer from the usual difficulties inherent to identifying epidemiological links and index cases seroepidemiology studies are currently lacking but will be essential to fully resolve the population susceptibility profile of covid-19 while the age patterns of contacts were not significantly different between the two study locations during the covid-19 outbreak period these patterns may not be fully representative of other locations in china and abroad where social distancing measures may differ modeling results may possibly be underestimating the effect of social distancing interventions as our results account for a decreased number of contacts but ignore the impact of increased awareness of the population which may have also affected the type of social interactions eg increased distance between individuals while in contact or use of face mask 16 17  finally our school closure simulations are not meant to formulate a full intervention strategy which would require identification of epidemic triggers to initiate closures and evaluation of all rights reserved no reuse

infection attack rate and peak incidence to generalize these findings to other contexts location-specific age-mixing patterns and population structures should be considered our study provides evidence that the interventions put in place in wuhan and shanghai and the resulting changes in human behavior drastically decreased daily contacts essentially reducing them to household interactions assuming the same scale of contact-distancing measures were to be put in place in other locations human mixing patterns could be captured by data on within-household contacts which are available for several countries around the world 4 5 6 18 19 20  further research should concentrate on refining age-specific estimates of susceptibility to infection disease and infectivity which are instrumental to

corona virus disease sars-cov-2 outbreak a behavioral infectious disease policy model the december 2019 new corona virus disease sars-cov-2 outbreak a behavioral infectious disease policy model jeroen struben  since the december 2019 coronavirus sars-cov-2 outbreak began to spread globally significant variation has emerged and sustained among countries responses and successes we outline a flexible behavioral dynamic and sectorial epidemic model of both virus transmission dynamics and endogenous policy and citizen responses the model allows exploring distinct policy interventions comprising general and targeted testing and social contact reduction efforts calibrating the model to the ongoing sars-cov-2 pandemic at the level of continents we demonstrate how the early and extensive buildup of testing and social contact reduction efforts interplay to suppress the outbreak further through a synthetic dynamic analysis of virus resurgence and of stratified case severity across population segments we show the importance of targeted approaches for effectively reducing the multifaceted impacts of the outbreak finally to aide critical collective involvement of policymakers volunteers citizens and media for successfully controlling outbreaks as these a version of the model is also available as a free web-based management flight simulator  response to the progression of the outbreak populations alter their social contacts and how policymakers and health experts ramp up testing and reporting and implement policies related to social distancing the model differentiates reactive and proactive testing approaches as well as differentiates interventions such as general population social distancing home confinement of suspected populations and quarantining of positive cases detected importantly in the model as in real life citizens and policy makers respond to reported -not actual -data of a progressing virus outbreak each of these behaviors in turn alters the outbreak path itself the model tracks key epidemic variables over time including the population within the various epidemic stages and the reproductive number -the average number of secondary cases that one case generates over the course of its infectious period as well as clinical data hospitalizations deaths and behavioral data such as the degree of social contacts and home-confined population reported versus actual cases etc the model is generic in the sense that it can be used to explore how the dynamics change depending assumptions related to infectious diseases such as sars hiv h1n1 and h5n1 influenza and ebola 1 as well as can handle differing assumptions about citizen and policy behavior across populations within and across socio-demographic segments here we use the model to explore both current questions about managing the december 2019 sars-cov-2 outbreak and future questions about managing resurgence we develop a baseline run that calibrates the most important parameters against the rapidly developing data and literature on the ongoing sars-cov-2 outbreak roser ritchie and ortiz-ospina 2020 dong du and gardner 2020 the lancet 2020  disaggregating our baseline at the level of continents we demonstrate how differences in early and extensive testing and extensive social contact reduction measures interplay and can explain different outbreak pathways across regions we also highlight the challenge of catching up once falling behind in curtailing the outbreak we then use the model to perform synthetic dynamic analysis of virus resurgence and of differential eg age-related vulnerability to the virus across population segments we show the importance of targeted approaches for effectively reducing the multifaceted impacts of the outbreak while stylized the model demonstrates the fundamental complex dynamics of infectious diseases caused by both virus transmission and human behavior powerful positive feedbacks that accelerate infections combine with delays in infection detectability inertia in the buildup of testing capabilities and with challenges in rapidly limiting human contacts together these factors lay the ground for the risks associated with wait-and-see approaches to epidemic outbreaks in showing these interdependencies the model further helps understand how swift and comprehensive responses can reduce the impact of epidemic outbreaks in clarifying these endogenous dynamics our model provides insights that are fundamentally different from but complement policy models that study interventions as exogenous shocks kissler et al 2020  by allowing the exploration of different intervention strategies through endogenous behavior -from social distancing advice to self-home confinement  and enforced quarantine we provide a general quantitative framework for better understand under what conditions measures are critical for successful reversing epidemic growth if applied efficaciously at an early stage of an outbreak or during the later stage of resurgence management finally because much of the success depends on collective involvement from not only experts but also policy makers local volunteers citizens and media that all need to better understand these dynamics a version of the model has been coupled to a free online behavioral infectious disease simulator struben 2020  that enables users to explore the impact of government and citizen responses and how they could alter the course of a pandemic in the remainder we provide a short background of the 2019 coronavirus outbreak the responses and of the existing relevant literature we then and perform a number of calibrated and stylized simulations to demstrate the value of the model we end by discussing next steps from december 31 2019 march 3 2020

causes the respiratory illness coronavirus disease 2019  hereafter we solely use the acronym sars-cov-2 indicating either main symptoms include diverse symptoms from respiratory infections ranging from mild to severe such as fever malaise cough shortness of breath and pneumonia in addition phlegm sore throat headache hemoptysis nausea and diarrhea also appear elderly immunocompromised patients and patients with underlying medical comorbidities are most likely to be in critical condition or die from the virus best current estimates suggest a case fatality rate cfr for sars-cov-2 of about 1-2 shim et al 2020 who 2020b  much larger than the order of 01 for a moderate seasonal influenza yet there is still much uncertainty about this number because of the often limited testing capabilities and endogenous factors such as hospital overload ghaffarzadegan and rahmandad 2020  further estimating the cfr requires information about the number infected the denominator yet this number is hard to detect because of the large number of cases with mild andor flu-like symptoms for example about 80 of people with sars-cov-2 has mild or no symptoms while 20 has severe symptoms with about a third of those latter group becoming critically ill ecdc 2020 the extent of an epidemic outbreak is affected by key virus transmission parameters estimating values of parameters such as infectious contacts and duration of infectivity is of critical interest to those seeking to impact this anderson et al 2020  compared to influenza or ebola transmission is rapid due too high infectivity the duration of the infectious period for sars-cov-2 is estimated to be 5-10 days zou et al 2020  after an incubation period of 2-14 55 average days the incubation period for sars-cov-2 is about 5-6 days li et al 2020  the fundamental metric transmissibility of a virus the basic reproduction number r0 -representing the number of people infected during once infectivity at the first infection -is estimated to be on the order of 24-33 quite higher than that for seasonal flus or ebola chowell et al 2004  but lower than for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars lipsitch et al 2003 read et al 2020 walker et al 2020  estimates using this reproduction number suggest that globally an unmitigated sars-cov-2 epidemic would lead to about 70 billion infections walker et al 2020  given the case fatality estimates this could potentially result in resulting in 40 million deaths an unmitigated scenario while important as reference is unrealistic because transmission rates decline as no matter how governments and citizens will respond as reported cases and deaths accumulate leading to reduced contacts however with such a high basic reproduction number outcomes must be seen in not only the total number of deaths but also the peak load on the health systems and the risks of resurgence therefore key policy questions are what set of responses and their timings help manage the outbreak path in the short and longer run ferguson et al 2020 pueyo 2020  and at what cost eichenbaum et al 2020  responses in asia south korea hong kong singapore mainland china and to some extent japan show that active policy measures such as quarantine social distancing and isolation of infected populations can contain the epidemic who 2020b while the outbreak has been contained within multiple countries through early government action and through social distancing measures taken by individuals in many other countries this has not been the case 2 to illustrate consider the outbreak and responses across three continents  figure 1  the three graphs show respectively cumulative reported cases per million people pmp cumulative tests performed pmp and metrics of social activities starting from the day of the first case reported case to the who december 31 2019 time  0 in the figure until april 8 time  100 the first reported cases within south korea italy the first known epicenter in europe and united states occurred all within one day january 18-19 2020 figure 1  top left initially reported cases were much higher in south korea suggesting it had become an epicenters however the fate of the countries differed considerably during the following 90 days whereas in south korea reported cases stabilized under 200 pmp by early march in italy by the end of march it was at 1700 cases pmp whereas in the united states by the end of march there were already 527 reported cases pmp case reporting however is not independent from case testing in south korea it took 43 days to get from the first reported case to 2500 tests pmp at which point there were 68 reported cases ppm italy reached 2500 tests pmp 15 days later with reported cases ppm at 291 ppm  the united states reached this on march 27 26 days later than south korea at which point there were 260 steeply growing cases ppm with exceptions such as iceland testing has lagged more in many other countries ----------figure 1 about here ------------south koreas approach reflects a more proactive approach beyond just testing in particular south korea has focused on early detection of persons at risk and so to identify and then isolate the virus korean cdcs 2020 as part of this south korea implemented a policy of early and widespread identification of suspected cases through targeted testing and isolation of suspected cases -family members and through contact tracing those that are thought to have been in close contact with positive cases the quarantining and monitoring of positive and suspected cases involves follow up according to specific protocol and timing finally efforts are done to build capacity of local government build systems of cooperation between affiliated organizations and educate and raise public awareness among the community korean cdcs 2020 in europe confinement policies have been implemented but often much more slowly yet they have more focused on confinement of the general population italys general lockdown commenced in the center and was gradually expanded to northern provinces march 8 in the united states despite urging from public health experts by eatly april some states and counties have taken limited action with beaches and restaurants still open axelrod 2020  indeed social activity has taken much more time to slow in europe and north america figure 1  bottom showing short term air bb lettings and mobility trends for places like public transport hubs such as subway bus and train stations  these contrasting results suggest that a mixture of interventions are considered to affect outcomes research suggests the importance of not only testing and general social distancing as often practiced in epidemic outbreaks jefferson et al 2008  but also more targeted approaches fraser et al 2004 wong et al 2016  yet outcomes will be very sensitive to the actual actions taken some of which depend on specific regional conditions we develop a computational model of infectious disease outbreak dynamics that captures the distributions of times to symptoms and infectiousness for the etiological agent concerned and consistent with earlier theoretical studies but that is also sensitive to the socio-behavioral complexity of policies and citizen response the model focuses on an infectious disease outbreak throughout its epidemic period while the main focus of the model is highlighting interactions among key policy levers and citizen responses and with virus transmission dynamics transmission and behavior can be affected considerably by geographic and by socio-demographic conditions for example the perceived severity of the outbreak at which policy makers and citizens begin to respond to the outbreak -differs by region and is in the baseline lower for the early asian countries than for others regions to allow exploring key sensitivities to demographic variation he model disaggregates into n demographic segments these sections can be used to represent geographical regions such as continents countries provinces for example as long they are sufficiently large so that individual contacts are less important the sectors can also be used to represent different socio-demographic segments older versus younger populations vulnerable versus less vulnerable groups within a geographic region in what follows we highlight only the key model concepts structures and variables figure 2 provides a high level overview likewise the accompanying figures show simplified representations of the model sections the online appendix 3 appendix a1 lists the model equations in the same sequencing as below and provide additional visuals the model itself is also available for download ----------figure 2 about here ------------ the core of the model forms a classic epidemiological compartmental model called the susceptible-exposed -infectious symptomatic-recovered seir model  figure 3  commonly used by epidemiologists hethcote 2000  the infectious population transmits the virus to susceptible population within demographic segment d   4 through infectious contacts at infection rate       infectious contacts may come from the symptomatic population in any demographic segment d  as well as from exposed population  being in contact with susceptible population at contact rates    and   the contact rate of the exposed population the contact rate prior to the outbreak forms a reference for variation in social contacts across population segments and time those with symptoms tend to have lower contact rates than those without if you feel sick you tend to stay at home more even absent any awareness of a virus outbreak further contacts change over time in response to the outbreak infectious contacts further depend on infectivity the probability of infection given contact between a symptomatic and an infected person while infectivity of the he symptomatic population   tends to be higher than of the exposed population   viral load measures suggest that in the case of the sars-cov-2 infectivity commences before the onset of first symptoms ferguson et al 2020 pan et al 2020 zou et al 2020   then the virus transmission simplified form is given by 5   0                  1  where    are equal to the contacts within segment  adjusted with relative cross-segment contacts            infected people remain exposed during a latent or incubation period  at which point they may begin to show symptoms details of a more disaggregated symptomatic stage including parameters marked with  are discussed below subsequently depending on the case lethality fraction those in the symptomatic stage either recover or die after figure 3 right ----------figure 3 about here ------------ the structure of the symptomatic population is further disaggregated figure 4  highlighting that symptoms may vary considerably across those infected ecdc 2020  only a small fraction of those infected has severe symptoms defined here as those requiring hospitalization those with severe symptoms progress from a pre-hospitalization stage time to hospitalization 9  to the hospitalization stage time to recover from hospitalization   after which they either recover or die depending on the actual not reported lethality fraction of the severe cases  all of the mild cases recover after a time to recover   ----------figure 4 about here ------------infectivity can differ from symptoms early research suggests that viral load is fairly constant for a period of time defining the average days infectious explicitly as the period during which people exhibit symptoms and possess the infectivity virus transmission depends not only on exogenous virus-related transmission parameters but also on behavioral responses from citizens and policy makers as they respond as they perceive a more severe outbreak as the population adjusts social contacts infectious contacts and transmission change too in the model social contacts by the symptomatic population as well 5 this is a simplified representation of the virus transmission rate in the model the stocks of exposed and symptomatic populations are each disaggregated into different stocks with different contact rates for example part of either stock population segment may be quarantined or home isolated discussed below further average infectivity needs to be adjusted for the fraction of the various symptomatic populations that are infectious  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted

of a perceived outbreak  figure 5  the population in the symptomatic state may reduce contacts in four ways i positive tested detected cases admitted to hospitals or detected elsewhere being quarantined quarantined ii undetected being associated with detected cases through targeted search being home-isolated suspected symptomatic cases being home-confined iv undetected symptomatic cases reducing contacts voluntarily or urged by governments beyond what they prefer because of sickness symptomatic contact reduction iv undetected cases reducing voluntarily or urged by governments general social distancing the last behavior ranges from increasing washing hands reduction in gathering in groups travel restrictions school and work closings except for essential ones etc the exposed population may reduce contacts in two ways i undetected cases being associated with detected cases and home-isolated suspected exposed cases being homeconfined  ii undetected cases reducing social contacts voluntarily or urged by governments general social distancing in the model aggregate social contacts for both the exposed and symptomatic population forms a weighted sum across populations subjected to the respective contact constraints further the effects are multiplicative for example the combined contact reduction effect  for someone being both home confined with effect   and subject to social distancing with effect   equals  1-1-  1-  indicated contacts for the symptomatic population example then are where a is the normal contact rate of the exposed population is the relative contact rate of symptomatic population compared to the normal contact rate of the exposed population the endogenous contact reduction effects adjust to indicated levels those quarantined and home-confined adjust contacts as they are being transferred to their new state contact reductions for those within their state adjust changing indicated levels of social distancing over adjustment time d  for example for social distancing  adjusts to the level indicated by social distancing  finally the newly symptomatic population adjust behavior of the symptomatic population over time this adjustment of contacts towards symptomatic behavior is captured through a co-flow structure sterman 2000  the adjustment of contact reduction through each of the above contact reduction responses depends the perceived outbreak level   relative to the reference breakout level hq  the actual responses depend on three factors first the sensitivity to an increase in the perceived outbreak captures heterogeneity in responsiveness to the perceived severity of the outbreak second there are limits to how much each response is able to reduce contacts this limit may come from implementation challenges quarantining may still lead to health worker infection enforceability limits home isolation is not defined properly practical limits those being home-isolated still need to go out to buy groceries or simply because not everybody complies for the social distancing effect   with  sensitivity and maximum contact reduction st the formulation is  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is

preprint as policymakers and citizens alter their behavior in response to the severity of the perceived outbreak and so affect virus transmission rates they respond to reported not actual data about positive tests and deaths media and experts report different metrics about the virus but reported absolute cases and deaths tend to dominate the media and affect population behaviour xiao et al 2015  we formulate the perceived outbreak level  as a weighted function of the reported deaths  and reported cumulative cases         1       with  weights of reported deaths case testing follows two main approaches reactive and proactive first reactive testing is driven by the symptoms occurring under the currently undetected symptomatic population de omitting demographic index d within any of the states       -either the early or advanced for mild or severe cases  figure 4  this happens when the population either self-reports their symptoms or is hospitalized with symptoms the reactive testing process for all states i is identical appendix figure a 1 visualizes the testing process for hospitalized population advanced-severe  positive tests equal the fraction of actual cases tested d times the case detection fraction  and the fraction of actual tests being positive d   d  d  second proactively experts can perform field tests provided available capacity there are two types of field tests sampling and targeted testing indicated by index     appendix figure a 2 shows the relations targeted testing may involve methods such as contact tracing testing and occurs within a small targeted sample of the population with relatively high likelihood of positive case detection however this approach requires efforts identifying potential positive cases tracing this back requires effort in addition for contract tracing to be effective a sufficient large amount of amount of positively tested cases need to be traced positive testing over time to identify and test potential case j

immunity loss rate is switched off for the purpose of this analysis to illustrate the value of the model for policy analysis and to demonstrate its flexibility we perform three different experiments the first involves the construction and analysis of a baseline case that builds through calibration on the actual sars-cov-2 outbreak in the second experiment we perform a sensitivity analysis of this baseline case centered on policy and citizen responses to the outbreak in the third experiment we perform an analysis about managing resurgence by lifting social distancing policies using hypothetical

-table 1 about here ----------------------table 2 about here ------------ figure 6a shows the resulting simulation run of the cumulative reported and actual and for the relevant time horizon the data on reported cases for asia europe and north america reported cases are on average about 19 of actual that is -on average 19 of cases are detected 6 figure 6b provides more details about the underlying dynamics showing a number of different indicators of the outbreak including related to case detection the top left graph in figure 6b shows see that the reporting fraction for the mild cases is much lower than for severe cases 15-25 versus about 90 asia has a higher detection fraction of the mild cases than the other regions this is in part the result of proactive -field-based -testing and monitoring the top left graph shows the social contacts for exposed population reducing due to social distancing and to some degree home confinement of targeted policies mostly in asia as more cases get detected governments and citizens respond and reduce action asia has a strong sensitivity of social distancing to the outbreak and hence a strong balancing feedback loop b3 figure 5  however the slopes in contact reduction do not differ much across regions this is because the weaker response in europe and north america has the effect to increase transmissions in turn inducing a stronger response than is needed in asia ----------figure 6 about here ------------infectious contacts together with transmission delays incubation time -the time before symptoms begin to appear -and duration of infectivity -of the symptomatic population determine how many people an infectious person infects during its infectivity affecting the likelihood and extent of the epidemic outbreak the basic reproductive number r0 captures how transmission parameters as social contacts affect the initial growth rate of the outbreak it is defined as the average number of secondary infections produced when one infected individual is introduced into a host population where everyone is susceptible dietz 1975  a value of r0  1 implies that an epidemic can get started the reproductive number r  figure  5b  bottom left captures how changes in transmission parameters as social contacts as well as changes in the remaining susceptible population which is negligible here affect the growth rate of the active cases and thus of the outbreak over time the reproductive number begins at around 3 close to estimates of the basic reproductive number r0 read et al 2020  it then first goes below 1 in asia followed by europe and north america and the total including other continents figure 6b bottom right shows the over-time population distribution of the population exposed quarantined symptomatic non-detected hospitalized and cumulative deaths the figure highlights the lags in peaking from exposed towards hospitalized global hospitalized populations peak later than others early may at around 350 thousand people this is most likely an underestimation of both timing of peak and quantity 6 a note of caution any simulation but in particular those looking forward during a developing case as this one should be interpreted with great caution and scepticism for at least three reasons i there is still much uncertainty about transmission parameters ii estimation of behavioural parameters is done at a very aggregate level and with a bias towards the asian and early european outbreaks this does not necessarily are a good representation of other regions iii forward looking outcomes do not incorporate future policy and citizen actions that may different from those simulated here yet the uncertainty is fundamental to the problem itself our main purpose is to develop and enhancing a grounded understanding of the problem to build confidence in and allow challenge what are brought forward as plausible explanations and support in the best way those policy decisions that need to take place under this great uncertainty  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint  httpsdoiorg10 1101 the baseline results suggest that the stricter measures in response to the outbreak were critical in curtailing the outbreak we now examine the interaction effects between interventions more closely we next examine the effect of hypothetical changes in policy and citizen responses to the outbreak -and in particular on actual and reported cumulative cases figure 7  we alter three distinct parameters the reference virus outbreak level hq rob behavioral social distancing exponent exposed h sde the cumulative hospitalization for testing growth rate   tst the threshold for building testing capacity as well as their joint effect all the effect of high responsiveness vs low responsiveness values are shown for north america high low indicate parameter settings that correspond to high low policycitizen responsiveness to the outbreak table 3 shows details on parameter ranges compared to the baseline once can see that a more responsive government to the outbreak citizens social distancing and earlier testing ramp up all have the effect to reduce cumulative cases the low parameter values are approximately equal to asias baseline values hence the results suggest that each of the policy measures taken -earlier and more extensive can help reduce the outbreak on the other hand any reduced responsiveness greatly exacerbates the outbreak further we see a strong interaction effect among socio-behavioral responses see all vs individual changes reported cases bottom left tend to be less responsive -in particularly visible for the interaction effects this is because the increased actual cases creates precisely those problems that make it hard to keep up with testing this observation is important because reported cases are main drivers for decisions and citizen responses this itself contributes to the strong effects we observe in the actual cases further deaths white bars correlate more with the actual than with reported cases while it is problematic to respond to reported deaths with lags between infection and death being 3-4 weeks the sensitivity analysis shows the risk of underestimating the effects of too little action when driven by reported cases especially when relative reported cases are low figure 7 top right highlights these amplification effects from response interactions and in particular from the delays in the system showing hospitalizations while actual cumulative cases are strongly sensitive to changes in behavioral responses lagged elements in the system such as hospitalization experience even stronger amplification compare with actual cumulative cases in figure 6   figure 8 further highlights the strong interaction effect between behavioral responses to the outbreak figure 7 left shows the joint effect of social distancing and the threshold for building testing capacity while a moderate higherlower response has the effect of reducing lighter colorsincreasing darker colors actual cumulative cases their joint change strongly amplifies these effects for example policies that stimulate social distancing are greatly enhanced when policy makers and citizen have a more accurate perception of the extent of the outbreak figure 8 right shows even more clearly the hurdle to implementing effective policies during the outbreak because of such interaction effects the figure shows again testing sensitivity but now interacting with the clustering parameter indicating the efficiency at which detectablesuspected cases  those that have been infected by others are actually identified and tested the map indicates that improving this effectiveness does not necessarily help this is so because successful targeted testing requires a lot of detectablesuspected cases thus absent capacity to identify cases in the first place one cannot find others through such targeted approaches one need a combination of high effectiveness in identifying of both early testing buildup note the positive feedback that acts to move efforts towards downstream-reactive testing -away from pro-actively identifying testing and isolating upstream exposed and symptomatic populations once testing capacity falls behind most cases are identified in the hospital or through severe-symptoms in the late stage  figure  a7 shows the positive feedbacks involved in detail by then those have infected many others but at this point there is also little opportunity to both identify and test those that they infected instead slack in testing capacity frees up resources for proactive testing and helps build up a stock of potentially identifiable existing and future cases the results highlight the extraordinary measures in many of the early outbreak countries were critical to control the outbreak in particular the combination of testing and finding ways to reduce general social contacts are critical more targeted approaches can work as long as complementary resources identification ability testing monitoring are available we also ran the model without interventions and testing leading to herd immunity at a recovered population of 68 b people with 900 m remaining susceptible while not every country has the same ability to together this suggest that controlled mitigation -considered in various countries -without other ways to immunize would be near impossible in the following experiment we focus on the challenge of managing resurgence because in the short run -without available vaccines -building up herd immunity is not likely a feasible strategy ferguson et al 2020  it is highly likely that additional waves of outbreaks will occur in the near future different from a first wave during resurgence testing capacity will likely be available hence in this phase pro-active testing approaches community oriented andor contact tracing will be a feasible as a policy even when not so during the first wave to illustrate how this may work consider a stylized region of 16m people the approximate size of a metropole like new york or paris of the hard-hit region of northern italy or of a country like the netherlands at time zero we introduce an outbreak with 100 undetected infections with characteristics identical to that of sars-cov-2 finally to allow resurgence we let policy makers and citizens respond to the reported active not cumulative cases table 2 shows all parameters different from the baseline figure 9 shows simulations using these synthetic data varying proactive testing effectiveness measured by the clustering parameter   first notice that all scenarios respond similarly to the first wave irrespective of proactive testing effectiveness this is so because as before testing is capacityconstrained therefore proactive testing can do little to alter the path of the first wave during which testing capacity is being built up and lags we note further that this firs wave is similar to what it would have been in case of a population responding to cumulative cases ----------figure 9 about here ------------however in this experiment at some point the virus outbreak appears to be receding as reported actual cases go down considerably bottom left as social distancing rebuilds right the virus can transmit again easier among the population allowing a second wave to commence and so forth while the oscillating resist suppression in the base case proactive testing effectiveness higher   is very effective in dampening the oscillation the rapid detection of new cases takes an important share of the newly introduced symptomatic population out of contact bottom right symptomatic population remains at a relatively low level the policy is very effective in not only reducing oscillations and overall emergence of  cc-by-nc 40 international

2020 new cases but also strongly suppresses oscillations and increases of social distancing but also restores a fairly high but not 100 level of social contacts for the general population besides showing the importance of targeted policies this experiment highlights the importance of differentiating constructs to identify policy levers symptom severity hospitalization and case fatality fraction differs considerably across age groups with the older population being disproportionally vulnerable to the impact of the virus russel et al 2020 russell et al 2020  in a final analysis we use the model segmentation to help better understand how these differences affect the different population groups as well as the overall outbreak dynamics to illustrate the value of analyzing this in more depth we focus in particular on explaining the role of different social interactions across these segments in different countries in explaining the outbreak patterns we perform an analysis in the same stylized way as the previous experiment doing this helps focus on the key dynamics at work we again use a stylized region of 32m 216m people but now we differentiate the population into two age cohorts differentiating those that are more and less vulnerable consider older and younger populations though note that the distinction can also proxy other stratifying variables such as income or race we control the difference between the segments by varying their relative case fatality    holding the average case fatality constant testing capacity grows as before with an initiation threshold of 100 hospitalized cases at time 0 we introduce again a sars-cov-2 outbreak with 200 undetected infections but only within the less vulnerable population segment see table 3 for parameter details figure 10 shows the results the graphs show on the horizontal axis the relative case fatality  across the segments relative to within segment contacts a value of one indicates that the fraction of severe cases and therefore the same case fatality rates is identical in the two segments while moving to the left signifies a relative severity of cases and with that case fatality that increases for the vulnerable population the left graph shows the actual cases left vertical axis as share of the population and deaths right vertical axis percentage of total population in the stylized simulation we also vary relative contact rates between the segments      continuous dashed lines have high low intersegment contacts when varying contact rates between segments we control for total contact rates within the population the right graph shows the cumulative death fraction in three different ways total versus reported total versus actual cases and as the share of vulnerable population to the total for reference one can see that this share reaches to 50 at high intersegment contacts when z  the graph shows a number of interesting insights about how cases and deaths develop as we vary these two parameters in particular when case fatality is very uneven actual cases increase left graph this is so because low vulnerability implies mild on average milder symptoms and because of that lower detection with low reporting there is little policy response and infections can easily spread among the less vulnerable populations a relevant but not unrealistic starting condition in this analysis is that the outbreak initiated among the young population for example in regions like new york city it appears that socially active younger population with mostly mild symptoms one can envision that the virus has spread rapidly but fairly undetected for a while the results further show that the worst case in terms of absolute fatalities high variation in case fatality and relatively high contacts between the population segments disproportionally affects the vulnerable population dashed line top right this is so because after the virus spread has spread among those who are less vulnerable it can easily spread to the vulnerable population segment at which point it is uncontrollable it is the latter that may have be playing part in italy with relative contacts across generations generally being larger than in many other countries  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint  httpsdoiorg10 1101 while only a synthetic analysis this analysis on stratified vulnerability may partially help explain variation in reported cfr across counties or why the reported cfr in some countries seem low for a while only to go up later these insights also may have policy recommendations may vary depending on the demographic makeup for example when relaxing general confinement policies or when managing resurgence should populations that are deemed more vulnerable remain longer isolated at home based on the insights here that may be a feasible direction though provided that mild cases can be monitored and isolated ----------figure 10 about here ------------ this paper developed the behavioral infectious disease model which aims to help improve understanding how the virus transmission characteristics and policy and individuals responses to a virus outbreak interact to generate outcomes with this we provided a general quantitative framework that can help understand under what conditions what combinations of interventions are successful alter the course of the epidemic it allows considering reduce not only deaths but also critical societal and economic costs of an overloaded health system and of widespread and recurrent social distancing the model builds on existing seir based epidemic modeling transition capturing the virus transmission dynamics as well as how in response to the progression of the outbreak populations alter their social contacts and how policymakers ramp up testing and reporting and implement policies such as quarantining self-isolation the model incorporates some key behavioral aspects that policy makers need to consider -including imperfect compliance as we showed the model also treats critical constructs at a more fine grained level mild versus severe symptoms reactive versus proactive testing interventions for general suspected versus detected populations and interactions across sociodemographic and geographical segments through these features the model can be used to evaluate the impact of diverse in particular non-pharmaceutical public health control measures to consider interaction with testing and reporting and citizen response we provided some illustrations using the model to explore both current questions about managing the december 2019 sars-cov-2 outbreak and future questions about managing resurgence we showed the interactive effects of distinct policies andor of citizen behavior and policies we also showed the longer term interactive dynamics of resurgence and key policy levers for addressing this our findings raise important questions about the means by which such targeted policies can be implemented without compromising citizen privacy our final analysis demonstrated the value of strategic disaggregation to generate important insights -such as inequality issues that affect both segments overall outbreak dynamics together the analysis shows the nature of non-linear and multi-feedback system being resistant to change our analysis shows what is generally true for complex dynamic systems significantly altering the pathway of a focal variable within the system requires a mix of interventions is required to address different positive feedback loops and delays within the system the model is available

duration of infectivity or alter the regional characteristics population size interregional contacts for reference users can also observe reported data on the outbreak the model and analyses suffer from usual limitations first the relatively aggregate representation of population segments implies that important dynamics may be missed for example particular social network structures may help explain the dynamics such as the emergence of super spreader clusters the current model also leaves out important structure such as endogenous infections and case fatality within the health providing

social distancing narratives on social media siti mohamad mazidah   this paper is motivated by the sociocultural implications and reconfiguration of everyday life amidst and beyond the covid19 pandemic in the period of intense social media use the introduction of social media to the public in the mid2000s and its development in recent years have created new youth spatialities and sociospatial engagements that have significantly altered the way audiences consume information participate in the content creation and engage with the content circulated on the social media platforms with a social mediascape that is characterised by participatory and networked culture and usergenerated content jenkins et al 2013 the creation circulation and consumption of information and contents are increasingly contextualised and socioculturally and politically shaped the ontological nature of our communication culture the intense and expected users selfdisclosure and the current social media practices in the context of risk communication are not making it easier for relevant stakeholders especially public health practitioners to disseminate health risk information and to understand the communicative health practices and risk perception of the population social media can be effectively utilised to communicate information on the covid19 for public health awareness and interventions while at the same time poses risk due to the confusion and uncertainties among the public from the misinformation disinformation and malinformation apparent in the growing infodemic that accompanies a contemporary epidemic or a pandemic cinelli et al 2020 zarocostas 2020 for instance the upsurge of false information or myths circulated on social media related to covid19 commonly seen myth  eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus world health organisation who and relevant government agencies bruneis ministry of health included took action by posting on their official instagram to highlight and debunk false information equally important in this risk communication is risk perception of the population risk perception cannot be generalised to the whole population as it is known to be based on a diverse array of information that individuals have processed on risk factors  and technologies as well as on their benefits and contexts who 2002 an individual assesses risk according to own knowledge experience and sociocultural environment hence the need to look into context and localities in this study unlike during the time of the sars outbreak in 2003 when social media was uncommon digital technology and new social media are now ubiquitously used by who and government bodies to spread awareness of the health risk to share latest information and to influence risk perception of the public on the severity of this pandemic the intense internet and social media penetration create digital landscapes where information is widely available from information data advice on the one hand to misinformation speculation and even conspiracy theories on the other to add to this the audience of a few of the recent social media sites such as instagram snap chat and tik tok are predominantly younger people ortizospina 2019 this makes it imperative to study young peoples responses to the pandemic in todays social media time in brunei young people are observed to be using social media in playing their part as community members in their own locality and as global citizens in the context of covid19 pandemic considering that there is still not much knowledge on how risk is communicated understood and acted upon smith 2006 including risk communication on social media platforms kasshout  alhinnawi 2013 this paper aims to reflect on how young people as active audience on social mediascapes are playing a key role in communicating risk to a fellow young audience and changing risk perception of a global pandemic covid19 via social media of equal importance here are the potential sociocultural transformations these young peoples social media engagements could create beyond this current crisis which are revealed in this paper in the following section a description of the qualitative content analysis qca of social distancing initiatives on social media is offered this followed by a section that demonstrates young peoples localised and contextualised creative responses to covid19 through the five social distancing narratives the narrative of fear the narrative of responsibility the narrative of annoyance the narrative of fun and the narrative of resistance one particular action worth highlighting is their effort in making social distancing contents accessible and readable by other users such as by translating official documents to everyday social media language the penultimate section reveals three key sociocultural implications and configurations new youth spatialities and social engagements youth leadership in development and consideration of social participation and reach in risk communication that have broader implications beyond covid19 this paper draws from the researchers preliminary study for an ongoing research project social media risk perception and risk communication of covid19 in brunei darussalam a research collaboration between universiti brunei darussalam and health promotion centre ministry of health brunei darussalam as there is not much information known on audiences social media consumption in risk communication and their individualised as well as contextualised risk perception a preliminary research on how the audience deliver and circulate covid19 related content on social media was conducted leading to this preliminary finding on the active involvement of young people in highlighting the significance of social distancing in flattening the curve in the country according to kemp 2020 social media penetration in brunei was 94 per cent 410000 population by january 2020 the growth in the size of the digitally connected group consuming social media content in the nation justifies this interest in looking into social media use in risk communication in brunei darussalam given the intensive digital transaction through the social media this research examined the affective consumption and transaction of social media content on covid19 among public in brunei darussalam and the impact of their social media transaction on their risk perception of covid19 it seeks to investigate one the official social media content on covid19 circulated by health practitioners and health organisations two the social media content on covid19 consumed by the public in brunei three their risk perception and understanding of the covid19 based on the social media contents transacted and consumed four their own appropriation framing and circulation of covid19 on their social media platforms and five their health and behavioural practices as a response to their risk perception of covid19 this research using qualitative content analysis qca on social media content between early march to the end of april 2020 is part of the fourth objective which is to investigate audience appropriation framing and circulation of social distancing initiatives using the multimodal features of the sites such as captions images videos and hashtags prior to finalising the research objectives the author conducted a pilot discussion with her undergraduate students to seek their views of covid19 at that time in point the students were not really concern about this crisis the general consensus was that this new coronavirus is only risky for those with underlying health conditions and older people one student said that if i get covid im going to recover while another student claimed that the crisis was sensationalised by the media interestingly a number of the students pointed out that the covid19 memes mostly humorous contents circulated on social media help in changing the perception of covid19 from high risk to low risk their views although not representative of the young people in the country point to this groups low risk perception it is safe to say that this could also be the reason for the lack of discussion among the social media users on covid19 in the country prior to the announcement of the first case on 9 march 2020 however the social media landscape changed drastically right after justifying the qca conducted on bruneians social media from march 2020 onwards to achieve the objective set and taking the above findings and observation into consideration two data collection strategies were employed one the researcher followed covid19 latest cases and issues in the country via the daily press conferences hosted by the ministry of health since 9th march 2020 social distancing related cases highlighted by the minister of health and invited ministers the issues the public brought to front via media personnel through the question and answer session at the press conference and issues mentioned by the audience of the press conference via the instagram live comment section of the invited media personnel were used to guide the second data collection strategy this first strategy was employed to obtain the key concerns and issues that are considered important to bruneians in the context of covid19 and social distancing measures two qca was conducted on random and selected young people in the authors social media network who share social distancing contents on their social media young bruneians instagram and twitter contents based on the information obtained from the first data collection strategy this step by step approach in the data collection allowed the author to follow the issues and the young peoples individual social media sharing on social distancing issues in total over 30 individual profiles from instagram and twitter combined were observed for social distancing contents specific social distancing contents observed include social distancing initiatives conducted by individuals groups and companies key incidents happening in the country related to social distancing the discussion on covid19 statistics on number of infected recovered and death to obtain the publics thoughts on the effectiveness of social distancing initiatives in the country the growing social distancing creative contents on instagram for instance those that are accessible via artcovidbn hashtag and related viral cases in the country contents on other sites such as youtube and tik tok are checked when they appear on the young peoples instagram and twitter posts the crossplatform integration functionality of social media allows for the same media contents to be shared simultaneously bossetta 2018 and the spreadability of social media enables content on youtube to be retweeted on twitter via url sharing the young people randomly and selectively chosen are between the ages of 18 and 36 a number of them are known in the country as proactive youth who are keen to support the countrys development they are also currently volunteering as front liners to support the ministry of health a few of these young people are not youth leaders and not directly involved in supporting the countrys effort in curbing the crisis there is a mixture of students employed and currently unemployed young people in the group these young peoples identity as bruneians were crosschecked with the details provided on their biography their mutual followers and their contents that are specific to brunei the findings point to the role of young people in pushing the idea and practice of social distancing apparent via the social distancing narratives narratives of fear social responsibility annoyance and fun affectively created reproduced and circulated online the findings did suggest that social distancing initiatives are supported more by the proactive youth the contents shared on the proactive youths social media include their volunteering activities as front liners there are only limited findings that point to the existence of resistance among the young people these young peoples active engagements on social media sites in the context of social distancing initiatives reveal two interrelated factors that not only could lead us to reconsider how risk are contextually spatially and individually perceived practised and communicated by the audience as both the producers and consumers of digital content equally significant and at a more macroscale level it reveals the issue of access and power to social media and digital contents in this era of connectivity and media spreadability when the first covid19 case was confirmed in the nation on 9 march 2020 brunei government was quick to take actions social distancing initiatives were disseminated to the public a few days after the first case was announced at the nations first covid19 press conference a school holiday that was previously set on 16 march 2020 started three days earlier within the two weeks since the first case restaurants and gyms were closed travel restrictions into and out of the country were imposed a few supermarkets started to implement physical gap at counters and limiting number of customers entering their premises places of worships are closed temporarily working from home wfh and digital learning were quickly introduced physical mobilities have not been restricted due to the relatively small number of infected cases 139 cases as of 6 may 2020 and low rate of infection in the country unlike our neighbouring countries with their lockdown measures singapores circuit breaker and malaysias movement control order while physical movements are allowed the public has been consistently advised to maintain social distancing including the physical distancing of at least 1 metre despite the nationwide social distancing initiatives confining the public to their home and to maintain social distancing were not easy tasks as experienced globally mass gathering were still seen in some parts of the country despite the governments effort in halting the virus transmission suggesting a low risk perception among the members of the public one critical incident that sparked the public outrage was the irresponsible act of a large group of locals visiting a night market in temburong district on the day of the opening of the temburong bridge which connects bruneimuara with temburong district after 130 years of physical separation the next day brunei government restricted the opening time of the bridge and closed the night market to prevent potential community transmission of covid19 social media sites were swiftly flooded by users reprimanding the public for going to the market in mass disregarding the governments social distancing initiatives apart from the governments circulation of social distancing reminders on their official channel mass and new media after this incident social distancing efforts were affectively circulated exchanged and reproduced by the public on social media from these localised and contextualised creatively and affectively produced and circulated content on covid19 a combination of five narratives of social distancing initiatives are apparent narrative of fear narrative of responsibility narrative of annoyance narrative of fun and narrative of resistance the narrative of fear is visible in contents that stress danger and risk to older people and loved ones detachment from family members due to isolation and quarantine for undetermined duration feed into the narrative of fear the narrative of responsibility is visible in contents that call for the community to play their role as responsible citizen and community members to flatten the curve this responsibility includes stressing the unselfish act of medical health professionals in looking after public in the isolation and quarantine centres general public singing the praises for other front liners including youth volunteers who dedicated their energy and time to support the ministry of health in handling the pandemic this narrative of responsibility is further instilled via the circulation of a video created by the ministry of health a video of a medical health professional captioned hargai pergorbanan mereka english translation  appreciate their sacrifices warmly with teary eyes requesting members of the public to stay at home and together be responsible in preventing local transmission via a personal communication with a public health officer from the ministry of health she confirmed that the ministry wanted the public to hear the voices of the health care workers being apart from their family members while caring for the infected patients and their gratefulness towards the community for their support the video emphasises the need for the community to be equally responsible and supporting the front liners in their effort to curb the spread of the disease and to treat infected individuals was reposted and affectively appropriated on sites such as whatsapp instagram and twitter through this affective content it was hoped that the audience would be able to empathise with the front liners and adjust their views actions and habits pedwell 2017 living in a country with a small population under 440000 population as of may 2020 and in a collectivist society bruneians imagined themselves related to each other either by blood or marriage such an emotive video that emphasised communal responsibility would be more effective in evoking the emotion of the general public and to create and sustain the sense of shared responsibility and sense of community and togetherness in time of a crisis and physical separation a local hip hop duo guardian of rhythm created a video music titled dont push it dedicated to the front liners a title they took from minister of healths famous statement dont push it that reminds public to be vigilant and responsible and to not push the countrys limit in health provision during this pandemic figure 1 this music video uploaded on youtube is one of the many creative contents appropriating minister of healths advice at the daily press conference to put pressure on social distancing stickers gif songs and appropriated hashtags such as dontpushit teranahsajadirumah english translation  stay at home are produced and circulated to reach certain pockets of the population that might not be familiar with english language one user took an initiative to translate the social distancing poster circulated via social media and mass media into colloquial malay language figure 2 the narrative of annoyance is apparent in the deliberate sharing of ones frustration towards members of the public who insisted on leaving home travelling overseas and possibly contracting covid19 due to their international travel there were also a few contents on social media highlighting cases of the public undergoing mandatory selfisolation and selfquarantine leaving home the rising number of cases in the country was used strategically by the audience to highlight the severity and potential risk of covid19 the creation and use of new terms such as covaval derived from the word covid and babal a local term for unrepentant individuals particularly those who went to temburong and those insisted on travelling amid covid19 to stress their annoyance and to push public to be more responsible figure 3 the narrative of fun by the young people were evident in the growing number of videos to show their coping strategies while on mandatory selfisolation and stay at home are uploaded on tik tok and reshared on twitter instagram and whatsapp one example is a tik tok video made by bruneian international students who were isolated in their homes and a few hotels turned isolation centres for 14 days upon their return to the country as part of the countrys precautionary measures to avoid potential community transmission these students created individual videos of themselves dancing from one end of their room to the other end when combined this video is creatively demonstrating mobilities while in isolation this is one of the isolationquarantine videos such as pass the brush and dont rush challenge seen on tik tok globally during this period exemplifying the spreadability of social media content and the upsurge in the use of one particular social media site tik tok emarketer 2018 crowley 2020 johnston 2020 leslie 2020 as a coping mechanism and a mode to socially and creatively connect with others interestingly the narrative of resistance is less prominent in bruneis context as previously mentioned prosocial distancing narratives are more apparent on the local social media contents than those demonstrating antisocial distancing which could be due to the less restrictions imposed on physical mobilities in the country perhaps there are contents demonstrating resistance to the social distancing initiatives in the country but have not surfaced or made known to the public for a number of possible reasons such as the authors limited access to contents of this group of social media users to the best of the authors knowledge there are only two contents in video format known to the public that fit the narrative of annoyance andor resistance to social distancing one video directly addressed the stay at home instruction and was created and uploaded by a 22yearold male on his instagram urging those who fear death to stay at home while criticising the public for fearing the coronavirus a humanmade virus he was charged for causing a breach of peace under the section 19 of the minor offences act chapter 30 faisal 2020 after this event the public is consistently reminded that any act that involves the publishing forwarding or creating fake news and misinformation about covid19 may be regarded as offences another video made and shared on social media by a male in his 30s did not directly address social distancing initiatives but the after effect of the stay at home on parents with schoolkids in his video he expressed his dissatisfaction with the current elearning arrangements where the role of educators is transferred to parents his video was uploaded on local reddit community page rbrunei and received backlash from the rbrunei community other narrative of annoyance demonstrated by the young people are not specifically on staying at home rather was focused on the slow internet connection in the country that affected their ability to continue their studies online and the impact social distancing brought to their livelihoods these narratives emerging from the creative production of social media contents demonstrate local youth responses to current situation by contextualising social distancing practice in the country this is supported and made possible by the growing digital creative youth via their digital affective practices wetherell 2012 that went beyond the content sharing to transmitting and recreating a discourse  it was civic engagement both creatives and noncreatives take part in the social distancing initiatives as an active youth citizen who are involved in the community to strive for changes adler  goggins 2005 there are also presence of annoyance and resistance to social distancing as demonstrated above social media sites act as new youth spatialities highlight the spreadability of digital content made possible affective production and consumption of the social distancing narratives the narratives of fear and responsibility in particular and abetted in initiating and sustaining the call for a change in social practices and mobilising youths actions this initiative needs mobile and active youth taking the helm in creating and pushing new subjectivities and taking collective actions to improve and change the society albeit temporarily due to this pandemic as previously mentioned the use of social media by young people is not new this group of users has been known to dominate the online spaces particularly social media sites we could observe new online platforms offering youth with spaces for negotiating their current immobilities stay at homesocial distancing measures new sociotechnological adoptions in the country possibly becoming the new normal in the community post crisis are observed such as poetry club activities open mic and youth mentorship sessions conducted online by young people in the country pointing to the creation of creative spaces online and new ways for conducting social activities such technological adaptation and creation of new social spaces are not limited to the young demographics but have also been adopted by the older generation for instance the group recital of the alquran via zoom exemplifying the rising digitalisation in the country as a matter of fact digital infrastructures applications websites and internet of things to name a few were already in place in the country prior to the crisis but was slow to be taken up by relevant agencies and individuals due to a number of reasons including lack of access due to financial constraints low knowledge of technology lack of motivation and possibly fear of technology the current pandemic that reconfigured our day to day operations and social practice however left these agencies and individuals with no option but to adopt new digital technologies digital technologies and platforms have transformed the relationship between media and the geographies of everyday life ash 2019 and young people as the main users of social media play a key role in this transformation as illustrated in this paper via the young peoples creative contents creation on social media these intense sociospatial engagements of young people on social media amidst covid19 demonstrate the interplay between media and the young people in reconfiguring the microgeographies of young people notwithstanding the growing literature on young people and social media use within the geography discipline haji mohamad 2014 2018 arendt  hordijk 2016 blanch 2016 mohamad 2019 skelton  aitken 2019 there is not enough geographical research that discusses the significance and implications of new youth spatialities in the context of onlinemediated environments a closer examination of youth new social realities would offer insights into the changing geographies of young people and the geographies of media focusing on the creation of new types of contents generation of new micro cultures and intensive affective attachments with media contents especially by the young people which have not received adequate attention by geographers ash 2019 these new online spatialities connected with physical spatialities offer broader sociocultural implications that could open new avenues for the progress of two geographies geographies of young people and geographies of media and communication separately or jointly and are in line with the recent turn in the geography discipline towards digital geographies ash et al 2019 in the context of brunei a young developing country youth engagements with the countrys progress and development is relatively low the country has only recently seen its young peoples active involvement in addressing key issues and concerns in the country government agencies in the country have been providing the young people with offline platforms for engagements in particular the ministry of culture youth and sports mcys the key supporter of young peoples progress in this time of crisis mcys plays a huge role in expanding and intensifying youth communal engagement as can be seen in the establishment of covid19 youth volunteer group to support the ministry of health other youth involvement includes key youth leaders actively involved in creating and distributing personal protective equipment ppe to the medical health workers moreover the availability of social media platforms offers these young people with spaces to engage leading to the growing number of active and creative youth supporting and sustaining progress and development in the country social media sites as seen in the previous section are affectively used by the young people to promote and support social distancing initiatives such active engagement by the young people during this time of crisis signals the already existing youth leadership in the country online and offline spaces are effectively utilised in pushing forward their agenda and concerns and for personal development the expansion of individual agencies on social media young peoples engagement with the media contents and through the media platforms has potential implications on development planning and execution and could help in creating better futures cupples 2015 the growing social media content on social distancing via the cocreation of narratives highlights community engagement and collaboration based on the collective concerns of young people and their interests in keeping the community safe and healthy at this point despite this active participation and the youths role in the context of social distancing initiatives we need to question the reach and success of these narratives and its implication on risk perception of the population the first question considers the issue of digital divide and access who are these young people reaching out to and what about those who are not part of this social media community despite high social media penetration in the country public health information and risk communication on social media remain exclusive and are not reaching the socially disconnected population these narratives and initiatives by the young people only reach the social media users with access to their content the asynchronicity of content delivery and consumption somewhat limit the access of the information for example instagram story posts that are only visible for twentyfour hours are only reaching the audience who are able to access the story within the time allowed second social distancing effort relies on the individuals perception of the risk of covid19 to their individual health and family members connected to the first point risk communication that does not reach the population could have led to low risk perception rendering the initiative impossible or difficult to achieve notwithstanding the efforts made by the young people on creating and adapting to this new social distancing practice if information reach is limited risk perception of the population will remain low the audience young people and relevant government and nongovernment agencies have worked collectively and informally to create contents that are affective and impactful however such efforts would not reach majority of the population if access is limited closely tied to this access to contents is the language use in communicating risk using words such as social distancing and social responsibility may not work well with some segments of the population those without access to social media where the social distancing term and practices are commonly demonstrated via caption images and videos would not be able to fully understand what are meant by social distancing official information in the country is commonly disseminated in the official language malay language and in a second language english evidently there are people in the country who are not wellversed in these two languages and would need the information to be translated to their colloquial language or dialects one noteworthy context appropriation action in ensuring the social distancing measures reaching other segments of the population is the translation of the official document to lay peoples everyday language in the forms of caption and hashtag such as teranahsajadirumah by social media users perhaps this is one of the best times for the country to rethink and restructure its risk communication strategy by learning from the current sociospatial practices and the loopholes in our risk communication system and strategy beyond covid19 crisis considering media convergence media accessible through various platforms spreadability of social media differential access and language preferences of the population in communication would improve not only public health communication but has broader developmental implications to conclude this paper offers preliminary findings on the localised and contextualised creative productions of social distancing narratives in brunei and the role of young people in emphasising the importance of social distancing in this crisis via social media platforms such as instagram twitter and tik tok using qca on young peoples instagram and twitter contents five narratives of local responses to social distancing practices were apparent the narrative of fear the narrative of responsibility the narrative of annoyance the narrative of fun and the narrative of resistance fascinatingly the research data demonstrated more prosocial distancing narratives than it did for the narrative around resistance technological affordances such as the participatory culture and spreadability of social media content supported the creative production of social distancing initiatives which could bring community and civic impact through individuals collective actions on social media they accentuate the role and social responsibility of each member of the public this is not a single persons tasks everyone plays an equal role in keeping the community safe and healthy in times of a crisis young people in the country played a huge role in supporting the social distancing measures through their everyday creative selfdisclosure on social media and as such has brought three key sociocultural reconfigurations to everyday life that have broader academic and developmental implications the creation of new youth spatialities and intense social engagements were observed which are of importance to geographers in understanding youth social realities and could open up academic discussions relevant to the geographies of young people and the geographies of media and communication the expansion of already existing youth leadership in the country offers a reconsideration of the significance of youths active social media engagements in the context of development social participation and reach in risk communication brought our attention to the issue of access to information differential use of communication platforms and language preference for the betterment of public health communication specific to risk communication during this pandemic what are shared in this paper offer a rethinking of risk communication strategy that includes consideration of socioculturally and politically appropriate and relevant approaches and a strategy that is inclusive to all segments of the population as observed globally the covid19 pandemic has forced us to alter our sociocultural practices and adapt to our drastically reconfigured everyday life creating the new normal in our everyday practices what is clear at this point in time is our dependencies on digital interconnectivity with the uncertainties surrounding covid19 we foresee other significant sociocultural implications of covid19 which could either favourably or unfavourably impact communities in their respective localities  projecting the transmission dynamics of sars-cov-2 through the postpandemic period stephen kissler m christine tedijanto edward goldstein yonatan grad h marc lipsitch   we used data from the united states to model betacoronavirus transmission in temperate regions and to project the possible dynamics of sars-cov-2 infection through the year 2025 we first assessed the role of seasonal variation duration of immunity and cross immunity on the transmissibility of hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 in the us we used the weekly percentage of positive laboratory tests for hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 31 multiplied by the weekly population-weighted proportion of physician visits due to influenza-like illness ili 32 33 to approximate historical betacoronavirus incidence in the us to within a scaling constant this proxy is proportional to incidence under a set of assumptions described in the supplementary materials and methods to quantify variation in transmission strength over time we estimated the weekly effective reproduction number defined as the average number of secondary infections caused by a single infected individual 34 35 the effective reproduction numbers for each of the betacoronaviruses displayed a seasonal pattern with annual peaks in the effective reproduction number slightly preceding those of the incidence curves fig s1 we limited our analysis to in-season estimates based on adequate samples defined as week 40 through week 20 of the following year roughly october to may for both hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 the effective reproduction number typically reached its peak between october and november and its trough between february and may over the five seasons included in our data 2014-2019 the median peak effective reproduction number was 185 range 161-221 for hcov-hku1 and 156 range 154-180 for hcov-oc43 after removing outliers five for hcov-hku1 zero for hcov-oc43 results were similar using various choices of incidence proxy and serial interval distributions figs s1 to s3 to quantify the relative contribution of immunity versus seasonal forcing on the transmission dynamics of the betacoronaviruses we adapted a regression model 36 that expressed the effective reproduction number for each strain hku1 and oc43 as the product of a baseline transmissibility constant related to the basic reproduction number r0 and the proportion of the population susceptible at the start of each season the depletion of susceptibles due to infection with the same strain the depletion of susceptibles due to infection with the other strain and a spline to capture further unexplained seasonal variation in transmission strength seasonal forcing these covariates were able to explain most of the observed variability in the effective reproduction numbers adjusted r2 743 the estimated multiplicative effects of each of these covariates on the weekly reproduction number are depicted in fig 1 as expected depletion of susceptibles for each strain was negatively correlated with transmissibility of that strain depletion of susceptibles for each strain was also negatively correlated with the reproduction number of the other betacoronavirus strain providing evidence of cross-immunity per incidence proxy unit the effect of the cross-immunizing strain was always less than the effect of the strain itself table s1 but the overall impact of cross-immunity on the reproduction number could still be substantial if the cross-immunizing strain had a large outbreak eg hcov-oc43 in 2014-15 and 2016-17 the ratio of cross-immunization to self-immunization effects was larger for hcov-hku1 than for hcov-oc43 suggesting that hcov-oc43 confers stronger cross-immunity seasonal forcing appears to drive the rise in transmissibility at the start of the season late october through early december while depletion of susceptibles plays a comparatively larger role in the decline in transmissibility toward the end of the season the strain-season coefficients were fairly consistent across seasons for each strain and lacked a clear correlation with incidence in prior seasons consistent with experimental results showing substantial waning of immunity within a year 15 we integrated these findings into a two-strain ordinary differential equation ode susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered-susceptible seirs compartmental model to describe the transmission dynamics of hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 fig s4 the model provided a good fit to both the weekly incidence proxies for hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 and to the estimated weekly effective reproduction numbers fig 2 according to the best-fit model parameters the r0 for hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 varies between 17 in the summer and 22 in the winter and peaks in the 2nd week of january consistent with the seasonal spline estimated from the data also in agreement with the findings of the regression model the duration of immunity for both strains in the best-fit seirs model is about 45 weeks and each strain induces cross-immunity against the other though the cross-immunity that hcov-oc43 infection induces against hcov-hku1 is stronger than the reverse in all modeled scenarios sars-cov-2 was capable of producing a substantial outbreak regardless of establishment time winterspring establishments favored outbreaks with lower peaks while autumnwinter establishments led to more acute outbreaks tables s2 to s4 and fig s7 the five-year cumulative incidence proxies were comparable for all establishment times tables s2 to s4 much like pandemic influenza many scenarios lead to sars-cov-2 entering into long-term circulation alongside the other human betacoronaviruses eg fig 3 a and b possibly in annual biennial or sporadic patterns over the next five years tables s2 to s4 short-term immunity on the order of 40 weeks similar to hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 favors the establishment of annual sars-cov-2 outbreaks while longer-term immunity two years favors biennial outbreaks the amount of seasonal variation in sars-cov-2 transmission could differ between geographic locations as for influenza 12 the r0 for influenza in new york declines in the summer by about 40 while in florida the decline is closer to 20 which aligns with the estimated decline in r0 for hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 table s8 a 40 summertime decline in r0 would reduce the unmitigated peak incidence of the initial sars-cov-2 pandemic wave however stronger seasonal forcing leads to a greater accumulation of susceptible individuals during periods of low transmission in the summer leading to recurrent outbreaks with higher peaks in the post-pandemic period fig 3c long-term immunity consistently led to effective elimination of sars-cov-2 and lower overall incidence of infection if sars-cov-2 induces cross immunity against hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 the incidence of all betacoronaviruses could decline and even virtually disappear fig 3d the virtual elimination of hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 would be possible if sars-cov-2 induced 70 cross immunity against them which is the same estimated level of cross-immunity that hcov-oc43 induces against hcov-hku1 even if sars-cov-2 immunity only lasts for two years mild 30 cross-immunity from hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 could effectively eliminate the transmission of sars-cov-2 for up to three years before a resurgence in 2024 as long as sars-cov-2 does not fully die out fig 3e to illustrate these scenarios fig 3 we used a maximum wintertime r0 of 22 informed by the estimated r0 for hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 table s8 this is a low but plausible estimate of the basic reproduction number for sars-cov-2 41 increasing wintertime r0 to 26 leads to more intense outbreaks but the qualitative range of scenarios remains similar fig s8 regardless of the post-pandemic transmission dynamics of sars-cov-2 urgent measures are required to address the ongoing epidemic pharmaceutical treatments and vaccines may require months to years to develop and test leaving non-pharmaceutical interventions npis as the only immediate means of curbing sars-cov-2 transmission social distancing measures have been adopted in many countries with widespread sars-cov-2 transmission the necessary duration and intensity of these measures has yet to be characterized to address this we adapted the seirs transmission model fig s9 to capture moderatemildasymptomatic infections 956 of infections infections that lead to hospitalization but not critical care 308 of infections and infections that require critical care 132 of infections 26 we assumed the worst-case scenario of no cross-immunity from hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 against sars-cov-2 which makes the sars-cov-2 model unaffected by the transmission dynamics of those viruses informed by the transmission model fits we assumed a latent period of 46 days and an infectious period of 5 days in agreement with estimates from other studies 26 the mean duration of non-critical hospital stay was 8 days for those not requiring critical care and 6 days for those requiring critical care and the mean duration of critical care was 10 days 26 we varied the peak wintertime r0 between 22 and 26 and allowed the summertime r0 to vary between 60 ie relatively strong seasonality and 100 ie no seasonality of the wintertime r0 guided by the inferred seasonal forcing for hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 table s8 we used the open critical care capacity of the united states 089 free beds per 10000 adults as a benchmark for critical care demand 2 we simulated epidemic trajectories based on an epidemic establishment time of 11 march 2020 we simulated social distancing by reducing r0 by a fixed proportion which ranged between 0 and 60 we assessed one-time social distancing interventions for which r0 was reduced by up to 60 for a fixed duration of time up to 20 weeks or indefinitely starting two weeks after epidemic establishment we also assessed intermittent social distancing measures for which social distancing was turned on when the prevalence of infection rose above a threshold and off when it fell below a second lower threshold with the goal of keeping the number of critical care patients below 089 per 10000 adults an on threshold of 35 cases per 10000 people achieved this goal in both the seasonal and non-seasonal cases with wintertime r0  22 we chose 5 cases per 10000 adults as the off threshold these thresholds were chosen to qualitatively illustrate the intermittent intervention scenario in practice the thresholds will need to be tuned to local epidemic dynamics and hospital capacities we performed a sensitivity analysis around these threshold values figs s10 and s11 to assess how they affected the duration and frequency of the interventions we also implemented a model with extra compartments for the latent period infectious period and each hospitalization period so that the waiting times in these states were gamma-distributed instead of exponentially distributed see the supplementary materials and methods and figs s16 and s17 finally we assessed the impact of doubling critical care capacity and the associated onoff thresholds on the frequency and overall duration of the social distancing measures we evaluated the impact of one-time social distancing efforts of varying effectiveness and duration on the peak and timing of the epidemic with and without seasonal forcing when transmission was not subject to seasonal forcing one-time social distancing measures reduced the epidemic peak size fig 4 and fig s12 under all scenarios there was a resurgence of infection when the simulated social distancing measures were lifted however longer and more stringent temporary social distancing did not always correlate with greater reductions in epidemic peak size in the case of a 20-week period of social distancing with 60 reduction in r0 for example fig 4d the resurgence peak size was nearly the same as the peak size of the uncontrolled epidemic the social distancing was so effective that virtually no population immunity was built the greatest reductions in peak size come from social distancing intensity and duration that divide cases approximately equally between peaks 42 for simulations with seasonal forcing the post-intervention resurgent peak could exceed the size of the unconstrained epidemic fig 5 and fig s13 both in terms of peak prevalence and in terms of total number infected strong social distancing maintained a high proportion of susceptible individuals in the population leading to an intense epidemic when r0 rises in the late autumn and winter none of the one-time interventions was effective in maintaining the prevalence of critical cases below the critical care capacity intermittent social distancing could prevent critical care capacity from being exceeded fig 6 and fig s14 due to the natural history of infection there is an approximately 3-week lag between the start of social distancing and the peak critical care demand when transmission is seasonally forced summertime social distancing can be less frequent than when r0 remains constant at its maximal wintertime value throughout the year the length of time between distancing measures increases as the epidemic continues as the accumulation of immunity in the population slows the resurgence of infection under current critical care capacities however the overall duration of the sars-cov-2 epidemic could last into 2022 requiring social distancing measures to be in place between 25 for wintertime r0  2 and seasonality fig s11a and 75 for wintertime r0  26 and no seasonality fig s9c of that time when the latent infectious and hospitalization periods are gamma-distributed incidence rises more quickly requiring a lower threshold for implementing distancing measures 25 cases per 10000 individuals for r0  22 in our model and more frequent interventions fig s16 increasing critical care capacity allowed population immunity to be accumulated more rapidly reducing the overall duration of the epidemic and the total length of social distancing measures fig 6 c and d while the frequency and duration of the social distancing measures was similar between the scenarios with current and expanded critical care capacity the epidemic concluded by july 2022 and social distancing measures could be fully relaxed by early- to mid- 2021 depending again on the degree of seasonal forcing of transmission fig 6 c and d introducing a hypothetical treatment that halved the proportion of infections that required hospitalization had a similar effect as doubling critical care capacity fig s15 here we examined a range of likely sars-cov-2 transmission scenarios through 2025 and assessed non-pharmaceutical interventions that could mitigate the intensity of the current outbreak if immunity to sars-cov-2 wanes in the same manner as related coronaviruses recurrent wintertime outbreaks are likely to occur in coming years the total incidence of sars-cov-2 through 2025 will depend crucially on this duration of immunity and to a lesser degree on the amount of cross immunity that exists between hcovs oc43hku1 and sars-cov-2 the intensity of the initial pandemic wave will depend fundamentally on the basic reproduction number at the time of epidemic establishment if establishment occurs in the autumn when the reproduction number is rising which could occur in countries that maintain epidemic control by contact tracing and quarantine through the summer or if sars-cov-2 is not subject to the same summertime decline in transmissibility as hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 then a high peak prevalence of infection is likely one-time social distancing efforts may push the sars-cov-2 epidemic peak into the autumn potentially exacerbating the load on critical care resources if there is increased wintertime transmissibility intermittent social distancing might maintain critical care demand within current thresholds but widespread surveillance will be required to time the distancing measures correctly and avoid overshooting critical care capacity new therapeutics vaccines or other interventions such as aggressive contact tracing and quarantine  impractical now in many places but more practical once case numbers have been reduced and testing scaled up 43  could alleviate the need for stringent social distancing to maintain control of the epidemic in the absence of such interventions surveillance and intermittent distancing or sustained distancing if it is highly effective may need to be maintained into 2022 which would present a substantial social and economic burden to shorten the sars-cov-2 epidemic and ensure adequate care for the critically ill increasing critical care capacity and developing additional interventions are urgent priorities meanwhile serological testing is required to understand the extent and duration of immunity to sars-cov-2 which will help determine the post-pandemic dynamics of the virus sustained widespread surveillance will be needed both in the short term to effectively implement intermittent social distancing measures and in the long term to assess the possibility of resurgences of sars-cov-2 infection which could occur as late as 2025 even after a prolonged period of apparent elimination our observations are consistent with other predictions of how sars-cov-2 transmission might unfold and with assessments of the mitigation efforts that might be needed to curb the current outbreak a modelling study using data from sweden found that seasonal establishment of sars-cov-2 transmission is likely in the post-pandemic period 11 observational and modelling studies 2 26 that find that early implementation of strong social distancing is essential for controlling the spread of sars-cov-2 and that in the absence of the development of new therapies or preventative measures such as aggressive case finding and quarantining 21 intermittent distancing measures may be the only way to avoid overwhelming critical care capacity while building population immunity the observation that strong temporary social distancing can lead to especially large resurgences agrees with data from the 1918 influenza pandemic in the united states 44 in which the size of the autumn 1918 peak of infection was inversely associated with that of a subsequent winter peak after interventions were no longer in place our study was subject to a variety of limitations only five seasons of observational data on coronaviruses were available though the incidence patterns resemble those from 10 years of data from a hospital in sweden 11 we assumed that the spline coefficients were constant across all seasons though seasonal forcing likely differed from year to year based on underlying drivers to keep the transmission model from becoming unreasonably complex we assumed that there was no difference in the seasonal forcing per-case force of infection latent period or infectious period across betacoronaviruses however our estimates for these values lie within the ranges of estimates from the literature although disease dynamics may differ by age we did not have sufficient data to parameterize an age-structured model we also did not directly model any effect from the opening of schools which could lead to an additional boost in transmission strength in the early autumn 45 the transmission model is deterministic so it cannot capture the possibility of sars-cov-2 extinction it also does not incorporate geographic structure so the possibility of spatially heterogeneous transmission cannot be assessed the construction of spatially explicit models will become more feasible as more data on sars-cov-2 incidence becomes available these will help determine whether there are differences in seasonal forcing between geographic locations as for influenza 12 and will also help to assess the possibility of epidemic extinction while accounting for re-introductions the timing and strength of post-pandemic outbreaks may also depend on stochastic introductions from abroad which can be assessed using more complex global models we used percent test-positive multiplied by percent ili to approximate coronavirus incidence up to a proportional constant results were similar when using the raw number of positive tests and the raw percent positive as incidence proxies fig s1 while the percent test-positive multiplied by percent ili has been shown to be one of the best available proxies for influenza incidence 32 the conversion between this measure and true incidence of coronavirus infections is unclear and so we do not make precise estimates of the overall coronavirus incidence this conversion will undoubtedly depend on the particular population for which these estimates are being made in a recent study an estimated 4 of individuals with coronavirus sought medical care and only a fraction of these were tested 46 in addition the method that we adopted to estimate the effective reproduction number depends on the serial interval distribution which has not been well-studied for commonly circulating human coronaviruses we used the best-available evidence from sars-cov-1 the most closely related coronavirus to sars-cov-2 our findings generalize only to temperate regions comprising 60 of the worlds population 47 and the size and intensity of outbreaks could be further modulated by differences in average interpersonal contact rates by location and the timing and effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions the transmission dynamics of respiratory illnesses in tropical regions can be much more complex however we expect that if post-pandemic transmission of sars-cov-2 does take hold in temperate regions there will also be continued transmission in tropical regions seeded by the seasonal outbreaks to the north and south with such reseeding long-term disappearance of any strain becomes less likely 48 but according to our model the effective reproductive number of sars-cov-2 remains below 1 during most of each period when that strain disappears meaning that reseeding would shorten these disappearances only modestly our findings indicate key data required to know how the current sars-cov-2 outbreak will unfold most crucially serological studies could indicate the extent of population immunity whether immunity wanes and at what rate in our model this rate is the key modulator of the total sars-cov-2 incidence in the coming years while long-lasting immunity would lead to lower overall incidence of infection it would also complicate vaccine efficacy trials by contributing to low case numbers when those trials are conducted as occurred with zika virus 49 in our assessment of control measures in the initial pandemic period we assumed that sars-cov-2 infection induces immunity that lasts for at least two years but social distancing measures may need to be extended if sars-cov-2 immunity wanes more rapidly in addition if serological data reveals the existence of many undocumented asymptomatic infections that lead to immunity 50 less social distancing may be required serology could also indicate whether cross-immunity exists between sars-cov-2 hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 which could affect the post-pandemic transmission of sars-cov-2 we anticipate that such cross-immunity would lessen the intensity of sars-cov-2 outbreaks though some speculate that antibody-dependent enhancement ade induced by prior coronavirus infection may increase susceptibility to sars-cov-2 and exacerbate the severity of infection 51 52 at present there is limited data describing ade between coronaviruses but if it does exist it may promote the cocirculation of betacoronavirus strains to implement intermittent social distancing it will be necessary to carry out widespread viral testing for surveillance to monitor when the prevalence thresholds that trigger the beginning or end of distancing have been crossed without such surveillance critical care bed availability might be used as a proxy for prevalence but this metric is far from optimal since the lag between distancing and peak critical care demand could lead to frequent overrunning of critical care resources critical care resources are also at greater risk of being overrun if the infectious latent and hospitalized periods follow peaked distributions eg gamma versus exponential measuring the distributions of these times and not just their means will help to set more effective thresholds for distancing interventions under some circumstances intense social distancing may be able to reduce the prevalence of covid-19 enough to warrant a shift in strategy to contact tracing and containment efforts as has occurred in many parts of china 21 23 53 still countries that have achieved this level of control of the outbreak should prepare for the possibility of substantial resurgences of infection and a return to social distancing measures especially if seasonal forcing contributes to a rise in transmissibility in the winter moreover a winter peak for covid-19 would coincide with peak influenza incidence 54 further straining health care systems treatments or vaccines for sars-cov-2 would reduce the duration and intensity of social distancing required to maintain control of the epidemic treatments could reduce the proportion of infections that require critical care and could reduce the duration of infectiousness which would both directly and indirectly through a reduction in r0 reduce the demand for critical care resources a vaccine would accelerate the accumulation of immunity in the population reducing the overall length of the epidemic and averting infections that might have resulted in a need for critical care furthermore if there have been many undocumented immunizing infections the herd immunity threshold may be reached sooner than our models suggest still sars-cov-2 has demonstrated an ability to challenge robust healthcare systems and the development and widespread adoption of pharmaceutical interventions will take months at best so a period of sustained or intermittent social distancing will almost certainly be necessary in summary the total incidence of covid-19 illness over the next five years will depend critically upon whether or not it enters into regular circulation after the initial pandemic wave which in turn depends primarily upon the duration of immunity that sars-cov-2 infection imparts the intensity and timing of pandemic and post-pandemic outbreaks will depend on the time of year when widespread sars-cov-2 infection becomes established and to a lesser degree upon the magnitude of seasonal variation in transmissibility and the level of cross-immunity that exists between the betacoronaviruses social distancing strategies could reduce the extent to which sars-cov-2 infections strain health care systems highly-effective distancing could reduce sars-cov-2 incidence enough to make a strategy based on contact tracing and quarantine feasible as in south korea and singapore less effective one-time distancing efforts may result in a prolonged single-peak epidemic with the extent of strain on the healthcare system and the required duration of distancing depending on the effectiveness intermittent distancing may be required into 2022 unless critical care capacity is increased substantially or a treatment or vaccine becomes available the authors are aware that prolonged distancing even if intermittent is likely to have profoundly negative economic social and educational consequences our goal in modeling such policies is not to endorse them but to identify likely trajectories of the epidemic under alternative approaches identify complementary interventions such as expanding icu capacity and identifying treatments to reduce icu demand and to spur innovative ideas 55 to expand the list of options to bring the pandemic under long-term control our model presents a variety of scenarios intended to anticipate possible sars-cov-2 transmission dynamics under specific assumptions we do not take a position on the advisability of these scenarios given the economic burden that sustained distancing may impose but we note the potentially catastrophic burden on the healthcare system that is predicted if distancing is poorly effective andor not sustained for long enough the model will have to be tailored to local conditions and updated as more accurate data become available longitudinal serological studies are urgently required to determine the extent and duration of immunity to sars-cov-2 and epidemiological surveillance should be maintained in the coming years to anticipate the possibility of resurgence  correlates of symptoms of anxiety and depression and mental wellbeing associated with covid-19 a cross-sectional study of uk-based respondents lee smith louis jacob anita yakkundi daragh mcdermott nicola armstrong c yvonne barnett guillermo lpez-snchez f suzanne martin laurie butler mark tully a   in march 2020 the world health organization declared the covid-19 outbreak a global pandemic covid-19 is caused by sars-cov-2 a variant of coronavirus as of 6th april 2020 1000am cet more than 1244421 cases have been diagnosed globally with over 68976 fatalities govuk 2020 symptoms of infection are usually non-specific and include fever cough and myalgia with diarrhoea with or without the subsequent development of dyspnea chan et al 2020 severe cases that include respiratory distress sepsis and septic shock have been increasingly reported with critically ill patients requiring intubation and intensive care treatments wang et al 2020 covid-19 is a respiratory virus that is transmitted by large respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected secretions who 2020 therefore on 23rd march 2020 the uk government released the following guidance for the uk public to self-isolatesocial distance to reduce the risk of transmission everyone must stay at home to help stop the spread of coronavirus you should only leave your home for very limited purposes 1 shopping for basic necessities for example food and medicine which must be as infrequent as possible 2 one form of exercise a day for example a run walk or cycle  alone or with members of your household 3 any medical need including to donate blood avoid or escape risk of injury or harm or to provide care or to help a vulnerable person and 4 travelling for work purposes but only where you cannot work from home prior to this the advice was that vulnerable adults should voluntary self-isolate ie not leave their home or meet anyone other than those who live in their home nhs 2020 the world health organisation has recognised that such self-isolationsocial distancing measures may result in people becoming more anxious angry stressed agitated and withdrawn who 2020 anxiety is among the most prevalent mental health disorders bandelow and michaelis 2015 and may be defined as a persistent feeling of worry fear or nervousness mental health uk 2020 approximately 1 in 10 people living in the uk suffer from an anxiety-related disorder mental health uk 2020 a large body of literature shows that anxiety is associated with several detrimental consequences including lower quality of life brenes 2007 suicidal ideation and attempts nepon et al 2010 physical chronic conditions including multimorbidity sareen et al 2005 relationship complications kasalova et al 2017 and increased alcohol consumption smith and randall 2012 in addition to anxiety depression is also a prevalent mental health complication who 2020 depression causes feelings of sadness andor a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed and for depression to be diagnosed these symptoms must last for at least two weeks american psychiatric association 2020 similar to anxiety depression can lead to a variety of emotional hawton et al 2020 and physical oerlemans et al 2007 problems and can decrease a persons ability to function at both work and at home american psychiatric association 2020 importantly anxiety and depression once developed tend to track across the lifespan owing to the known detrimental consequences of anxiety and depression it is important to ensure strategies are in place to both prevent and manage such mental health complications the literature suggests that a key risk factor for both anxiety and depression is perceived isolation santini et al 2020 moreover literature shows that social network ties social support network structure and participation in social activities are associated with better mental health cornwell and laumann 2015 it is thus possible that the recent restrictions placed on the uk population owing to the covid-19 pandemic may have unintentional consequences per se on the state of mental health and mental health complications of the uk public the consequences of the current uk public health guidance and potential correlates of those who may be worst affected by the consequent effects of self-isolationsocial distancing have not been scrutinised to date moreover the fact that the uk public have not been required to follow such drastic self-isolationsocial distancing guidance in modern history means that there is a limited body of literature to which one can refer to inform effective policy and practice in order to support emotional wellbeing alongside the reduction in risk of exposure to contagion to date just one study exists on the impact of covid-19 on mental health the study investigated the immediate psychological response of the covid-19 pandemic on 1210 participants from 194 cities in china the study found that 538 of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe 165 reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms 288 reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms and 81 reported moderate to severe stress levels female gender student status specific physical symptoms eg myalgia dizziness coryza and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress anxiety and depression wang et al 2020 considering the current self-isolation social distancing guidance set out by the uk government and the scarcity of data on its impact on the state of mental health and mental health complications per se it is of the upmost importance to develop an understanding of the impact of such guidance on mental health and correlates of poor mental health to inform targeted intervention the present study aimed to investigate the cross-sectional association between the uk covid-19 self-isolationsocial distancing guidance and levels of anxiety depression and mental wellbeing as well as potential correlates of poor mental health this paper presents pre-planned interim analysis of data from a cross-sectional epidemiological study administered through an online survey the study was launched on 17 march 2020 17 days after the first case of covid-19 was diagnosed in the united kingdom the study was approved by the anglia ruskin university research ethics committee 16 march 2020 participants were recruited through social media and through national media outlets bbc march 26th 2020 and by distributing an invite to participate through existing researcher networks adults aged 18 years and over declaring that they currently reside in the uk and were self-isolatingsocial distancing due to covid-19 were eligible to participate participants were directed to a data encrypted website where they indicated their consent to participate after reading an information sheet demographic data was collected including sex age in 10-year age bands marital status singleseparateddivorcedwidowed or marriedin a domestic partnership employment annual household income 15000 15000-25000 25000-40000 40000-60000 60000 they were also asked to indicate which of the four main uk countries they lived in england northern ireland scotland wales measures of health status included whether respondents were a current smoker and consumer of alcohol yn the presence of physical multimorbidity ie more than three chronic diseases this is consistent with previous research sakib et al 2019 chronic physical diseases included obesity hypertension myocardial infarction angina pectoris and other coronary diseases other cardiac diseases varicose veins of lower extremities osteoarthritis chronic neck pain chronic low back pain chronic allergy excluding allergic asthma chronic bronchitis emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd type 1 diabetes type 2 diabetes diabetic retinopathy cataract peptic ulcer disease urinary incontinence or urine control problems hypercholesterolemia chronic skin disease chronic constipation liver cirrhosis and other hepatic disorders stroke chronic migraine and other frequent chronic headaches hemorrhoids cancer osteoporosis thyroid disease renal disease and injury participants were also asked if they had experienced any physical symptoms of covid-19 during self-isolationsocial distancing ie persistent cough high temperature sore throat runny nose and the number of days they had been in self-isolationsocial distancing mental health was measured using the becks anxiety inventory bai and becks depression inventory bdi these are both 21-item questionnaires with higher bai and bdi scores indicating more severe anxiety and depressive symptoms the short warwick-edinburgh mental well-being scale is a 7-item measure of mental well-being fat et al 2017 stewart-brown et al 2009 poor mental health was defined as the presence of at least one of the following three criteria moderate-to-severe anxiety symptoms bai score 16 moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms bdi score 20 carney et al 2011 and poor mental wellbeing swemwbs metric score 158 warwick medical school 2020 mental health is a multi-component construct although traditional aspects of mental health have been considered in isolation they may be experienced simultaneously therefore we created a mental health score to capture a wider range of aspects of mental health in individuals than usually is examined sample characteristics were compared between individuals with and those without poor mental health using chi-squared tests for categorical variables and t-test for the number of days of self-isolationsocial distancing bai bdi and swemwbs scores were further compared between different sex and age groups using analysis of variance anova effect sizes were estimated using phi coefficient chi-squared tests with binary categorical variables cramers v chi-squared tests with categorical variables with more than two categories cohens d t-tests with continuous variables and eta squared anova with continuous variables the association between several potential predictors independent variables and poor mental health dependent variable was studied using a multivariable logistic regression model potential predictors included sex age marital status employment annual income region current smoking current alcohol consumption physical multimorbidity any physical symptom experienced during self-isolationsocial distancing and number of days of self-isolation social distancing sensitivity analyses were conducted with moderate-to-severe anxiety symptoms moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms and poor mental wellbeing as dependent variables results from the logistic regression analyses are presented as odds ratios ors and 95 confidence intervals cis the level of statistical significance was set at p  005 the statistical analysis was performed with r 352 the r foundation this cross-sectional study included 932 participants 633 of women and 208 of individuals were aged between 25 and 34 years table 1
 the prevalence of poor mental health was 368 in the population respondents with poor mental health were significantly more likely to be women younger and singleseparateddivorcedwidowed than those not reporting poor mental health while they also had a lower annual income and were more likely to smoke and less likely to consume alcohol mean sd bai bdi and swemwbs scores were 121 117 116 106 and 208 51 respectively table 2
 bai and bdi scores were higher and swemwbs score lower in women and in those self-identifying as non-binary transgender or intersex individuals and younger people than in men and older adults respectively finally the results of the multivariable regression analyses are displayed in table 3

depressive symptoms and poor mental wellbeing as dependent variables the present study utilising a sample of 932 uk adults found that the prevalence of poor mental health was 368 in individuals self-isolatingsocial distancing due to the covid-19 pandemic correlates of poor mental health included female sex a younger age lower annual income being a current smoker and having physical multimorbidity moreover scores from the bai and bdi were particularly high ie demonstrating high levels of anxiety and depression and the swemwbs was low ie demonstrating low levels of mental wellbeing findings from the present study carried out during the covid-19 pandemic support those of the only other study carried out on mental health and mental health complications during this pandemic to date wang et al 2020 suggesting that the covid-19 pandemic may result in a poor mental health epidemic however such a claim cannot be confirmed until further longitudinal epidemiological studies emerge on this topic although it should be noted that mental health complications are often not an acute phenomenon and once developed may reoccur throughout ones life burcusa et al 2007 scholten et al 2013 in the present study the prevalence of poor mental health ie 368 is higher than that which was reported during non-pandemic times in the uk namely approximately 25 mind 2020 moreover bai and bdi scores in the present study are also higher than which was previously reported in populations without a psychiatric disorder muntingh et al 2011 veerman et al 2009 similarly scores for the swemwbs were lower fat et al 2017 the higher prevalence for anxiety depression and low mental health may be explained through two pathways first the pandemic itself may be increasing anxiety depression and reducing mental wellbeing indeed previous studies carried out during former pandemics have shown a heightened level of anxiety depression and psychological distress taha et al 2014 wheaton et al 2012 it may be proposed that such a deterioration in mental health may result from worry about contracting the condition oneself or a loved one or friend being diagnosed with covid-19 moreover the unavoidable media coverage and constant exposure to information relating to this pandemic including an increase in cases and mortality rates is likely to be further negatively influencing the respondents reported mental health second self-isolationsocial distancing is likely to negatively impact mental wellbeing and increase levels of anxiety and depression as has been suggested in previous literature cornwell and laumann 2015 santini et al 2020 this impact on mental health may be a result of perceived isolation financial concerns owing to not working or a reduction in custom if a business owner or self-employed and a reduction in social interactions in addition the physical environment of the home space may not be conducive to a healthful experience for individuals or families living in close contact during the pandemic home overcrowding inadequate facilities and poor housing standards may add to feelings of distress furthermore relationships that were strained prior to the pandemic may have heightened tensions either because people are forced to spend the lockdown together media reports confirm that worldwide reports of domestic abuse and violence have increased in frequency and severity the new york times 2020 a potential increase in levels of anxiety and depression owing to government self-isolation social distancing guidance is of concern as these behaviours have been shown to track across the lifespan and may thus present future health complications for the general public post-covid-19 pandemic it could therefore be purported that interventions are thus required to improve mental health during the active phase of pandemics and in order to be most efficient and to bring the most favourable outcomes interventions should be targeted at those at greatest risk to minimise potential long-term individual health and societal health burden the present study showed that female sex a younger age lower annual income a current smoker and those having physical multimorbidity had the lowest levels of mental health these results are somewhat surprising as females and young people are not in the groups thought to be at higher risk of complications from covid-19 however these correlates have also been observed to be associated with poor mental health during non-pandemic times lorant et al 2007 mental health 2020 patel et al 2007 stickley and koyanagi 2018 stubbs et al 2018 interestingly the results also do not conform to usual u-shape relationship between age and mental wellbeing typically young and older people report higher levels of mental wellbeing blanchflower and oswald 2008 with middle aged adults reporting the lowest levels the u-shaped relationship may result from the quelling of the aspirations of youth as people enter middle age and subsequently adjusted downwards in later life blanchflower and oswald 2008 the apparent linear relationship between age and mental wellbeing suggests that the current pandemic may be disproportionately affecting young people further research is required to understand why this might be including if it is due to declining economic prospects or diminished social contacts once these mechanisms have been identified targeted interventions may be implemented however several interventions to improve mental health status in young adults have been established utilising an internet-based delivery overcoming a key barrier during covid-19 self-isolationsocial distancing ye et al 2014 additional research should also consider the impact of self-isolationsocial distancing on specific marginalised and at risk populations eg lgbt youth interventions to improve mental health during the covid-19 pandemic should apparently focus specifically on those groups findings from the present study must be interpreted in light of its limitations first those suffering from poor mental health may have been more likely to complete the present survey and thus potentially introduce self-selection bias into the findings next participants were asked to self-report on their mental and physical health potentially introducing reporting bias third analyses were cross-sectional and thus it is not possible to determine trajectories of mental health during the current pandemic future research using multiple time points is thus warranted fourth the present study collected data on a sample of the uk public utilising an online questionnaire further research is required using other samples of uk adults to confirm or refute the present findings finally those with psychiatric disorders may have higher levels of anxiety than the general public however such data was not reported and thus it is possible that some participants included in this study may have had a psychiatric disorder in conclusion in the present sample of 932 uk adults who completed the survey while under uk government self-isolation social distancing instructions during the covid-19 pandemic high levels of the symptoms of anxiety and depression and low levels of mental health were reported correlates of these mirror those during non-pandemic times among uk adults self-isolatingsocial distancing females younger age groups those with a lower annual income current smokers and those with physical multimorbidity were associated with higher levels of poor mental health interventions to improve mental health during the covid-19 pandemic should focus on these groups moreover future research is now required to understand why the covid-19 pandemic may be disproportionally influencing the mental health status of these populations

research in context
evidence before this study
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 emerged in wuhan china in late 2019 in mid-january 2020 schools and workplaces closed as part of the lunar new year holidays these closures were then extended to prevent sars-cov-2 spread the intended effect of such physical distancing measures was to reduce person-to-person contact which spreads infectious diseases epidemic parameters such as time-dependent reproduction numbers governing sars-cov-2 transmission in wuhan have been estimated based on local and internationally exported cases the frequency of contacts in different age groups and locations schools workplaces households and others in china has also been previously estimated we searched pubmed and medrxiv for studies published in english up to march 7 2020 with the terms coronavirus and school or work and wuhan or hubei and identified 108 and 130 results respectively however to our knowledge no published article has reported use of location-specific transmission models that consider the impacts of school or workplace closures to study the spread of sars-cov-2 in wuhan
added value of this study
we built an age-specific and location-specific transmission model to assess progression of the wuhan outbreak under different scenarios of school and workplace closure we found that changes to contact patterns are likely to have substantially delayed the epidemic peak and reduced the number of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 cases in wuhan if these restrictions are lifted in march 2020 a second peak of cases might occur in late august 2020 such a peak could be delayed by 2 months if the restrictions were relaxed a month later in april 2020
implications of all the available evidence
the measures put in place to reduce contacts in school and work are helping to control the covid-19 outbreak by affording health-care systems time to expand and respond authorities need to carefully consider epidemiological and modelling evidence before lifting these measures to mitigate the impact of a second peak in cases
 person-to-person transmission is mostly driven by who interacts with whom9 10 which can vary by age and location of the contact ie school work home and community under the context of a large-scale ongoing outbreak contact patterns would drastically shift from their baseline conditions in the covid-19 outbreak in wuhan physical distancing measures including but not limited to school and workplace closures and health promotions that encourage the general public to avoid crowded places are designed to drastically shift social mixing patterns and are often used in epidemic settings4 although contact patterns can be inferred from reported social contact data that include information on which setting the contact took place in such studies are often focused on high-income countries11 or particular high-density areas12 this limitation can be addressed by quantifying contact patterns in the home school work and other locations across a range of countries based on available information from household-level data and local population demographic structures13
 to examine how these changes in population mixing have affected the outbreak progression we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in wuhan and adapted these in the presence of school closures extended workplace closures and reduction in mixing in the general community using these matrices and the latest estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the wuhan outbreak1 9 14 15 16 we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in wuhan using an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed seir model17 18 for several physical distancing measures we simulated the outbreak in wuhan using a deterministic stage-structured seir model over a 1 year period during which the modelled outbreak peters out an implication of this approach is that all demographic changes in the population ie births deaths and ageing are ignored we divided the population according to the infection status into susceptible s exposed e infected i and removed r individuals and according to age into 5-year bands until age 70 years and a single category aged 75 and older resulting in 16 age categories susceptible individuals might acquire the infection at a given rate when they come in contact with an infectious person and enter the exposed disease state before they become infectious and later either recover or die we assumed wuhan to be a closed system with a constant population size of 11 million ie s  e  i  r11 million throughout the course of this epidemic we used the seir model presented in figure 1
 the age-specific mixing patterns of individuals in age group i alter their likelihood of being exposed to the virus given a certain number of infectious people in the population additionally we incorporated contributions of asymptomatic and subclinical cases however the question of whether such individuals are able to transmit infection remains unresolved at the time of writing although evidence suggests that they are likely to19 we also considered a scenario in which we assumed that younger individuals are more likely to be asymptomatic or subclinical and less infectious than older individuals20 21

c  using parameters from the literature as presented in the table

0 values uniformly from the 95 ci from the posterior of the r
0 distribution from the semi-mechanistic model by kucharski and colleagues appendix p 214
 social mixing patterns vary across locations including households workplaces schools and other locations therefore we used the method set out by prem and colleagues13 which accounts for these differences and obtains the location-specific contact matrices c for different scenarios in a normal setting contacts made at all of these locations contribute to the overall mixing pattern in a population so we summed contacts across the different locations to obtain our baseline contact pattern in the population before the outbreak figure 2
 appendix pp 12 in an outbreak setting different intervention strategies are aimed at reducing social mixing in different contexts to lower the overall transmission in the population to simulate the effects of interventions aimed at reducing social mixing we created synthetic contact matrices for each intervention scenario from these building block matrices we considered the following three scenarios first scenario theoretical assumed no change to social mixing patterns at all location types no school term break and no lunar new year holidays second scenario no interventions winter school break in wuhan and lunar new year holidays assumed no physical distancing control measures school-going individuals did not have any contacts at school because of school holidays from jan 15 to feb 10 2020 and 10 and later 75 of workforce would be working during the holidays from jan 25 to jan 31 2020 and from feb 1 to feb 10 2020 respectively and third scenario intense control measures in wuhan to contain the outbreak assumed school closure and about 10 of workforce eg health-care personnel police and other essential government staff would be working even during the control measures figure 1 figure 2 for the third scenario we modelled the effect of the intense control measures ending at the beginning of march or april and we allowed for a staggered return to work while the school remained closed ie 25 of the workforce working in weeks one and two 50 of the workforce working in weeks three and four and 100 of the workforce working and school resuming figure 23 23 24
 analyses and model building were done in r version 362 the funder of the study had no role in study design data collection data analysis data interpretation or writing of the report the corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication our simulations showed that control measures aimed at reducing social mixing in the population can be effective in reducing the magnitude and delaying the peak of the covid-19 outbreak for different control measures among individuals aged 55 to 60 years and 10 to 15 years the standard school winter break and holidays for the lunar new year would have had little effect on progression of the outbreak had schools and workplaces reopened as normal figure 3
 we present the median cumulative incidence incident cases per day and age-specific incidence per day of 200 simulated outbreaks figure 4
 intense control measures of prolonged school closure and work holidays reduced the cumulative infections by end-2020 and peak incidence while also delaying the peak of the outbreak figure 4 our model suggests that the effects of these physical distancing strategies vary across age categories the reduction in incidence is highest among school children and older individuals and lowest among working-age adults figure 4 figure 5
 physical distancing measures were most effective if the staggered return to work was at the beginning of april this reduced the median number of infections by more than 92 iqr 6697 and 24 1390 in mid-2020 and end-2020 respectively figure 5 appendix p 3 should the disease have a longer duration of infectiousness and reduced the magnitude and delayed peak incidence across all age categories figure 4 which could have had further beneficial impact by relieving the pressure on the health-care system in the immediate few months after the outbreak began uncertainty in r
0 values has a large effect on the timing of the epidemic peak and final size of the outbreak figure 4 the modelled effects of the intense control measures of prolonged school closure and work holidays vary by the duration of infectiousness if the disease had a short infectious period 3 days then our model suggests that relaxing physical distancing interventions in march figure 5 appendix p 4 could avert around 30 of cases in school children and older individuals fewer cases could be averted by end-2020 should the disease have a longer duration of infectiousness eg 7 days figure 5 physical distancing interventions would need to be relaxed a month later in april to observe a larger effect if children were less infectious lifting physical distancing interventions in april instead of march could engender additional health benefits figure 5 appendix pp 56 covid-19 a contact-transmissible infectious disease is thought to spread through a population via direct contact between individuals1 9 10 outbreak control measures aimed at reducing the amount of mixing in the population have the potential to delay the peak and reduce the final size of the epidemic to evaluate the effect of location-specific physical distancing measuressuch as extended school closures and interventions in workplaceson the timing and magnitude of the peak and the final size of the epidemic we accounted for these heterogeneities in contact networks in our model we simulated outbreaks and modelled the interventions by scaling down the appropriate component of the contact mixing matrices for china mathematical models can help us understand how sars-cov-2 could spread across the population and inform control measures that might mitigate future transmission25 26 we simulated the trajectory of the ongoing outbreak of covid-19 in wuhan using an age-structured seir model17 18 as individuals mixing patterns are non-random they influence the transmission dynamics of the disease11 models that assess the effectiveness of physical distancing interventions such as school closure need to account for social structures and heterogeneities in mixing of individuals27 28 29 30 31 in our model we incorporated changes to age-specific and location-specific social mixing patterns to estimate the effects of location-specific physical distancing interventions in curtailing the spread of the outbreak the measures put in place to reduce contacts at schools and workplaces are helping control the outbreak by providing the health-care system with the time and opportunity to expand and respond consequently if these restrictions are lifted prematurely while there are still enough susceptible people to keep the r
e1 once contacts increase the number of infections would increase realistically interventions are lifted slowly partly as an attempt to avoid a sharp increase in infection but also for logistical and practical reasons therefore we simulated lifting the interventions in a staggered fashion evidence of the effects of various physical distancing measures on containing the outbreak are scarce and little is known about the behavioural changes of individuals over time either during an outbreak or otherwise therefore to model the effects of the physical distancing measures implemented in wuhan we assumed the effect that certain types of physical distancing have on age-specific and location-specific contact rates much is unknown about the true age-specific susceptibility and transmissibility of covid-19 therefore we assumed no heterogeneity in susceptibility between children furthermore for simplicity we assumed that children and adults were equally transmissible other than the differences in their contact rates subclinical children could be more infectious than subclinical adults appendix pp 56 similar to an influenza-like pathogen our model suggests that interactions between school children and older individuals in the population have important public health implications as children might have high infection rates but the elderly are more vulnerable to severe infections with potentially fatal outcomes32 33 however unlike models built for pandemic or seasonal flu we accounted for the lack of population immunity to sars-cov-2 this study describes a mathematical model that quantifies the potential impacts of physical distancing policies relying on wuhan as a case study epidemiological investigations during the who-china joint mission on covid-19 found many infections clustered around households34 extreme physical distancing measures including school closures workplace closures and avoidance of any public gatherings all at once can push the transmission to households leading to increased clustering of household cases5 as households are not explicitly included in the model we did not consider heterogeneity and clustering of household transmission distinguishing between repeated and new contacts is important for disease propagation in contact network models35 36 more sophisticated methods that account for temporal presence within the household37 would be needed to characterise higher degrees of contact looking at limitations of our study our compartmental model does not capture individual-level heterogeneity in contacts which could be important in super-spreading events particularly early in an epidemic combined with nosocomial infections the risk of covid-19 infection is potentially amplified with close contact between confirmed cases and health-care workers however the compartmental model we present is not equipped to explicitly consider transmission within health-care institutions and households more complex models such as individual-based models with familial and health-care structures should be explored nosocomial infection risk among health-care workers and patients has been identified as a research gap to be prioritised in the next few months by who a key parameter is the basic reproduction number r
0 which determines how fast sars-cov-2 can spread through the population during the early stages of the outbreak this is an inherently difficult parameter to estimate since the true number of cases that can transmit infection at a given time is unknown reported cases are likely to be just a small fraction of true cases and probably varies over time because of different interventions being introduced and population behaviour changing in response to the epidemic in our analysis we used an existing model that inferred time-dependent r
e based on the growth of reported cases in wuhan and the number of exported cases outside china originating from wuhan14 we acknowledge that the underlying reproduction number in wuhan could have been larger than that used in our study however other studies of early sars-cov-2 transmission dynamics in wuhan using different methods arrived at the same estimate with similar ranges1 9
 although the precise effects of interventions might vary by country and different estimates of key parameters our model highlights the usefulness of physical distancing interventions and the need to carefully calibrate their lifting to avoid second and subsequent waves of a covid-19 epidemic areas of china outside hubei and other east or southeast asian regions have managed to avert a major outbreak locally and delayed the peak of the epidemic without resorting to hubeis extreme measures38 policy makers are advised to reapportion their resources to focus on mitigating the effects of potentially soon-to-be overwhelmed health systems39
 non-physical distancing factors play a part in mitigating potential spikes in cases especially when physical distancing measures are relaxed the effects of seasonality on sars-cov-2 are difficult to predict without long time series supporting evidence for the link between climate and covid-19 has been largely anecdotal and based on spread in different settings and such analyses are subject to confounding40 41 consequently we have not incorporated climatic factors into our mathematical model future research should be directed towards understanding the potential seasonality of covid-19 and the climatic factors that could affect its transmission dynamics other innovations such as the rapid expansion of hospital capacity and testing capabilities would shorten diagnostic and health system delays3 38 39 thus reducing effective interactions between infectious and susceptible individuals and interrupting transmission effective vaccines42 and antivirals43 that are being developed could counteract this global public health threat the extent to which these strategies can detect cases earlier and isolate infectious individuals from the susceptible pool or protect against infection is less well-understood hence necessitating further evaluation combined physical distancing and travel restrictions have aided in lowering the transmission of covid-19 over the course of the ongoing outbreak in wuhan8 44 45 evidence for this drop in transmission can be gleaned from the time-varying estimates of the reproduction number14 or observing that the turnover of the epidemic has occurred far before depletion of susceptible individuals indicating the effects of the implemented measures it is difficult to quantify whether physical distancing alone is responsible for the drop in cases especially during the ongoing epidemic therefore we took a broad view of this question making assumptions about the results of certain forms of physical distancing and measuring the effects somewhat qualitatively however to some extent physical distancing has resulted in both a shorter epidemic and a lower peak given what is known about the transmissibility and the relatively long 56 days incubation period of covid-191 16 the efficacy of physical distancing in reducing these important attributes of any epidemic are no surprise in the analysis we have varied the basic reproduction number the average duration of infections the initial proportion of cases infected the susceptibility of children and the role of younger individuals in transmission dynamics of covid-19 in conclusion non-pharmaceutical interventions based on sustained physical distancing have a strong potential to reduce the magnitude of the epidemic peak of covid-19 and lead to a smaller number of overall cases lowering and flattening of the epidemic peak is particularly important as this reduces the acute pressure on the health-care system premature and sudden lifting of interventions could lead to an earlier secondary peak which could be flattened by relaxing the interventions gradually access to computer code is provided in the appendix p 1 data used in this study are freely available to the

covid-19 is a newly emergent infectious disease caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 virus originated in december 2019 from mainland china with initial cases emerging from the city of wuhan hubei province cdcp 2020 li et al 2020 although most individuals diagnosed with covid-19 present with mild to moderate respiratory symptoms a substantially minority present with severe symptomatology with accompanying need for hospital treatment a further proportion needing intensive care unit icu admission and an elevated fatality rate risk of mortality follows a clear age gradient verity et al 2020 on 30th january 2020 world health organization who officially declared the covid-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern followed by designation as a pandemic on 11th march ie presence of illness across multiple continents the rapid spread of covid-19 places huge strain on capacity responsiveness and resilience of public and private healthcare systems worldwide emanuel et al 2020 legido-quigley et al 2020 across multiple countries this has been accompanied by implementation of public health policies significantly altering everyday life such as the quarantine of citizens for significant periods of time with both short- and longer-term consequences for psychological distress and wellbeing brooks et al 2020 at time of writing the worldwide cases of covid-19 are steadily increasing across all continents on 11th april 2020 the cumulative total of individuals presenting with confirmed covid-19 was 1648365 people with a total of 102216 deaths who 2020 in many countries testing is limited to hospitalised cases therefore these numbers are likely to significantly underestimate the true prevalence of covid-19 in the population given they do not cover mild presentation and asymptomatic cases there is emerging evidence of the psychological impact of covid-19 on populations both directly due to the distress accompanying confirmed cases in individuals and their loved ones and indirectly due to population health interventions such as quarantine however it should be emphasized that the majority of people are not expected to suffer from mental disorders emerging from the pandemic and its impact taylor 2019 however a significant percentage will experience intense emotional adjustment reactions including fear of contagion zhou 2020 impact of prolonged quarantine brooks et al 2020 xiao 2020 the death of relatives wang et al 2020 or increased social adversity as a consequence of geopolitical instability to civil society associated with the economic crisis silva et al 2018 in china a survey of 1210 people found that 538 assessed the psychological impact of the situation as moderate-severe 165 reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms 288 moderate to severe anxiety symptoms and 81 moderate to severe stress levels most respondents 847 spent between 20 and 24 h a day confined at home and the main concern 752 was that hisher relatives would become infected with covid-19 wang et al 2020 based on our survey of preliminary current research and on previous literature on coping with past coronavirus-based epidemics eg severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers we identify three groups at risk for psychological morbidity during and after the covid-19 pandemic the first group are healthcare professionals particularly those working in inpatient physical health settings who experience higher frequency of exposure to the virus and higher viral load in the workplace compounded by significantly increased workload high risk procedures and the low availability of necessary personal protective equipment ppe thus health professionals are at risk of elevated levels of depression anxiety and sleep disorders li et al 2020 and many among them harbour fears of being infected during work shifts recent findings on medical students in the current crisis supporting this al-rabiaah et al 2020 this is also in line with previous experiences from sarsmers showing frontline health professionals constitute a unique risk group especially after pandemic containment ends and systems move towards mitigation of the disease impact gardner and moallef 2015 lee et al 2018 of note many other workers are exposed to the same risk and fear of contagion such as police officer postal carrier emergency medical technicians or trash collectors the second elevated risk group that should be considered include individuals who as a result of the crisis have been exposed to potentially traumatic events such as loss of a loved one threats to ones health and to the ability to work and make a living and concerns about their future capacity to maintain a sufficient income these people may express symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder ptsd depression or complicated grief disorder consistent with the literature on psychological and psychiatric sequelae of global emergencies or disasters goldmann and galea 2014 this group may not emerge immediately within the pandemic and presentations may only become apparent after several months even after the incidence of covid-19 has peaked a third group of people at increased risk for psychological problems consists of people with pre-existing psychopathology especially those with severe or complex psychiatric disorders their existing presentation may be exacerbated by extreme isolation due to exposure to either the virus or associated social distancing in this sense social distancing may exacerbate existing social isolation in this vulnerable group there is conflicting evidence from previous studies on the responses of people with severe psychiatric disorders to different types of disasters such as earthquakes with some evidence for higher levels of avoidance-related coping being associated with higher distress horan et al 2007 but other studies showing that this risk is somewhat disorder specific with pre-disaster mood and anxiety disorders but not psychotic disorders predicting further psychological distress katz et al 2002 this group also includes individuals with more common psychopathologies eg depression and anxiety who were receiving primary care mental health treatment or psychotherapy prior to the onset of covid-19 restrictions other people exposed to psychological suffering are those who have to live alone during the quarantine who has been recently bereaved by the coronavirus but the bereavement process has been disrupted by the lockdown and ones that are not allowed to visit their loved ones who are in hospital for whatsoever medical conditions as duan and zhu 2020 highlight specialized psychological intervention for covid-19 should be dynamic and flexible enough to adapt quickly to the different phases of the pandemic in the early stages clinical psychologists psychotherapist and psychological intervention specialists should actively collaborate with the rest of the multi-professional healthcare system in the treatment of the immediate impacts of covid-19 presentations mohammed et al 2015 this may take the shape of organising or enabling healthcare systems to orientate towards psychological impacts of a pandemic facilitate public mental health approaches to increasing population awareness of mental health or organizing systems for psychologically informed interventions this may also include task-shifting of psychological interventions either to delivery through digital means or by different professional groups potential therapeutic targets includetraining and support for health professionals at high exposure risk to identify and manage emotional reactions that may hinder their clinical work in frontline health delivery this includes for instance managing anxiety fear of contagion episodes of acute stress or promoting self-carereducing burnout the main objective of this approach is to maximise psychological resilience in as many professionals as possible who have frontline duties during a pandemic chen et al 2020 importantly in the peak of a pandemic interventions such as psychological debriefing critical incident stress debriefing or any other single session intervention mandating staff to talk about their thoughts or feelings are not recommended that said compassionate and sensitive awareness of the impact of critical care on health care professionals can be used to facilitate one on one support should that person wish it nice 2018next it is important to engage emotionally vulnerable groups especially people with previous psychopathology the main goal here is to support individuals undergoing covid-19 treatment or preventative quarantine the mental health symptoms of this group of patients with covid-19 should also be monitored although the presence of non-essential professionals such as psychiatrists clinical psychologists or social mental health workers in isolation rooms for covid-19 patients is completely discouraged therefore front-line psychological support either needs to be facilitated by medical staff involved in immediate care which may not be possible if the health system is at capacity or be implemented indirectly through telecare systems serious psychiatric emergencies such as aggression self-harm or suicide attempts will still need to be addressed in person for patients with acute symptomatology and diagnosed or suspected covid-19 professionals who assist them face-to-face should be protected to minimize the risk of contagion eg via appropriate ppe and ensure both their safety and that of the patientall other outpatient psychological interventions can be effectively carried out by digital care phone and internet enabled psychological interventions have been demonstrated to be clinically effective in a wide variety of mental disorders irvine et al 2020 related to this it is also important to tailor standard mental health delivery for individuals with pre-existing psychiatric disorders to acknowledge the impact of social isolation and distancing on mental health as part of adaptation to life under lockdown or quarantinerelatives of patients admitted by the coronavirus in a severe condition poorly prognosed or who have already died in such interventions it is essential not to pathologize the normal emotional reactions of family members and it is important to establish clear and consensual criteria with all the professionals involved to determine whether intervention is more beneficial than not to do so von blanckenburg and leppin 2018as the pandemic plateaus and societies begin to emerge from distancing mental health symptoms such as hypochondriasis anxiety insomnia or acute stress as well as symptoms consistent with ptsd are expected to present across health systems in these cases the first-line intervention should be psychological minimizing as far as possible the use of drugs nice 2014 2018 furthermore the literature emphasizes the importance of not starting formal psychological treatments quickly and without careful assessment including active monitoring as noted above although well intentioned intervening in individuals natural coping mechanisms too early can be detrimental there is evidence that these interventions may be ineffective or even increase the likelihood of developing ptsd nice 2018 special attention should also be paid to potential for re-traumatization of ptsd presentations where trauma-focused therapies are implemented without adequate psychotherapeutic frameworks and structures duckworth and follette 2012 and guarding against the development of interventions for those that have recovered from covid-19 that stigmatize or block access of the to a new functional identity as survivors of the pandemic muldoon et al 2019 going forward it is also crucial to ensure individuals affected by covid-19 retain a sense of their overall identity and that this is not subsumed into an explanatory model reduced to the illness any intervention should be based on a thorough assessment of possible risk factors that may maintain the problem the patients prior state of mental health the history of bereavement the presence of a history of self-harm or suicidal behaviours in both the patient and hisher family the history of previous traumas and the socio-economic context of the patient at this stage it is also important to recognise the likely profound impact of covid-19 on economic social and political levels at all levels from the individual to international this may therefore require mental health systems to adopt new ways of working with structural inequalities emerging from the aftermath of covid-19 and consistent with a social determinants of mental health model eg lund et al 2018 in organizing psychological assistance within and across various stages of the pandemic we highlight four major challengeshealthcare system deficits both in terms of material and human resources ie lack of adequate ppe infrastructure for digital interventions staffing or in mental health professionals not specialized in the psychological approach of crises and emergencies shultz et al 2015 shultz and neria 2013 in china the scarcity of human resources led to individual professionals accumulating multiple responsibilities reducing the effectiveness of their interventions duan and zhu 2020 for this reason government policy makers and health managers need to be aware of health systems strengthening for increasing the capacity of mental health professionals facilitate training for emergency intervention and monitor workload burdens especially when sustained over timesocietal underestimation of the short- and long-term psychological consequences of pandemics and consequently limited resources to cope with them bitanihirwe 2016 there is evidence that individuals exposed to public health emergencies have increased psychopathological vulnerability both during and after the potentially traumatic event fan et al 2015 although the international covid-19 pandemic response has been unprecedented in terms of mobilisation of resource and finance there will also be long-term impacts in terms of treatment burden including mental health particularly in low resource and conflict settings un 2020 in china the progression of covid-19 aggravated the mental health of infected patients the general population and health professionals duan and zhu 2020 therefore it is important to evaluate and identify all risk groups and adapt interventions to their specific needs among the variables to consider are disease trajectory severity of clinical symptoms place of treatment in-home or out-of-home isolation icu etc history of previous trauma and previous history of mental health problems having this information will help classify people at risk and enable specific preventive mental health measures to be put in placepoor planning and coordination of psychological interventions especially when they are applied at different levels and by different professionals zhang et al 2020 in china at the start of the covid-19 outbreak the absence of adequate planning of psychological interventions led to fragmented or disorganized implementation compromising effectiveness and efficacy and hampering access to available health resources any psychological intervention should be planned and coordinated together with all the social-health stakeholders involved particularly primary healthcare services and specialized mental health services this maximised the potential for adequate continuity of care even after acute phase of the pandemic recedesfinally there is also a risk attached to early crisis responses leading to a proliferation of interventions and frameworks associated with an oversupply of well-intentioned but potentially non-evidence based psychological assistance often non-governmental organizations ngo and the third sector this is not to say all ngo interventions are compromised and indeed prevention in mental health is highly desirable that said delivery of preventive interventions must be balanced by delivery andor supervision applied by appropriately qualified professionals loewenstein 2018 ogden 2019 as previously noted where health systems have sufficient flexibility for those with existing mental health conditions should continue their psychological interventions by technology enabled means this can include telephone consults or increasingly via digital platforms such as skype zoom or health provider developed platforms this presents a number of specific challenges including familiarity with the technology both therapist and client adaptation of the therapeutic intervention awareness of the additional parameters of delivering therapy in lockdown conditions and the accompanying question of the purpose of therapy in such unusual circumstances there are thus several difficulties that psychotherapists and practitioners have in adjusting their practice to technology enhanced therapy which is now delivered from their own homes as opposed to familiar public facilities or private practices the following suggestions of how to adapt psychotherapy to this unique condition have emerged from our everyday clinical experiences over the adaptation to lockdown in several countries and represent an attempt to systemize clinical practice for the duration of the emergence and of social life restrictions therefore we provide a number of key points to guide clinicians in adapting practicedraft a new contract many patients will have difficulties in accepting digital psychotherapy clinicians must be clear that this is pragmatically the only option available if this is the case but also acknowledge and self-regulate their own difficulties with changes such as worry for the clients mental health irritation with the option of discontinuing face to face psychotherapy or guilt at the idea of not being available enough in all of these cases the clinician remains open for phonevideo contact where the patient experiences psychological problem but negotiation is required over whether sessions are for crisis-management only or whether regular sessions are still possible andor desirable to both parties this can help retain a balance between acceptance of difficulties and the maintenance of a robust treatment frameworkraise the bar for what we consider psychopathology reactions of distress such as fear rage anxiety obsessions guilt constriction rebellion against authority emotion and behavioural dysregulation albeit transitory are to a certain extent normal during a crisis the clinician must first and foremost help the patients understand that their suffering is human and mostly unavoidable this is not to say that they should be ignored or minimised when patients can note how their mind is overwhelmed by symptoms affect or relational problems this creates a basis for agreement to work on themcommon factors eg norcross and lambert 2019 are even more important than usual in particular we think that validation sharing and self-disclosure become of uttermost importance validation follows from the above that adjustment to the new normal is normal and patients experience is human therapists can note how experiencing fears for their own and their loved ones health is understandable that to be worried about the future of the economy is reasonable how to behave with a certain degree of obsessions is adaptive eg hand hygiene or that unexpected losses of temper are to be expected in confinement where sharing is appropriate the clinician may provide examples of witnessing the same experiences and noting this is part of what the humanity is experiencing now this is aimed at reducing feelings of self-shaming self-criticism stigma or guilt for ones own weaknesses self-disclosure is unique in this aspect above all it is one of the most powerful interventions safran and muran 2000 and in this moment becomes even more necessary therapists may need to strategically disclose moments of their own personal vulnerability during the outbreak we contend that in this moment clinicians should mindfully and tactically not stick to one of the principles of good self-disclosures eg dimaggio et al 2015 that is clinicians should disclose well-regulated feelings and thoughts in this moment still having command over their own experiences clinicians may disclose moments in which they experienced momentarily feelings of fear even moving closer to panic worry anger sadness rebellion and irritation than one ordinarily would this helps create a sense of human connection and reduces in session risk on the clients side of self-blaming or setting unrealistic standards of good mental health for the self safran and muran 2000 inchausti et al 2019 this can be balanced in session with learning from these experiences of momentary dysregulationcreate the therapeutic environment we are not working in our offices but often from our homes the therapy space must be therefore be created anew for video-therapy the clinician should choose what part of their home they want to show beyond their shoulders and possibly consider the patients personality equally the therapists will be projecting a sense of their own identify in these choices with some patients it is better to choose a more neutralprofessional background for example bookshelves or a working table with other patients there is less this need and they experience a sense of familiarity even when they see the kitchen of the windows of the therapists home in any case asking patients for feedback about how they experience the therapist in this new environment is crucial another issue is how to present oneself in the camera absence of embodied intersubjectivity deprives the session of face-to-face aspects of the human connection we consider that adjusting zoom of the webcam which means placing oneself at some distance can be helpful showing only ones face is artificial and deprives the client of gestures and nonverbal markers from the therapist conversely at least a half-length shot eg breaking news conductors is better and some background must be present so the patients retains a sense of a human being in context this way therapists can use arms and hands and chest and shoulders to convey nonverbal signals making communication more natural alternatively some patients may feel more comfortable without using a camera and the use of audio might suit them better coping with such anxiety disorders as social anxiety might lead patients to avoid video as in any form of coping if using video is too much of an emotional burden to that client the clinician accepts phone consultation but keeps exploring the possibility to switch to video which would be a kind of behavioural exposure a compromise would be using a web platform with video disabled simply accepting coping deprives the clinician the possibility to counteract psychopathology whereas gently asking if the patient feels ready to switch to video and explore the cognitive-affective antecedents of the possible refusal gives precious information about residual maladaptive interpersonal schemas which are one fundamental therapy targethelp patients build their own environment clinicians may offer suggestions for how to create a therapeutic space safe and protected from interference of course having a private distraction-free room is best but even in this case patients can be suggested to use headphones and a microphone and maybe some background music so reducing the risk others listen alternatively sessions can be conducted over smartphone in the open for example a private garden the parking lot or ones car trivial as they may sound we have found these suggestions help many patients to accept and practice therapy even after initial reluctancetherapeutic focus only self-regulation and overcoming distress or exploration of opportunities for building healthy parts and pursuing autonomy exploration and expanding the healthy self dimaggio et al 2015 we have noted that in majority of cases where we have adjusted delivery of psychotherapy to fit the pandemic restrictions patients are seeking a balance between acceptance of the current condition whilst still trying to challenge maladaptive schemas and develop an emergent healthy part of the self indeed once issues relating to the present crisis have been dealt with patient and therapist may explore how the current distressing conditions create suffering not only for their direct traumatic effects but also because they may indirectly bring existing personality cognitive and emotional vulnerabilities to the fore thus clinicians may help the patients connect their present experiences to lifelong vulnerabilities enabling therapeutic work to continue as they did before the emergency albeit with specific adaptations for example prior to lockdown patients with avoidant personality disorders may have started questioning schemas of themselves as inferior and others are judging and therefore they coped with social avoidance inchausti et al 2018 in this moment behavioural experiments aimed at increasing social contact and thus further challenging the schemas are more difficult to enact yet the clinician may still explore opportunities and build more basic steps for future real-life exposures patients looking for employment may be able to access online courses or training for life after patients searching for romantic partner may use dating apps or explore the feelings and thoughts they experience when chatting with some new acquaintance even the home may be a test ground for new experiments one client related difficulty in showing personal vulnerabilities to significant persons because she had learned that if she revealed these emotions others either became unavailable or distressed therefore she had avoided disclosure or felt guilty for burdening them lockdown and having to live with her partner 247 helped her realize that there was no point in her concealing her personal feelings thus she burst into tears with her partner relating afterwards in therapy that she felt relieved as she realized that that was possible this enabled schema-driven difficulties in continuing with disclosure of feelings could be addressed as a current therapeutic issuefinally some practices like two-chairs sensorimotor work guided imagery exercises can regularly be performed simply adjusting the zoom in the patient room the therapists may ask the client to step back so the whole body can be observed and then ask to close their eyes and engage in guided imagery or use bodily oriented work like grounding lowen 1971 to enhance self-regulation or connecting with feelings of strength and personal agency that said for some patients that are unwilling or do not want to use this platform for treatment if they are content to postpone specific elements of treatment until restrictions are lifted the therapist should be sensitive in recognizing distress but also respecting the decision-making process it is still possible to remain open to the patient recontacting the therapist to recommence therapy to conclude the covid-19 pandemic and associated disruption to society poses major challenges to the provision of mental health services these challenges include the need to identify and monitor possible risk groups for psychological morbidity as well as exploring new ways of providing services as a heuristic it is useful to consider three potentially overlapping groups that can benefit from psychological frameworks for mental health andor treatment approaches these are i healthcare workers engaged in frontline response to the pandemic and their patients ii individuals who will experience the emergence of new mental health distress as a function of being diagnosed with covid-19 or losing family and loved ones to the illness or the psychological effects of prolonged social distancing and iii individuals with existing mental health conditions who are either diagnosed with covid-19 or whose experience of social distancing exacerbates existing vulnerabilities there are yet limited data on the mental health impacts of the current crisis but evidence from past epidemics eg mers and sars offer a basis for identifying risk groups and preparing management strategies the current crisis is the first global crisis in the age of mass internet supported communication and this offers opportunities and challenges for delivering high-quality psychological therapies online practical and technical adjustments to therapy can and have already been made but as the pandemic unfolds it will be important to generate a corpus of knowledge both on the effectiveness of technologically supported psychotherapy and to share technique in working with patients in an environment where technological changes intersect with societal changes due to the pandemic  epidemiological impact of sars-cov-2 vaccination mathematical modeling analyses monia makhoul houssein ayoub h hiam chemaitelly shaheen seedat ghina mumtaz r sarah

two vaccination program scenarios were considered in both programs it was assumed that vaccination is introduced in absence of social-distancing interventions as the purpose of vaccination is to replace such interventions the first program scenario assumes vaccine introduction and scale-up to 80 coverage before epidemic onset this scenario is relevant for assessing impact of vaccination on future sars-cov-2 introductions in countries where the epidemic has been contained or at low level such as in china the scenario is also relevant to assess maximum potential impact of vaccination regardless of current epidemic status the second program scenario assumes vaccine introduction during the epidemics exponential growth phase with scale-up to 80 coverage within one month incidence of new infections was assessed at various levels of s ve to determine the minimum efficacy needed to fully control the infection incidence was also assessed in a scenario where vaccination was introduced with a social-distancing intervention to estimate level of social distancing needed to complement vaccination to control the infection incidence was assessed in another scenario where those vaccinated

minor differences in effectiveness over time for instance in initial phases of the epidemic prioritizing those 60-69 years of age was slightly more effective than prioritizing those 40-49 years of age  figure s8 of sm meanwhile towards end of epidemic cycle the inverse was true figure 5b illustrates the gains in effectiveness as while a vaccine with 50 s ve  cannot fully control the epidemic figure s9 of sm shows the impact when vaccination is supplemented with a social-distancing intervention that reduces the contact rate less than 20 reduction in contact rate would be sufficient to fully control the epidemic vaccinated individuals may increase their contact rate with the perception of protection figure 6 shows the consequences of behavior compensation a 20 increase in contact rate

not only depend on its efficacy in preventing infection but can be enhanced if those vaccinated who still acquire the infection have reduced infectiousness duration of infection and disease severity

documents the age and location of contacts and as well as a measure of their intimacy whether physical contact was made or not in addition we asked about adherence to different physical distancing measures the first surveys were sent on tuesday 24th march one day after a lockdown was implemented across the uk we compared measured contact patterns during the lockdown to patterns of social contact made during a non-epidemic period by comparing these we estimated the change in reproduction number as a consequence of the physical distancing measures imposed we used a meta-analysis of published estimates to inform our estimates of the reproduction number before interventions were put in place we found a 73 reduction in the average daily number of contacts observed per participant from 102 to 29 this would be sufficient to reduce r0 from 26 prior to lockdown to 062 95 confidence interval ci 037 -089 after the lockdown based on all types of contact and 037 95 ci  022 -053 for physical contacts only the physical distancing measures adopted by the uk public have substantially reduced contact levels and will likely lead to a substantial impact and a decline in cases in the

epidemiological surveillance evidence before this study many governments have adopted physical distancing measures to mitigate the impact of the covid-19 pandemic however it is unclear to what extent these measures reduce the number of contacts and therefore transmission we searched pubmed and medrxiv on march 28 2020 with the terms coronavirus or covid-19 or influenza and school or work and closure or holiday and contact or mixing and identified 59 and 17 results respectively only one study conducted in china during the covid-19 pandemic reported a reduction in daily contacts outside the home during the period of lockdown we found no other published articles that empirically quantify the impact of these measures on age-and location-specific mixing patterns by surveying adults behaviour in the uk during a period of stringent physical distancing lockdown and comparing the results to previously collected data we found a large reduction in daily contacts particularly outside the home resulting in a marked reduction in the estimated reproduction number from 26 to 062 95 bootstrapped confidence interval ci 037 -089 this method allows for rapid assessment of changes in the reproduction number that is unaffected by reporting delays changes in human contact behaviour drive respiratory infection rates understanding these changes at different stages of the covid-19 pandemic

of march 2020 1  in an attempt to mitigate the covid-19 pandemic many countries have adopted unprecedented physical distancing policies 2  on the 23rd of march with just over 6000 confirmed cases the uk government implemented strict physical distancing measures instructing individuals to stay at home and avoid leaving their house except for essential work to take one form of exercise a day and to buy essential items such as food and medicines this followed the closure of sporting events schools restaurants bars gyms and other leisure or hospitality-related businesses the previous week 3 and an increase in social distancing among the population that had been taking place for several days before the announcement 4  physical distancing interventions attempt to reduce contacts relevant to infectious disease spread between individuals multiple surveys have been instigated on the uptake of different physical distancing measures during this current pandemic but these have not explicitly

stratified by setting furthermore to reflect school closures during the collection of our survey we removed school-contacts from the polymod data from our analysis the basic reproduction number or r0 is the average number of secondary infections arising from a typical single infection in a completely susceptible population and can be estimated as the dominant eigenvalue of the next generation matrix 17  the exact form of the next generation matrix is model dependent for respiratory infections such as sars-cov-2 the pathogen causing covid-19 this is usually a function of the age-specific number of daily contacts the probability that a single contact leads to transmission and the total duration of infectiousness therefore r0 is proportional to the dominant eigenvalue of the contact matrix 15  we assumed that contact patterns prior to physical distancing were similar to those observed in the polymod data and that the duration of infectiousness and the probability that a single contact leads to transmission did not change during the study period under these assumptions the relative reduction in r0 is equivalent to the reduction in the dominant eigenvalue of the contact matrices by multiplying the value of r0 prior to the interventions by the ratio of the dominant eigenvalues from the polymod and comix contact matrices we were able to calculate r0 under the physical distancing interventions prior to interventions we assumed r0 followed a normal distribution with mean 26 and standard deviation of 054 based on a metaanalysis of the literature presented in the supplementary material to assess uncertainty we repeated the age imputation process by taking 10000 bootstrapped samples from both polymod and comix matrices for every bootstrap sample we calculated the ratio between the dominant eigenvalues for the sampled polymod and comix matrices this sampling provided a distribution of relative change in r0 from the contact patterns observed in polymod and comix subsequently we scaled the initial distribution of r0 with the distribution of bootstrap samples to estimate r0 under physical distancing interventions recent results of the bbc pandemic study 16 suggested a decrease of nearly 50 in the average number of contacts made by teenagers 13-18 years compared with the polymod data we assessed the sensitivity of our results to a potential reduction in contacts over time by taking a conservative reduction of 50 between 5-18 year olds in the polymod study and repeating our approach to estimate the reduction in r0  cc-by-nd 40 international license

resulted in very large 73 reductions in the total number of contacts if similar changes are observed across the uk population we would expect the basic reproduction number to now be below 1 062 95 ci 037 -089 and that these physical distancing measures will lead to a decline in cases in the coming weeks however this projected decline in incidence will not result in an immediate decline in reported cases as there are significant delays between infection and the onset of symptomatic disease and hospitalisation as well as further delays to these events being reported hence routine surveillance data are unlikely to show a decline in cases for some time however by directly measuring individuals contact patterns and estimating the corresponding basic reproduction number we are able to rapidly quantify the impact of physical distancing on transmission the total number of daily contacts mean of 31 per person was significantly reduced compared to patterns previously estimated in the polymod study 107  excluding children 18 years old and more recently by the bbc pandemic study 105  excluding under 13-year-olds 16  the observed reduction appears to be unlikely due to chance given the large difference in average contacts and is consistent with a recent study conducted in wuhan china that estimated a reduction in the average number contacts per day from 146 prior to the outbreak to 20 under physical distancing interventions 12  while we are unaware of any directly comparable data from the uk our findings are certainly consistent with other reports from the uk of a dramatic reduction in social contacts with for example only half of respondents in one survey reporting having the house at all in the past 24hrs 4  there are several limitations to this survey asking individuals to report their contacts from the day before may result in recall bias moreover individuals who are adhering to physical distancing measures may have been more likely to respond to this

preprint sample any children so child-child contacts had to be imputed from comparison with a previous survey we were not able to quantify any additional effect from the interventions on transmission such as reduction in infectiousness by increased handwashing in addition we were not able to calculate the net reproductive number r0 as we did not account for the proportion of the population that is no longer susceptible these could all reduce the net reproductive number to values lower than estimated in our analysis our analysis assumed that direct contacts are an appropriate proxy for effective contacts and thus that transmissibility is equal across age-groups eg contact between a single infected child and susceptible adult is as likely to result in transmission as contact between a single infected adult and a susceptible adult we further assume that the reduction in non-school contacts in children is similar to that observed in adults furthermore we assume that the contact patterns prior to interventions are consistent and of similar magnitude a recent study has found significantly lower numbers of contacts reported by teenagers compared with the polymod survey 16  decreasing mixing among 5-17 years by 50 whilst reducing the magnitude of reduction in r0 did not affect the qualitative conclusions from the analysis this study is planned to continue in the uk for the next 15 weeks future analyses will be able to explore changes in contact patterns during different interventions and may provide early warning signs of changes in contact patterns due to interventions being lifted or decreasing adherence with restrictions we have shown that behavioural monitoring can give a rapid insight into transmission of covid-19 and have provided the first evidence that the restrictions adopted by the uk government have led to a decrease in transmission of covid-19  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a

since the emergence of sars-cov-2 the virus that causes coronavirus disease in late 2019 communities have been required to rapidly adopt community mitigation strategies rarely used before or only in limited settings this study aimed to examine the attitudes and beliefs of australian adults towards the covid-19 pandemic and willingness and capacity to engage with these mitigation measures in addition we aimed to explore the psychosocial and demographic factors that are associated with adoption of recommended hygiene-related and avoidance-related behaviors a national cross-sectional online survey of 1420 australian adults 18 years and older was undertaken between the 18 and 24 march 2020 the statistical analysis of the data included univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis the survey of 1420 respondents found 50 710 of respondents felt covid-19 would somewhat affect their health if infected and 19 perceived their level of risk as high or very high 849 had performed 1 of the three recommended hygiene-related behaviors and 934 performed 1 of six avoidance-related behaviors over the last one month adopting avoidance behaviors was associated with trust in

ci 11-30 interpretation in the last two months members of the public have been inundated with messages about hygiene and social physical distancing however our results indicate that a continued focus on supporting community understanding of the rationale for these strategies as well as instilling community confidence in their ability to adopt or sustain the recommendations is needed  in the course of four months since the first reports about a novel strain of coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 emerging in december 2019 countries around the world have introduced a range of community mitigation strategies with the aim to lower the trajectory of this pandemic by reducing transmission and avoid overwhelming health services community mitigation strategies refer to measures that people and communities can take to slow the spread of infection during a period when vaccines andor medical treatments that are not available 1  they include the use of personal protective measures for everyday use eg voluntary home isolation of ill persons respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene community measures aimed at increasing social distancing eg maintaining a physical distance of 15-20 meters between people staying at home and postponing or cancelling gatherings and environmental measures eg routinely disinfecting surfaces in some settings these strategies are voluntary whereas in others they are now enforced such as via fines andor jail time governments are implementing strategies at large-scale that have previously been used in limited ways and for limited time periods ie during ebola avian influenza outbreaks and sars this means a large proportion of the population do not have prior experience undertaking these strategies peoples ability to comply with recommendations during emergency situations is influenced by a range of modifiable and nonmodifiable factors including 1 what people perceive their susceptibility to infection to be 2  2 whether they perceive the infection to be serious if acquired 3 whether they have the necessary capacity confidence and resources to comply with the strategies 3  and 4 their

towards actual or willingness for adoption of hygiene strategies including hand washingsanitizing while anxiety levels were amongst our participants perceived susceptibility to covid-19 was at an intermediate level there may be several factors at play here that account for the perceived level of risk firstly people may be unaware of true risk since little reporting has focused on attack rates during the time of the study secondly people may be subject to optimism bias -a phenomenon where people downplay their own risk of an outcome 12  thirdly it is likely that some people assess their risk as being low due to already factoring in a change towards anticipated or already accomplished protective behavior 13  during events that people deem familiar we often see unrealistic optimism because the risk is perceived to be under control as was the case in 2009 with the influenza pandemic when adoption of precautions was low and there  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made

behavior if an individual does not believe that heshe can carry out the behavior ie physically distance themselves there is little motivation to engage 20  three-quarters of the study respondents agreed that they could adopt the avoidance-related strategies with lower scores for working from home and self-isolation at home when asked whether they had adopted any of the hygiene related strategies washing or sanitizing hands were the most common responses these represent more readily adoptable strategies as people in the community understand how to engage in them believe that the strategy will protect them and usually have the resources to carry them out these easy to adopt actions have also been a focus of government mass media messages when it came to avoidance behaviors our

21  it is not surprising that some strategies including social distancing scored low as people may not understand what the strategy entails the rationale for its use or what impact it may have on ones health it should also be noted that individuals may not have the capacity or resources to comply with physical distancing measures because they 1 have extended families living in their households 2 they have a responsibility to provide care for someone outside of their home 3 they may reside in share accommodation 4 may not have access to internetcomputer in the home setting or 5 because of the type of job they have they cannot simply shift to working from home in these settings providing mass media education is not going to suffice what is needed is pragmatic solutions that support people financially and socially to participate examples including increases in social support and charities to assist with delivery of groceries and meals home delivery from chemists telehealth consultations

them about why the strategy would be implemented the end-goal of implementing it what could be the potential impacts how members of the public engage and the criteria for its de-escalation in order to promote cooperation with social physical distancing strategies governments may need to use realistic portrayals community stories and role modelling by influential actors in social networks observing

hong kong during the 2003 sars outbreak 5 17 and some studies during the 2009 h1n1a pandemic 24 25  however the pattern of age is not straight forward in contrast to the above studies others have reported higher levels of adoption of preventive behaviors amongst younger people 18-24 years in the context of the 2009 influenza pandemic when it comes to gender we found that females were more likely to report uptake of both preventive and avoidance behaviors consistent with studies during sars and h1n1 pandemic influenza 2 5 17 26  earlier studies have indicated that women are more likely to perceive themselves to be susceptible and hence adopt the behaviors 15 27  when it comes to country of birth we found that people born outside of australia were less likely to adopt behaviors this finding may relate to the capacity to access information which at the time was being disseminated in english and largely through mainstream media conferences and health department websites rather than community and language groups further work is needed to explore the associations between country of birth and pandemic-related behaviors when asked what would motivate respondents to comply with a social distancing strategy they nominated i believe it is the right thing to do as the primary response while this answer did not have any significant relationship with the outcome measures reviewed it is still relevant when it comes to planning communication messages it suggests that respondents may be influenced by a desire for social approval from others an idea linked to the model of moral motivation the model developed by brekke et al 2003  assumes that individuals have preferences for achieving and maintaining a self-image as a socially responsible person 28  in brekke et als model

s santosh honavar g gudlavalleti murthy v   sars outbreak took place in 2002 in china and infected 8422 people globally4 the total number of deaths was 916 globally4 as of march 31 2020 the sars-cov-2 has infected over a million and has caused more than 50000 deaths2 one reason why its spread is evidently much wider as compared to sars is the rapid urbanization and the increase in international travel during the last two decades hence the control measures applied at the time of sars are no longer adequate in these days and more vigorous actions are required to control sars-cov-25 another reason is related to a difference in the infectious period between patients infected with sars and those infected with sars-cov-2 while in the former case viral shedding peaks only when the patients illness is advanced and respiratory symptoms occur5 for sars-cov-2 transmission can occur in the early phase of the illness when the patients are completely asymptomatic67 hence isolation after the onset of symptoms might be ineffective in preventing virus transmission and this also makes temperature screening less effective8 finally sars-cov-2 has been proven to hold higher transmissibility and wider community spread than other betacoronaviridae5 despite being highly infectious and having higher transmissibility the severity of sars-cov-2 is much lesser compared to sars5 statistical models on the spread of sars-cov-2 suggested that due to lack of herd immunity in the population and the highly contagious nature of the virus 40-70 of the population can be infected unless strong containment measures are timely taken9 based on the past experience with different epidemics and pandemics as well as the current understanding of sars-cov-2 the who suggested frequent hand washing with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water avoiding touching eyes nose and mouth and practicing respiratory hygiene2 the use of face masks by everyone is still controversial though who does not recommend its use by everyone2 coronavirus can survive on different surfaces for a long time  plastic 72 hours stainless steel 48 hours cardboard 24 hours and copper 4 hours1011 as regard to contact spreading the virus can be effectively inactivated by surface disinfection with 70 isopropyl alcohol 05 hydrogen peroxide or 01 sodium hypochlorite1011 hence thorough cleaning with disinfecting solutions in health facilities and public places is warranted health care facilities are advised to use personal protective equipment ppe with triple-layered masks or n95 masks and to educate the staff about the proper disposal of the equipment2 respiratory precautions during aerosol-generating procedures are also recommended2 anyone with fever cough and difficulty in breathing is advised to seek medical attention2 social distancing minimum one meter is recommended both at individual and community levels2 at the community level the most important measures for reducing infection spread rely on case detection isolation and contact tracing of positive cases followed by quarantine for those exposed other strategies include the closure of places of mass gathering like schools libraries places of worship malls and cinemas and the suspension of all social events as sports celebrations and meetings temperature screening has been introduced at airports railway stations and bus stations as well as the entrance of the main community buildings like hospitals banks or law courts the limitation of temperature screening is that it misses a significant number of asymptomatic carries which has been estimated at around 468 in countries with a worse rate of infection more restrictive measures have been put in place like travel bans reduction or interruption of both internal and overseas flights and boundary closure curfew and lockdown are also implemented all the aforementioned measures aim at reducing the rate of infection transmission thus delaying the timing and lowering the height of the epidemic peak these allow from one side gaining time for the healthcare system to prepare an efficient response to the pandemic and from the other side the development of potential new treatments and vaccines in wuhan it has been calculated that physical distancing with a staggered return to work at the beginning of april instead of march was the most effective strategy with a projected reduction of the median number of infections by 92 interquartile range iqr 66-97 and 24 iqr 13-90 in mid-2020 and end-2020 respectively12 a range of strategies has been adopted worldwide based on the population structure as well as the health care infrastructure of each country one of the problems that have been faced is the delay in the implementation of measures a model simulation by lai shengjie and andrew tatem predicted that if china had implemented control measures a week earlier 67 of all cases could have been prevented if implementation had been done at the beginning of january it would have cut infection rate to 513 the events in wuhan show that for at least three weeks after the first cases were reported city authorities had been informed about the virus spreading but they issued orders to suppress the news for instance on january 18th roughly six weeks after coronavirus started to spread in wuhan they allowed the citys baibuting district to organize its traditional annual mass banquet of the 40000 families attending more than 28000 got infected and more than 560 succumbed to the virus in the later weeks just a few days later more than 5 million people had traveled out of wuhan for the upcoming spring festival just before wuhan imposed lockdown thus spreading covid-19 across other provinces of china and abroad the elevated connectivity of wuhan with other international airports such as singapore japan and thailand facilitated the rapid spread to bordering countries1415 on january 23rd a 3-week lockdown was ordered to the entire hubei province along with some major cities like beijing and shanghai16 outdoor activities were limited with each citizen being permitted to go out for 30 minutes only on every second day17 all transports in and out of the city were prohibited mobile-phone data location from chinese internet giant baidu was used to track peoples moments as well as person to person contacts18 in wuhan where the infection rate was the highest residents were required to measure and report their temperature daily the mild and asymptomatic cases were quarantined in fangcang hospital as well as in public spaces such as stadiums and conference centers which have been repurposed for medical care19 a 1000-bedded hospital was built in a matter of 10 days to take care of patients with coronavirus thanks to all these measures a decline in the number of infected growth rate and an increase in its doubling time from 2 to 4 days was eventually achieved the median daily reproduction number declined from 235 of january 16 to 105 of january 3020 tian et al estimated that the wuhan shutdown slowed the dispersal of infection to other cities by 291 days 95ci 254-329 delaying epidemic growth elsewhere in china21 other chinese cities that early implemented preventive control measures reported 333 fewer cases in the first week of their outbreaks compared with cities that started control later21 the correlation between domestic air traffic and covid-19 spread became weaker following lockdown17 nevertheless a study from italy china and the united states found that the wuhan travel quarantine delayed the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days in mainland china but had a greater effect at the international scale where case export was reduced by nearly 8022 however with all these measures china prevented cases from increasing by 67-fold ie without these measures there would have been 8 million cases by the end of february13 however replicating the chinese model elsewhere turned out to be extremely challenging as the measures implemented in wuhan and the entire hubei province of china far exceeded the classical definition of local confinement lockdown and isolation fig 217 some of the other countries were successful in flattening the curve including singapore taiwan hong kong and south korea one of the key factors in the success of these countries was continuous testing isolation of infected and quarantining of contacts in singapore temperature screening at the airport of all travelers arriving from wuhan was started on january 3rd even before identification of sars-cov-2 sequence aggressive contact tracing and quarantine of contacts of confirmed cases travel advisories and entry restrictions on people who had traveled to china in the preceding 14 days were implemented at a community level people were encouraged to work from home and to record their temperature twice a day to make quarantine less onerous the government offered self-employed people sgd  100 per day respiratory and hand hygiene and social distancing were followed rigorously23 temperature checking in all clinics and provision and use of ppe by medical staff were ordered as compulsory strict visitor controls cohorting of patients with pneumonia or respiratory infection and restriction of movement of patients and doctors between different healthcare institutions were also set up to prevent disease spread across multiple institutions a network of 800 public health preparedness clinics phpcs was activated to enhance the management of respiratory infections in primary care settings all pneumonia cases severely-ill patients in intensive care units deceased people with a possible infectious cause and influenza-like illness ili in primary care clinics were tested1624 since february 7 2020 the country has been in disease outbreak response system condition dorscon orange the second-highest alert signifying more relaxed measures of containment25 besides singapore also taiwan and hong kong were found well prepared before the outbreak thus making a rapid and vigorous response to the first cases closure of places of mass gathering travel restrictions and case detection isolation and contact reducing quarantine of exposed were widely practiced in south korea authorities called for voluntary social distancing and isolation apart from this testing was scaled up aggressively nearly 18000 per day and contact tracing was done through cctv and credit card transactions the general community was also encouraged to inform about infected people16 in contrast countries in europe like italy spain the united kingdom and the united states delayed implementing containment measures and failed in anticipating the impact of the pandemic in their own boundaries italy has recorded the highest number of deaths globally2 before the outbreak was detected the virus had been circulating into the country for at least 4 weeks in just a matter of weeks february 21 to march 22 2020 italy went from the discovery of the first official covid-19 case to a state of complete lockdown26 within this brief period the impact on the country was nothing short of a tsunami the health care system was literally overwhelmed with new pneumonia cases with a considerable number of them in critical conditions in the red zone ie the regions of lombardia and veneto the most hit by the pandemic the situation had become so grim that the risk of treating only those with a better prognosis younger and healthier population to the detriment of older people became almost reality27 the shortage of hospital beds ventilators and health professionals became a concrete threat health professionals from different disciplines including ophthalmology were converted to covid-19 patient care and who came in contact with sars-cov-2 patients were encouraged to work until they show symptoms28 at the social community level there was a delay in the implementation of restrictive measures the lockdown started with places of mass gathering but restaurants and bars were left open for one more week and travel within and outside italy were not restricted a total lockdown was imposed in northern italy the red zone but not in central and southern italy concurrently only on march 10 national lockdown was proclaimed this led to the movement of cases to southern italy and subsequently spreading the infection across the entire country26 one other fact facilitating the diffusion of the virus and the lack of homogeneity in the national response is that the italian health system is decentralized and different regions tried varying policy responses most notably lombardy and veneto two neighboring regions with a similar socioeconomic profile and number of cases tried two different approaches26 veneto tested extensively both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases and proactively traced the potential positive cases if someone tested positive everyone in the family as well as neighbors were tested and if testing kits were unavailable they were asked to self-quarantine whenever possible samples were collected directly from home and processed in the laboratory in contrast lombardy conducted only half of the tests done in veneto and focused more on symptomatic cases there was a limited investment in proactive tracing home care and monitoring and protecting healthcare workers recently the epidemic curve flattened and the number of new cases and deaths stabilized started decreasing only when enormous measures of containment were accomplished social media campaigns movement tracing by the police and closure of all non-essential activities were finally working on the other hand conversion of public places and existing hospitals into intensive care units contributed to the reduction of the fatality rate although the italian experience might have been a teaching example for the other european countries a steep increase in the number of cases has been recorded in spain france and the united kingdom just a few days later like italy the spanish government reacted late to the pandemic on february 19th 2500 valencia soccer fans mingled with 40000 atalanta supporters for a champions league game in bergamo which was described as the gamechanger a week before the shutdown on march 8th several mass events such as sports events political party activities conferences and a massive demonstration for the international womens day took place three days later about 3000 athletic fans flew together for another champions league match in liverpool when the regional government of madrid closed universities and schools it provoked a holiday atmosphere with crowded bars and parks and many people moved to their beach homes29 the poor coordination and the delay in implementation of restrictive measures led an abrupt surge of cases in spain before they enacted the lockdown on march 14 2020 only after lockdown a decline in the number of new cases have been reported fig 3 we expect a steep decline in new cases in 6-8 weeks provided it is vigorously implemented to face the burden of the case boom the government took over all the private healthcare facilities and converted them to covid-19 care due to the shortage of testing kits laboratory testing was done only for patients needing admission for severe acute respiratory infections sari and the essential service personnel such as health workers in those departments16 in the united states us there was a lack of coordination in the national response with an unclear message from the us president with often a variance with information from the us national institutes of health nih and the centers for disease control cdc early and severe outbreaks in washington state and new york state prompted the six counties in the san francisco bay area to impose stay-at-home orders on march 17th 2020 in response to initial cases two days later the entire state of california was placed under these orders to flatten the curve of new severe cases the 50 us states and many localities within them individually imposed measures ranging from tight provisions as in california to more lenient approaches such as bans on gatherings and curfews there was no consistent national policy this chaotic pattern included a wide variation in travel restrictions and even quarantines for travelers from one state to another and travel restrictions30 even in the absence of enforced restrictions social distancing was emphasized and those feeling ill were urged to stay home early in the epidemic policy on investigating contacts and quarantining them varied from city to city for example in denver colorado when there were 49 confirmed cases on march 19 health officials reached out to people who might have been exposed only if they were elderly or had underlying health conditions31 health departments in at least two counties in california  sacramento and placer counties  decided not to quarantine contacts who did not show symptoms despite growing evidence that asymptomatic carriers might transmit sars-cov-231 in seattle washington the health department was no longer routinely investigating contacts because cases were proliferating rapidly and contact tracing was labor-intensive31 there was also an issue with testing due to a shortage of testing kits163233 if the country had accurately tracked the spread of the virus hospitals would have had the opportunity to be prepared and executed their pandemic plans effectively and on time suddenly the system was faced with a virus that had been left to spread untracked through communities around the country34 new york country reported at least 83712 total positive cases of covid-19 and more than 1941 related deaths on april 2nd 2020 making it the state with the most us coronavirus cases new york city hospitals were straining under the onslaught of novel coronavirus cases worsened by a shortage of ppe such as gloves gowns and masks and limited availability of ventilators and intensive care beds27 this stress on the us healthcare system is likely to increase as cases are projected to peak in some areas during mid-april to late-april and some thereafter in fact to track the virus citizen crowd-sourcing methods have been devised including wwwcovidnearyoucom which enables anyone to view the reported healthillness of residents aggregated by postal zip code among the middle-income countries iran was the worst hit the iranian government was aware of the outbreak quite early but only little measures were applied to stop it the connections between iran and china were not interrupted until january 31st 2020 in the attempt to maintain strong diplomatic ties35 however the iranian airlines continued their flights between the two countries up to february 23 202035 the outbreak was officially acknowledged following only on february 19 2020 letting the disease spread in the preceding weeks35 iran did not impede the arrangements for the parliamentary elections scheduled on february 21st35 furthermore it also resisted quarantine measures the deputy health minister iraj harirchi publicly opposed it saying quarantines belong to before world war i for diseases like plague and cholera and even chinese are not satisfied with the quarantine they had put in place35 ironically he later tested positive for coronavirus in summary iran lost multiple opportunities to respond to their worst public health crisis35 there were also issues related to a lack of transparency in their reports1636 a few data on the impact of traveler screening lockdown travel restriction and quarantine is available these days as the results of these measures have been analyzed only in these days37 however compared to travel restrictions improved detection isolation of cases and social distancing are likely to have a greater impact on the containment of the outbreak social distancing also needs to be continued for several months to have a lasting impact it has been predicted that by reducing the human to human contact by 90 we can stop the epidemic38 countries that have implemented social distancing earlier had a greater doubling time south korea singapore japan hong kong as compared to countries that did not us france italy39 the use of face masks by everyone is still controversial though who does not recommend use by everyone other agencies do recommend it4041 in india the first case of covid-19 was reported on january 30th 2020 followed by two similar cases on february 2nd and 3rd all three had a travel history to wuhan china a month later on march 2nd two new cases were reported  one each from new delhi and hyderabad a sharp increase in numbers then followed to contain the spread the ministry of health and family welfare mohfw immediately took action and issued a travel advisory as travel restrictions had previously demonstrated efficacious on outbreaks of sars ebola and bubonic plague all international travelers entering the country were asked to self-quarantine for 14 days all travel visas to other countries were canceled until april 15th 2020 all the states were asked to invoke the epidemic disease act which allowed officials to quarantine suspected cases and close down public places an intensive campaign was rolled out and guidelines were developed for personal hygiene surveillance contact tracing quarantine diagnosis laboratory tests and management people were advised not to visit farms live animal markets or places where animals are slaughtered and to avoid mass gatherings all the health care facilities were asked to stop regular out-patient and in-patient services and to continue with solely emergency services doctors were encouraged to use telemedicine services arogya setu app was also launched to connect essential health services with people of india to fight against covid-19 this app will reach out and inform the users of the risk best practice and relevant advisories pertaining to containment of covid-19 amenities like hotels colleges railway train coaches etc were converted into quarantine facilities and large public places as stadiums were converted into isolation wards to handle an anticipated increased number of cases some of the states converted existing hospitals to exclusively handle covid-19 patients on march 22nd prime minister narendra modi initiated the lockdown process with a 14-hour janta curfew followed by lockdown in 75 covid-19 affected districts and a nationwide lockdown for the 3 weeks a containment plan involving the state and twenty ministries was set up a round-the-clock control room was set up at the headquarters of the general director of health service dghs to address the virus-related queries the countries of the south asian association for regional cooperation saarc were invited to fight jointly against this pandemic and 10 million us dollars were allocated for saarc countries a huge evacuation program of many indian nationals was done from the covid-19 affected areas all the measures implemented in india are revealing efficiency in flattening the curve nevertheless a small effort has been addressed to the identification of asymptomatic and mild cases this might have detrimental effects on the indian economy in the long term a long duration of the lockdown might be more devastating in india than in wealthier countries like the united kingdom or australia and it could result in serious economic damage increased hunger and poverty and it might reduce the populations resilience to handle the infection therefore if these cases remain unidentified there is a possibility of another peak of covid-19 cases once the lockdown is lifted and indias healthcare system might be not able to handle it properly hence moving ahead india should have staggered exit from the lockdown especially in the covid-19 hotspot areas and use this lockdown period to screen and identify as many cases as possible isolate them and quarantine their contacts as compared to other countries worldwide a very low number of tests have been run in india fig 4 with the highest number done in kerala table 1 testing is done in 122 government labs and 44 private laboratories however it is likely to increase in the near future42 at the time this article is being written 158 districts in india have recorded at least one covid-19 case42 hence this opportunity should be taken to screen the high-risk areas in these districts using the mid-level personnel both from the government and private sectors at the same time the capacity for rapid diagnostic testing at the primary level should be implemented to identify cases earlier and limit the transmission this period should be also utilized for producing a large supply of ppe for the safety of health care workers and increasing the number of available ventilators in case the outbreak worsens in conclusion india and the world have a long legacy of successful efforts to prevent or cure widespread infections recalling the successful smallpox eradication campaign of the 1970s we are reminded of the pivotal role of leadership and sound management to stop the killer disease43 hence india has the opportunity to reverse disease predictions with stringent containment measures social distancing increasing case detection isolation and quarantining the contacts efforts should be made to enlist community support and ownership so containment measures do not depend exclusively on administrative measures critical situations like a mass exodus of laborers from the major cities to the rural areas as well as mass gatherings like nizamuddin markaz event which happened recently should be avoided as the impact of covid-19 is not limited to human infection and death other associated issues should be addressed like social discrimination for instance healthcare workers are increasingly looked at as someone who can spread the virus in the community furthermore asian americans have been experiencing a rising number of episodes of violence and hate after us president made hurtful and misleading comments as china is to blame and calling covid-19 the chinese virus the impact of covid has been also affecting sectors like entertainment tourism restaurants and the travel industry with a tremendous escalation of job losses44 disrupted supply chain and declining stock markets are the final consequences of these social changes thus hitting the global economy44 finally a greater incidence of panic disorder anxiety depression and other psychosocial issues has been reported45 looking into the near future containing the covid-19 epidemic is likely to take several months public health interventions will be directed towards social distancing and improving hygienic practices these interventions will be effective in delaying the onset of wide community transmission reducing peak incidence and its impact on public services5 testing contact tracing isolation of infected and precautionary self-isolation of contacts is critical in reducing the number of new cases46 an exceptionally high degree of understanding in the population and acceptance of these measures is also critical46 these interventions have to be balanced with getting back to normal life and everyday activities to the best extent possible until a reversing the trajectory of the pandemic is traced47 a little knowledge is available so far on alternate routes of transmission namely via sewage contaminated water or air conditioning systems it is also poorly known if those who have recovered from sars-cov-2 infection would be protected from reinfection but evidence to confirm this is yet to be generated antibody testing has to be implemented on a large scale to identify who is already immune to the virus the effect of temperature season and humidity on covid-19 also has an impact on the covid-19 outbreak however results from other parts of the world are awaited4849 multiple trials are currently underway to develop novel treatment options as well as a vaccine to treat the respiratory syndrome but results are still awaited50 moreover months are needed before a vaccine is developed and approved even though herd immunity develops over time vulnerable groups as the healthcare workforce and elderly people should still be preserved smart working and staggered shifts may have to be adopted to mitigate covid-19 transmission in the future digital didactic and online learning can be protracted for months telemedicine and in particular teleophthalmology needs to be implemented also in the future infectious diseases will be probably included amongst the most important health hazards along with anti-microbial resistance51 in addition timely identification efficient diagnosis rapid isolation and clinical management would remain in the forefront51 one of the last concerns regards the second wave of covid-19 outbreak asian countries and cities that seemed to have brought the coronavirus epidemic under control are suddenly tightening their borders and imposing stricter containment measures fearful about new imported infections hong kong suddenly saw new cases spike as high as 65 in one day and ordered a new closure of non-essential activities in japan where infections have remained relatively controlled cases started to rise in march as travelers returned in the home country new cases of local transmission have also been detected similarly singapore again announced one-month lockdown in view of increased local transmission this portends a worrisome sign for the united states europe india and the rest of the world regarding the second wave of the virus spreading once the restrictive measures are relieved52 nil there are no conflicts of interest  covid-19 the forgotten priorities of the pandemic cristina mesa vieira oscar franco h carlos gmez restrepo thomas abel   by the end of march 2020 more than three-quarters of a million people had been diagnosed with covid-19 and more than 39 000 had died 1 even though the disease was declared a pandemic by the world health organization who only earlierthat month the pandemic has swiftly reached and affected all continents and countries around the globe measures taken to reduce the rapid spread of the sars-cov-2 virus 2 have extended the impact of the pandemic on health systems economies and society everywhere in the world no treatment for covid-19 exists and a vaccine will not be available in less than 18 months in an optimistic scenario nonpharmacological practices such as covering the mouth and nose when coughingsneezing frequent handwashing and maintaining spatial separation between persons can only retard the spread of the virus and mitigate the burden of the disease the strategies of social distancing include closure of educational institutions and workplaces cancellation of mass gatherings isolation of suspected or confirmed cases quarantine of persons in contact with confirmed cases stay-at-home recommendations and even mandatory quarantine in some cities and residential areas 3 these and further measures have been implemented especially to protect populations at higher risk the elderly and people with comorbidities such as cancer hypertension diabetes and cardiovascular disease governmental interventions have aimed above all else as they should at the protection of physical health however social distancing seeds the spread of misinformation and can have profound consequences for psychological wellbeing in vulnerable populations 4 see fig 1
 social distancing can diminish the wellbeing of not just those thought to be members of at-risk populations it can reduce the wellbeing of anyone experiencing confinement even in small degrees and all humankind in general given the dire situation posed by this pandemic some experts have recommended changing the term social distancing to spatial distancing because of social distancing can be misleading 5 spatial distancing more correctly connotes maintaining the physical distance from others that the use of social distancing intends to promote but proper adherence to spatial distancing or isolation can have the side-effect of a social distancing that can have unfortunate consequences for psychological wellbeing a study conducted during the epidemic in january among over 17 000 users of weibo  one of the most popular social networks in china - found differences in the expression of emotions among its users from which inferences about users psychological states may be drawn in a two-week period of social distancing the number of posts talking about depression anxiety and indignation increased while the expression of positive emotions decreased significantly 6 social interaction can still take place using the internet mobile phones and other technological devices in challenging times the value of social capital rather than being neglected should be highlighted misinformation not only inheres in the inaccuracy of information it can emerge from the torrent of information coming from non-experts and commercially-driven interests misinformation may lead to uncertainty that is increased by the novelty of the virus to which we are being exposed this state of uncertainty often in combination with mobility restrictions and isolation increases the risk of feelings of insecurity anxiety and a general emotional tension all of which may impair our quality of life fear arising from the excess or unreliability of information about disease can lead to erratic behaviour trigger the onset of psychiatric disorders and even increase rates of suicide 7 the daily flood of often contradictory information has led to panic buying of supplies that are unnecessary under conditions of spatial or social distancing and to the misinterpretation of health care recommendations misinformation on the other hand can also create a false sense of reassurance statements underestimating the severity of the disease eg it is just a flu and downplaying the risk that young populations run eg it only kills old people could have contributed greatly to the spread of the disease and its rapid progression flawed communication is not confined to the media researchers academia and policymakers are disconnected from each other both recommendations and measures already adopted are not being coordinated producing scientific evidence takes time but preventive measures often have to be taken before science can yield all the answers moreover research findings are written using technical insider terminology and usually published in english this impairs policy-making everywhere but especially in non-english-speaking countries the situation in low- and middle-income countries lmic could be even worse some countries in latin america have younger populations than those in europe and some asian countries which is an advantage in terms of biological resistance against the coronavirus but most of these countries have weaker health systems and socioeconomic conditions that can exacerbate consequences of the pandemic and increase social and health inequalities indigenous populations homeless people populations of lower socioeconomic status migrants and people in prison or detention bear high burdens caused by of high-risk environmental exposures the inaccessibility of both accurate information and timely healthcare services and myriad demographic and psychosocial conditions that impose poor health upon them the largest proportions of indigenous populations live in lmic they are frequently marginalised do not live in big urban centres and have limited access to health care services beliefs about wellbeing and health can also influence how they seek medical attention this poses challenges for health systems based on or oriented towards typical european and north american norms and values language barriers can intervene between the healthcare providers and indigenous people whose lifestyles foods physical activities and hygienic practices also vary the immune profile of indigenous populations can also differ from those of the majority populations living in the same region response to a new virus and disease may therefore be unexpected and even deadlier among such minority groups a high proportion of homeless persons have chronic physical and mental disorders these persons can be even more overlooked once healthcare services are allocated almost exclusively to fighting the covid-19 pandemic detection of cases and prevention of disease in a transient population are more difficult yet worse is that many countries lack the infrastructure and resources to shelter and assume the care of homeless persons in an eventual quarantine 8 the situations of imprisoned populations or people living in detention centres are similar the spread of the coronavirus will be unimpeded in both overcrowded prisons and detention centres chronic diseases are more prevalent and mortality rates are higher in prisons in many states just as it is for the homeless the provision of healthcare services for incarcerated or detained persons is deficient in centres in which the workers might not be prepared for the outbreak of an epidemic 9 the pandemic is already exacerbating the precarious situation of migrants refugees and asylum seekers now that most countries have closed their borders people fleeing their countries due to war and insecurity are struggling to find shelter migrants have poor access to healthcare services and a large proportion of them do not even have access to clean and safe water colombia has almost 6 million internally displaced personas and in the last few years approximately 2 million venezuelans have migrated into the country the majority of this migrant population lack adequate housing healthcare and social support they are also victims of xenophobia and discrimination being accused of spreading the covid-19 in the country 10 on the frontline of the epidemic stand healthcare professionals hcp whose workload is increased by the pandemic as they have to work with limited medical resources they are themselves highly exposed to infection these factors in addition to the frustration of not being supported by a strong health care system and the fear of infecting people around them increase the prevalence of symptoms of stress depression and anxiety disorders with long-term consequences as was seen during the sars epidemic in 2003 11 a study of the covid-19 epidemic in hubei china conducted among 493 physicians and 764 nurses found that around half of them showed symptoms of depression and anxiety many of the participants also reported insomnia and 70  psychological distress women and nurses  who in great proportion were the first responders - were more affected it is important to point out that the consequences of working under stressful conditions are not confined to hcp stressful conditions also compromise their performance in caring for patients 12 the elderly who are the main target group of most of the policies of social distancing due to their high risk of presenting complications from covid-19 need stronger psychosocial support because so many live in permanent isolation and do not have social networks and have limited social activities 1314 persons with psychiatric disorders face similar situations because policies of social distancing can worsen their symptoms large families that are financially constrained and live in poor housing conditions are very common in lmic the combination of confinement and isolation increases the risk of interpersonal conflict in families which in turn puts children and women at higher risk of domestic violence for as long as the stay-at-home measures last 15 authorities in china have warned families about the consequences of spending too much time together sharing the same space appointments to file for divorce rose significantly in march after couples had been under the stay-at-home order for over a month experts argue that impulsive decisions caused by daily conflict can lead to divorce 16 recently human rights watch called for the protection of the rights of persons who live with disabilities who constantly deal with barriers that impair their access to healthcare services they must receive reliable information on the pandemic and support to adopt preventive strategies 17 although a certain level of stress is practically unavoidable when facing dramatic circumstances such as those currently unfolding wellbeing is a key concept to support and facilitate mental health caring for the wellbeing of individuals is not limited to preventing the incidence of mental health disorders the onset of symptoms of stress and other psychiatric disorders can affect the immune system furthermore reduction in the expression of positive emotions and the loss of life satisfaction is associated with higher levels of inflammation which increases the risk of contracting disease 18 for this reason experts are making recommendations that can promote mental health and overall wellbeing during confinement it is important to be creative in the ways we maintain meaningful affective and social links strategies for doing this can be not only technological very vulnerable populations such as elderly persons in nursing homes may not have wide access to the internet and electronic devices affording certain kinds of social support community action to alleviate the psychological impact of social isolation is thus even of greater importance in spite of the imposition of strict confinement routines nursing homes could risk continuing relatively safe social activities among the elderly to avoid the much greater risk of impairing the overall state of the residents health to reduce anxiety caused by overexposure to news experts advise that people update themselves on the current situation no more than twice a day and rely only upon mainstream sources with reliable access to official information the access of children and minors to the news and mobile devices should be restricted scientifically knowledgeable source are opening up accounts on social media so that reliable information which counters the plethora of fake news reaches more people 19 we must emphasize that much remains uncertain about the science and management of covid-19 and the virus that causes the disease this will remain the case for some time and reliable reporting of what we learn should not misrepresent the evolving and provisional state of our knowledge to reduce misinformation among vulnerable populations news broadcasts should be more inclusive add languages like sign language and use diverse channels that include television radio newspapers mobile apps and landlines information should be communicated in simple language that is understandable by everyone no matter his or her educational level 17 instead of using complex terms and neologisms such as social distancing experts recommend giving specific advice for example you should go to the supermarket only once a week once you are there avoid getting too close to the others states can also collaborate with non-governmental organizations to promote lifestyle changes and establish initiatives that help the most vulnerable populations regarding the provision of specialised services healthcare systems should explore the use of telemedicine to protect mental health professionals from getting infected improve the delivery of mental health services and ensure access to the internet and other means of communication by vulnerable populations 20 some countries are already offering psychological assistance via the internet or telephone and using mobile apps to provide counselling or treatment amid the covid-19 crisis 12 hcp should also be trained in psychosocial skills to cope with stress and receive practical training on surveillance and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders 19 finally it is worth considering that etymologically the word pandemic derives from pan all and demos people greek doctors used this term to refer to that which affects the entire population and that is precisely the message of this article we call upon hcp public health specialists academics researchers and policy-makers to engage in communitarian strategies that favour the wellbeing of the population - and especially those who are so often overlooked all of us share responsibility independent of the state your wellbeing is our wellbeing only through cooperation and solidarity will long-term solutions to pandemic disease and its consequences be achieved cristina mesa vieira was responsible for

70 of the residents of new york state use such masks in public consistently nationwide a compliance of at least 80 will be required using such masks the use of low efficacy masks such as cloth masks

the extended lockdowns caused by the pandemic online communities are crucial for people to access information and share experiences in particular two new communities have emerged on reddit rchinaflu and rcoronavirus by studying activities and users in these two communities we provide a characterization of peoples responses to covid-19 on reddit first we find that user activity peaks around march 17 when the world health organization who announced covid-19 as a pandemic shortly after that the activity levels of both communities have been declining week by week we further illustrate the central role of these two communities in the emergence of covid-related communities second we study the differences between these two communities rcoronavirus is recommended as the official community for covid-19 on reddit while rchinaflu adopts a loose moderation practice as a result we observe that these two communities are gradually growing apart and more extremism is being found in rchinaflu finally we examine the spillover effect of the covid-19 pandemic on user activity across the entire reddit platform our results show significant changes in user activities outside covid-related communities in subreddits related to finance food and countriescities user activity is recovering to the pre-pandemic level in late april and may as countries reopen but subreddits related to travel and sports remain highly impacted and show lower activity levels than the pre-pandemic period our work highlights the strength of reddit as a source for understanding public reactions to covid-19 and the importance of content moderation on the internet during a pandemic  in december 2019 a novel coronavirus strain sars-cov-2 emerged in the city of wuhan china the disease quickly spread all over the world and led the world health organization who to declare a pandemic 63  by the end of may 2020 188 countriesregions reported over 62 million positive cases and 372037 deaths 14  the pandemic is not only exhausting public health resources but also causing social and economic disruption at an unprecedented speed and scale governments around the globe have implemented a series of protective measures such as lockdowns social distancing travel bans and mask-wearing to contain the spread of the disease while medical experts are rushing to treat covid-19 patients and develop vaccines social media has been critical for people in accessing information and sharing experiences during the pandemic take reddit as an example user-created subreddits dedicated to discussing the coronavirus have popped up and attracted millions of subscribers since the beginning of the outbreak top posts on these subreddits include ama ask me anything with bill gates medical experts and politicians by the end of may 2020 there are over four hundred coronavirus subreddits on the platform including two major general discussion communities rchinaflu and rcoronavirus others may focus on a specific region such as rcanadacoronavirus rcoronavirusca and rcoronavirusnewyork or a specific topic such as rcoronavirusrecession rcoronavirusmemes and rcovid19support the platform has become one of the most comprehensive and up-to-date sources of information for this constantly developing crisis besides information sharing social media also provides regular people a sense of normalcy during these challenging times it can serve as an antidote to physical isolation by allowing people to seek possible job opportunities keep up with education and entertain when outside forces such as covid-19 largely break in-person contact online communication provides an urgently-needed remedy for connecting the world however the impact of social media during this pandemic is not always positive the ubiquity of social media has made it easy to create and spread covid-19 falsehoods the worlds largest social media companies are reportedly under immense pressure to crack down on coronavirus misinformation that has been spread across their platforms 54  on rcoronavirus reddits official covid-19 community a team of more than 60 content moderators including researchers of infectious diseases virologists computer scientists doctors and nurses are spending hours daily removing misinformation trolls and discussions 53  however despite the joint effort on content moderation from mainstream social media platforms 54  nearly two-thirds of americans reported that they had seen news and information about the disease that is wholly made up 4  many of these misinformation narratives originally surfaced from unregulated platforms including gab and 4chan 74 and under-moderated spaces such as rwuhanflu and rcoronavirusconspiracy 18  in this work to characterize public responses to covid-19 on social media we construct a largescale dataset of two reddit communities that are dedicated to covid-19 discussions rchinaflu and rcoronavirus the dataset contains 312k posts 70m comments and 573k users we choose reddit as our testbed because 1 massive numbers of people turn to reddit for the latest updates about covid-19 take the official community rcoronavirus as an example it has become the fastest-growing subreddit on the entire platform with over 21 million subscribers after four months of its creation 2 health professionals 68  essential workers 72  and recovered patients 39 are reportedly using reddit as a primary source to share stories and information and 3 reddit is driven by communities and each community has its own moderation rules in comparison the content regulation policies on twitter and facebook are relatively vague organization and highlights we first describe the background research questions and hypotheses then we provide an overview of covid-related subreddits and introduce the dataset that we collected for this study we also demonstrate how user activity is connected with the important dates of this pandemic after that we investigate three research questions in the rest of the paper first we provide an exploratory analysis to understand how coronavirus-related subreddits have emerged during this pandemic by investigating the founders of the two earliest covid-19 communities rchinaflu and rcoronavirus we find that users who have paid attention to the disease from the beginning are news readers conspiracy theorists and survivalists we have also built a genealogy graph of covid-related communities and have found rchinaflu and rcoronavirus to be parents of many other subreddits related to second we compare the differences between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus and how these differences relate to moderation practices implemented in these two communities our results show that the language distance between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus decreased in early february and then started to increase over time after the moderation practices diverged rchinaflu users pay much more attention to topics related to china and the chinese government while rcoronavirus users spend more time discussing the urgency and seriousness of the pandemic furthermore rchinaflu has more racist behavior and has a higher overlap with extreme communities compared with rcoronavirus intriguingly many of these differences observed in our study are not apparent until different moderation practices have been implemented by the platform third we turn our focus to the entire reddit platform and examine how people adjust their activity in response to the pandemic as a proxy of peoples lives during the pandemic we show that users who are active in coronavirus-related subreddits also have had a surge of activity in non-coronavirus subreddits during this pandemic in addition we explore the change of user activity in different categories of online communities we find significant changes in most of the categories in communities related to finance food and countriescities user activity has recovered to the pre-pandemic level in late april and may as countries reopen but communities related to travel and sports remain highly impacted and show lower activity levels than before the pandemic finally we offer concluding discussions our work develops a framework for characterizing disaster responses in online discussion forums the results in our work highlight the strength of reddit as a source for understanding public reactions to covid-19 and examining the spillover effect on user activity across different categories additionally our work provides clear evidence that social media may not be neutral in the middle of an international crisis proactive content moderation is associated with preventing the dissemination of racism and conspiracy theories given the dynamic nature of the covid-19 pandemic real-time tracking of public response is critical posts and comments in covid-related subreddits provide a valuable resource for characterizing the public response this section reviews three areas that are most relevant to our work community genealogy and highly related communities the effect of moderation practice and crisis informaticssociology of disaster when social media platforms give users the freedom to form interest groups a series of highly related communities can emerge for example during the 2016 election a battery of trump-related communities emerged on reddit such as rthedonald raskthedonald and rasktrumpsupporters the creation development and lifecycle of highly related communities have drawn considerable interest in the research community the first line of work compares the characteristics of highly related communities hessel et al 21 investigate the interactions between highly related reddit communities and identify patterns of affixes being used in their names the work by zhang et al 77 focuses on online nba fan communities and analyzes how fans of different teams react to team performance the second line of research studies the impact of membership overlap between highly related communities haiyi zhu robert kraut and collaborators investigate shared membership in online communities on a variety of platforms and propose strategies for long-term community survival 30 79 80 81  the final line provides a global overview of how users move through the space of communities and how new communities emerge from the old ones for example tan and lee 61 use several temporal features across communities to predict users activity levels and departure from reddit to visualize the process of how new communities develop from old ones tan 59 proposes a computational approach for building genealogy graphs between communities as the covid-19 pandemic evolves over four hundred coronavirus-related subreddits have popped up besides rchinaflu and rcoronavirus there are region-specific subreddits such as rcoronavirusuk rcoronavirusca and rcoronavirusnewyork there are also subreddits focusing on a certain aspect of the pandemic such as rcoronavirusmemes rcoronavirusrecession and rcovid19positive following the rise of these subreddits we formulate our first research question as follows rq1 how do coronavirus-related communities emerge during the covid-19 pandemic the effect of moderation practice on online platforms that invite users to post comments a moderation mechanism involves the monitor of various content including written opinions reviews videos and pictures according to a pre-determined set of rules and regulations it may also be under external requirements like removing content that violates local national and international laws 71  content moderation is critical in the development of a healthy environment as it protects users from being harmed and ensures the quality of content 23-25 30 55  lack of such regulation can expose users to unpleasant information and exhaust their limited attention in a recent example rworldpolitics is overwhelmed with nsfw not safe for work posts featuring porn pictures as moderators allow for all sorts of inappropriate content to be submitted 13  there has been an impressive body of research to understand the effect of moderation for example jhaver et al 23 25 employ survey-and platform-based approaches and find that users who receive explanations for content removal are more likely to post again in the future they further examine the role that automoderators play in content moderation and identify a list of advantages and challenges 24  juneja et al 28 reveal the lack of transparency in moderation practices on reddit which impede moderators ability to be fair the study by phadke and mitra 47 portray cross-platform efforts by online hate groups for recruitment and growing influence due to the lack of censorship and moderation from the technical perspective various approaches have been proposed to improve the performance of moderation such as tagging 75  summarization 76  distributed moderation 32  and crowdsourcing 33 37  in our work rchinaflu and rcoronavirus provide a natural experiment for examining how moderation practice shapes online communities both of these two communities are covid-19 centric which indicates similar discussion topics broadly however rchinaflu allows more relaxed discussions while rcoronavirus implements strict moderation rules  figure 1  this observation motivates us to study the difference between these two subreddits rq2 how do rchinaflu and rcoronavirus differ during the covid-19 pandemic earlier studies find that lack of effective moderation may produce a large amount of low-quality content in the online space such as conspiracy theories racist content and misinformation 23 24 30 73  for example npr cnn reuters and other news sites eliminate their online comment section due to inappropriate content 34  the well-known unregulated website 4chanorg is responsible for some of the largest hoaxes conspiracy theories cyberbullying incidents and internet pranks of the past few years 42  therefore we formulate our first hypothesis as follows h1 due to the loose moderation practice rchinaflu will have more conspiratorial discussions and racist behavior than rcoronavirus online communities are in constant flux 11  new members who join a community need to adapt to existing community norms and old members who do not like the trajectory of the development will depart given the lack of restriction in rchinaflu extreme users may be more likely to join rchinaflu and remain active there meanwhile members who are looking for serious discussions about the pandemic may leave accordingly we expect rchinaflu to attract more users from extreme communities than rcoronavirus h2 rchinaflu has a higher overlap with extreme communities than rcoronavirus according to a 2018 united nations review the frequency of disasters is on the rise globally 15  disaster events and their economic impacts are trending topics in computational social sciences in the early days of crisis informatics research qualitative methods such as descriptive surveys and interviews were the main source of data collection 44 45 57  recently following the advancement of the internet and mobile technology social media has played a critical role in the flow of public information a growing percentage of citizens frequently turn to these platforms for emergency updates 31 50  to effectively analyze information on mass media computational approaches have been widely adopted in crisis informatics for example vieweg et al 67 analyze public responses to two disaster events the red river floods and the oklahoma grassfires using twitter communications hagen et al 17 propose a network analysis approach to identify a number of distinct communities and influential actors using zika-related tweets stewart and wilson 56 characterize how citizens utilize social media to redistribute emergency updates and connect with family and friends during hurricane sandy the covid-19 pandemic has caused catastrophic social and economic disruption around the globe as reported by the international monetary fund the world is going through the worst global recession since the great depression in the 1930s 16  the pandemic has led to cancellation or postponement of school religious political and sporting events and supply shortages exacerbated by panic purchasing 5 22 43  during the pandemic social media platforms such as twitter and reddit have not only become primary sources of information but also serve as destinations for companionship and entertainment purposes as a result users activity on reddit may reflect how their normal life is being affected additionally when countries began phased reopenings in late april and may would users activity on reddit return to the pre-pandemic norm rq3 how do people change their activity during the pandemic over time and how does it relate to their membership in rchinaflu and rcoronavirus as the stay-at-home order begins people have more time to tune into social media to connect with friends family and like-minded individuals for socialization and emotional support several major social media platforms have observed traffic escalation 29 58 62  we expect the increment happens not only to coronavirus-related subreddits but also to non-coronavirus subreddits we propose the third hypothesis as follows h3 people who are active in coronavirus-related subreddits also have a surge of activity in non-coronavirus subreddits during the covid-19 pandemic more importantly the user activity on different categories of online communities can be a direct reflection of the socio-economic effects of covid-19 on daily life for example as the unemployment rate keeps soaring people who lost jobs may check economy-related communities more often some sports fans may stop checking sports-related communities as most sporting events are suspended in a recent survey review nicola et al 43 summarize the effect of covid-19 on individual aspects of the world economy in tertiary sectors which are divided into eight categories education finance healthcare travel housing sports technology and food with this list we find subreddits that are highly relevant to each category based on the wiki page of rlistofsubreddits 1  this page provides a summary of various kinds of popular subreddits we do not find a popular subreddit related to housing or healthcare on this page thus these two categories are removed we also add three additional categories that are specific to the reddit culture humor tvmovie and countriescities all these three categories attract a vast audience on the reddit platform for example rfunny is one of the largest subreddits with more than 30 million subscribers 2 rtv and rmovies each has more than 15 million subscribers additionally almost all major countriescities can find their corresponding subreddits 3 social distancing quarantine travel restrictions and stay-at-home order have led to a reduced out-home activity across many categories in an attempt to control the spread of the disease most governments around the world have temporarily closed educational institutions 65  more than 90 of the people worldwide live in countries with travel restrictions 10  many influential sports leagues have postponed or canceled sporting events 70  food and restaurants have been forced to close or only take carry-out orders 7  therefore we hypothesize subreddits related to out-home activities to draw less attention during the pandemic h4a for categories in which events are mostly out-home and mobile users will show less interest in corresponding subreddits such categories include education travel sports and food while much out-home activity is disrupted people are finding creative ways to study work connect and entertain at home online technology platforms become our best chance of staying together and enduring difficult times events that can be conducted on the internet may have a unique advantage during the covid-19 outbreak h4b for categories in which events are mostly online or related to stay-at-home and work-fromhome their subreddits will have a surge of activity such categories include finance technology countriescities tvmovie and humor our main dataset is drawn from reddit 4 a community-driven forum for discussion news consumption and content rating it was founded in 2005 and has become the 21st most popular websites in the world in may 2020 1  there are tens of thousands of communities known as subreddits on reddit dedicated to a wide variety of topics users can submit comment on upvote and downvote content in each subreddit since the outburst of covid-19 in late january 2020 a series of covid-related communities have emerged and drawn substantial public attention in this study we focus on two communities posts comments users table 1  dataset statistics here users refers to the number of unique users who postedcommented in rchinaflu and rcoronavirus respectively a reddit makes rcoronavirus the official community for covid-related updates b reddit allows more relaxed discussions in rchinaflu rchinaflu 5 and rcoronavirus 6 which are dedicated to covid-related information from the very beginning of this global pandemic rchinaflu was founded on january 20th 2020 when news about the first breakout of covid-19 emerged in wuhan china rcoronavirus was founded on may 3rd 2013 but remained inactive most of the time the first post in rcoronavirus since 2017 is about covid-19 on january 20th 2020 we collect all the posts and comments submitted to these two subreddits from january 20th to may 24th in 2020 from pushshiftio 8  table 1 gives a summary of the statistics about these two subreddits on february 17th the reddit platform has decided to make rcoronavirus the official community for covid-related updates on the website users who search for covid-related keywords have been recommended to check out rcoronavirus figure 1a  since then the subreddit is described as the place for high-quality discussions all the posts and comments submitted are strictly moderated meanwhile the platform allows more relaxed discussions in rchinaflu figure 1b  this policy shift is reflected by user activity in these two subreddits as illustrated in figure 2  the weekly number of posts and comments in these two communities are at a similar level before the february 5 on the front page of rchinaflu httpswwwredditcomrchinaflu it explains that the name rchinaflu was created at a time when sars-cov-2 had not been named and was only affecting china subreddit names cannot be changed after they are created  6 httpswwwredditcomtcoronavirus figure 2a and figure 2b shows the number of posts and comments per week respectively in rchinaflu and rcoronavirus before the february 17th announcement user activity is at a similar level between these two subreddits after the announcement rcoronavirus becomes much more popular than rchinaflu the overall user activity starts declining in both subreddits around march 9th it may be due to peoples fatigue of covid-related topics 17th announcement after that rcoronavirus has become much more popular than rchinaflu over time on march 11th the world health organization declared covid-19 as a global pandemic 63  user activity in rcoronavirus peaks at that week interestingly after that week user activity keeps dropping it may be due to peoples fatigue of covid-related topics according to a study released by the pew research center at the end of april 71 of americans say they need to take breaks from news about the coronavirus and 43 say they feel worse emotionally as a result of following the news 4  in comparison the posting activity in rchinaflu shows a similar trend and the comment activity starts to go down even earlier from the week of february 24th to understand how covid-related subreddits emerge from rchinaflu and rcoronavirus we also collect posts and comments from a set of coronavirus-related subreddits we use two ways to search for popular coronavirus-related subreddits the first set of subreddits are identified at the sidebar of rcoronavirus we also find all subreddits whose names start with covid or coronavirus after combining these two sets of coronavirus-related subreddits we rank them based on their total number of comments and select the top-7 regional-specific subreddits and top-7 general related subreddits these 16 subreddits will be used for visualizing the genealogy graph between in figure 5  for each of these subreddits we collect its entire posting and commenting history from the creation date to may 24th 2020 we will share all our processed data and code upon publication we start with an exploratory analysis to understand how coronavirus-related communities emerge during this pandemic we first examine the weekly overlap and common news articles between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus to understand the composition of these two communities second we look at the founders of these two subreddits and check which communities they came from before joining rchinaflu and rcoronavirus respectively finally we characterize the genealogy figure 3a shows the weekly overlap between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus the overlap is measure by the proportion of users who are active in both communities figure 3b shows the weekly proportion of common urls that are posted in both rchinaflu and rcoronavirus graph of covid-related subreddits to get a sense of how other coronavirus-related subreddits emerge from rchinaflu and rcoronavirus our results show that users who pay attention to the disease from the beginning are news readers conspiracy theorists and survivalists rchinaflu and rcoronavirus are indeed parents of many covid-related subreddits but the separation of membership between these two communities is increasing over time the weekly overlap between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus figure 3a shows the weekly overlap between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus the overlap is measured by the proportion of users in one community that are also active in the other community in the same week around the week of march 2nd more than 40 of rchinaflu users are also active in rcoronavirus after that week the overlap keeps going down over time this trend indicates that the separation between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus widens as the pandemic develops we also examine the weekly proportion of news articles shared in both communities we define a news article to be shared by both communities by finding a pair of posts one from rchinaflu one from rcoronavirus which have the exact same url linking to the same news article figure 3b illustrates that an increasing proportion of news articles posted in rchinaflu are also submitted to rcoronavirus in contrast rcoronavirus covers more diverse covid-19 stories as around 90 of its news articles are not shared in rchinaflu to understand where the founders of rchinaflu and rcoronavirus came from figure 4 shows the top-10 parents of these two communities these top-10 parents are selected based on each communitys first 50 members activity on reddit one week before joining rchinaflu or rcoronavirus interestingly the founders of rchinaflu and rcoronavirus were both active in rcollapse a subreddit that attracts survivalists to discuss the potential collapse of global civilization it suggests that people who pay attention to this virus at the very beginning tend to worry about the break down of our society in general 12  unsurprisingly early members of rchinaflu and rcoronavirus figure 4a shows the top-10 subreddits that the first 50 users of rchinaflu had been active in one week before joining rchinaflu figure 4b shows the top-10 subreddits that the first 50 users of rcoronavirus had been active in one week before joining rcoronavirus are also active members of news-related subreddits rworldnews and rnews this explains why they were aware of this new disease the earliest moreover eight founders of rchinaflu were also active in rconspiracy indicating that covid-19 topics attract conspiracy theorists 35 41  particularly in rchinaflu in comparison rchina is among the top-10 parents of rcoronavirus suggesting that individuals who are invested in china started to avoid rchinaflu from the very beginning since rchinaflu and rcoronavirus are the two earliest communities that concentrate on covidrelated discussions it would be useful to explore how other covid-related subreddits emerge from them on the platform following tan 59  figure 5 presents a broader view of a genealogy graph the graph is based on the first 50 members of each covid-related subreddit a directed edge indicates that there exist early members of the child subreddit who were members of the parent subreddit the thickness of an edge represents the fraction of such members the node size indicates the community size measured by the number of active members to improve the readability of the graph we remove edges with less than 002 weights which is less than or equal to one member from the parent subreddit in general we can see that this genealogy graph is very dense rchinaflu and rcoronavirus are indeed parents of many communities related to covid-19 it also shows that both communities attract users from all over the world some exceptions are interesting rcoronavirus is not a parent of rcoronavirusmemes and the edge between rchinaflu and rcoronavirusmemes is thin founders of rcoronavirusmemes are not from coronavirus-related subreddits moreover the edge from rchinaflu to rcoronavirusrecession is thinner than the one from rcoronavirus to rcoronavirusrecession we see similar trends when plotting the genealogy graph using the post activity  figure 11 in the appendix even though both rchinaflu and rcoronavirus are covid-19 centric we have seen in rq1 that the overlap between these two communities decreases over time in this section we investigate a directed edge indicates that there exist early members of the child subreddit who were members of the parent subreddit the thickness of an edge represents the fraction of such members pink nodes represent regional subreddits and blue nodes represent general ones the node size indicates community size as measured by the number of active members to improve the readability of the graph we remove edges with less than 002 weights which is less than or equal to one member from the parent subreddit hypotheses about their differences driven by moderation practices we expect them to develop different norms formulate different language styles and stimulate further changes to the membership and social dynamics over time we first compare the language usage difference between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus and examine how it evolves then we conduct a qualitative analysis of over-used keywords the most downvoted comments and replies to moderators in each community after that we compare the weekly overlap between these two communities and some more extreme communities on reddit overall we observe an increasing difference when comparing these two subreddits rchinaflu cares more about topics related to china or the chinese government generates more racist comments and has higher overlap with other extreme communities many of these differences are not apparent until different moderation practices are implemented by the platform because posting comments is a major activity for users on reddit we first characterize two communities behavior differences through the lens of language usage language distance first we measure the language distance between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus intuitively since both communities are covid-19 centric we would expect their word usage to follow similar distributions it would be surprising if one word frequently appears in rchinaflu but not in rcoronavirus and vice versa the existence of such words indicates a larger language distance similar to prior work 3 6 60  we adopt the jensen-shannon divergence 38 to measure the weekly unigram usage difference in comments between these two subreddits for all textrelated computations in this paper we remove punctuation marks and stopwords and stem the words during preprocessing the preprocessing is implemented using gensim 49  we also remove comments from moderators or bots to focus on natural users responses during this pandemic figure 6 summarizes the weekly language distance between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus as measured by the jensen-shannon divergence interestingly the language distance decreases slightly before the week of february 24th this suggests that the word usage between these two communities are similar at that time after that the language distance keeps going up indicating an increasing difference between these two subreddits intriguingly the peak similarity appears in 6  the weekly language distance between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus the language distance is getting closer before the week of february 24th after that the distance between these two subreddits is steadily increasing  the week of february 24th one week after the february 17th official announcement figure 1  the strict moderating rules implemented in rcoronavirus and allowing more relaxed discussions in rchinaflu may play a role for this shift the final decline in may is likely driven by the reduction of activities in both communities classification models another way to estimate the language distance between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus is to measure the separation of comments in each community we formulate a binary classification task given the aggregation of comments under one post can we determine which community this post comes from for each week we randomly sample 2000 posts from rchinaflu and rcoronavirus respectively each post is represented by the aggregation of all the comments it receives posts without any comments are removed before the sample to make sure that the number of comments in each post does not play an important factor in our classification model we randomly sample 20 comments of each post this task is thus a balanced classification task where the majority baseline accuracy is 50 the feature set for this task is bag-of-words bow from aggregated comments to assess each weeks classification performance we measure accuracy in five-fold cross-validation using a standard  2 -regularized logistic regression classifier figure 7a presents the weekly accuracy of determining which community a post came from given its aggregated comments we observe a similar trend compared with using jensen-shannon divergence before the week of february 24th the accuracy is decreasing indicating that the language difference between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus is hard to classify after the week of february 24th the accuracy goes up indicating an increment of distinction different from the jensen-shannon distance we observe that the classification performance between these two communities converges at around 65 since march with each weeks classification model trained we also evaluate the cross-week performance as illustrated in the heatmap figure 7b  we use the classification model trained on week1 to classify the aggregated comments in week2 the accuracy is low close to chance in the top right corner these results suggest dramatic change in these two communities before and after the february figure 7a shows the weekly accuracy of determining which community rchinaflu or rcoronavirus a posts aggregated comments come from using bow before the week of february 24th the accuracy is decreasing indicating that the language difference between these two communities is hard to classify after the week of february 24th the accuracy goes up showing an increment of distinction we run this classification model until the week of april 6th as there are not enough posts in rchinaflu after that week to perform this task figure 7b shows the cross-week accuracy of differentiating comments posted to rchinaflu or rcoronavirus using bow in this heatmap figure every cell indicates the accuracy of using the classification model trained on week1 to classify the comments in week2 the weeks before february 17th have relatively good performance when classifying each other and a similar pattern applies to the weeks after february 24th however when we use a classification model before february 17th to classify the comments after february 24th and vice versa the performance is poor 17th announcement the model trained before the announcement can hardly be useful for weeks after the announcement qualitative validation of over-represented keywords to get a better sense of how rchinaflu and rcoronavirus members talk differently we supplement with qualitative analyses to identify a list of keywords that are over-used by members in rchinaflu and rcoronavirus we implement the fightin words model 40 to compare one communitys word frequencies to the other community using the informative dirichlet prior model the fightin words model is effective in detecting word usage differences between two corpora by introducing a smoothing dirichlet prior on vocabulary items this method avoids over-emphasizing fluctuations of rare words a challenge faced by traditional methods such as pmi 38 and tf-idf 51  recently the fightin words model has been frequently used in analyzing language usage in online communities 20 36 78  table 2 presents the weekly over-used keywords in rchinaflu and rcoronavirus due to the space limit we show results every three weeks after the february 17th announcement members in rchinaflu pays much more attention to china-related topics many of the over-represented keywords are related to china or the chinese government this finding echoes prior research about the emergence of sinophobic behavior on twitter and 4chan during the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic 48 52  however we do not see such words in the first two weeks in the table in comparison in the week of february 17th many keywords in rcoronavirus are related to content moderation given that we already remove all the comments from moderators or bots during preprocessing these words can be members arguing foragainst strict rules and quality control after that week members in rcoronavirus spend more time discussing topics related to daily life eg school work home and grocery table 2  the weekly top-10 over-used words in rchinaflu and rcoronavirus respectively these words are selected and ranked by the z-scores calculated using the fightin words model 40  these words are stemmed before fitting into the model replies to moderators what kind of comments were removed in rchinaflu and rcoronavirus in both communities moderators usually explain the decision with a reply to the removed comment however the explanation is usually generic eg incivility isnt allowed on this sub and it is difficult to know the exact reason to answer this question an alternative approach is to look at peoples responses to moderators explanations we note that even if a comment is removed the responses to this comment will still be available on the platform in those responses users usually present a rebuttal of why their content does not violate the rules we identify 708 such responses in rchinaflu and 2275 such responses in rcoronavirus we again run the fightin words model to find a list of distinguishing keywords that are over-used by each community our results are shown in table 3  in rchinaflu over-represented keywords in responses to moderators are highly related to china or the chinese government they also connect with some popular conspiracy theories about covid-19 such as the virus comes from a wuhan lab the virus comes from people eating bats or the virus is a foreign bioweapon 35  additionally when we read through these responses many users are arguing that their comments are not meant to be racist comparatively most of the over-used keywords in rcoronavirus are about arguing the quality of the content or whether it is political there are also users complaining that their comments are not conspiracy theories or not uncivil a random sample of responses to moderators in each community are attached in appendix table 5  most downvoted comments in each community by design reddit communities allow users to vote up or down for the comments they read the difference between the number of upvotes and downvotes a comment receives is referred to as score  the ranking system will display comments with the highest scores at the top of the page and hide the ones with the lowest scores the most table 3  the top-20 over-used words in replies to moderations in rchinaflu and rcoronavirus these words are selected and ranked by the z-scores calculated using the fightin-words algorithm 40  over-used keywords in replies to moderations in rchinaflu lab china viru flu wuhan relat topic bat racist countri ccp hospit claim effort protect rule weapon freedom cfr advertis over-used keywords in replies to moderations in rcoronavirus titl post qualiti polit articl repost high conspiraci sourc video gui remov sorri edit provid translat info state uncivil pure downvoted comments can help us understand what opinions that the community members dislike intensely the most downvoted comments in rchinaflu and rcoronavirus are listed in table 4  interestingly all five comments in rchinaflu are related to saying positive things about china or the chinese government in contrast downvoted comments in rcoronavirus are mostly about downplaying the seriousness of the virus these results provide further evidence that members in rchinaflu pay much closer attention to chinese-related news and have a negative opinion against china it also explains the higher percentage of sinophobic behavior observed in rchinaflu we also check the most upvoted comments in each community which is attached in appendix  table 6  the topics that are heavily endorsed in both communities are more diverse given that members in rchinaflu seem to have more radical behavior such as promoting conspiracy theories and posting racist content we explore its membership overlap with other extreme communities on the platform the extreme communities that we consider include  rwuhanflu 7  rwuhanflu is also a covid-19 centric community founders of rwuhanflu claim this community a place for uncensored discussion the subreddit was quarantined by reddit four days after its creation due to misinformation and hoax content  rconspiracy 8  rconspiracy is a community devoted to a wide range of conspiratorial discussions dramatic events frequently talked about there include jfk ufos and 911  rcollapse 9  rcollapse focuses on discussing the potential collapse of global civilization the community defines collapse as a significant decrease in human population andor politicaleconomicsocial complexity over a considerable area for an extended time some topics frequently discussed in rcollapse are similar to that of rconspiracy figure 8 illustrates rchinaflus and rcoronavirus weekly user overlap with these three extreme subreddits rchinaflu has a much higher overlap with rwuhanflu than rcoronavirus figure 8a  even after rwuhanflu was quarantined by reddit in the week of february 3rd due to the spread of misinformation and hoax content rchinaflu also has a much higher overlap with rconspiracy than rcoronavirus after the february 17th announcement figure 8b  moreover the proportion of overlap users is increasing steadily after that week we see a similar trend between the overlap of rchinaflu and rcollapse figure 8c  except that the increase starts in the week of march 2nd interestingly rcoronavirus user overlap with rconspiracy and rcollapse is also trending up after march 2nd this finding echoes previous studies that the spread of conspiracy theories is a widespread problem in coronavirus-related discussions 46 52  however this problem is more salient in rchinaflu than in rcoronavirus suggesting that these discussions on conspiracy theories tend to occur in relatively smaller communities with loose moderation practice finally we examine how covid-19 affects peoples life beyond discussions related to coronavirus the covid-19 pandemic has caused many cities worldwide to implement strict lockdown to control the spread of this disease with more time spent indoor people likely have adjusted their behavior to measure users activity change before and during the pandemic we collect all rchinaflu members commenting history on reddit since november 1st 2019 we filter users who posted no comments in the entire month of november 2019 to focus on users who were already active on reddit before the pandemic after this removal there are 42748 rchinaflu members left among them 16594 members have not posted any comment in rcoronavirus the remaining 26154 members have commented in both communities we also randomly sample 16594 members in rcoronavirus who have no comments in rchinaflu and have been active since november 2019 in our analysis we compare the weekly activity change of the following three groups of users figure 8a shows that rchinaflu has a much higher overlap with rwuhanflu than rcoronavirus rwuhanflu is a community quarantined four days after its creation due to misinformation and hoax purple line figure 8b shows that rchinaflu has a much higher overlap with rconspiracy than rcoronavirus after the february 17th announcement the proportion of overlapping users exhibits an increasing trend figure 8c shows that rchinaflu has a much higher overlap with rcollapse than rcoronavirus since the very beginning of this pandemic the proportion of overlapping users exhibits an increasing trend since the week of march 2nd for each comparison we quantify the change of activity using increase rate which is measured by the percentage increase of the weekly average number of comments before and during the pandemic increase rate  av j weeks during the pandemic n j av i weeks before the pandemic n i  av i weeks before the pandemic n i   where n i represents the average number of comments in week i in our definition all the weeks before january 27th when the outbreak starts in wuhan china are before the pandemic and the remaining weeks are during the pandemic to understand how activity trends differ between members of rchinaflu and rcoronavirus we calculate the pearson correlation coefficient corr between the weekly average number of comments of rchinaflu-only users and rcoronavirus-only users figure 9a shows users weekly number of comments in all subreddits since november 2019 we observe a notable increase in overall activity on reddit during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic 23 increase this trend is consistent for both rchinaflu-only users 11 increase and rcoronavirus-only users 11 increase the trend is similar to figure 2 as it peaks at the week of march 9th and then starts going down it suggests that as countries are reopening in april and may user activity on reddit is returning to the pre-pandemic norm figure 9b and figure 9c show that the surge of activity is more than following covid-related updates in non-coronavirus subreddits the weekly average number of comments also has a 9 boost during the pandemic interestingly the activity correlation between rchinaflu-only users and rcoronavirus-only users is much higher outside the covid-19 communities figure 10 summarizes users activity change in different categories of comments we observe varying shapes among these categories the increase rates for travel and sports are negative which supports our hypothesis h4a as extensive travel and sporting events are canceled users pay less attention to these subreddits accordingly in april and may even though many countries are reopening their economic activity travel and sports events do not recover subsequently user activity in these two categories remains at a low level among these three categories we observe similar trends between rchinaflu-only and rcoronavirus-only users as the pearson correlations are all above 060 in h4a we also hypothesize a decline in user activity in education and food subreddits however the results in figure 10c and figure 10d do not support this hypothesis we observe a 10 increase in the education subreddits and little change in the food subreddits 2 increase rate in figure  10c  there is an apparent surge of activity between two yellow lines as covid-19 starts to become a serious problem in europe and the us people may flock to the education subreddits to discuss issues about school closure and students going home after that the discussion in the education subreddits recovers to an average level similar to the pre-pandemic period when we compare user activity of rchinaflu-only and rcoronavirus-only users in the education subreddits rcoronavirus-only users maintain a high level of interest during the pandemic while many rchinaflu-only users shift their focus away after the week of march 9th in figure 10d  we see some drop of activity around the week of march 9th but it quickly recovers even though restaurants and cafes are forced to close there is a massive demand for food in grocery stores and supermarkets the shortage of food supply may also prompt discussions in online communities these factors may mitigate each other in the food subreddits the increase rates for finance countriescities and humor are positive which supports our hypothesis in h4b these results indicate that people pay more attention to economic opportunities and local news during this pandemic they are also pursuing funny stories perhaps for relieving mental and physical stress interestingly user activity in these three categories starts dropping in late april and may as countries are opening up people may be less worried about financial issues follow less local news and spend less time on memes jokes and funny stories among these three categories the patterns of rchinaflu-only and rcoronavirus-only users are similar as the pearson correlations are all above 050 in h4b we expect an increment in technology and tvmovie subreddits however the results in figure 10h and figure 10i refute our hypotheses there is no significant change in the technology subreddits before and during the pandemic -1 increase rate and an 18 drop in the tvmovies subreddits notably rchinaflu-only and rcoronavirus-only users exhibit opposite trends in the 10  the weekly average number of comments in different categories of subreddits for three groups of users increase rates shown in titles are measured among all users the correlation corr is measured between rchinaflu-only users and rcoronavirus-only users we also mark two important weeks in the figure the first week of january 27th the first week of the outbreak and the week of march 9th when who declared covid-19 a pandemic technology subreddits figure 10h  the increase rate is -12 for rchinaflu-only users and 11 for rcoronavirus-only users surprisingly user activity in the tvmovies subreddits is decreasing during the pandemic according to forbes streaming hits have jumped by at least 12 in march 9  this surge does not seem to translate to activity in the tvmovies subreddits one possible explanation is that people are more likely to discuss newly released tv series or movies on reddit for example in figure 10i  the peak around the week of december 16th is mainly due to the release of the classic movie star wars the rise of skywalker during the pandemic new film releases have been delayed to future dates or indefinitely 69  people may spend more time watching old tv series or movies but are not passionate about discussing them on the internet in this work we provide a large-scale characterization of reddit users responses to the covid-19 pandemic we focus on two new communities that emerged on the reddit platform rchinaflu and rcoronavirus by comparing users activity and language usage in these two communities from the beginning of the outbreak to late may we observe an increasing difference between them in many aspects for example the language distance between these two communities is going up week by week the users in rchinaflu care more about china-related topics generate more racist comments and are more likely to be active in other extreme communities intriguingly the february 17th announcement made by the reddit platform which makes rcoronavirus the official community for covid-19 and increases moderation effort in rcoronavirus might be associated with this difference moreover we illustrate how the disease is rippling through society by examining users activity change on the entire reddit platform we find significant activity changes outside covid-related communities in some categories such as finance and food user activity has recovered to the pre-pandemic level in late april and may as countries reopen but other categories remain highly impacted implications for moderation practice should social media be neutral this question has drawn increasing attention in our society amidst concerns over bad behavior on the internet such as spreading misinformation supporting conspiracy theories and promoting racism one popular argument for non-intervention on social media is to protect freedom of speech recently us president donald trump signed an executive order targeting social media censorship trump described the move as to defend free speech from one of the gravest dangers it has faced in american history 2  however allowing totally free and uncensored discussions in online platforms may not work for example the well-known unregulated website 4chanorg is responsible for some of the largest hoaxes conspiracy theories cyberbullying incidents and internet pranks of the past five years 42 52 64  npr cnn reuters and other news sites have eliminated their online comment section due to the inability to limit inappropriate content 34  subreddit rworldpolitics is overwhelmed with nsfw posts featuring porn pictures due to a lack of moderation 13  the fight against coronavirus on social media notably demonstrates the importance of content moderation on the internet facebook twitter and other service providers have been increasingly active building ways of removing damaging coronavirus misinformation 19 26  the results in our work suggest that rchinaflu which has adopted a loose moderation practice has more racist behavior and a higher overlap with rconspiracy another coronavirus-related subreddit rwuhanflu which calls itself the best place for uncensored coronavirus discussion was quarantined only four days after its creation reddit explains that the quarantine decision was made to contain misinformation or hoax content in summary considering the potentially harmful impact that low-quality content can have on society during the crisis social media platforms should take responsibility and play a substantial role in content moderation and curation it remains an open question as to what kind of moderation is appropriate and effective implications for online extremism is the human crisis a golden opportunity for extreme online spaces to grow and recruit new members since the beginning of the outbreak wild conspiracy theories and misinformation began sprouting online 41  take rconspiracy as an example its user activity skyrocketed during the covid-19 pandemic figure 12  we find that rchinaflu a community dedicated to covid-related discussions is attracting users from extreme communities at the same time it may serve as a pathway for radical communities to surface and develop some users who are not interested in conspiracy stories or are not aware of such online spaces in the beginning may be exposed and become new fans during the pandemic future research towards painting a comprehensive picture of user radicalization on social media platforms during crises is necessary for answering this question implications for understanding online communities our work demonstrates that online communities do not only exist in the virtual world user activity in online communities can be heavily embedded in the offline context covid-related subreddits provide a unique opportunity for understanding the connections between the online and offline world because these communities only exist as a result of the covid-19 pandemic many activity changes identified in these communities are highly correlated with the timelines of how the pandemic has unfolded in the real world such observations emphasize the necessity of connecting online and offline data resources to explain the dynamics of online communities and their relationships with on-going offline events our results on user activity outside covid-related communities also point to possible directions in informing offline policies using online behavior further research is required to bridge the gap between the online and offline worlds the findings in our work are subject to several limitations first the causal relationship between moderation practices and differences between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus is not established due to the nature of our observational study we do not know what will happen to rchinaflu if reddit implements stricter rules an important confounding factor could be that all the differences are driven by the decision of making rcoronavirus the official coronavirus subreddit on the entire platform not by moderation however this factor alone cannot explain the high overlap between rchinaflu and extreme communities second most of the data has been collected during the covid-19 pandemic a unique period in human history the results reported in this study are highly connected to this context for example there is a steep rise in the expression of anti-asian bias and blatant harassment across the globe related to fear amidst the epidemic 27 66  false information has led to scapegoating and disrespect aimed at persons of asian descent particularly those of chinese origin 52  this background partially explains the sinophobic behavior observed in rchinaflu the generalization of insights from this work to other contexts requires further investigation   predictions for covid-19 outbreak in india using epidemiological models rajesh ranjan  covid-19 data from india is compared against several countries as well as key states in the us with a major outbreak and it is found that the basic reproduction number r 0 for india is in the expected range of 14-39 further the rate of growth of infections in india is very close to that in washington and california exponential and classic susceptible-infected-recovered sir models based on available data are used to make short and long-term predictions on a daily basis based on the sir model it is estimated that india will enter equilibrium by the end of may 2020 with the final epidemic size of approximately 13000 however this estimation will be invalid if india enters the stage of community transmission the impact of social distancing again with the assumption of no community transmission is also assessed by comparing data from different geographical locations  coronavirus disease 2019 has presented an unprecedented challenge before the world as of march 30 2020 there have been about 08 million confirmed cases of covid-2019 and about 40000 reported deaths globally about one-third of the world population is currently under lockdown to arrest the spread of this highly infectious disease covid-19 is caused by the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 for which there is no specific medication or vaccine approved by medical authorities yet this disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets or fomites and the incubation period may range from 2 to 14 days 1  though the overall fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3 the disease can be fatal to elderly people about 27 for 60 age groups and those with an underlying medical history studies 2 1 have presented characteristics of covid-19 disease describing symptoms and the latest developments india first reported a covid-19 case in a student who returned from wuhan china on january 30 2020 for future references 2020 is the default year for all the dates unless mentioned otherwise since then there has been a gradual rise in the number of infections with 1251 cases on march 30 among which there are 1117 active cases 102 recovered cases and 32 deaths in response india has implemented international travel bans and a strict lockdown however countries like india are at a greater risk because of a very large population density limited infrastructure and healthcare systems to cater to very large demands on the other hand factors like warmer climate as well as humidity 3 4  a large proportion of the young population and possible immunity due to bcg vaccinations 5  may favor india most of these studies are preliminary and correlation-based and therefore more evidence is required for arriving at concrete conclusions 6  we hereby present epidemiological models for the spread of covid-19 in india most of pandemics follow an exponential curve during the initial spread and eventually flatten out 7  the current models are thus based on an exponential fit and logistic regression for short term and long term predictions respectively further in the latter case susceptible-infectious-recovered sir compartment model 8 is used to include considerations for susceptibles infectious and recovered or deceased individuals these models have shown a significant predictive ability for the growth of covid-19 in india on a day-to-day basis so far we have also considered the possible effects of social distancing on the growth of infections india announced a countrywide lockdown on march 24 for 21 days although a study by singh and adhikari 9 have suggested that this period may be insufficient for controlling the covid-19 pandemic in the present study we assessed the effects of social distancing measures from the time of spread by comparing lockdown status of india with several other countries and states in the us and china it is shown that the early action of lockdown in india compared to many other countriesstates can have a favourable effect in limiting the final epidemic size however social and economical issues in a country of 134 billion population with high density pose significant challenges in enforcing strict social distancing as the current model is fully dependent on data it is imperative to comment on the nature of this data different countries have different strategies for conducting covid-19 diagnostic tests in india testing has largely been limited to individuals travelling from high-risk countries and their immediate contacts as well as selected pneumonia patients and symptomatic healthcare workers as of march 30 india has tested 42788 samples indian medical authorities have justified this strategy by testing randomly collected samples sahasranaman and kumar 10 have compared basic reproduction number r 0 from india and the world to analyze this strategy r 0 is the transmission rate given that the population has no immunity from past exposures or vaccination nor any deliberate intervention in disease transmission the number of infections grow and spread in the population if r 0  1 they have found that r 0 from india r 0  043 is much smaller than the rest of the world 15  r 0  25 and the numbers reported in india may not be reflective of the actual number of cases however by considering a longer date range from march 10 to march 30 we show that the value of r 0 from india is comparable to infection rates reported elsewhere further we find that the growth of infections in india is comparable to that in california and washington in any case current models do not depend on the testing strategy provided the same protocol is used throughout the time-period in other words the ratio of actual to reported number of cases will remain the same at any given time on the other hand the uncertainty due to exclusion of asymptomatic cases can be a major limitation in predictions with these models the current model does not account for factors such as the weather or humidity changes several studies 11 have reported that the efficacy of coronavirus may change when the weather becomes warmer other factors such as differential immunity of indians due to bcg vaccine 5 are already implicitly assumed in the data in the form of basic reproduction number current models predict the transmissions due to stage-1 individuals with a travel history to high-risk countries and stage-2 person-to-person contact it should be noted that if the reported number of cases begins to exceed the predicted end-state systematically then the pandemic will enter a new stage and none of the models described above will be applicable although as of march 30 there is no strong evidence for community transmission which can be achieved only by extensive testing and enlarging testing criteria however high population density as well as social and demographical issues puts india on a high risk for community transmission stage-3 although the social distancing and rigorous contact tracing measures taken by india may help in containing these transmissions to small clusters migration of labourers and workers could worsen the situation therefore these factors should be considered while making informed decisions based on the present study the missing data of imported infections 12 may also affect the predictions but this may be a moot point as discussed below india implemented a travel ban on march 12 the total number of air travellers who entered india in 2 months before this ban was around 15 million and a gap between those being monitored for covid-19 and total arrivals during this period has been reported 12  although if a significant number of infections were missed a spike would have already appeared in the curve by march 30 it takes 2-14 days for the covid-19 symptoms to appear but no unusual events are noticed 18 days after the travel ban it is known that during early stages of a pandemic the growth in the number of diagnosed infections with time is exponential thus if the number of diagnosed infections it over time t is known one can find the growth rate r 2  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a

the eventual decay but may fail in initial stages in logistic model the growth is given by 13  where a  ki 0   1 assuming k i 0 and hence a 1 for small time t this approximates the exponential model

guess of  and  are obtained by setting r0  0 and then the sir equations are solved details of the implementation can be found in batista 14  for the covid-19 predictions in china batista 14 has shown that both logistic and sir give similar results hence in this study only sir results are included for this purpose the fitviruscv19v3 code developed by mcgee 15 is used the data for the models have been taken from johns hopkins university coronavirus data stream that combines world health organization who and center for disease control and prevention cdc case data for the exponential model the data between march 11 and march 23 were used when the number of reported infections were 62 and 499 respectively for the sir model a longer range is required to obtain a reasonable estimate and hence data for 21 days were considered starting from march 10 which is designated as the seed value on this date there were 56 individuals who had contracted the virus out of which 39 were travel-related stage-1 and 17 were person-to-person stage-2 transmissions there is no confirmed report of community transmission as of march 30 hence we consider that models with these seed values will give a good estimate for stage-1 and 2 transmissions further like the study of singh and adhikari 9  we consider all cases to be symptomatic as it is not easy to estimate the number of asymptomatic cases this could significantly underestimate the actual numbers of cases before showing the models for india we compare the growth of infections with several different countries and states in the us there have been several reports see for example 10  that have indicated that the initial slow growth of infections in india could be an artifact of its testing strategy where testing is limited to specific individuals travelling from high-risk countries and their immediate contacts figure 1 shows the growth of infections in india from 1 to 1000 along with other countries and states with a reasonable

to 1000 the initial growth of epidemic in india is very close to that in washington and california different testing strategies to report the number of infections the growth rate in india is much smaller than places like new york and new jersey where the spread is very fast and it took only 16-17 days to reach 1000 cases italy and france took about 29 and 43 days respectively to reach the same figure on the other hand places like california and washington took a relatively long time about 55-58 days which is similar to india that took 59 days further the growth curve of india is very close to that of washington as india is 9 days behind washington in outbreak history this information could be very useful as one may look at the washington data to make predictions for india the results for the exponential and sir mathematical models are discussed next figure 2 shows the exponential model for short and long term predictions the values of parameters in this model fit are i 0  3964 r  01887 with coefficient of determination r 2  09768 figure 2 a shows confirmed as well as expected numbers of patients up to april 6 for comparison the confirmed data from washington are also shown though the model uses the data till march 23 for predictions the number of reported cases are remarkably close to the number of predicted cases according to this curve india can have around 5000 infected cases by april 6 though the exponential fit is not a good model for long term predictions we present a pessimistic case by showing the results till april 30 using this model in figure 2 b it should be mentioned that these models do not consider any effect of social distancing due to lockdown that was enforced on march 24 though this presents a very frightening picture as the number of affected individuals may go up to 05 million by april 30 with a single-day increase of around 90000 patients however this situation is going to be highly unlikely because of 1 inability of this model to account for eventual decay in an epidemic and 2 measures due to social distancing that result in flattening the curve results for the sir model which has better abilities for long term forecasts are shown in figure 3  the regression model has a coefficient of determination of r 2  0996 as seen in the top panel of figure 3  after the initial exponential phase till march 31 the acceleration phase starts and continues till april 13 when there is a peak of around 400 cases 4  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to

till april 30 after which asymptotic slow growth begins till flattening of the curve the estimates from this model reaches a plateau at 12416 cases which is the final epidemic size in the acceleration phase april 1-april 13 the predictions from the sir model differ from exponential model for example the exponential model suggests that the number of cases will cross 5000 on april 6 but the prediction for the same using sir model is on 12 april the basic reproduction number r 0 using sir model is 1504 which is much higher than the initial values reported by sahasranaman and kumar 10 using the sir model but it is close to the values reported by deb and majumdar 16 who used auto-regressive integrated moving average arima model the initial doubling time from the sir model is 48 days these values can be compared with estimated epidemiologic parameters from covid-19 in wuhan 17  6  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted

initial doubling time were about 19 and 54 days respectively for us particularly new york and new jersey the estimated r 0 is very large 16  however as ridenhour et al 18 pointed that r 0 is a complicated property of an epidemic specific to the underlying model used to estimate it the population being studied in terms of contact patterns and demography the host the pathogen and often the specific strain of the pathogen they suggested that this number may vary geographically due to changes in the environment population structure viral evolution and immunity as well as healthcare and immigration policies figure 3 suggests that the pandemic may reach equilibrium by end of may based on data till march 30 however these estimations may change greatly if there is any jump or large departure in the trend further as explained before none of the models described above will be valid if india enters stage-3 community transmission on the other hand the social distancing measures taken by india can help in arresting the growth much earlier this aspect is analyzed in the next section the effects of social distancing on covid-19 outbreak have been studied by various researchers using different mathematical models 1 19  here instead of incorporating that effect into the mathematical model we follow an empirical approach by learning from the data from different countries and states in the us it is known that the effects of social distancing become visible only after a few days from the lockdown this is because the symptoms of the covid-19 typically take some time to appear after getting infected from the coronavirus sars-cov-2 the average incubation period is normally 5-6 days but it may take 2-14 days according to the cdc table 1 shows the list of a few countries and cities with their lockdown status particularly we focus on the lockdown in the hubei province of china where it was enforced on feb 2 figure 4 shows the number of confirmed cases as well as increase per day in hubei as shown in figure 4a  on the date of lockdown hubei had 11177 cases lockdown in wuhan capital city of hubei was announced much earlier on january 23 when the country had just 830 cases another observation from table 1 is that india was very early in enforcing lockdown when it had only 536 cases compared to many other countriescities such as uk germany and new york where this strict measure was taken only after covid-19 entered stage-3 and the spread became uncontrollable this may become a key factor in controlling this pandemic in india -april 2 2020 further different countries have different norms as well as compliance levels due to practical considerations in enforcing the lockdown as shown in remarks in table 1  this may affect the final outcome for example the growth in italy is still not stabilized after 19 days of lockdown they have also seen the highest percentage of death as well a large population over 60 years of age may be a primary factor on the other hand spain has shown signs of decline from march 25 but it may be too early to confirm that according to an estimate by chang et al 19 for covid-19 outbreak in australia a reduction in incidence and prevalence can be visible only if the social distancing compliance levels exceed 80 now we focus on the impact of social distancing in india india announced a strict lockdown on 24 march when the number of reported cases was 536 though on 22 march india observed janta curfew voluntary lockdown and the public activity has been limited since that date assuming the same pattern as hubei in india as well although the lockdown in hubei was more stringent with strict police control over individual movements we can assume that till april 8 14 days from lockdown very little effects of social distancing will be seen by this date india may have reported patients as many as 8000 according to figure 2 b this number may increase greatly if community transmission happens and spreads due to the movement of migrant workers and labourers however after april 8 india should start seeing the effects of social distancing provided it is enforced properly and the curve should start flattening out at its peak india should expect around 1500 patients on a single day april 8 considering an exponential growth a recent study by mandal et al 20 has shown that social distancing can reduce cases by up to 62 assuming the uncertainty about the compliance in the enforcement of lockdown we predict the social distancing effects with reductions of 30 50 and 70 figure 5 shows the impact of social distancing in these scenarios exponential growth is assumed throughout to account for the worst-case scenario a reduction of 70 can bring the cases to a more controllable number ie a total of around 28000 patients on april 20 further if india follows the case isolation strategy strictly it is expected that this curve will start flattening out after that date estimated based on the date from hubei in figure 4 a this exploratory evaluation shows that the transmission rate of covid-19 in india is comparable to that in washington state in the us the curves describing the initial phase of the outbreak for both the locations are very close as the beginning of the outbreak in washington was about 9 days prior to that in india the current data from the former can be 8

reduction in cases most optimistic there will be approximately 30000 cases by april 20 2020 used to make informative predictions for india along the similar argument we show that the transmission rate and basic reproduction number r 0 for india are in the expected range this is contrary to several reports questioning the testing strategies adopted by india quoting a low transmission rate and hence the smaller basic reproduction number two epidemiological models -a simple exponential model and an sir model are used respectively to forecast short and long term outcomes these models assume all the seed cases to be symptomatic which may underestimate the actual numbers due to an uncertain number of asymptomatic individuals with this limitation the exponential model based on data till march 23 nicely predicts the values till today march 30 the sir model based on data till march 30 indicates that india will enter equilibrium by the end of may with an estimated total number of infected cases to be approximately 13000 it is estimated that the impact of social distancing will be visible after april 8 following which we may see a significant reduction in the reported infections however india is on high risk to enter into community transmission due to reported violation of quarantine norms by individuals as well as other social and demographic issues the predictions made using the current epidemiological models in the current work will be invalid if such an event occurs finally the model is as good as the underlying data because of real time change in data daily the predictions will accordingly change hence the results from this paper should be used only for qualitative understanding and reasonable estimate of the nature of outbreak but are not advisable for any decision making

the non-pharmaceutical mitigation scenarios yong zhang xiangnan yu hongguang sun geoffrey tick r wei wei bin jin  the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic radically impacts our lives while the transmissioninfection and recovery dynamics of covid-19 remain obscure a time-dependent susceptible exposed infectious and recovered seir model was proposed and applied to fit and then predict the time series of covid-19 evolution observed in the last three months till 3222020 in various provinces and metropolises in china the model results revealed the space dependent transmissioninfection rate and the significant spatiotemporal variation in the recovery rate likely due to the continuous improvement of screening techniques and public hospital systems as well as full city lockdowns in china the validated seir model was then applied to predict covid-19 evolution in united states italy japan and south korea which have responded differently to monitoring and mitigating covid-19 so far although these predictions contain high uncertainty due to the intrinsic change of the maximum infected population and the infectionrecovery rates within the different countries in addition a stochastic model based on the random walk particle tracking scheme analogous to a mixing-limited bimolecular reaction model was developed to evaluate non-pharmaceutical strategies to mitigate covid-19 spread preliminary tests using the stochastic model showed that self-quarantine may not be as efficient as strict social distancing in slowing covid-19 spread if not all of the infected people can be promptly diagnosed and quarantined  the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 outbreak a respiratory illness that started first detected in late december 2019 is a pandemic infecting 336000 people in more than 140 countries with the average fatality rate of 44 globally data up to 3222020 1  the covid-19 pandemic is infiltrating almost every aspect of life damaging global economy and altering both man-made and natural environments urgent actions have been taken but further effective and efficient strategies are promptly needed to confront this global challenge to address this challenge and promptly guide the next efforts it is critical to model the transmission infection and recovery dynamics of covid-19 pandemic mathematical models are among the necessary tools to quantify the covid-19 dynamics and are the primary objective motivating this study this study aims to model the covid-19 evolution for representative countries with apparent coronavirus cases including china united states us italy japan and south korea covid-19 spread in these countries under different starting initiation and detection times for example china had passed the peak of the coronavirus outbreak and hit a milestone with no new local infections on 3192020 79 days from the onset 12312019 in wuhan china while the us coronavirus cases soared past 10000 on the same day this study will apply the core characteristics of covid-19 outbreak obtained in china to estimate the covd-19 spread in the us as well as other countries where the number of affected people has not yet reached its peak in addition this new pandemic may last for a relatively longer time than expected 2  no vaccine against sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is currently available 3  indeed a vaccine for prevention and infection control may not be ready before march 2021 for covid-19 considering the minimum 45 weeks for trial and at least 1 year for safety evaluation and final deployment efficient strategies are therefore needed to mitigate the 4 covid-19 outbreak possible non-pharmaceutical scenarios such as isolation of cases and contact tracing can be evaluated using mathematical models 4  to identify the most efficient strategy going forward this is another major motivation and the secondary task of this study to address the questions mentioned above this study is organized as follows section 2 proposes an updated seir model for covid-19 where s e i and r stand for susceptible exposed infectious and recovered people respectively 5  this model is then applied to fit and predict the covid-19 spread in various provinces and major cities in china resulting in abundant datasets to derive the core characteristics of the covid-19 dynamics of transmissioninfection and recovery section 3 predicts the spread of covid-19 in the other countries using the knowledge gained from china section 4 proposes a fully lagrangian approach to model the spatiotemporal evolution of covid-19 and then applies it to evaluate non-pharmaceutical scenarios to mitigate the virus spread section 5 reports the main conclusions several mathematical models have been applied for epidemic analysis of covid-19 the most widely used one so far is the well-known seir model for example peng et al 6 using data up to 2162020 proposed a generalized seir model to successfully estimate the key epidemic parameters of covid-19 in china and predicted the inflection point and ending time of confirmed covid-19 cases the seir model was also applied by li et al 7 using the observed data up to 262020 to compare the effect of city lockdowns on the transmission dynamics in different cities in china the sir model with time-dependent transmission and recovering rates was used by chen et al 8 using data up to 2202020 to analyze and predict the number of confirmed cases of covid-19 in china the sir model was extended by wang et al 9 using data up to 2122020 to incorporate various time-varying quarantine protocols for assessing 5 interventions on the covid-19 epidemic in china the seir model and its modifications were also successfully applied by others 10 11 12 13  mostly for assessing the early spreading of in china previous applications of the popular seir model however may contain high uncertainty since they had limited data access for only a short period of the covid-19 outbreak as will be shown below the covid-19 dynamics have changed dramatically in the last three months likely due to the improvementadjustment of screeningtesting techniques public hospital system capabilities and the governments control policies for contagious diseases an updated much better version of the seir model is therefore needed and can be reliably built now for china since the detailed datasets are now available and the coronavirus outbreak ie  of people infected has passed its peak in china other models have also been used for specific purposes related to covid-19 including the global metapopulation disease transmission model to project the impact of travel limitations on the epidemic spread 14  the transmission model for risk assessment 15  and the synthetic contact matrix model for reproductive ratios for covid-19 16  to the best of our knowledge the classical stochastic epidemic models such as the discrete or continuous time markov chain model and the stochastic differential equation model have not yet been applied for covid-19 spread scenarios a preliminary stochastic model for evaluating covid-19 spread in a city will be developed and applied in section 4 this section focuses on the deterministic model the classical seir model considers constant parameters which may not well capture time-dependent dynamics hence the seir model is updated in section 21 and then tested in section 22 the classical seir model containing four populations s e i and r takes the form 17  where is the stock of susceptible population is the number of persons exposed to or in the latent period of the disease is the stock of infected is the stock of recovered population r denotes the number of susceptible people whom the infected people contact daily n is the sum of all the four groups of people              constant representing the constancy of population n p is the constant rate of infection ie representing the probability for the infected people to transform the susceptible people into infected ones is the constant rate for the exposed person transformed into the infected one and is the constant recovery rate defining the speed for the infected person to be cured or expired to allow for possible time-sensitive rates for covid-19 evolution we revise model 1 where represents the number of deaths which is one component in i is the rate for the healthy susceptible person to be transferred to the infected one by the exposed people note that covid-19 patients in the incubation period might be contagious too and is the number of 7 healthy susceptible people that are contacted by the exposed people daily now the infection rates can change with time and the infected persons are removed from the risk of infection also with a time-dependent rate of   if the recovered individuals can return to the susceptible status due to for example loss of immunity then the partial differential equation pde 2d for the time rate of change of needs one more sink term       where is the rate of the recovered individuals returning to the susceptible status we add the fractional-order pde 2e containing the death probability of while the other  which is the caputo fractional derivative 18 19 with order 0   1 when the order 1 model 2e reduces to the classical integer-order pde for the death evolution the fractional pde 2e is used here for two reasons first the evolution of deaths and cures may be characterized by a random process since the exact time for the recovered person to be initially infected is unknown ie the patient that died or was cured today may have been diagnosed yesterday or last week second some patients may not be treated in time after being infected making the death toll to evolve with a time memory therefore we extend the classical mass-balance equation of death cases to the fractional pde to characterize the random property and memory impact embedded in the temporal evolution of mortality the fractional pde 2e and its classical version will be compared below using real data we apply the seir model 2 to fit the infection and recovery of coronavirus in china up to 372020 and then predict the future evolution  figure 1  20 with solutions shown by the dotted lines in figure 1a  accurately fits the observed data at the early stage but then overpredicts the spread of covid-19 observed after 2122020 dynamics of transmission for covid-19 especially the recovery rate therefore changed in time in china likely due to the time-dependent conditions in for example medical care mentioned above a dynamic seir model therefore may be preferred for modeling covid-19 spread in china in addition compared to the fractional pde 2e the best-fit solution using the classical pde   for death evolution see the black dotted line in figure 1a  slightly overestimates the late-time growth of mortality the actual death toll in hubei province grew slower than that estimated by a constant rate model indicating that the memory impact may affect the late-time dynamics of death that can be better captured by the fractional fde 2e the best-fit solutions using model 2 fit the evolution of the infected and recovered populations well for the data recorded from hubei province and three large cities closely related to wuhan china  figure 1  the model can also predict well the observed time series of covid-19 spread from 382020 to 3222020 for most places except for shanghai city figure 1d  this is due to the oversea cases imported to shanghai whose number was increasing quickly after 332020 causing inconsistency of population and failure of the model shanghai pudong international airport one of the two airports located in shanghai city is the eighth-busiest airport in the world and the busiest international gateway of mainland china if deleting the coronavirus 9 cases imported from overseas model 2 can predict well the covid-19 data in shanghai  figure   2  therefore model 2 works well for various places in china while external sources can easily break the internal evolution especially the asymptotic status of covid-19 in china the resultant time-dependent recovery rate   is depicted in figure 3  where the rate fitted by the latest observation data point in the fitting period ie 372020 remains stable in the following prediction period the best-fit recovery rate is the highest for shanghai except for the impulse of   for wenzhou discussed below which is expected since shanghai has the best public health system of all of these cities contrarily hubei shows the lowest recovery rate likely due to its delayed response and the relatively limited public health capability at the beginning of the outbreak compared with shanghai february 2020 resulting in the sudden increase in the total recovery rate in addition a relatively large number of people working in wuhan returned to wenzhou in late january and it appears that the improved efficient screening process successfully identified the number of infected cases the new cases were 29000 from 1242020 to 1312020 in wenzhou with an average of 3600 new patients per day who were then immediately centralized for treatment it appears that this fast response helped to alleviate the spread of coronavirus in wenzhou 10  the best-fit parameters of model 2 are listed in table 1  and the initial values for each group of people are listed in table 2  we reveal three behaviors in model parameters first the best-fit s-shaped   figure 3 can be described by the sigmoid function    1   where a b and c are factors showing that the recovery rate increases exponentially before reaching stable this increase is likely due to the healthcare facility and experience improved with time in an accelerating rate before reaching their asymptote or maximum capacity second the rates and probabilities r  p and  affecting the covid-19 transmissioninfection slightly change in space and remain stable for a given site  table 1  the small spatial fluctuation of these rates may be due to the similar strategies of local government for we also introduce an index c to quantify the infection severity of covid-19 at different places where is the maximum number of cumulative infected people at the given site a smaller c represents a greater infection severity of coronavirus there is a power-law relationship between 11 the regional population n and the maximum cumulated number of infected people  figure   4  this empirical formula may be used to approximate the largest cumulative number of infections which will be applied below in predicting the covid-19 evolution outside of china where the coronavirus infection has not yet reached its peak number of cases different countries are applying different modes for slow the covid-19 spread in the next sub-sections we discuss several representative countries and then fitpredict the virus spread there to  to decrease the acceleration of covid-19 spread italys mode is now similar to china lockdown of the full population the predicted covid-19 spread in italy is plotted in figure 6a  although italy has followed chinas mode of national isolation the number of infected people increased rapidly from 3142020 to 3192020 495 new cases per day to account for the delayed national quarantine compared with china we decrease the c index when also increasing the upper limit of the cumulative infection the covid-19 evolution prediction results show that there may be a turning point in the next two weeks when the current infected cases begin to decline we also separate the death toll from the number of recovered cases south koreas mode of combating the spread of covid-19 is fast detection and tracking of the disease south korea is using efficient mobile diagnoses tests and accurate tracing of infected cases to maintain a low death rate even with a large infected population the mobile method can test 20000 people per day the maximum capability on 3122020 and apps for cell phones andor credit cards can accurately track the routes of infected people with the help of local government without invasion of privacy so that warnings can be immediately delivered to the general population to obviate the places with high risk the current infected population may have passed 13 its peak number of cases around 3202020 and the prediction shows that the covid-19 outbreak may be well controlled in 35 days from 3222020 figure 6b  japans mode of combating the spread of covid-19 is compatible with that of the us in addition to other changes such as enhanced educationoutreach and fast treatment to the infected cases specific policies include social distancing which might be a key barrier to the spread of the novel coronavirus personal hygiene and quarantine of the infected cases the current data and modeling results figure 6c show that japan has an efficient way so far to limit the maximum population infected and slow the spread of covid-19 while this outbreak may last for a while the model-predicted covid-19 spread in us using the fitted infection and recovery rates from china  figure 5  reveals the impact of one possible mitigation scenario for covid-19 state coronavirus lockdowns which have now been implemented by some states in the us such as california and new york other non-pharmaceutical options can and should also be evaluated using mathematical models considering the recent surge of infected cases in the us when the number of infected persons is initially small compared to that of susceptible people the infected and susceptible people are not well mixed and hence the system is not homogeneous under such conditions a stochastic model is needed as the deterministic continuum models such as the seir model assume well-mixing of components for a homogeneous system 21 22  hence this section develops and applies a stochastic model to evaluate the non-pharmaceutical scenarios for mitigating covid-19 with a small number of initial infections the random walk based stochastic model for covid-19 spread is analogous to a mixing-limited bimolecular reaction-based mechanismcondition 23  when a reactant a particle 14 representing a susceptible individual a meets a reactant b particle representing an infectious person b a chemical reaction may occur if the collision energy is large enough to break the chemical bond meaning that the susceptible person a may be infected if satisfying additional criteria such as a and b are close enough and b touches hisher face after receiving coronavirus from a therefore the condition of a being infected is not deterministic but rather a random probability-controlled process this probability is related to various factors such as the duration that a and b are in contact the infectivity rate and the distance between the two people which may be characterized parsimoniously by the interaction radius r that controls the number of reactant pairs susceptible  infectious in a potential reaction infection 23  hence the core of the random walk stochastic model for covid-19 spread is to define the interaction radius r the analogous development and similarities between bimolecular reactions and the sir model can also be seen from their governing equations the time-dependent sir model takes the form 24  where   and   denote the transmission rate and recovery rate at time t respectively therefore following the argument in zhang et al 23 and lu et al 25  we derive analytically the interaction radius r for the sir model 4 where v denotes the volume of the domain  is the time step in random walk particle tracking     is the mass or weight carried by each a particle   is the initial concentration of a which can be assumed to be the normalized value 1 here and denotes the initial number of susceptible people after defining the interaction radius r the particle tracking scheme proposed by zhang et al 23 and lu et al 25 can be applied to model the transmission of coronavirus between the susceptible and infectious people in addition to pharmaceutical strategies including vaccine and therapeutic drug development and herd immunity that may either take a while or have a high risk non-pharmaceutical scenarios can be tested several particle-tracking based stochastic models were proposed recently 26 to evaluate non-pharmaceutical scenarios to mitigate coronavirus spreading in a city here we evaluate three related scenarios described below using the stochastic model proposed above scenario 1 no special constraints assuming a city with 10000 people and 4 initial coronavirus cases this scenario does not put any constraints for any population we assume that 16 the population distributes in the city randomly at the beginning and then moves randomly the spread of covid-19 is then simulated using the stochastic model proposed in section 41 scenario 2 social distancing this scenario assumes that all people in the city maintain a social distance significantly decreasing the probability of infection scenario 3 attempted quarantine this scenario creates a forced quarantine for infected individuals before the outbreak which is expected to be the most efficient way of quarantine in the stochastic model we assume that 10 days after being infected the person will be removed because of being cured or expired dead this is because the median disease incubation period was estimated to be 51 days 27  for simplicity purposes the interaction radius r 6 remains constant since the constant interaction radius was found to be able to efficiently capture the temporal variation of effective reaction rates in mixing controlled reactions 23 25  the initial number of a and particles is 10000 and 4 respectively the lagrangian solutions of the covid-19 outbreak for the three scenarios are depicted in figure 7  scenarios 1 2 and 3 have a peak in the curve of newly infected people at time t28 65 and 32 respectively showing that the virus spreads the fastest for the scenario without mitigation constraints ie scenario 1 where the number of the total infected increases by one order of magnitude every 10 days in the rising limb as expected however the value for this peak scenario 1 198 people is lower than that for scenario 3 267 people although the total number of the infected people for scenario 1 9336 is slightly larger than scenario 3 9322 this may be due to a greater separation of infection cases for the higher number of initial coronavirus carriers in scenario 1 which causes a lower and relatively flatter covid-19 evolution peak than scenario 3 scenario 2 has the lowest peak value 121 people and the most-delayed peak in the curve of new cases and the total infection time is almost doubled compared to the other two 17 scenarios indicating that people living with strict social distancing may also suffer from a much longer period of covid-19 threat it is also noteworthy that the overall trend of the solution of scenario 1 initial surge without special constraints figure 7a  is similar to that for italy which had delayed response to the covid-19 outbreak initially figure 6a  and scenario 3 solution a lower peak value and a longer duration due to social distancing figure 7b  is similar to that for japan which has been taken social distancing actions figure 6c  the simulated particle plumes plotted in figure 8 reveal the subtle discrepancy between the three mitigation scenarios scenario 1 assumes that four initial cases were initially located on the right side of the city while the whole population 10000 susceptible persons was distributed randomly in the 11 domain  figure 8a  the trajectory of each person is assumed to follow two-dimensional brownian motion with retention to capture the random vector for each displacement and the random waiting time between two consecutive motions the virus moved quickly from east to west figures 8b and 8c  spreading over the whole city before all the infected people were cured or expired dead at time t69 figures 8d  a total of 664 susceptible people 66 of the total population distributed randomly around the city were never infected scenario 2 assumes that social distancing can reduce the infection probability which can be characterized by a smaller reaction rate or a smaller interaction radius in our lagrangian approach figure 8i can still cause the spread of coronavirus figures 8j8l  self-quarantine therefore may not be as effective as maintained social distancing the covid-19 pandemic radically impacts our lives altering our daily patterns and interactions in an unprecedented way and rate in this study the transmissioninfection and   economic impact of government interventions during the covid-19 pandemic international evidence from financial markets badar ashraf nadeem   the outbreak of highly contagious covid-19 pandemic came as a surprise event with unprecedented uncertainty with respect to how deadly disease really is and whether and when can we get a vaccine in response governments across the world scrambled with emergency actions such as lockdowns travel restrictions testing and quarantining and economic packages the main purpose of these actions was to ensure social distancing among people to contain the spread of the disease on the one hand while to minimize the adverse economic impact on the other hand however these actions generated additional uncertainty regarding their effectiveness and impact for instance lockdowns though could be effective in reducing new infections increased the economic distancing as well thereby hurting the jobs and incomes of tens of millions of people despite the fact that long-term effect of these government actions yet has to be seen in this paper we examine their expected impact by analyzing the stock markets reaction to these actions stock markets which include the pool of sophisticated and opinionated investors provide an incentivized survey of future expected outcomes wagner 2020 argues stock markets provide particularly useful information in fast evolving complex situations particularly we examine stock markets reaction to three types of government actions including social distancing measures containment and health response and income support packages social distancing measures include the closure of schools workplaces parks public transport among others containment and health response is mainly about government public awareness campaigns and testing and quarantining policy income support packages include the government financial assistance to households in the form of direct cash transfers or relief in debt or other payments for utilities we postulate that these government actions have both direct and indirect effects on stock market returns for the direct effects social distancing measures might have direct negative effect on stock market returns by adversely affecting economic activity on the contrary government containment and health response and income support packages are likely to lead to positive market reaction by enhancing the investors confidence and reducing the adverse economic effects due to the disease the indirect effect of these government actions channels through the reduction in the intensity of covid-19 outbreaks comprehensive and strict government actions such as stringent social distancing measures aggressive testing and quarantining policy and generous government income support programs might reduce the rate of new infections building on the recently emerging literature which reports that stock markets around the world have reacted to covid-19 pandemic with strong negative returns al-awadhi et al 2020 ashraf 2020a baker et al 2020 ramelli and wagner 2020 zhang et al 2020 we argue that if strict government actions reduce the intensity of local outbreaks then they weaken the negative market reaction to the growth in covid-19 confirmed cases to empirically examine the above hypothesized relationships we use a panel dataset of daily stock market returns government responses and the growth in covid-19 confirmed cases from 77 countries over the period january 22 to april 17 2020 after controlling for country characteristics and systematic risk due to international factors we find that social distancing measures have direct negative impact on stock returns while an indirect positive impact by reducing the growth rate of new confirmed cases containment and health policies and income support packages have direct positive impact on stock returns but do not affect stock returns indirectly through the reduction in growth in confirmed cases together our results provide evidence that stock markets have priced in the impact of government actions results remain robust against alternative sample compositions and alternative estimation methods we offer at least two important contributions to the existing literature first we add to the emerging literature which examines the impact of covid-19 on financial sector outcomes in this regard recent literature surveys by goodell 2020 and yarovaya et al 2020 suggest that covid-19 pandemic might have important impact on the functioning of financial sector and is a promising research domain focusing on more specific issues corbet et al 2020a examined the impact of being named corona on stock returns and find that the companies with corona word in their names experienced strong negative hourly returns and an exceptionally large increase in hourly volatility when covid-19 pandemic was announced likewise sharif et al 2020 find that the pandemic has a greater effect on the us geopolitical risk and economic uncertainty than on the us stock market debating the safe heaven properties of different assets corbet et al 2020b conlon and mcgee 2020 and conlon et al 2020 conclude that crypto assets largely do not act as hedges or safe havens but perhaps rather as amplifiers of contagion during the bear market amid the pandemic on the other hand goodell and goutte 2020 analyze the bitcoin reaction to daily covid-19 world deaths and show that bitcoin is a safe haven asset moreover sharif et al 2020 find gold and soybean futures as having strong safe-haven role during the covid-19 outbreak in this regard we examine how stock markets reacted to government actions aimed to control the pandemic besides we also examine how government actions interact with local covid-19 outbreaks to affect the stock market returns second we complement the recent studies which examine the impact of covid-19 on financial markets al-awadhi et al 2020 ali et al 2020 ashraf 2020a baker et al 2020 haroon and rizvi 2020 ramelli and wagner 2020 schell et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 for instance focusing on stock market volatility baker et al 2020 compared the reaction of us stock market to various infectious diseases and found that covid-19 has inflicted the unprecedented volatility likewise zhang et al 2020 examined the volatility of ten stock markets in the countries with most confirmed cases over the months of january and february 2020 and found that volatility increased substantially in february due to covid-19 focusing on stock market returns alfaro et al 2020 use data from the us and found that equity market value declined in response to pandemics such as covid-19 and sars likewise al-awadhi et al 2020 found overall share prices declined in china due to the expected adverse economic outcomes of covid-19 ashraf 2020a examined data from 64 countries and found that overall stock markets reacted negatively to the covid-19 outbreak however this reaction was only significant to the growth in number of confirmed cases but not to the growth in number of deaths we add to this literature by finding that stringent social distancing measures have significantly weakened the stock markets negative reaction to the growth in covid-19 confirmed cases in this regard our study is comparable to ashraf 2020b who shows that higher national-level uncertainty avoidance significantly strengthens the negative stock markets reaction to the growth in covid-19 confirmed cases the rest of the paper proceeds as follows section 2 introduces data collection procedure section 3 introduces the indexes which measure government response during the covid-19 pandemic section 4 explains testable hypotheses section 5 is about empirical model section 6 reports empirical results final section concludes the study for the purpose of this study we mainly collected data from three main sources daily stock market returns data was collected from the wwwinvestingcom website this data was available for around 80 countries to maintain consistency we choose only one major stock index from each sample country next we downloaded the data of daily covid-19 confirmed cases for each country from the john hopkins university coronavirus resource centre jhu-crc website lastly we collected data of government response indexes from the oxcgrt website we chose sample period from january 22 to april 17 2020 we selected this sample period because both early covid-19 confirmed cases and government responses in each country mainly occurred during this period for example ramelli and wagner 2020 argue that the most important period regarding market reaction to covid-19 was from january 20 to march 20 2020 likewise hale et al 2020a show that average global government response curves flattened and even started declining from mid-april onward we appended three datasets together to get the main sample we applied two filters to refine the main sample first we dropped countries with missing data of stock returns covid-19 confirmed cases or government response indexes second we dropped daily observations with missing values of any of the required variables our refined sample consists of 2750 daily observations from 77 countries over the period january 22 to april 17 2020 table 1 reports basic information about the sample distribution 
 we use oxford covid-19 government response tracker oxcgrt database hale et al 2020b to quantify governments response to covid-19 led crisis oxcgrt has measured governments responses with three main indexes stringency index containment and health index and economic support index stringency index records information on social distancing measures and is coded from 8 indicators including school closing workplace closing cancel public events restrictions on gathering size close public transport stay at home requirements restrictions on internal movement and restrictions on international travel economic support index is constructed from 2 indicators including the government income support and debtcontract relief for households programs this index represents government policies regarding income support to citizens amid crisis containment and health index is coded from 3 indicators representing public awareness campaigns testing policy and contact tracing this index represents government emergency policies regarding health system such as the covid-19 testing regime each of the three indexes is simple additive score of the underlying indicators and is rescaled to vary from 0 to 100 the indexes are for comparative purposes and should not be interpreted as a rating of the appropriateness or effectiveness of a countrys response hale et al 2020a appendix reports detailed definitions of these government response indexes in this section we draw testable hypotheses regarding the direct and indirect impact of announcements of government social distancing measures containment and health policies and economic support programs on stock market returns social distancing saves lives on the one hand while imposes large costs on society due to the reduced economic activity on the other hand therefore government actions such as lockdowns and travel restrictions targeted to ensure social distancing are expected to have both direct and indirect effects on stock returns for the direct effect such policies have adverse economic impact by shutting down places of work such as schools offices and factories for instance sauvagnat et al 2020 estimate that a 10 increase in state-level labor restrictions in the us led to a 3 drop in employment and a 187 drop in firms market value in the month of april 2020 only when investors price these adverse valuation effects the stringent government social distancing measures lead to decline in stock market returns based on this discussion we write our first hypothesis in the following form 
h1a the announcements of government social distancing measures lead to decline in stock market returns despite the direct negative effect on economic activity social distancing might also have positive economic impact by reducing the risk of mortalities greenstone and nigam 2020 thunstrm et al 2020 in this regard greenstone and nigam 2020 estimate that moderate social distancing in the usa beginning from late march 2020 would save 17 million lives by october 1 in the usa the major chunk of lives saved is due to avoided overwhelming of hospital intensive care units using the estimates of the united states governments value of a statistical life they project 8 trillion economic benefits of social distancing through reduction in mortalities likewise thunstrm et al 2020 estimate a net benefit of about 52 trillion of social distancing in the usa the people in countries where government implemented stringent social distancing policies are more likely to practice social distancing hussain 2020 and hence have lower chances to get infected and consequently die from the virus thus the benefits of social distancing mainly channeled through the reduction in new infections a number of recent studies show that stock markets reacted to the growth in covid-19 confirmed cases with negative returns al-awadhi et al 2020 ashraf 2020a we postulate if social distancing has positive impact by reducing new infections then stringent government social distancing measures would weaken the negative stock market reaction to the growth in confirmed cases our specific hypothesis is as follows 
h1b the announcements of stringent government social distancing measures are likely to weaken the stock markets negative reaction to the growth in covid-19 confirmed cases likewise stock market reaction to government measures regarding the containment and healthcare system might be positive for instance government aggressive information campaign provides awareness about the benefits of staying at home sanitize common places and washing hands regularly moreover testing and contact tracing helps to identify infected and suspected cases in the early phases of the pandemic countries such as south korea and japan have achieved enormous success in controlling the local outbreaks through extensive testing and contact tracing better healthcare policies are likely to lead to positive market reaction by boosting investors confidence and trust in government to control the pandemic 
h2a the announcements of government containment and healthcare policies lead to increase in stock market returns further better containment and health policies are likely to produce benefits in terms of lower new infections and mortality rates lower mortality rate in turn provides enormous economic benefits in terms of more saved lives greenstone and nigam 2020 thunstrm et al 2020 therefore we hypothesis if public awareness campaigns and testing and contact tracing have positive impact by reducing new infections then announcements of containment and health policies would weaken the negative stock market reaction to the growth in confirmed cases 
h2b the announcement of government containment and health policies are likely to weaken the stock markets negative reaction to the growth in covid-19 confirmed cases finally stock market reaction to government economic support programs is likely to be positive economic support programs to some extent can counter adverse impact of the social distancing measures on incomes and employment direct cash transfers help households to buy essential goods while staying under lockdowns therefore investors might react positively to such actions and our specific hypothesis is as under 
h3a the announcements of government economic support programs lead to increase stock market returns income support programs might also affect stock returns by reducing the infection rate due to higher compliance with social distancing measures recent studies such as lou et al 2020 and wright et al 2020 find that compliance with stay-at-home orders varies significantly with income where lower-income groups are less likely to follow the orders and more likely to get exposed to the virus since income support is largely provided to poor segments of the society more generous income support programs can lead to reduction in infection rates by motivating lower income individuals to stay at home 
h3b the announcements of government income support packages are likely to weaken the stock markets negative reaction to the growth in covid-19 confirmed cases following ashraf 2020a we specify following pooled panel ordinary least squares regression model to examine the direct impact of government actions on stock market returns 1yctc1governmentresponsect2covid19ct1c1c1ccct1t1tdtct
 here y is the dependent variable and measures stock market returns in county c on day t c is a constant term specifically daily stock market return equals indexvaluetindexvaluet1indexvaluet1 government response is represented with the daily change in three government response indexes from oxcgrt dataset hale et al 2020b these variables include stringency index containment and health index and economic support index following ashraf 2020a who found that stock markets reaction was significant to covid-19 cases but not to fatalities we measure covid-19 as the daily growth in covid-19 confirmed cases in a cross-country setting investors reaction to similar events might vary due to specific institutional or cultural contexts of countries ashraf 2020b since our study sample is very short most of the country-level factors remain fixed therefore rather than to include individual country-level control variables we add a matrix of country fixed-effects dummy variables these dummy variables effectively control for all factors which remain fixed over the sample period but differ across sample countries stock markets also react to international events such as oil prices or major international events with strong spill-over effects across borders to control for this systematic risk due to international factors we include daily fixed-effects dummy variables dt in the model ct is an error term we use heteroskedastic-robust standard errors to estimate p-values in regressions we modify eq 1 as follows to examine the indirect impact of government actions on stock market returns through the channel of reduction in new infections 2yctc1governmentresponsect2covid19ct13governmentresponsectcovid19ct1c1c1ccct1t1tdtct
 the interaction term governmentresponsectcovid19ct1 is the main variable of interest where the estimated values of coefficient 3 show whether the stock market reaction to the growth in covid-19 confirmed cases depends on government actions we use interaction terms for each of the three government response indexes with growth in confirmed cases all other variables are same as in eq 1 
 this section reports empirical results table 2 reports summary statistics for main variables the stock market returns variable has a mean value of 000 with a standard deviation of 003 zero mean value confirms the random walk property of stock market returns the 017 mean value of the growth in confirmed covid-19 cases variable indicates on average covid-19 cases observed a 17 percent daily increase the minimum and maximum values of government response indexes show that governments have responded with significant changes in policies 
table 3 reports main empirical results model 1 is the baseline specification the growth in confirmed cases variable enters negative and significant this result confirms the findings of previous studies such as al-awadhi et al 2020 alfaro et al 2020 and ashraf 2020a that stock markets reacted to covid-19 outbreaks with strong negative returns and validates our model for further analysis we include government response indexes in model 2 the stringency index enters negative and significant showing that stock markets react with negative returns to government actions regarding increase in social distancing measures this result indicates that corporate valuations on average decline due to the adverse effect of social distancing on economic activity and supports our hypothesis h1a both containment and health and economic support indexes enter positive showing that overall stock markets reacted to these government actions with positive returns however the result of economic support index is not statistically significant one possible reason is that economic support index which we use measures the income and debt relief support to households but not to businesses therefore stock market reaction to these actions though positive is not very strong on the contrary stock markets might have reacted more strongly to financial support to businesses which unfortunately economic support index does not measure future studies might focus on this area 
next we examine how government actions interact with the growth in covid-19 confirmed cases to affect stock market returns as shown in model 3 the interaction term growth in confirmed cases  stringency index enters positive and significant suggesting that the negative impact of growth in confirmed cases on stock market returns weakens in countries with more stringent social distancing measures this result confirms that markets take social distancing positively because of its effectiveness in reducing the number of covid-19 confirmed cases other two interaction terms growth in confirmed cases  containment and health index and growth in confirmed cases  economic support index are not statistically significant suggesting that the impact of government actions related to healthcare and income support is not channeled through the reduction in confirmed cases together these results suggest investors expect that government social distancing measures are the most effective mechanism to contain the disease while public awareness and testing and quarantining policies are less so 
following ashraf et al 2020 we use graphical approach to explain the moderating effect of government actions on the relationship between stock returns and growth in confirmed cases with interaction terms for doing so we graph relationship between stock returns and growth in confirmed cases at mean and  one standard deviation of mean value of all three government response indexes one-by-one graphs 1 2 and 3 in fig 1 are drawn from model 3 of table 3 the overall downward slopped lines in these graphs show that stock market returns and growth in confirmed cases are negatively associated however lines with different slopes in each graph show that the negative association between stock returns and growth in confirmed cases varies with variation in government actions this variation is the strongest in graph 1 for social distancing measures where the slope of the lower line with embedded circles turns to be positive as compared to the negative slope of the upper line with embedded squares this suggests when government implements stringent social distancing measures the stock markets negative reaction to the growth in confirmed cases not only weakens but becomes positive in graphs 2 and 3 slopes of upper and lower lines change only slightly and remain negative confirming that government actions regarding containment and health and economic support do not significantly moderate the negative association between stock returns and growth in confirmed cases we perform several robustness tests to further confirm the above results in this regard first we replace country fixed-effects dummies with country-level macroeconomic and institutional control variables specifically following ashraf 2020a we include log gdp investment freedom democratic accountability and uncertainty avoidance definitions of these variables are given in appendix log gdp variable controls for the differences in economic development of countries investment freedom index measures the easiness with which foreign investors can invest in a country and controls for the presence of foreign competition in local financial market democratic accountability index controls for the cross-country differences in political institutions likewise uncertainty avoidance index controls for the differences in uncertainty aversion of stock market investors from different countries as shown in table 4 the main results largely are similar to those in table 3 even after replacing country fixed-effects dummies with specific country-level control variables second we use panel random-effects model as an alternative estimation method and re-estimate all specifications of table 3 in unreported results1
we observe findings largely remain similar as in table 3 in this paper we examine the expected economic impact of government actions such as social distancing measures public awareness programs testing and quarantining policies and economic support packages during the covid-19 pandemic by analyzing the effect of such actions on stock market returns for empirical analysis we use the daily data of stock market returns growth in covid-19 confirmed cases and announcements regarding government policies from 77 countries over the period january 22 to april 17 2020 we find the announcements regarding the implementation of social distancing measures by governments have dual a direct negative and an indirect positive effect on stock market returns specifically the announcements of social distancing measures result in negative stock market returns due to their expected adverse impact on economic activity while these announcements lead to positive market returns through the channel of reduction in covid-19 confirmed cases government announcements regarding public awareness programs testing and quarantining policies and income support packages largely result in positive market returns our findings have important implications though some studies such as heyden and heyden 2020 shanaev et al 2020 and zaremba et al 2020 show government social distancing measures are counterproductive however we show that such measures also have indirect beneficial economic impact through the channel of reduction in the intensity of covid-19 outbreaks therefore it is difficult to predict their net impact on economic outcomes and more research needs to be done with the availability of further data to better understand the economic impact of such government measures our findings to some extent are aligned with correia et al 2020 who find that stringent non-pharmaceutical interventions used across the us cities during the 1918 flu pandemic led to better economic outcomes in the medium run as the frequency of pandemics including contagious diseases has increased over recent decades ross et al 2015 a consensus regarding the net economic impact of government social distancing measures can help in designing better government response in the future the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper  covid-19 pandemic emerging perspectives and future trends syed tabish amin   human population faces a grave health-related challenge in the form of infectious diseases that are responsible for the highest number of deaths globally the tiniest primitive invisible life form is now controlling the behavior of the most powerful and evolved life form on earth tough times ahead 12 between 1940 and 2020 around 340 new infectious diseases have emerged globally the compromised health and disability due to infectious diseases which accounts for 30 of all disability- adjusted life years decreases work productivity and increases morbidity12 since the dawn of civilization humans and microbes have co-existed and interacted with each other is the situation worse now the answer to this question might be yes it is because of our immense population and our several activities that lead to flourishing of infections modern civilization dates back to approximately 10000 bc we are consuming earths resources at a rate that is unsustainable at around 8000 bc the global human population was 5 million by 1 ad the population grew up to 200 million it reached around 1 billion in the 1800s during industrial revolution the second billion was achieved in only 130 years 1930 the third billion in 30 years 1960 the fourth billion in 15 years 1974 and the fifth billion in only 13 years 1987 during the 20th century alone the population in the world has grown from 165 billion to 6 billion it is projected to reach 14 to 18 billion by the end of the 21st century3 today sars-cov-2 has spread to 216 countries areas and territories with nearly 6310635 infected cases and 374723 deaths as on 1 june 2020 and has officially been termed as a pandemic by who on 11th march 2020 most of the covid- 19-related deaths occurred in the usa united kingdom italy france spain germany belgium brazil iran turkey etc4 in a global world with hyperconnected international travel and transport points of entry poes - airports ports and ground crossings - could play a key role in the worldwide spread of diseases the travel and transport sectors are indispensable part of public health emergency preparedness and response actions related to poes most of the human respiratory infections caused by coronaviruses including nl63 oc43 hku1 and hcov-229e are mild in nature however in the past two decades two beta-coronaviruses middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarscov have severely infected more than 10000 individuals with mortality rates of 37 and 10 respectively5 the fatality rate of covid-19 is lower than both of these infections6 the pattern of infection of covid-19 is unique and unpredictable previous studies have suggested that similar to sarscov covid-19 might interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans the amino acid sequence of the nucleocapsid n protein of covid-19 is 90 identical to that of sars-cov covid-19 might cross-react with the n protein antibodies of sars-cov however these antibodies might not provide cross-immunity in addition similar to sars-cov sars-cov-2 might inhibit the rna interference defense mechanism of the host organism7 super-spreaders release significantly higher levels of viral particles compared to other infected individuals which increases their chances of spreading the infection coronaviruses are enveloped non-segmented positive-sense rna viruses belonging to the family coronaviridae and order nidovirales coronaviruses target the upper respiratory tract which leads to several ailments including pneumonia however they might also affect the central nervous system that leads to longterm neurological damage the rna genome of coronavirus encodes for sixteen nonstructural proteins nsp 116 with known or predicted rna synthesis and modification functions and they have also been suggested to trigger evolution of large genomes8 virus characteristics primarily define the risk of infection these characteristics include the efficacy of the virus to spread the severity of the disease after infection and the efficacy and success rates of the available medical resources to contain the spread of the virus with no vaccine or medication community intervention becomes the most important response strategy against a pandemic in a nutshell covid-19 risk can be defined as the risk of exposure versus risk of serious illness and death the general risk factors of covid-19 include advanced age and chronic medical conditions such as diabetes cardiac disorders etc reducing the number of emerging cases to a level where health-care facilities can adequately manage them is important to flatten the curve the world responded to covid-19 pandemic with remarkable speed and resource mobilization within a matter of weeks the causative agent for this pandemic was identified and sequenced by the chinese scientists further genomic and clinical data were shared rapidly around the world to date various potential treatments have been proposed for this virus however none of the antiviral treatments have been approved there is still no vaccine available for covid-19 with ongoing research it can be assumed that we would soon have a vaccine for sars-cov-2 social distancing is crucial in the regulation of the spread of the infection at community level it plays an indirect role in prevention of the overwhelming of our health care systems by reducing the number of infection persons and the rate of infection however social distancing tests the degree of cooperation among humans there is a correlation between perceived social connectedness and stress responses more prominent effect could be observed on those who are already lonely or isolated better mental health is critical for better physical health prioritizing mental health is important during times of high stress in the digital age and information superhighway people are fortunate to live in an era where technology will allow us to see and hear our friends and family even from a distance having said that social distancing is not a permanent state this is a moment in time a multifarious approach is required and involvement of community leaders is critical responsible electronic and print media also have an important role to play governments around the world are struggling with the question of how to reopen their economies while still containing the virus the covid-19 could become endemic like hiv it is here to stay and it is impossible to predict that when this pandemic is supposed to control this would take a massive effort even if a vaccine was found it is still possible to control the virus with effort strong and robust control of the virus is required in order to lower the assessment of risk everyone should contribute to stopping this pandemic both life and livelihood are important deprivation is unacceptable shelter food healthcare and subsistence for weaker sections of population are the key challenges poor like migrant workers and casual labourers eat from garbage containers which is a disgrace equally important is the care of internally displaced people and refugees they need special attention shaping the future is critical as schools remain closed during the pandemic the education of many children for whom long distance learning is unavailable stands at great risk nations must do everything in their power to protect children from the dire consequences teens are feeling lonely and anxious in isolation poor children with limited access and illiteratesemi-literate parents are in serious trouble they are losing out this will impact them severely as the pandemic pushes up levels of hunger among the global poor governments must prevent devastating nutrition and health consequences for children missing out on school meals amid school closures the covid-19 pandemic could also lead to the spread of other preventable diseases economic recovery from covid-19 will be much harder according to the global health security index 2019 india ranked 57th among 100 countries on a scale to gauge preparedness for the outbreak of serious infectious diseases densely populated cities low awareness and unhygienic conditions can turn this outbreak into an epidemic in a matter of days shortage of health facilities like hospital beds rapid testing facilities healthcare equipment and quarantine facilities would lay immense burden on an already over-stretched healthcare system india with over 138 billion population must have robust and evidence-based health care management and action plans in place along with extraordinary monitoring supervision and continuous assessment to control this pandemic while maintaining a zero-breach screening system must be a priority it is equally important to ramp up the preparedness to meet any major outbreak if it occurs india does not at present has the infrastructure and preparedness to face the challenges community spread is already here containment facilities must be established right away and human resource should be effectively trained in handling patients to minimize chances of virus spread india has two major challenges the size of population and limited resources rapid diagnosis is a very critical aspect in the collective response to covid-19 some states in india are experimenting with containment zones they could consider employing the cluster containment strategy which includes containment of the pandemic within a defined region with high rate of infection and thus preventing its spread to new areas the bhilwada model included a complete citywide curfew an extensive follow-up and testing of its residents and travel ban this approach is considered to be more flex- ible and efficient after implementation of this approach intensive risk communication campaign can be employed to encourage the citizens to stay in their homes for an initial period of 28 days which can later be extended after subsequent risk assessment the government of india has decided to divide the entire country into three regions red orange and green based on the severity of the infection rates however the restrictions should be lifted in a staggered manner otherwise it can lead to a deadly resurgence india is far short of resources required to impede the pandemic nearly 41 of the population lack basic handwashing facility indias health system cannot handle the upcoming turmoil and the government has done a great job containing the virus till now this time should be used for consolidating patient-level data clinical labs images and outcomes from the cases around the world starting with india and free access should be given to all the researchers this data could have three potential applications population- level predictions patient-level predictions of outcomes and quicker and more effective diagnosis indian government ordered a nationwide sudden severe and absolute lockdown on 24th march 2020 which is likely to end on 1 june 2020 however owing the immediate imposition of the lockdown proper planning could not be implemented migrant workers daily wagers manual laborers and informal workers were left to fend for themselves hundreds of thousands had to walk over 400 kilometers to reach their homes in rural areas as they had no job or source of income in locked down metropolitan cities government should have arranged for shelter food and money for these poor people before ordering lockdown initially india also lagged behind in testing on an average 10000 tests were conducted a day now 15000 per day which was too small for a huge population of 138 billion contact tracing has also been weak health professionals do not have enough ppe there is a shortage of ventilators and ppe all over the country indias economy might be heading for its first full-year contraction in more than four decades the lockdown would result in an 8 output loss and would also have indirect consequences such as persistent fear community after the lockdown is over it has been predicted that the gross domestic production would decrease by 04 and 01 till the end of this year and till march 2021 respectively the lockdown will adversely affect the unorganized workforce as well as the banking and the corporate sectors overall a precipitous recession is inevitable in india covid-19 has been a disaster for the americans to date the us has had the highest number of covid-19-related cases and deaths than other countries the american governments inaction has allowed the virus to spread inside its borders and it has actively increased the risk to other countries a faulty diagnostic kit rolled out by the american centre for disease control and prevention and slow approvals for other testing kits led to the disease spreading under the nose of the administration the key problem with the kits was their negative control cdcs test uses the polymerase chain reaction pcr assay to find tiny amounts of the sars-cov-2 genome in say a nose swab to make sure a test is working properly kits also include dna unrelated to sars-cov- 2 the assay should not react to this negative control but the cdc reagents did react with it at many but not all state labs9 because of slow initial response to the pandemic tens of thousands more people might die millions more might lose their jobs if the situation is not brought under control immediately social distancing and lockdown are inescapable necessities the need of the day is to prioritize diagnostic tests and strengthen laboratory response network laboratories in all the major cities and government hospitals must be prepared to handle the diagnostic burden rapid diagnostic kits to identify the virus are currently being tested at different centers their testing readiness and approvals must be prioritized and sped up to ensure adequate diagnostic preparedness effective communication is an indispensable tool the indian state of kerala which is the first state in india to encounter the disease tackled the outbreak with a combination of swift measures travel curbs and effective communication timely dissemination of surveillance data as well as effective communication with the healthcare system allowed the state to contain the threat and prevent panic at the same time the governments must effectively communicate with all the stakeholders including hospitals health professionals diagnostic facilities as well as the general public a daily advisory informing everyone about the situation the need for precautions and travel restrictions will help keep a check on the disease at the community level professional management of health care delivery is an essential component of a successful program to contain this great challenge before us effective mitigation is an equally important component of the overall strategy clinical diagnosis is done on the basis of symptoms chest imaging data etc however the infection can be confirmed only by genetic testing of the samples obtained from the respiratory tract such as throat swabs due to absence of an appropriate antiviral therapy the patients are kept on supportive care10 the suspected individuals must be isolated until confirmation if they are confirmed to be positive then they must be quarantined furthermore since asymptomatic transmission is also possible it is necessary to test all the persons who have been in the areas with known transmission in addition the symptomatic mothers who are still breastfeeding must maintain proper hygiene before and after handling the baby it might be more efficient to obtain the samples from the suspected individuals and then send them home with appropriate instructions to maintain proper hygiene and to use respiratory masks until the test results come back in case of shortage of hospital beds the infected individuals who are not severely ill could be isolated and treated at their own homes no hospitalization is needed unless the symptoms worsen this strategy could be employed to save the hospital capacity for the needier people and prevent unintended infections to the otherwise healthy individuals while they await their test results at the hospital it is necessary to develop point-of-care diagnostic tests to rapidly test for 2019-ncov infection in general population such tests could be widely used at checkpoints in hospitals and even in homes for suspicious persons moreover they can also be used after every few weeks to check if any asymptomatic person is unintentionally spreading the virus however the individuals who are screened positive by these tests would still have to undergo laboratory tests for confirmation covid-19 infection has led to the development of clusters of pneumonia with manifestations similar to those of sars-cov infection covid-19 infection might lead to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome admission to the icu and even death the severity of the infection might also be associated with the development of cytokine storm syndrome the community-level of covd-19 diagnosis is achievable via the aid of accurate and scalable point-of-care poc tests1112 such poc tests could help in obtaining rapid diagnosis which in turn could facilitate early detection of covid-19 cases and adequate use of resources and implementation of preventive measures currently several such tests are in development phases different devices may be more suitable for diagnosing new cases on infection while others especially those that test for the presence of antibodies are better suited to determining whether an individual has previously been infected13 the rates of evolution and mutations in coronaviruses are very high which makes it difficult to develop a vaccine against them even after quick diagnosis decision of an adequate treatment is very challenging in this regard government support and funding play a crucial role because the processes like development of vaccine and antiviral agents require decades of research and assessment another danger posed by this pandemic on peoples lives arises from the disrupted supply of personal protective equipment ppe due to increase in demand hoarding misuse panic buying etc south korea has shown an exemplary performance by significantly slowing the infection spread in the country with a population of 50 million without any lockdowns or other severe measures that were adopted by china south korea had a well-organized testing program that involved efficient isolation of the infected individuals as well as their contacts in south korea more than 270000 people have been tested which indicates that more than 5200 tests per million individuals have been conducted there in the us only 74 tests per million individuals have been conducted south korea has demonstrated that diagnosis at large scale is key to epidemic control along with case isolation and contact tracing 14 a speedy recovery would depend on most of the world getting the pandemic under control or achieving herd immunity today we are confronted with an unprecedented crisis this world has never experienced before the global economy has hit the worst recession due to the covid-19 pandemic the pandemic and societys responses to it are hitting the economies across the world simultaneously suffering both a demand and a supply shock the worst economic fallout since the great depression is anticipated the international monetary fund imf on 14th april 2020 slashed growth forecast for the indian economy projecting a gdp growth of 19 in 2020 the covid-19 has forced the general population around the world to rethink their daily lifestyle in response to travel bans school closures and social distancing recommendations to limit the spread of the virus many people have turned to digital tools to keep some semblance of normality according to the international labour organization the labor and economic crisis induced by the covid-19 pandemic could lead to a rise in global employment from 53 million to 247 million overall the global impact of this pandemic has been predicted to be around 01 to 04 of global gdp15 the uns trade and development agency unctad predicted that the economic triggered by covid-19 might cost the global economy 2 trillion in 2020 the most prominent adverse economic impact would be faced by the already heavily-indebted developing countries particularly commodity exporters16 in the long-term the pandemic will reduce the productive capacity of the global economy greater moves toward selective self-sufficiency can be anticipated given supply the chain vulnerability covid-19 pandemic might result in permanent shifts in political and economic powers many businesses that rely on human contact are already feeling an immediate impact and we expect to see significant changes across all industries many countries will have difficulty in recovering from the present scenario in the aftermath of pandemic people will rush to regain their sense of equilibrium and normalcy the nations that responded early to the pandemic such as korea taiwan singapore hong kong and china have emerged as victors and will write the history according to un report regarding the impact of covid-19 on children covid-19 can cause deaths of hundreds of thousands of children furthermore in the aftermath of this crisis 42-66 million more children could fall into poverty the impact of this pandemic could essentially reverse the recent improvements in infant mortality the children living in slums refugee camps and regions of active conflicts would suffer the most from this crisis furthermore unicef has reported that practically all the schools have been closed globally this has directly affected the education and indirectly affected the nutrition of the children with schools shutdown around 310 million children who are dependent on the school meals now miss a vital part of their nutrition17 another concern is delay in routine immunization of children that makes them vulnerable to disease once the pandemic is over every child in need must be vaccinated unprecedented international solidarity is crucial for children and humanity as scientists strive to understand the respiratory covid-19 disease and its causal agent the need for aggressive and fruitful research on the subject is the need of the hour during sars outbreak south korea had learned the importance of being prepared with emergence of novel coronavirus korea centers for disease control and prevention kcdc raced to develop commercial test kits in cooperation with industrial manufacturers they also designed the following protocol severely ill patients are first hospitalized the individuals with moderate symptoms are sent to repurposed facilities for basic medical support if they are tested negative twice then they are released the individuals with minimal symptoms are advised to quarantine themselves for two weeks the covid-19 pandemic is tackled by various strategies some of these strategies include minimizing human-to-human transmissions to reduce secondary transmissions identifying and isolating infected individuals at early stages minimizing transmission via animals elucidating the factors that affect clinical severity accelerating the development of diagnostic kits and vaccines communicating the risk factors to arise awareness among the communities minimizing the spread of misinformation and minimizing the economic and social impacts the four key stages of any pandemic include investigation recognition initiation and acceleration maximum number of infected individuals is found at the end of the acceleration phase this stage is finally followed by a deceleration stage in which the number of infected individuals decreases to reduce community spreads mass gatherings must be discouraged increased incidences of community spread would lead to increase in the number of individuals who would need medical care this would surely lead to overloading of healthcare systems due to increased hospitalizations and deaths currently the primary global focus is on minimizing the spread of the virus everyone can do their part to help us respond to this emerging public health threat the early studies on covid-19 from hubei province in china have reported case series of hospitalized covid-19 patients and could provide information regarding the severe end of the disease spectrum based on these reports about 81 of covid-19 patients suffer from only mild fever and do not require hospitalization there have note bee extensive reports on such patients yet18 the absence of adequate ppe leads to a much higher risk of exposure to healthy individuals who are either close to infected persons or are working in healthcare systems putting high-risk persons under quarantine with minimal public interactions could play a key role in the spread of sars-cov-2 clinicians should work in association with public health departments on a case-bycase basis vaccine development is crucial a faster way has to be developed to identify antibodies that neutralize the virus researchers have to generate lung tissue models called organoids to test candidate drugs for covid-19 and harness the power of individual genomes to identify variants that raise or lower peoples risk of serious illness when infected by sars-cov-2 more than 90 vaccines for the sars-cov-2 are at various stages of development some six groups have already begun injecting formulations into volunteers in safety trials others have started testing in animals we need a drug or combination of drugs that work remdesivir has generated hope it is an antiviral and works by attacking an enzyme that a virus needs in order to replicate inside our cells experts believe that remdesivir has a clear-cut significant positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery thus can block this virus it may prove to be a magic bullet covid-19 pandemic management requires a planned proactive strategy for efficient prevention and control of the virus life threatening situations demand extraordinary response and more stringent measures to contain the pandemic extreme social distancing and avoiding public places like theatres clubs and pubs can flatten the pandemic curve and peak it may place huge pressure on the society we are living through an unprecedented biopsychosocial crisis we find ourselves in a time of great economic social and medical uncertainty the human cost of covid pandemic could be extraordinary it endangers thousands of lives the pandemic has catalysed the development of novel coronavirus vaccines across the biotech industry future pandemics are likely to happen more frequently spread more rapidly have greater economic impact and kill more people if we are not extremely careful about the possible impacts of the choices we make today nations have to build a healthier world by focusing on the shared good health of human and nature covid pandemic has exposed the health systems weaknesses and deficiencies of most if not all countries science is failing all over health care workers around the world have shown unimaginable bravery dedication and commitment to helping others during the pandemic often at great risk to themselves countries like new zealand south korea taiwan singapore hong kong vietnam have done exceptionally well to contain the spread of covid-19 new zealand has shown the way decisive action going hard and going early helped to stamp out the worst of virus testing was done widely the covid-19 pandemic highlights the need to protect people from health emergencies as well as to promote universal health coverage and healthier populations to keep people from needing health services through multisectoral interventions like improving basic hygiene and sanitation the covid-19 pandemic demands action on many fronts from prevention to testing to treatment we need to create simple cheap more accessible testing for sarscov- 2 the virus that causes covid-19 both in humans and on various surfaces scientists have to develop a faster way to identify antibodies that neutralize the virus it is crucial to identify any antibodies that inadvertently help the virus enter cells so researchers who are developing vaccines can avoid including those antibodies there are some opportunities to pursue other interventions in the short- and long-term that could save lives till proper treatment or vaccine is made available people have to rely on social distancing contact tracing self-isolation and other measures to end this pandemic we must act in solidarity nations will have endemic sars-cov-2 infection for the foreseeable future a structured and well-coordinated approach is critical for success global crisis needs global action collaboration among the researchers clinicians industry and government is critical for efficient disease diagnosis improved basic and clinical research devising of appropriate countermeasures timely manufacture of relevant drugs and vaccines and adequate therapeutic management of infected individuals pandemic will disproportionally harm the poor globally this is because they lack access to health care and have lower immunity nations responses to existing inequalities is critical moreover safety of health workers must be strengthened world is facing such an unprecedented global crisis every day refugee and migrant children and those affected by conflict face major threats to their safety and well-being the pandemic is deepening inequalities and millions more women and girls now risk losing the ability to plan their families and protect their bodies and their health group upon group of terrified starving exhausted people leave the cities they built carrying with them precious items packed into sacks some clothes biscuit packets bread they flee on foot bicycles hitch a ride on goods-laden trucks hungry thirsty and tired to rest under the shade of a tree or a school converted into a shelter for migrants countries must address the fragilities inequalities and gaps in social protection that have been so painfully exposed and place women and gender equality front and centre nations must keep food supply chains alive and protect the most vulnerable what the world needs right now is solidarity along with bold and courageous leadership guided by science data ethics and empathy recovery from covid can steer the world toward a safer healthier more sustainable and inclusive path the pandemics lead to communities or individuals being stigmatized it is not only irresponsible but unethical to associate a virus and the disease it causes with a specific place or members of a particular race or community it is tragic and unacceptable the stigma must stop now every nation and every individual is experiencing the societal strain of this disease in new and powerful ways today to efficiently tackle the global crisis of covid-19 pandemic several countries have employed a combination of containment and mitigation strategies for proper treatment of the infected and to prevent the spread of the infection these strategies include self-isolation quarantine contact tracing public health management improving health facilities etc19 in china where severely aggressive strategies were employed minimal level of nosocomial transmission was observed chinas epidemiological records showed that most of the viral transmissions occurred within the family clusters20 this data indicated that the viral transmission mainly occurred via direct contact or contact with fomites in close proximity to the infected individuals nations need to rapidly and robustly increase their preparedness readiness and response actions intensified case finding and contact tracing are crucial other than case and contact finding containment or other measures that aim to delay the onset of patient surges where feasible and measures such as public awareness promotion of personal protective hygiene preparation of health systems for a surge of severely ill patients stronger infection prevention and control in health facilities are of paramount importance surveillance and rapid testing to identify both asymptomatic and symptomatic cases contact tracing is required followed by quarantine and appropriate treatment contract tracing can play a key role in interrupting the pathways of future transmissions moreover pool testing in non-hotspot areas can be beneficial moreover the large numbers of infections reported among health workers need urgent attention risk of transmission must be substantially minimised if not prevented their safety is absolutely essential solidarity at national and global levels is need of the hour nations have a responsibility to look after weaker sections of society supply chain must be maintained ppe ventilators oxygen kits etc equitably at global and national levels no failures in this regard are acceptable furthermore over 16 billion children are out of school novel methods have to be developed to ensure that education does not suffer it is widely believed that during the covid pandemic treatment suffers cancer patients get either neglected or do not have access to quality healthcare and medicines similarly patients with diabetes have difficulties in managing the disease at an appropriate health facility patients who need renal dialysis suffer because of non-availability of medical care or transportation facility pregnant ladies from rural areas or even from towns face immense problems so far conducting delivery normal or caesarean section is concerned those who have cardiac disease are unable to reach hospitals for any prompt medical attention covid pandemic is turning us into a cruder society fear of virus else seeing the death coming so near is forcing us to think of individual safety rather than collective security and dignity stigma is a curse and needs to be discouraged with full might what is required is burying dead with dignity giving human face to lockdown citizen-state engagement creating a social-security net for poor moreover this is the time of reason and science not rhetoric the number of women unable to access family planning facing unintended pregnancies gender-based violence and other harmful practices could skyrocket by millions of cases in the months ahead it is widely believed that during the pandemic treatment suffers patients with diseases like cancer diabetes renal failure cad and pregnant women need special attention as the pandemic pushes up levels of hunger among the global poor governments must prevent devastating nutrition and health consequences for children missing out on school meals amid school closures initial response to this global crisis by some countries has been so feeble and spotty the response serves as a critical reminder for why strong government leadership is needed during a global crisis many basic facts about the virus remain unknown viruses have no nationality so there is no place for discrimination on the basis of race religion caste etc we have to work all together to defeat the virus empathy and simple kindness are essential powerful tools of national recovery to date no specific therapy has been scientifically proven to reduce mortality tackling this global crisis scientists are working hard to develop vaccines and treatments to slow the pandemic and reduce morbidity and mortality drugs are still being tested in clinical trials to see if they are effective against covid-19 the medications have to be safe for this particular use the coronavirus vaccines in various stages of development across the world include fusogenix dna vaccine by entos pharmaceuticals chadox1 ncov-19 by university of oxford gimsilumab by roivant sciences adcovid by altimmune tjm2 by i-mab biopharma coronavirus vaccine by

even make it that far it is crucial to identify any antibodies that inadvertently help the virus enter cells so researchers who are developing vaccines can avoid including those antibodies there are some opportunities to pursue other interventions in the short- and long-term that could save lives the pandemic demands action on many fronts from prevention to testing to treatment we need to create simple cheap more accessible testing for sars-cov-2 a faster way has to be developed to identify antibodies that neutralize the virus over 100 vaccines for the sars-cov-2 are at various stages of

researchers across the globe are racing against the time to develop a vaccine for the novel covid-19 more than 100 potential vaccines are being developed including several in clinical trials but experts have underscored the difficulties of finding vaccines that are effective against coronaviruses collaborating across the healthcare innovation ecosystem to making the impossible possible is need of the hour researchers and scientists have been relentlessly working to develop an investigational antiviral compound a vaccine to prevent infection as well as evaluating other therapies that have scientific potential to help infected patients fight the virus both antivirals and vaccines will be valuable tools in combating covid-19 the countries that effectively managed covid-19 disease by implementing strong measures in place included were taiwan vietnam new zealand south korea and singapore each of these countries imposed travel restrictions quarantines social distancing and heightened hygiene in singapore three university hostels were converted into quarantine facilities and people were compensated for any workdays lost officials then began aggressively tracing all contacts of known infected people using data from transport companies hotels and cctv footage though large gatherings have been suspended schools and offices have remained open to limit the outbreaks social and economic costs however all students and employees undergo daily health checks and temperature screenings taiwan screened the passengers on planes after landing it later halted the flights incoming from wuhan and other parts of china after its first imported case it used home quarantines more extensively than others despite the availability of state facilities disobeying quarantine orders also drew a penalty of up to inr 2500000 mass gatherings and religious services were banned hong kongs strategy focused on limiting the local transmission rather than preventing infected people from entering the city boundaries it expanded its existing temperature screening facilities at entry points and asked local clinics to report any patient showing symptoms and with a travel history to wuhan all the people crossing the border from china were placed under mandatory 14-day quarantine vacant newly constructed public housing buildings were converted into quarantine facilities social distancing was extensively implemented - large-scale events were canceled schools were closed until april and civil servants were asked to work from home for a month in south korea everyone was tested however in italy sick people were tested number of covid-19 cases has dropped in south korea it necessitates the need for increase in number of tests to minimize the impact of future epidemics laboratories and epidemiological capacities must be established at regional and national levels improved surveillance could facilitate higher degree of prevention and treatment of the disease new zealand has shown the way there is no widespread undetected community transmission decisive action going hard and going early helped to stamp out the worst of virus testing was done widely an effective or ideal vaccine may take more than a year to develop even after the vaccine has been developed its effectiveness side effects availability and accessibility will be a larger issue the world community will see pockets of resurgence of disease moreover antibody testing can be used for public testing to determine who is immunized and free to work and intermingle older people will have to be protected during this exercise by lockdown and social distancing the covid-19 could become endemic like hiv it is here to stay and it is impossible to predict that when this pandemic is supposed to control this would take a massive effort even if a vaccine was found it is still possible to control the virus with effort strong and robust control of the virus is required in order to lower the assessment of risk everyone should contribute to stopping this pandemic both life and livelihood are important deprivation is unacceptable shelter food healthcare and subsistence for weaker sections of population are the key challenges poor like migrant workers and casual labourers eat from garbage containers which is a disgrace equally important is the care of internally displaced people and refugees they need special attention shaping the future is critical as schools remain closed during the pandemic the education of many children for whom long distance learning is unavailable stands at great risk nations must do everything in their power to protect children from the dire consequences teens are feeling lonely and anxious in isolation poor children with limited access and illiteratesemi-literate parents are in serious trouble they are losing out this will impact them severely as the pandemic pushes up levels of hunger among the global poor governments must prevent devastating nutrition and health consequences for children missing out on school meals amid school closures in a world of 78 billion people countries have to be in a state of emergency preparedness to tackle emerging infectious diseases it needs an aggressive and focused action with coordination among all departments of the government - health security finance commerce transport trade information diplomacy etc global eid threats require an organized global response including adequate communication epidemiology behavioral science laboratory science adequate public health infrastructure increased surveillance and primary prevention efficient prevention and regulation of problems would require elucidation of causal factors of disease disability and premature death under such evolutionary changes the future trends cannot be predicted by the extrapolation of current scenarios instead accurate prediction can be made by scientists and professionals by applying the current data to various possible scenarios an optimum harmony can be maintained between humans and environment by improving human resistance environmental safety and adequate healthcare systems one might consider infectious diseases as an imbalance between humans and environment caused by the dominance of microbes the economic social administrative and legal forces must work together towards better human health the approach to tackle this pandemic has to be solidly evidence- informed balancing act between public health crisis and complex societal implications is an inescapable necessity in these unprecedented and critical times the global community has a moral responsibility to jointly fight this dreaded virus that can otherwise lead to millions of avoidable deaths the private sector also has an important role to play in efforts to fight this pandemic during these most difficult times in human history nations need to ensure that the needs of the general public are met and the businesses can resume normal operations after the pandemic is over structure of the society will change new geopolitical and socioeconomic dynamics will emerge values will change and our lives and habits will also change nations will have to prioritise their expenditure weaker sections of society will need all the possible help however regardless of the devastation caused by the crisis human population will prevail humanity will still find the strength to recover investing in public health preparedness and relying on science will bring a better future  predictions of covid-19 dynamics in the uk

of a virus of unknown origin that was leading 2 to a cluster of pneumonia cases 1  the virus was identified as a novel strain of coronavirus on 7th 3 january 2020 2 and the first known death as a result of the disease occurred two days later 1  over 4 the next few days cases were reported in several other cities in china and in other countries around 5 the world including south korea japan and the united states of america on 23rd january the 6 chinese government issued an order for wuhan city to enter lockdown whereby all public transport 7 was suspended and residents were not allowed to leave the city over the next 24 hours these measures 8 were extended to all the major cities in hubei province in an attempt to prevent further spread of 9 disease 10 whilst the introduction of these

northern italy 6  as more countries in europe and around the 15 world started to experience a dramatic rise in cases similar measures were put in place in an effort to 16 protect the most vulnerable

north of england in the early stages of the uk outbreak the government focused on a strategy 20 of containment to reduce the likelihood of large-scale within-country transmission occurring this 21 strategy involved rapid identification and isolation of infected individuals achieved through contact 22 tracing and testing of suspect cases however by early march it was evident that sustained community 23 transmission was occurring and there was a growing concern that a large epidemic could rapidly 24 overwhelm the health service resulting in a significant number of deaths this led to the government 25 considering the introduction of a range of social distancing measures in order to slow the growth of the 26 outbreak thus delaying and flattening the epidemic peak and reducing the risk of exceeding hospital 27 capacities owing to an influx of covid-19 patients on 12th march the uk officially entered the 28 delay phase with the government declaring that all individuals with a cough or fever should self-29 isolate for a period of seven days over the following days several major sporting events were cancelled 30 and the prime minister advised against all non-essential travel and contact with others with daily 31 cases and deaths continuing to rise the government introduced its most severe measures with firstly 32 all restaurants pubs and cafes being ordered to close on 20th

provide short and long term forecasts regarding the future course of the covid-19 50 outbreak in the uk our model uses real-time data on confirmed cases requiring hospital care and 51 mortality to provide up-to-date predictions on epidemic spread in ten regions of the uk we investigate 52 how compliance with social distancing affects future epidemic outcomes we compare and contrast 53 different exit strategies namely relaxing social distancing by age group or the regional lifting and 54 imposition of restrictions according to healthcare system capacity finally we explore the sensitiv-55 ity of our conclusions to a key biological aspect of sars-cov2 which remains unknown whether 56 different age groups differ in their core susceptibility to infection or their likelihood of displaying 57 symptoms transmission model 60 here we describe a compartmental model that has been developed to simulate the spread of sars-61 cov-2 virus resulting in cases of in the uk population in the ongoing outbreak in the 62 uk cases of covid-19 are confirmed based upon testing with priority for testing given to patients 63 requiring critical care in hospitals 8 -generating biases and under-reporting there is evidence to 64 suggest that a significant proportion of individuals who are infected may be asymptomatic or have only 65 mild symptoms 9 10  these asymptomatic individuals are still able to transmit infection 11  though 66 it remains unclear whether they do so at a reduced level our modelling approach has consequently 67 been designed to consider the interplay between symptoms and hence detection and transmission 68 of covid-19 we developed a deterministic age-structured compartmental model stratified into 69 five-year age bands transmission was governed through age-dependent mixing matrices based on 70 uk social mixing patterns 12 13  the population was further stratified according to current disease 71 status following a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered seir paradigm as well as differentiating 72 by symptoms quarantining and household status fig 1  susceptibles s infected by sars-cov-2 73 entered a latent state e before becoming infectious given that only a proportion of individuals who 74 are infected are tested and subsequently identified the infectious class in our model was partitioned 75 into symptomatic and hence potentially detectable d and asymptomatic and likely to remain 76 undetected infections u  we assumed both susceptibility and disease detection were dependent upon 77 age although the partitioning between these two components is largely indeterminable additional 78 details are given in table 1 and supporting text s1 we modelled the uk population aggregated to 79 ten regions wales scotland northern ireland east of england

example if all transmission outside the household is set to zero in a standard ode model then 84 an outbreak can still occur as within-household transmission allows infection between age-groups and 85 does not account for local depletion of susceptibles within the household evironment we addressed 86 this limitation by extending the standard seir models such that first infections without a household 87 e f  d f  u f  are treated differently from subsequent infections e s  d s  u s  to account for the 88 depletion of susceptibles in the household we assumed that all within household

household status on this depiction of the system the model is concerned with epidemiological processes and so predicts the number of symptomatic 92 and asymptomatic infections on each day however in order to provide evidence regarding the future 93 impact of the outbreak in the uk it is crucial to be able to predict the number of severe cases that may 94 require hospital or critical care we utilised two processes in order to estimate hospitalisation rates 95 i we estimated the proportion of clinical cases in each age group that would require hospitalisation 96 by comparing the age distribution of hospital admission to the age structure of early detected cases -97 4  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a

detected cases were an unbiased sample of symptomatic individuals ii we used age 98 independent distributions to determine the time between onset of symptoms and hospitalisation a 99 similar process was repeated for admission into intensive care units both of these distributions were 100 drawn from the covid-19 hospitalisation in england surveillance system chess data set that 101 collects

of 106 symptomatic infections to drive the estimated daily number of deaths within hospitals the risk of 107 death is again captured with an age-dependent probability while the distribution of delays between 108 hospital admission and death is assumed to be age-independent these two quantities are determined 109 from the public health england phe death records model fitting 111 we fit on a

from a poisson distribution at the outset of each iteration 118 based on the  and  instances at that moment we first set the recovery rate  age-dependent 119 susceptibilites  a  and age-dependent probabilities of displaying symptoms d a  we achieved this 120 through calibration to early age-stratified uk data from 1st february 2020 to 1st april 2020 initial 121 assumptions were an r 0 of 27 and doubling time of 33 days but these are allowed to vary between 122 regions after a burn-in of 250000 particles the algorithm was run for a further 250000 iterations we thinned 124 the generated parameter sets by a factor of 100 giving 2500 parameter sets representing samples from 125 the parameter posterior distributions in order to capture the impact of social distancing measures that were introduced in the uk on 128 23rd march to reduce transmission we scaled down the mixing matrices associated with schools 129 work and other activities while increasing the within household transmission matrix see supporting 130 text s2 this approach allowed us to flexibly vary the effectiveness of different social distancing 131 measures and investigate the impact of compliance with social distancing  upon the future spread 132 of disease we considered a range of compliance levels scaling from zero no-compliance to one 133 maximal compliance as well as inferring the compliance

quarantining whereby an entire household was instructed to self-quarantine 137 when any member of that household started to show symptoms of infection to incorporate house-138 hold quarantining measures into the ode formulation we added a quarantined class into our model 139 whereby a fraction h of the first detectable infection in any household and therefore by definition a 140 symptomatic case is quarantined as are all their subsequent household infections accounting for the 141 effect of household saturation also ensures that subsequent household infections do not contribute to 142 further transmission for a complete description of the model equations see supporting text s1 143 we used this model framework to perform a series of analyses assessing the impact of social distancing 144 strategies on the future spread of infection unless otherwise stated all intervention shown represent 145 the mean dynamics from the posterior parameters inferred by a monte carlo markov chain mcmc 146 fitting scheme where practical credible intervals are also shown to provide a baseline for comparison of our intervention scenarios we initially simulated our model 149 to investigate the impact of the current intervention policies continuing from their introduction on 150 23rd march 2020 we simulated the model from 1st march 2020 to 30th april 2020 and compared 151 the results to a scenario where no lockdown measures were ever introduced to quantify prediction 152 uncertainty a total of 200 simulations were run for each scenario lockdown activated or no lockdown 153 imposed using distinct parameter sets produced by the mcmc procedure representing samples from 154 the posterior parameter distributions we focused our attention on estimates of deaths as well as 155 hospitalisation and icu bed occupancy as key public-health considerations to investigate the longer term impact of the epidemic we explored several scenarios in which control 158 measures are relaxed on 7th may the first scenario investigated a policy whereby social distancing 159 measures were relaxed on 7th may for all individuals regardless of age to reflect the uncertainty 160 6  cc-by-nc-nd

trajectory may be 162 affected for a range of relaxation policies in these simulations we assumed that any remaining social 163 distancing measures were fully removed at the end of 2020 age-dependent relaxation of lockdown measures 165 we next investigated policies imposing age-dependence upon the relaxation criteria specifically we 166 allowed all social distancing measures to be lifted from 7th may for all individuals below a certain age 167 from 45 to 75 year old for those above the age threshold we assumed that social distancing measures 168 remained in place until the end of 2020 simulations were then run to the end of 2021 to capture 169 any subsequent waves of infection for each age threshold under consideration we again consider the 170 cumulative deaths as well as cumulative hospital and icu bed occupancy we differentiate between 171 these health impacts that occur when age-specific restrictions are in place and when all restrictions are 172 lifted we also focus of the number of days in which icu bed occupancy exceeds 4000 as a measure 173 of the immediate severity of the outbreak and the pressure on the health services full relaxation of lockdown measures with region-based reintroduction 175 our penultimate set of simulations considered an adaptive intervention strategy whereby lockdown 176 measures were fully relaxed on 7th may but then reintroduced when occupancy of intensive care 177 units exceeded a given capacity and relaxed again when icu occupancy declines to account for 178 regional variation in the outbreak and local hospital capacities we assumed that control measures 179 would operate locally using the ten regions we therefore used a pro-rata threshold which equated 180 to 3000 occupied beds on a nationwide scale as a trigger for reintroducing or relaxing controls see 181  table s2  given the sizeable delay between the implementation of controls and their effects on icu 182 occupancy the dynamics only predicted a low number of switches between control and relaxation we 183 gathered regional predictions of daily deaths icu bed occupancy and hospital bed occupancy with 184 simulations run to the end of 2023 when evaluating the impact of lockdown measures we are reliant upon recorded data on confirmed 187 cases hospital admissions and icu occupancy in order to infer parameters of our model however 188 there is still ongoing uncertainty in the relative level of transmission from asymptomatic individuals 189   and the mechanisms driving age-specific detection rates  a range of  and  parameter values 190 are all able to generate predictions that closely match the available data we therefore carried out a 191 sensitivity analysis to these two parameters investigating the impact of applying lockdown measures 192 for specific age groups as these parameters vary we allowed   the relative level of transmission from 193 asymptomatic individuals to vary between 0 and 05 while  varied between 0 and 1 for large  194 higher proportions of confirmed cases in a particular age group is as a result of greater susceptibility 195 whereas low vales of  indicate that a higher proportions of confirmed cases is due to greater severity of 196 symptoms this key parameter interacts with the relative transmission from asymptomatic infection 197   although  plays a minimal role when  is small to assess the impact of these parameters on the 198 effectiveness of lockdown measures we computed the early epidemic growth rate under restrictions 199 that target four specific age-groupings i pre-school children under 5 ps ii school-aged children 200 and young adults 5-20 s iii adults between the age of 20 and 70 a and iv the elderly over 70 201 e cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available

model predicts that should the current lockdown policies be continued the number of daily deaths 206 would peak in april across all regions before starting to decline fig 2  england and wales are found 207 to be most severely affected with the highest number of predicted deaths per capita whilst we predict 208 a lower number of deaths per capita in scotland and northern ireland noting that though our regional 209 model fits generally had strong correspondence with the data the fit to scotland was weaker all 210 english regions show similar behaviour other than the south east and south west where we predict 211 a lower number of deaths fig 2  we observe similar behaviour in the levels of hospital and intensive 212 care unit occupancy throughout this period  fig s1 and fig s2  our

age-independent relaxation protocols to reduce health system burden 220 evaluating a policy whereby social distancing measures were relaxed on 7th may for all individuals 221 we found that for a significant relaxation of lockdown the epidemic rapidly resurges with a peak in 222 daily deaths of over 4000 occurring in late june fig 3 top panel  we project intensive care unit 223 occupancy to near 10000 by the end of june fig 3 second panel  implying that significant release 224 of lockdown measures would not be advisable for more measured relaxation protocols we found 225 that whilst there may be a slight resurgence in cases in the short term hospital and icu occupancy 226 remained within capacity whilst the short term forecasts from these simulations suggest that keeping 227 some lockdown measures in place can have a positive impact upon reducing cases and deaths we note 228 that for simulations in which more severe lockdown remains in place after 7th may a second infection 229 wave is predicted in 2021 when all social distancing measures are removed this implies that should 230 relaxation of measures occur there may need to be a reintroduction of social distancing interventions 231 at a later stage to reduce the impact of a potential second wave occurring later in 2020 or early in 232 2021 assessment of age-based shielding strategies 234 we next analysed the lifting of social distancing measures on 7th may for all individuals below a 235 certain age with social distancing measures remaining in place for the remainder of the population 236 until the end of 2020 we observe that continuing lockdown for anyone over the age of 45 for the 237 duration of 2020 results in the lowest number of deaths and number of admissions into hospital and 238 icu wards during 2020 fig 4 first column  however upon release of these lockdown measures we 239 observed a significant second wave in 2021 when isolation includes these younger age groups fig 4  240 second column when isolation is only in place for older age groups a large initial wave of infection 241 occurs during 2020 but a subsequent secondary wave is not observed if we consider the overall 242 impact from 2020-2021 we find that a strategy of continuing lockdown measures for anyone over the 243 age of 65 minimises the total number of deaths and continuing these measures for anyone over the 244 age of 60 minimises hoapital and icu occupancy though the overall effect of this when compared 245 with other age-related lockdown policies is marginal fig 4  third column continuing lockdown for 246 the over 60s throughout 2020 whilst relaxing measures of the remainder of the population results in 247 on average 138000 deaths by the end of 2021 table 2  finally we note that as the age-threshold 248 at which shielding is implemented increases the total number of days for which icu bed occupancy 249 exceeds 4000 increases implying that only shielding older age groups may put severe demands upon 250 the health service fig 4  third row utility of reintroducing lockdown measures regionally with icu occupancy triggers 252 performing subsequently occurs but an increase in icu

specific age groups whilst varying 265   the relative level of transmission from asymptomatic individuals and  the scaling determining 266 whether the age-dependence in cases comes from susceptibility   1 or symptoms   0 we 267 observe that regardless of the values of  and  applying control on only a single age group ps 268 s a or e results in large-scale epidemics fig 6  similarly ineffective strategies are observed when 269 combining ps control with one of s a or e however control of school aged children adults and the 270 elderly results in epidemics that are under control for all values of  and  should we exempt the elderly from lockdown we find that for high levels of  large epidemics are 272 observed whereas if the true value of  is high and  is small applying control on the younger age 273 groups and releasing lockdown on the elderly can result in epidemics that will rapidly die out in 274 contrast if we relax lockdown on school children but keep it in place for other age groups we note 275 that this only has a positive effect upon the epidemic if the true value of  is high or the true value of  276 is low if  is low and  is high then this implies that the age-dependence of reported cases is primarily 277 as a result of clinical symptoms rather than susceptibility and the transmission rate of asymptomatic 278 cases is high therefore school children will play a much larger role in transmission implying that a 279 policy of re-opening school would cause a much larger epidemic these results reinforce the need to 280 resolve uncertainty regarding the role of asymptomatic individuals in the infection process in order to 281 establish the optimal intervention strategy potential exit strategies comparison 283 our findings are summarised in table 2  where we focus on deaths and the associated qaly losses 284 hospital occupancy and the scale of the lockdown as a measure of potential economic burden qalys 285 quality adjusted life years are a standard measure in health economics which accounts for the 286 number of life years lost due to an illness or disease which also takes into account quality of life 287 hence under the qaly framework deaths in younger individuals have greater impact than deaths of 288 older individuals due to the additional years of life lost for further details see the supporting text 289 s3 our lockdown scale measures the pro rata number of days the population is under lockdown so 290 if 50 of the population is under lockdown for 200 days we report a value of 100 50  200 a completely uncontrolled outbreak is predicted to lead to around 200000 deaths 45 million qaly 292 losses but no lockdown impacts if the current controls are maintained until the end of 2020 then 293 we predict only 39000 cases this year but a further 159000 if controls are then completely removed 294 regional switching and age-dependent strategies provide alternative exit strategies in the absence 295 of pharmaceutical interventions of these the lockdown of those age 60 or over generates the lowest 296 mortality and also the lowest lockdown scale thereby minimising socio-economic disruption however 297 it is unclear if a protracted lockdown of this age-group would be practical ethical or politically 298 acceptable 299   cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has

this version posted may 11 2020   httpsdoiorg101101 discussion 300 in this paper we have developed an age-structured compartmental sars-cov-2 transmission model 301 that has been used to make short-term predictions and analyse the effectiveness of the current social 302 distancing measures that have been implemented in the uk we have also extended our model to 303 investigate a suite of alternate policies to establish whether some relaxation of intervention measures 304 may be considered as part of potential exit strategies our model shows that without the introduction 305 of the large scale social distancing measures that were introduced on 23rd march the epidemic would 306 have continued to grow exponentially and hospital and icu occupancy would have rapidly exceeded 307 capacity however under current policies the epidemic is expected to peak in april for all regions of 308 the uk before starting to decline one of the most important questions in the current epidemic is when and how social distancing 310 measures might be relaxed we consistently find that any relaxation of control measures in the 311 short term leads to a rapid resurgence of covid-19 disease with the health system potential being 312 overwhelmed by a sizeable second epidemic wave fig 3  in contrast moderate or no adjustments to 313 current social distancing measures allows hospital and icu occupancy to remain within capacity over 314 the duration of the outbreak it is apparent from the data on confirmed cases and deaths as a result 315 of covid-19 disease that the risks associated with infection increase with age 15 16 17  we therefore 316 also investigated the impact of age-specific control policies whereby lockdown measures remained in 317 place for all individuals over a certain age until the end of 2020 we found that whilst some marginal 318 gains can be made should everyone over the age of 60 be put under isolation measures extending this 319 policy to include younger age groups increases the risk of a second wave occurring when measures are 320 relaxed furthermore we projected critical care to be stretched and icu bed occupancy to exceed 321 4000 during the course of the pandemic in all but the most wide-ranging age-specific lockdown policies 322 fig 4  as a note of caution our sensitivity analysis shows that the effectiveness of any age-specific intervention 324 policy is critically dependent upon the precise role of asymptomatic individuals in the epidemic 325 undocumented infection has been inferred to have facilitated the spread of sars-cov-2 in china 18  326 we note that government advice upon self-quarantining focuses upon individuals who show symptoms 327 of covid-19 primarily a fever and a dry persistent cough and therefore should asymptomatic or 328 pre-symptomatic infections play a significant role in the transmission process such a policy may 329 not be as effective as thought due to the potential for ongoing transmission through asymptomatic 330 cases in practice to minimise the risk of a second large epidemic wave occurring in the uk adaptive 332 policies may need to be considered to that end we examined a more bespoke intervention policy 333 whereby measures were relaxed and re-introduced on a regional basis with a defined trigger for 334 the reintroduction of interventions when icu occupancy exceeded a certain level this results in 335 a longer epidemic tail until the second half of 2021 but ensures that the health service is protected 336 by reintroducing social distancing measures for all individuals in a region when required several countries around the world have now seen significant epidemics of covid-19 and many have 338 implemented severe lockdown policies in an effort to contain the disease in china and other countries 339 in east asia once the epidemic was regarded to be under control in seeking to prevent the occurrence 340 of a large second infection wave the relaxation of isolation measures has been implemented in a gradual 341 fashion our model findings support the need for this form of relaxation policy we recognise that 342 there is a need for certain measures to be lifted as soon as is feasible for a range of practical social and 343 economic reasons however government agencies should be prepared to resume lockdown if needed 344 based upon the the progression of the epidemic following relaxation identifying triggers such as icu 345 occupancy exceeding a certain threshold may be beneficial in allowing decision makers to follow a 346 16  cc-by-nc-nd 40

the ability to resolve epidemiological uncertainty as 348 the outbreak progresses to this end formal adaptive management approaches may help to facilitate 349 the establishment of state dependent intervention strategies 19  the model described is necessarily a simplified representation of reality based on several assumptions 351 and has various limitations data informing contact structure for the uk were measured histori-352 cally 12  were contact patterns in early 2020 pre-lockdown to substantially differ from the preex-353 isting data the influence of projected intervention effects may be impacted similarly while we can 354 infer the compliance to the currently imposed rules we have limited understand of how people will 355 behave if the controls are released -will they remain wary of potentially infectious situations or 356 will they compensate for the time in lockdown throughout we have assumed that mixing patterns 357 would return to their pre-pandemic norm heterogeneities in compliance and in infection patterns 358 such as increased transmission in hospitals and institutions may affect the outcome of the measures 359 considered we note that the estimates of deaths resulting from an individual strategy does not take 360 into account the potential for increased deaths due to exceeding hospital or icu capacities and so may 361 underestimate deaths from strategies resulting in high occupancies in addition though there have 362 been recorded instances of superspreading events for covid-19 20  our model does not explicitly 363 account for such dynamics however beyond the early stages of the outbreak the dynamics at the 364 population-level are generally driven by the average pattern of social mixing rather than individual 365 level variation all the strategies we have considered here assume that an exit strategy will have to rely on non-367 pharmaceutical intervention in which case a second or subsequent wave of infections follows any 368 return to normality while there is sufficient susceptibility in the population we are therefore faced 369 with three potential exit solutions 1 seek a measured reduction in restrictions that minimises the 370 impact of the unfolding outbreak but acknowledging that the majority of the population will become 371 infected although not symptomatic 2 accept a substantial and long-term change to our social 372 interactions practising far better prevention of transmission such that the reproductive ratio of the 373 virus is constantly held below one -electronic and traditional methods of tracing and isolation 21 374 fall into this category or 3 rely on the development of an effective vaccine in which case the best 375 approach may be to extend the lockdown reducing infection until mass vaccination can occur in conclusion the current pandemic of covid-19 has resulted in the introduction of strict social 377 distancing measures in the uk and many other countries around the world government agencies are 378 currently analysing how best to develop an exit strategy from these measures and to determine how 379 the epidemic may progress once measures are lifted our work provides strong evidence to support 380 the need for a cautious measured approach to relaxation in order to provide necessary support for 381 the health service and to protect the most vulnerable members of

states however large-scale evaluation of the publics response to social distancing campaigns has been lacking we used anonymized and aggregated mobility data from google location history users to estimate the impact of social distancing recommendations on bulk mobility among users who have opted into this service we found that state-of-emergency declarations resulted in a 10 reduction in time spent away from places of residence implementation of one or more social distancing policies resulted in an additional 25 reduction in mobility the following week subsequent shelter-in-place mandates provided an additional 29 reduction our findings provide evidence that state-wide mandates are effective in promoting social distancing within this study group  social distancing has emerged as the primary strategy for slowing the spread of the covid-19 pandemic social distancing is expected to reduce the frequency of close contact with others and thus minimize the transmission of the sars-cov-2 coronavirus prior experience with the 2009 h1n1 influenza and ebola suggests that social distancing is effective in reducing disease transmission 1 2 in china officials engaged in an unprecedented quarantine of hubei province to contain covid-19 transmission out of the initial epicenter city of wuhan 3 4 5 as the pandemic spread to new clusters of infection in the united states us efforts at containment and then mitigation have been largely at the discretion of state and local governments leading to a patchwork of directives to encourage social distancing these policies have included state emergency declarations work-from-home policies school closures closures of non-essential businesses and services limits placed on large social gatherings bans on in-restaurant service and shelter-in-place orders 6 to date there is some limited data that these policies may be working several news outlets have shown substantial drops in mobility across the nation since early march although the ties to specific policy interventions are less clear given the current reliance on social distancing policies to limit the spread of covid-19 systematically quantifying the impact of these policies on mobility may be helpful to public health officials the availability of anonymized and aggregated mobility data represents a novel opportunity to quantify the effectiveness of individual social distancing interventions 7 we used aggregated anonymized with differential privacy data from google users across the us who have opted-in to location history the location history feature is off by default and requires explicit opt-in 8 9 using these data information on the dates of implementation of various social distancing policies see supplemental material and a regression discontinuity approach we sought to 1 quantify the average effect on mobility of declarations of states of emergency social distancing policies and shelter-in-place orders and 2 gain insights into which policies are most effective in promoting social distancing our primary outcome of interest is the relative change in the time spent away from places of residence and also considered relative changes in the number of visits to places of work and the number of visits to 1 grocery stores and pharmacies 2 retail recreation and eateries 3 parks and 4 transit stops overall we observed three waves of state-level responses to covid-19 1 a first wave occurring during the first two weeks of march with state of emergency declarations 2 a second wave during the week of march 16 where a variety of specific social distancing orders were implemented and 3 a third wave during the last two weeks of march consisting of orders for residents to shelter in place orders  figure 1  the first state of emergency related to covid-19 was declared by washington state on february 29 and most recently by oklahoma and maine on march 15 many states subsequently ordered that schools close led by louisiana and virginia on march 13 2020 andor placed limits on specific activities and businesses in order to promote social distancing within a week 48 states and washington dc had implemented at least 1 social distancing policy in 78 of states the first social distancing order imposed was the closure of schools on march 16 nevada enacted orders advising residents to shelter in place followed by california on march 19 2020 as of april 5 80 of states had ordered residents to shelter in place we used the same data that was used to prepare the community mobility reports published by google 8 9 to compute aggregated visit trends to a number of specific categories of locations see supplemental material trends were aggregated to the county level including washington dc and independent cities that are not otherwise included in county boundaries and available daily from january 1 through march 29 2020 within each county we applied a regression discontinuity analysis to estimate the relative change in the amount of time spent away from places of residence of location history users and the relative change in the number of visits to specific categories of locations in the week after versus before each intervention the following results should be interpreted in light of several important limitations including that our data are limited to google users who have opted in to location history on average across the country a declaration of a state of emergency was associated with a 99 95 confidence interval ci -101 -97 decrease in time spent away from places of residence 114 95 ci -118 -110 fewer visits to the workplace 115 -117 -112 fewer visits to retail outlets and recreational sites and 93 fewer visits to transit stops -96 -90 in the following week  figure 2a  these changes in mobility are noteworthy given that emergency declarations did not necessarily specifically call for increased social distancing and suggests that government messaging news coverage andor actions observed in other countries could have influenced peoples activities visits to parks were also affected by emergency declarations with a small 35 95 ci -44 -26 average reduction the smaller impact of emergency declarations on visits to parks versus other venues is likely at least partly explained by the warmer weather and transition to spring during this period on the other hand emergency declarations coincided with a relative increase in visits to grocery stores and pharmacies of 82 95 ci 79 85 consistent with news reports of individuals stocking up on dry goods cleaning supplies and medications at the end of february and early march in anticipation of impending social distancing orders 10 we next examined the impact on mobility of the first social distancing policies implemented in each state we found that on average across the country these orders resulted in additional reductions in mobility above and beyond the changes observed following emergency declarations  figure 2b  specifically implementation of one or more social distancing policies resulted in a further 245 95 ci -247 -243 reduction in time spent away from places of residence a further 330 -333 -328 reduction in visits to retail and recreational outlets and a further 279 -283 -275 reduction in visits to work in the following week the same pattern was evident for visits to parks and for visits to grocery stores and pharmacies the impacts of social distancing orders varied substantially between states  figure 3  for example implementation of social distancing policies was associated with a 36 decrease in the time spent away from places of residence in new jersey versus a 12 decrease in louisiana but we note that differences in mobility between states may be due to a number of factors beyond social distancing policies the median of state-specific changes in time spent away from places of residence was a decrease of 19 states that enacted multiple social distancing measures tended to experience greater reductions in mobility the impact of social distancing orders also varied substantially across counties within each state regardless of the average impact across the state  supplemental table 1  results were consistent when considering changes in visits to work visits to grocery stores and pharmacies visits to retail recreation and eateries visits to parks and visits to transit stops  supplemental figure 1  we next considered the impact on mobility of state-wide orders to shelter in place among the 7 states that had issued shelter in place orders on or before march 23 we found substantial reductions in time spent away from places of residence and in visits to all categories of locations  figure 2c  specifically time spent away from places of residence was 290 95 ci -294 -285 lower in the week following implementation of shelter in place orders versus the prior week note that these changes are multiplicative over time as all states had already declared a state of emergency and implemented at least one social distancing policy for comparison we also show in figure 2c the change in mobility during the same time frame march 23-29 versus march 14-20 2020 among those states that had not yet issued shelter-in-place orders by march 23 however note that comparisons between states reflect the influence of a number of factors on mobility in addition to policy differences given that most states enacted multiple policies to encourage social distancing over a short time period it is not possible to estimate the independent effects of individual policies however in secondary analyses we sought to identify the combinations of social distancing orders that were associated with greater changes in mobility  figure these results should be interpreted in light of several important limitations first our source data are limited to smartphone users who have opted in to googles consumer location history feature these data may not be representative of the population as whole and furthermore their representativeness may vary by location additionally these limited data are only viewed through the lens of differential privacy algorithms specifically designed to protect user anonymity and obscure fine detail 8  moreover comparisons across rather than within locations are only descriptive since these regions can differ in substantial ways besides the policy environment second our analyses are focused on state-level policies whereas individual metropolitan areas and counties within a state may have implemented specific social distancing policies prior to implementation of state-level policies see supplemental figure 4 for detailed examples from king county wa westchester county ny new york county ny and santa clara county ca third we did not assess the impact of social distancing policies or resulting changes in mobility on published counts of confirmed covid-19 cases or deaths although such analyses are of critical importance they are complicated by the heterogeneous availability of testing delays in reporting and the inherent latency before social distancing impacts are evident in clinical outcomes and thus beyond the scope of this report in summary using anonymized aggregated and differentially private data from google users who opted in to location history we found that state-mandated social distancing orders were effective in decreasing time spent away from places of residence as well as reducing visits to work and visits to both grocery storespharmacies and retailrecreational locations while the majority of states declared states of emergency by early march the emergency declaration per se had only a modest effect on mobility in contrast implementation of one or more specific social distancing orders was associated with an almost 25 additional reduction in time spent away from places of residence and a 33 additional reduction in visits to retail and recreational locations these effects were evident in every state and in virtually every county although we were unable to estimate the independent effects of different social distancing measures due to their close temporal proximity within each state we did observe that those states that implemented multiple such measures experienced more pronounced declines in mobility in addition limits on bars and restaurants appeared to be the single most effective social distancing order we conclude that state-based orders intended to promote social distancing appear to be very effective in accomplishing the public health goals of encouraging individuals to stay at home in order to minimize the risk of covid-19 transmission our findings not only illustrate the importance of specific social distancing orders but also demonstrate the magnitude of change in mobility that we might expect from these policies this information can help public health officials better calibrate and understand the extent to which social distancing can slow down the disease the anonymized and aggregated dataset analyzed herein was the same one that was used to create the publicly-available google covid-19 community mobility reports published at httpgooglecomcovid19mobility on april 2 2020 the data analyzed in this paper consisted of anonymized aggregated and differentially private counts of visits to places in different categories the publicly available data reflects percentage ratios computed using these counts the information on dates of policy interventions was aggregated from publicly available data as described in the supplemental material  our overall approach was to use regression discontinuity using each countys recent past as its own control to assess the impact of state declarations of emergency and targeted social distancing policies on the relative changes in the average time spent away from places of residence the number of visits to work and the number of visits to 1 grocery stores and pharmacies 2 retail stores recreational sites and eateries 3 transit stops and 4 parks data on state social distancing policies were obtained from official documents issued by state governors and health and education officials documents were linked from the kaiser family foundations state data and policy actions tracker 11 and supplemented with manual searches of state public health websites dates of policy enactment were cross-checked with the aei covid-19 action tracker 12 and the nytimes shelter in place tracker 13  policies tracked were categorized as follows 1 state-declared state of emergency 2 state-mandated school closures 3 state-mandated closing of non-essential businesses and services 4 state-mandated limits on large gatherings 5 state-imposed bans on in-restaurant service and 6 state-imposed mandatory quarantines state-mandated closing of non-essential businesses included any order closing gyms theaters and other businesses even if it did not extend to all non-essential businesses limits on large gatherings referred to any ban on gatherings larger than a certain number of people though that threshold varied between states for states that issued additional orders reducing the size of permitted gatherings the date of the first such order was taken bans on in-restaurant service excluded mandatory reductions in restaurant capacity and included only those orders that prohibited any restaurant activity except pick-up and delivery these bans often also included bars and clubs mandatory quarantine referred to any stay-at-home or shelter-in-place order that prohibited non-essential travel away from the home for all residents shelter-in-place orders specifically for high-risk individuals were excluded orders that went into effect at any time after 1200 pm were considered to begin on the following day we obtained aggregated and anonymized data from groups of google users on mobile devices in all 50 states and washington dc who have opted in to having their location history data stored the anonymized dataset used for these analyses is the same as the one used to create the publicly-available google covid-19 community mobility reports published at httpgooglecomcovid19mobility on april 2 2020 the aggregation and anonymization process applied to the initial version of google covid-19 community mobility reports has been previously described in detail 8 the community mobility reports leverage signals such as relative frequency time and duration of visits to calculate metrics related to places of residence and places of work of location history users as described elsewhere 8 the anonymization process is designed to ensure that no personal data including an individuals location movement or contacts can be derived from the resulting metrics data were aggregated to the county level and washington dc and available daily from january 1 through march 29 2020 within each county we applied a regression discontinuity analysis to estimate the relative change in time spent away from the place of residence primary outcome and the relative change in the number of visits to public locations secondary outcomes associated with 1 declaration of a state of emergency 2 ordering of one or more social distancing measures and 3 orders for people to shelter-in-place we note that less populous counties are more likely to have days with missing data for visits to one or more categories of places eg pharmacies due to privacy filtering and other technical aspects however we believe that missing data has negligible effects on the state and national estimates provided because 1 state level estimates are weighted by county population and populous counties are extremely unlikely to have any metrics which fall below the limits of detection and 2 the unweighted correlations between the relative changes in the combined metrics used in this paper eg grocery stores and pharmacies considered together compared to an unbiased but lower-coverage alternative eg grocery stores only are very high 095 for each county we compared the value of each metric in the week after the date of implementation versus the 7-day period 9 to 2 days prior to the date of implementation we included a two-day washout period prior to the implementation date given the public messaging that typically precedes implementation of these orders given data until march 29 were available the effects of policies enacted on or before march 23 could be evaluated the state level estimates reflect population-weighted aggregates of the county-specific estimates the national estimates are a simple average of the state estimates because each county and state is compared to its recent past these estimates are causally interpretable however comparisons across counties or states are only descriptive since locations can differ substantially in terms of the proportion of the population opted-in to location history the demographics of this group the quality of the mobility data and of the google maps data about local establishments and a number of other factors that may influence the observed changes in mobility beyond differences in the policy environment we performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the distribution of each outcome metric under the null hypothesis of the policies having no effect we interpret the relative change across two periods of time period 1 january 27-february 2 2020 period 2 february 5-11 2020 prior to the enactment of any state-level social distancing measures as observations under the null hypothesis during this time there were only 5 reported cases of covid-19 in the us which were isolated in washington state although there was a small drop in time spent away from the place of residence across these pre-intervention periods the much larger effects on mobility observed after each of the policies suggests that our observed effect during the exposure period is in fact related to the implementation of social distancing  supplement figure 2  figures 2 and 3 in the main text to gain a sense of how different these effects look when the first social-distancing measures were implemented under the null hypothesis of no policy-affect the median observed change is slightly below -2 however during the first social-distancing measures the median drop is nearly 10 times as large at -19 for further context all but two counties during the first social-distancing measures are below the null distribution median and over 96 of counties are below the null distribution 25 percentile a comparison between the changes in mobility during first social-distancing measures and changes in mobility under the null hypothesis for each metric is presented in supplemental tables 2a and 2b  our main analyses estimate the incremental mobility changes after versus before each of three waves of policy orders  figure 2  however it is also of interest to quantify the overall effect of social distancing by comparing mobility at the end versus the start of march we define the overall effect as the change in mobility from the week before the term social distancing started increasing in google search march 1-7th to the last week available in the data march 23-29th we see a significant decrease in all metrics the ordering of the magnitudes is comparable to those in figure 2b  as expected the overall magnitudes of the drops are larger than any of the incremental effects in figure  2  table 1  anova sum of squares decomposition of the variation in the relative change on average time spent away from places of residence across counties for the linear model with the relative pre-post difference in time spent away from the residence as the outcome and state as the only independent variable the results show that approximately half of the variance in the outcome is explained by differences between states and the remaining variance is largely explained by differences across counties within states figure 2 a relative changes in national averages from january 27-february 2 2020 to february 5-11 2020 for all metrics of interest the results are also shown in supplemental table 2 a this plot can serve as a reference point for figure 2 in the sense that these periods occurred before any orders were issued and can be interpreted as observations under the null hypothesis of no effect of policy interventions  supplemental figure 2 b  relative changes in county averages from january 27-february 2 2020 to february 5-11 2020 for time spent away from the residence counties are grouped by state to show the heterogeneity across counties and states before any orders were issued the changes can be interpreted as observations under the null hypothesis of no policy effect because these periods occurred before any orders were issued  trading privacy for the greater social good how did america react during covid-19 anindya ghose beibei li meghanath macha

todri catherine tucker raluca ursu yuqian xu michael zhao f peter zubscek  digital contact tracing and analysis of social distancing from smartphone location data are two prime examples of non-therapeutic interventions used in many countries to mitigate the impact of the covid-19 pandemic while many understand the importance of trading personal privacy for the public good others have been alarmed at the potential for surveillance via measures enabled through location tracking on smartphones in our research we analyzed massive yet atomic individual-level location data containing over 22 billion records from ten blue democratic and ten red republican cities in the us based on which we present herein some of the first evidence of how americans responded to the increasing concerns that government authorities the private sector and public health experts might use individuallevel location data to track the covid-19 spread first we found a significant decreasing trend of mobileapp location-sharing opt out whereas areas with more democrats were more privacy-concerned than areas with more republicans before the advent of the covid-19 pandemic there was a significant decrease in the overall opt-out rates after covid-19 and this effect was more salient among democratic than republican cities second people who practiced social distancing ie those who traveled less and interacted with fewer close contacts during the pandemic were also less likely to opt out whereas the converse was true for people who practiced less social-distancing this relationship also was more salient among democratic than republican cities third high-income populations and males compared with lowincome populations and females were more privacy-conscientious and more likely to opt out of location tracking overall our findings demonstrate that during covid-19 people in both blue and red cities generally reacted in a consistent manner in trading their personal privacy for the greater social good but diverged in the extent of that trade-off along the lines of political affiliation social-distancing compliance and demographics participants in the carlson online mis seminar for very helpful comments that have improved the paper 16 after 911 we gave up privacy for security will we make the same trade-off after covid-19 httpswwwstatnewscom20200408coronavirus-will-we-give-up-privacy-for-security  in the very early days of covid-19 as health experts realized that human-to-human transmission was happening they advised the public to practice social distancing a tactic commonly employed in the past to combat health epidemics stay-at-home orders were also put in place in many communities globally as another non-pharmaceutical intervention or measure taken to mitigate the covid-19 spread the related issue of location tracking of citizens whereabouts widely covered by major news outlets has seized public attention and reignited debate over the efficacy and legality of government surveillance and privacy rights in early march of 2020 as covid-19 continued to spread rapidly all over the world scientists and health officials were puzzled by the exceedingly high infection and fatality rates in certain parts of the world such as italy and spain vodafone subsequently provided italian officials with anonymized customer data to track and analyze population movements in italy where a government-mandated lockdown was in place a crucial insight gleaned from the analysis of the data was that up to 40 of residents in milan still moved every day 300-500 meters beyond their homes despite the lockdown which finding revealed the extent of social-distancing non-compliance as a significant driving factor of covid-19s diffusion in italy in the meantime active contact tracing as well as monitoring of possibly infected people and those who had come into contact with any suspected cases was widely publicized as being effective in curbing the covid-19 spread 2 particularly in countries such as taiwan china singapore israel and south korea highly granular location data revealing all of the locations of a given consumer in the immediate past is needed for successful implementation of contact tracing by virtue of the fact that consumers are wedded to their smartphones and have widely adopted wearable technologies such data is available to telecom providers digital platforms wearable technology and smartwatch firms and mobile app developers 3 the consequent news headlines in mainstream media such as cnn 4 and fox news 5 led to many people becoming aware of contact tracing location-data tracking and potential surveillance concerns one of the inadvertent consequences of this heightened awareness was increased public concern about surveillance and privacy 6 it is well known that apps make it feasible for different elements of the mobile ecosystem to track consumers locations one perspective held by some consumers is that since lives are at stake it is imperative that we look at data privacy through a different lens at least until the pandemic is mitigated and suppressed in the uk more than two-thirds of the population backed the use of cctv footage mobile phone data and credit card records in a mass contact tracing exercise to prevent a second 2

infringement of their civil liberties they are especially concerned that contact tracing may enable intrusions into their everyday lives by governments or big tech companies 8 a 2017 reuters poll 9 found that a majority of americans were unwilling to give up privacy to assist the us governments national security initiatives over 76 reported being unwilling to yield information on their internet activities even if it would help the us governments security initiatives but would americans behave differently during a pandemic according to april 2020 research from codefuel 10  84 of us adults said that they would be willing to share their health data to deter the spread of the virus and more than half 58 of respondents said that they would be open to disclosing their location-both important factors that can help public officials flag hot spots another recent survey 11 based on responses from 1374 american adults found that two-thirds were willing to install an app that would help slow the spread of the virus and reduce the lockdown period even if that app collected information about their location data and health status moreover people whom the centers for disease control cdc has identified as being at higher risk those who are younger and those who are more technologically savvy were more likely to be willing to install such an app meanwhile studies have also shown that whereas low-income populations in the us are aware of a range of digital privacy harms it is difficult for them to access the tools and strategies that could help them protect their personal information online 12 conversely high-income populations are more likely to be both aware of potential harms and technologically savvier in their ability to protect their data privacy besides studies have shown that political party affiliation and political ideology impact how americans feel about institutional surveillance more than do income age gender and race 13 more specifically a 2018 study showed that republicans tend to feel pleased about tracking both online and in real life while democrats often feel bad about it 14 conservative republicans were found to have warmer responses to surveillance scenarios whereas liberal democrats had cooler responses with moderates and independents somewhere in the middle these facts motivated us to incorporate differences between democrats and republicans in their privacy choices as exhibited by differences in opt-out rates on mobile apps that allow for location tracking 7

httpswwwascupennedusitesdefaultfilesdocumentsturow-divided-finalpdf 14 httpswwwnytimescom20180430technologyprivacy-concerns-politicshtml in this research we aimed to examine and quantify the impact of socio-economic factors including demographics such as age income race gender and income and political affiliation such as whether they live in a top 10 red city or top 10 blue city on the following two metrics i social distancing and ii privacy behavior we focused on demographics because a number of articles from both academia and the mainstream media have discussed heterogeneity in behavior as driven by the above-noted demographic factors prior research has shown that the compliance rates of non-therapeutic interventions among young adults are less than the average compliance rates because young adults in the us do not follow protective behaviors to the same extent as other segments of the population do 15 lower compliance among them makes it easier to spread infections as they have higher levels of human contact specifically we focused on three main research questions 1 how overall privacy choice ie opt out respecting mobile locationdata sharing has changed before and after covid-19 being declared a national emergency 2 how such changes in privacy choice vary across demographic groups in blue democratic cities and red republican cities and 3 what the relationship between individuals practice of social distancing and willingness to share mobile location data during covid-19 is and how it varies with political affiliation our analyses revealed three major findings first there is a significant decreasing trend of mobile-app location-sharing opt out in the us whereas areas with more democrats were more privacy-concerned than areas with more republicans before the advent of the covid-19 crisis there was a significant decrease in overall opt-out rates after covid-19 which effect was more salient among democratic than republican cities second people who practice social distancing ie those who travel less and interact with fewer close contacts during the pandemic are less likely to opt out while the converse is true for those less compliant with social distancing this effect appeared to be more salient among democratic than republican cities after covid-19 third high-income people and males are more privacy-concerned and thus more likely to opt out of location tracking this research endeavored to make a valuable contribution to the literature of privacy and pro-social consumer behaviors by demonstrating a powerful pro-sociality-motivated relinquishing of personal privacy particularly as massive granular individual-level location data have become an increasingly prominent tool for academic research policy making and combating the present unprecedented pandemic our research is closely related to the literature on consumer privacy and pro-social behaviors as well as social distancing political affiliation and demographics amid the covid-19 pandemic below we will concisely review each literature 15  granular location data and other consumer data have generated widespread concern for consumer privacy wedel and kannan 2016  in the business context privacy broadly pertains to the protection of individually identifiable information online and offline along with the adoption and implementation of privacy policies and regulations in the context of location data privacy concerns may arise from for instance identification of sensitive information such as home address workplace location daily movements or social-distancing compliance there is a rich literature on information systems and marketing as it pertains to consumer privacy the data sources being surveys acquisti et al 2012  direct marketing goh et al 2015  and digital advertising goldfarb and tucker 2011 ghose 2017  researchers also have investigated how consumers make privacy choices of platform-provided privacy settings eg burtch et al 2015 adjerid et al 2019 and how they select opt-inout options provided by email marketing programs kumar et al2014  overall this research points to the positive effects of granting consumers enhanced control over their own privacy besides egocentric motivations such as financial benefits soleymanian et al 2017  consumers may choose to relinquish privacy for altruistic reasons such as to support national security post-911 in the form of the patriot act and its broad expansion of the federal governments surveillance powers 16 similarly amid an unprecedented pandemic like covid-19 some people may reduce their opt out of location tracking for the social good such as for digital contact tracing and city-wide social-distancing analyses to identify clusters of outbreak and hotspots although the specific research on the potential tradeoff between privacy concerns and pro-social behaviors is limited studies such as that by burtch ghose and wattal 2015 in the context of online fund-raising campaigns for charities have shown that reduced privacy settings eg access to information controls for concealment of personal identity or contribution amount increases pro-social behaviors whereas monitoring such as through location tracking and contact tracing can cause uneasiness the feeling of being observed and accountable can incentivize people to engage in pro-social behaviors or adhere to social norms acquisti et al 2015  the literature on pro-social consumer behavior has also demonstrated various motivations for consumers pro-social behaviors including both egocentric motivations eg ego utility self-signaling and reputation benefits and altruistic motives gershon et al 2020  related to the present covid-19 pandemic sympathy biases such as for identifiable victims are also shown to drive the extent of pro-social behaviors sudhir et al 2016  as demonstrated by this literature pro-social tendency can be escalated by contextual factors even general coverage of climate change or global warming by major media outlets for instance can exert an overall positive impact on the sales of hybrid vehicles chen et al 2019  in times of sudden and widespread crises such as the covid-19 pandemic filled as they are with life-and-death decisions negative emotions as well as divergent risk perceptions and behavioral norms it is plausible that consumers would exhibit heightened pro-social behaviors as exemplified by better compliance with shelterat-home policies to protect others health and reduced opt outs in location tracking from mobile devices to support various initiatives such as social-distancing monitoring contact tracing and other public safety measures bagozzi and moore 1994 show that public service ads designed to reduce the incidence of child abuse stimulate negative emotions that result in empathic reactions and increased willingness to help finally there is also evidence that most people do not make the effort to truly understand the privacy policies of mobile apps or websites primarily because they are starved for time a 2008 study estimated that it would take 244 hours a year for the typical internet user to read the privacy policies of all websites he or she visits-and that was before everyone carried smartphones with dozens of apps 17 another analysis this one on the length and readability of privacy policies based on nearly 150 popular websites and apps shows that it can take up to 18 minutes to read the privacy policies on certain platforms 18 schaub et al 2017 argue that todays privacy notices and controls are surprisingly ineffective at informing users or allowing them to express choice macdonald and cranor 2008 demonstrate that it takes about 8 to 12 minutes to read privacy policies on the most popular sites their point estimate being 10 minutes per policy with the increased time available due to shelter-at-home and social-distancing policies at least for certain demographics and societal segments it is conceivable that some consumers may finally have the time to read through the mobile apps privacy policies and react either change their choices or maintain the status quo accordingly given heightened surveillance concerns and awareness amid the covid-19 pandemic social distancing has resulted in empirically verified dramatic changes in where people spend their time and with how many people they interact for instance based on an analysis of anonymized location data in new york city bakker et al 2020 show that distance travelled everyday dropped by 70 the number of social contacts in certain places decreased by 93 and the number of people staying home the whole day increased from 20 to 60 measuring the relative transmission-risk benefit and social cost of closing about thirty different location categories in the us across eight dimensions of risk and importance and through composite indexes benzell et al 2020 find that from february to march there were larger declines in visits to locations that their measures imply should be closed first overall while social distancing may reduce the population livelihood and entail personal inconvenience it is shown to lead to substantial economic benefits greenstone and nigam 2020 estimate 17 httpswwwsaloncom20171014nobody-reads-privacy-policies-heres-how-to-fix-thatpartner 18 httpswwwnytimescominteractive20190612opinionfacebook-google-privacy-policieshtml that moderate distancing beginning in late march 2020 would save 17 million lives by october 1 and that the mortality benefits of social distancing would be about 8 trillion or 60000 per household social distancing is thus widely perceived amid the covid-19 pandemic as a pro-social behavior a number of recent studies have demonstrated a strong link between social-distancing compliance and political affiliation for example a higher percentage of republican county vote share was found based on location data to be associated with increased social-distancing non-compliance even after the declaration of a national emergency and that according to survey data democrats believe the pandemic to be more severe and report a greater reduction in contact with others fan et al 2020  also based on location data areas with more republicans engage in less social distancing and according to survey data significant gaps exist between republicans and democrats in beliefs about personal risk and the future path of the pandemic allcott et al 2020  similarly using internet search and location data barrios and hochberg 2020 reveal that a higher percentage of trump voters in a county is associated with a lower perceived risk associated with covid-19 and less social distancing other studies have revealed a strong link between social-distancing compliance and demographics such as gender income and race for instance low-income black and hispanic neighborhoods in new york city exhibit more work activity during the day and less sheltering in place during non-work hours coven and gupta 2020  similarly ruiz-euler et al 2020 present widespread evidence of a mobility gap ie the decline in human mobility during covid-19 lockdown happened at different speeds for high versus low income groups within most cities as lockdown imposes low-income groups with a stringent choice between health and income wright et al 2020 further suggest that poverty reduces social-distancing compliance conversely chiou and tucker 2020 demonstrate that people from regions with either highincome or high-speed internet display more compliance with state-level directives to remain at home which finding suggests an impact of the digital divide on the ability to comply with social-distancing policies painter and qiu 2020 show that democrats are less likely to respond to a state-level order when it is issued by a republican governor relative to one issued by a democratic governor our study distinguishes itself from the extant literature in the following ways 1 it is based on unique massive individual-level location data whereas nearly all of the prior work leveraged aggregate location data 2 it examines opt-out decrease as a valuable pro-social indicator of the criticality of location tracking in the unprecedented combat against the covid-19 pandemic for the purposes of our analysis we combined two datasets individual-level gps location tracking data and census-block-level demographic data from the american community survey 2016  19 for the location data we collaborated with a leading data collector that aggregates location data across hundreds of commonly used mobile applications ranging from news to weather map navigation and fitness the location-data collection was performed through a gdpr-and ccpa-compliant framework the data covers one-quarter of the us population across the android and ios operating systems 20 each row of the data corresponds to a location recorded for an individual each row contains information about 1 user id -an anonymized unique identifier of an individual using a mobile app 2 latitude longitude and timestamp of a location visited 3 speed at which the location was captured and 4 app category -the type of mobile app such as news or weather that captured the location in total we collected from january 1 to april 15th 2020 detailed fine-grained location data on individuals in 20 major us cities including baltimore md washington dc boston ma san 21 we choose these cities based on the respective political affiliations shown in recent national elections among the 20 cities the former ten are rated as among the top-10 most liberal cities and the latter ten the top-10 most conservative cities 22 for each of the 20 cities we parsed through an average of 150k individuals 70 locations per individual per day 15m unique locations overall and 11b rows of individual location data 23 to create the final panel dataset for our empirical analysis we selected a random sample of 25000 individuals 24 per city for each individual we identified the home address 25 and assigned the demographics of the census block that was closest 26 to the home address 19 we obtained census block group data from safegraph httpsdocssafegraphcomdocsopen-census-datasection-censusdemographic-data 20 although due to data anonymity we did not observe the demographics of each individual user in our data we did observe the geographical distribution of users home locations covering all census blocks in each city in addition we also observed users who opted out of location tracking for nearly all census blocks in a given city instead of a selected subset of blocks put simply there was no systematic selection for opt-outs therefore our user sample can be considered to be well representative of the us populations in the cities studied 21 each city is defined as including the metropolitan statistical area 22 tausanovitch c and warshaw c 2014 representation in municipal government american political science review 1083 pp605-641 httpsctausanovitchcommunicipalrepresentation140502pdf 23 depending on the app setting the locations are typically tracked every 5-20 minutes throughout the day or when a person moves out beyond 100 meters even within 5 minutes 24 we tried different sizes of random samples and found 25k to be a rather representative sample with a highly consistent data distribution as the full sample 25 we assigned the most frequent location captured during 3 -5 am to an individual as their home address a similar heuristic was used to identify home address from location data in a previous study macha et al 2019  26 for assignment of the census block the haversine distance between the individuals home address and the interpolated center latitude and longitude of the census block group provided by safegraph was computed in tables 1a and 1b we detail and provide the summary statistics across all cities for the four types of measures computed from the location and census block data 1 privacy choices at the day level an individual was considered opt in for location tracking on all days between the first and the last day we observed the individuals locations in our data if we never saw an individuals records in the data after a particular day we considered that individual to be opt out after that last day optout 27 28 we computed optoutcount at the block-day level as the total number of individuals who opted out on that day in a given block these two measures were our primary dependent variables modeled in our empirical analysis 29 for controls we computed the total number of current opt-in individuals on a given day in each city totalactiveusers as well as the total number of new opt-in individuals first observed on that day and block totalnewusers 2 social distancing we determined contact between two individuals if they were co-located in the same 10-meter radius at a popular location 30 within a 15-minute window this was motivated by various covid-19 media studies that show that human-to-human transmission can occur when individuals come in close contact within similar distance and time windows eg benzell et al 2020 there is a chance when an individual uninstalls an app instead of opting out of location sharing that it will also lead to the cessation of location data however to completely disappear from our data the individual needs to simultaneously uninstall all of the hundreds of affiliated apps that use the location-tracking sdk provided by our location data collector given the market share of the company and the coverage of their client apps this was very unlikely to occur in addition we also conducted robustness tests to check individuals app usage and location data points tracked before the last day of observation ie before the user opted out if our result were due to uninstallations of all of the affiliated apps over time we would expect to see an overall decreasing trend in daily app usage time unique app categories and the daily number of locations tracked over time before the opt-out we did not find any such significant decreasing trend we provide the detailed analyses in section 63 28 it is also possible that an individual opts out of location tracking and then decides to opt in again and then opts out again etc based on our conversation with the company very few users demonstrate such behavior for our analysis we adopted a conservative definition and considered only the last opt-out of the same user in addition note that when a user decides to opt out of location tracking she can opt out of a specific app each app has an opt-out option but can also choose to opt out of all apps in our partner companys affiliated app network in our study we defined opt out as the strictest case wherein the user opts out of all apps therefore our measure is a lower bound of the actual opt-out rate 29 for robustness checking we also considered opt in instead of opt out the user opt in and block-day-level total opt-in counts as alternative outcome variables and the results were highly consistent 30 top 1 of locations based on popularity -number of unique individual visits to the locations we also performed a sensitivity analysis based on alternative definitions of contact by varying the notion of location popularity 15 and 2 and noticed that the distribution of the number of unique contacts remained similar 31 httpswwwcdcgovcoronavirus2019-ncovprevent-getting-sickhow-covid-spreadshtml httpswwwthelocalde20200417what-you-need-to-know-about-plans-for-germanys-states-to-ease-lockdown 32 to compute the distance we considered only locations more than 10 meters apart and where individuals have spent at least 1 minute each 33 we observed major app categories including weather news fitness health education business social networking etc hhi determined using category-level duration appusagehhi that captures the concentrations of preferences demographics in addition to the individual-block-level measures from the location data we also compiled block-level social demographics population density proportions of different races income levels and gender 6 treatment indicator we defined treatment as the declaration of the national emergency for covid-19 by president trump on march 13 2020 this definition was motivated by the fact that during the same time period march 10-20 news headlines appeared in mainstream media such as cnn 34 and fox news 35 leading many people to become aware of contact tracing location-data tracking and potential surveillance concerns figure 1 shows the detailed anonymized location data from twenty randomly sampled individuals with 2318 2465 unique total locations in sfo on a certain day in the january 1-april 15 period 34 httpswwwcnncom20200310healthcoronavirus-contact-tracingindexhtml https3wwwcnncom20200318techusgovernment-location-data-coronavirusindexhtml 35 httpswwwfoxnewscomtechus-government-big-tech-smartphone-coronavirus-google-facebook httpswwwfoxnewscomtechtaiwans-so-called-electronic-fence-monitor-for-those-quarantined-raises-privacy-concerns-report before specifying the econometric model to quantitatively understand privacy choices we present qualitative model-free evidence in figure 2  we first show the overall distribution of monthly total opt outs across all 20 cities one month before and one month after the national emergency declaration regarding covid-19 on march 13 as we can see there appeared to be a consistent decreasing trend in the opt outs in each city after covid-19 to further validate this finding we next plot detailed day-level trends  in figure 3  we plot the day-level opt-out rates by pooling the 10 red and blue cities and their corresponding blocks respectively together from the figure we observe that in general before the covid-19 emergency declaration blue cities were more privacy-concerned than red ones this is consistent with recent studies showing that republicans are less concerned about privacy than democrats 36 interestingly we see that both red and blue cities show a decreasing trend in opt out after the declaration prominently the decrease in opt-out rates is more salient in blue cities than in red ones in addition we also notice an interesting weekendweekday effect-people are more likely to opt out during weekends than weekdays this pattern becomes less prominent after covid-19 potentially due to the blurred boundary between weekends and weekdays after the stay-at-home order  in figure 4  we plot the day-level opt-out rates for the 20 cities where the blocks in each city are grouped by the number-of-contact quantiles from the plots we observe that in general blocks with lesser socialdistancing practices higher number-of-contact quantiles have lower willingness to share location data higher opt-out rates compared with blocks with better social-distancing practice we also observe that in practicing lesser social distancing even after the declaration  in figure 5  we plot the opt-out rates for different cities where the blocks are grouped based on the proportion of households with income more than 200k hence blocks with a lowerhigher proportion of households with income more than 200k belong to low-high-income quantiles in figure 5  we see that in many cities eg boston new orleans philadelphia nyc pittsburgh lexington wichita highincome people are more privacy-concerned compared with low-income people after the emergency declaration the drop in opt-out rates seemingly is heterogeneous across the different income groups in figure 6  we compare the opt-out rates across gender by grouping blocks with a higherlower proportion of males we observe that blocks with a higher male population are in general more privacyconscious than their counterparts we can see that after the declaration there is an overall drop in opt-out rates across all cities and across both genders finally in figure 7  we plot the opt-out rates across different racial diversities by grouping blocks with a higherlower proportion of the white population in baltimore dc and new orleans all blue cities we observe that blocks with a higher white population have a higher opt-out rate relative to more diverse census blocks in boston blue jacksonville and omaha red we notice that people in relatively lowerwhite-populated blocks 2nd quantile in figure 7  tend to opt out more than do others in all of figures 4-7 we notice that san francisco shows little heterogeneity across all social demographics  while the qualitative trend insights regarding opt-out rates from figures 2-7 are useful they do not control for many other shifts that were taking place during the time period therefore to further examine the effects of social demographics social distancing and political affiliation on americans privacy choices during covid-19 we conducted detailed econometric analyses using panel data models at both the individualday level and the census-block-day level in each of the 20 cities  more specifically first we analyzed the effect of social demographics on an individuals likelihood of opting out of mobile location tracking before and after president trump declared the national emergency on march 13 2020 37 we modeled the likelihood of the individuals opt-out choice using the logit model where    1  2   3  4  5  6  7  8  9   10 2 37 we also examined as an alternative the treatment effect of the states specific lockdown effects and found the results to be qualitatively similar we will discuss this in more detail in section 6 and are dummies to control for the week and day-of-week fixed effects is a day index from 1 to 106 to control for any continuous time trend from january 1 to april 15 2020 controls for all of the user-day-level app usage factors such as the users total app usage time the total number of app activities the total number of unique app categories and the entropy of usage time across the different app categories on a certain day moreover we considered and to further control for the daily-level trend of user opt in to mobile location tracking we ran the individual logit model for each of the 20 cities in addition  captured any other additional factors such as the population density of the block where the individual resides as well as the covid-19-related health risk infection rate and death rate for robustness checking we also ran these analyses using individual-level and day-level fixed effects notably nonlinear models eg logit sometimes are difficult to interpret because the cross-partial may have a different sign than the coefficient on the interaction term ai and norton 2003  so to check the robustness of the coefficients in the interaction terms in the logit model we also conducted a similar analysis using the linear probability model lpm 39 overall we found that the interaction effects remained qualitatively consistent our main results are shown in table 2  we will discuss them in the next section beyond the social-demographic effect we were also interested in the relationships among social distancing political affiliation and americans privacy choices before and after covid-19 to study such 38 to be precise the mean treatment effect estimated from our model is the average treatment effect on the treated att eyi1 -yi0  treati  1 because in our case we didnt have a formal control group but instead multiple groups treated simultaneously essentially we estimated a heterogeneous treatment effect from an event study across different treated groups using a diff-in-difflike setting note that because the treatment in our study was rather exogenous as opposed to most other event studies where the treatment was endogenous the att in our study was actually equivalent to the average treatment effect ate eyi1 -yi0 because the chance of getting treatment was orthogonal to the outcome treati  yi1 yi0 eg rubin 1983 1984  39 besides we also conducted a survival analysis using the cox-proportional hazard model to examine the covid-19 mean treatment effect on an individuals hazard rate of opt out overall we found that the mean effect remained qualitatively consistent to further understand the effect of political affiliation we also ran a pooled analysis with ten blue cities and ten red cities for robustness checking we also conducted analyses using the negative binomial model with block-level and day-level fixed effects we provide the corresponding results in tables 3-4 next we will discuss our findings in detail from these two levels of analysis in this section we first discuss our main findings then we will also discuss some additional falsification tests conducted to validate our findings we estimated both individual-day-level and block-day-level models specified in equations 1-3 and we report our empirical results in tables 2-4   p  010  p  005  p  001  p  0001 column 1 shows the mean effect of the covid-19 national emergency declaration on peoples likelihood of opting out of location tracking the negative and statistically significant coefficient with magnitude -0027 suggests that the covid-19 national emergency has a negative marginal effect and that on an average it will decrease the probability of a consumer opting out of location tracking by 16 this result is consistent with the model-free evidence and indicates that americans are more willing to share their location data after the trump administration declared the national emergency column 2 looks at how the treatment effect is heterogeneous across different income groups the coefficients on the low-income bracket below 60k and 60k-100k are both negative and statistically significant whereas the coefficients on the high-income brackets 100k-150k 150k-200k 200k are positive and statistically significant these results are striking in general they suggest that compared with low-income people high-income people were not only more privacy-concerned before covid-19 but also have become even more privacy-concerned and more likely to opt out of location tracking in contrast lowincome people have become even less privacy-conscious after covid-19 column 3 reports the treatment effect as interacted with race the findings regarding how race moderates the main effect are heterogeneous across different cities columns 4 and 5 we also looked at how the treatment effect varies with gender the result indicated that males in general are more privacy-concerned than females and that moreover after covid-19 males have become even more privacy-concerned and more likely to opt out of location tracking in contrast females have become even less privacy-concerned the above findings remain highly similar among the cities the details across all 20 cities are reported in appendix a tables a1-a20 as a response to covid-19 people have been encouraged to stay home and practice social distancing to help stem the spread of the viral pandemic it was reported by cnn that the trump administration wanted to use personal mobile location data to track the level of social distancing and trace close contacts to prevent the spread of coronavirus an intriguing question given this situation is whether people may want to sacrifice their privacy for the greater social good so we turned to an examination of how peoples opt-out decision is affected by the covid-19 national emergency declaration and social distancing across the 20 cities we present our results on washington dc in table 3 as an example results for all of the other cities are presented in tables b1-b20 in appendix b the analysis was conducted on the block level we report in column 1 of table 3 a specification which includes the national emergency treatment ie treat and three variables that capture how well people practice social distancing ie total daily contacts daily travel distance and daily average travel speed we were also interested in the heterogeneous treatment effect on people practicing different levels of social distancing so we included an additional specification with an interaction effect between treat and total daily contacts the coefficient on treat across the 20 cities tells a consistent story people were less likely to opt out and more willing to share their mobile locations after the covid-19 national emergency declaration the coefficients on total daily contacts daily travel distance and daily average travel speed are both positive and significant this indicates a positive relationship between the practice of social distancing and the willingness to share location data people who travelled more and interacted with a larger number of close contacts during the pandemic were also more likely to opt out of location tracking on the flip side people who practiced social distancing ie those who travelled less and interacted with fewer close contacts during the pandemic were also more likely to share their location data taking the coefficient on total daily contacts in table 3 as an example we can explain the result in an intuitive way one unit increase in face-to-face contact in a block is associated with a 1303 exp0265 increase in the number of opt outs in the same block on the same day  p  010  p  005  p  001  p  0001 models 17 are based on the poisson model we also ran analyses using the negative binomial model and the results remained highly consistent what is more striking was that the positive relationship between social distancing and location sharing became even more salient after the national emergency was declared this is supported by the positive and statistically significant coefficient ie 0219 on the interaction terms treat and total daily contacts in column 2 of table 3  because the outcome variable was the number of total opt outs in each block we conducted count data analyses using both the poisson and negative binomial models columns 1 -2 are based on the poisson model and columns 3 -4 are based on the negative binomial model we found that the results remained highly consistent 40 while table 3 shows the results for dc appendix b provides the replicatedanalysis results for all 20 cities the results were robust across cities as well table 3 yes  p  010  p  005  p  001  p  0001  nebraska never ordered residents to stay home the results are based on the main analyses using the poisson model we also ran the same analyses using the negative binomial model and the results remained highly consistent furthermore we conduct pooled analyses for all 20 cities to see if the effect of social distancing on privacy concerns varied across political affiliations the results are shown in table 4  first we ran the pooled analysis for all 10 red cities and for all 10 blue cities separately as shown in columns 1 to 6 then we ran the pooled analysis with all 20 cities together using a blue city indicator as shown in column 7 looking at columns 1 to 6 the coefficients are qualitatively similar to those in table 3  this indicates that individuals who practice social distancing are more likely to share their location data than are those who do not practice social distancing besides comparing the coefficients of the interaction effect between treatment and daily contacts in columns 3 and 6 of table 4  we found that such a positive correlation between social distancing and location sharing appears more salient in blue cities than in red ones after covid-19 in addition we conducted similar analyses at the block-day level for all 20 cities using the statespecific lockdowns in each city as the treatment variable we provide the mean effects of the two treatments national emergency vs state lockdown in table 5 for comparison we found that the results remained qualitatively consistent in a large majority of the cities 41 in consideration of all the empirical evidence shown above we summarize our major findings as follows political affiliation and privacy concern people were more willing to share their mobile locations after president trump declared the covid-19 national emergency on march 13 the results were also consistent in each city when we used the state-specific lockdowns in each city as the treatment variable despite the increasing concern that government authorities the private sector and public health experts may have to use individual-level location data to track the coronavirus we find that there is a significant and decreasing trend of opt out of location sharing with mobile apps in the us our results are consistent with recent studies 42 demonstrating an increased willingness of americans to share location and health data to help slow the spread of the virus and reduce the lockdown period while in general people in the blue cities were more privacy-concerned than those in the red cities before the advent of the covid-19 crisis there was a significant decrease in opt-out rates after covid-19 and this effect was more salient in the blue cities than in the red cities 41 we noticed the effect of state lockdown was positive in arlington and virginia beach this was likely due to the fact that the lockdown orders in those two states tx and va were issued relatively late apr 2 and mar 30 we did not have enough daily observations to fully observe the post-treatment trend ie april 15 is the last day of observation in the current data set the estimate of the effect of the state order also appears positive for seattle which seems somewhat noisy we are now collecting post-april 15 data to run additional robustness tests 42 httpsblogsscientificamericancomobservationswill-americans-be-willing-to-install-covid-19-tracking-apps httpwebuseorgcovid httpswwwemarketercomcontentconsumers-are-more-willing-to-share-private-data-during-covid-19 social distancing and privacy concern the practice of social distancing and willingness to share location data were positively correlated people who practice social distancing ie those who travel less and interact with fewer close contacts during the pandemic were also more likely to share their location data whereas anti-social-distancing people ie those who travel more and interact with a greater number of close contacts during the pandemic were more likely to opt out of location tracking such positive relationship between social distancing and location sharing has become even more salient after trump declared the national emergency and after the state-specific lockdowns such positive relationship between social distancing and location sharing appeared to be more salient in blue cities than in red ones after the declaration high-income people and males in general are more privacyconcerned than are low-income people and females after covid-19 high-income people has become even more privacy-concerned and more likely to opt out of location tracking finally an interesting observation from both our individual-level analyses  table 2 tables a1-a20  and block-level analyses table 3 tables b1-b20 suggests two opposing forces with respect to privacy concern on the one hand our findings show a positive relationship between willingness to practice social distancing and willingness to share location data this seems also to suggest an underlying pro-social cause that might positively affect both peoples compliance to nationalstate lockdown orders and their willingness to trade privacy for social good during the pandemic period such pro-social behavior is also moderated by the potential health risk previous research 43 has shown that people whom the cdc has identified as being higher risk were more likely to be willing to install contact-tracing apps for location tracking we found consistent evidence that health risk factors infection rate and death rate had a significant negative effect on peoples opt-out behavior and that cities that were hit harder by covid-19 demonstrated a more salient drop in the opt-out rate 44  on the other hand the change in peoples opt-out behavior could also be a result of a change in time availability with the increased time available due to shelter-at-home and social-distancing policies it is conceivable that consumers may more likely have the time to read through the mobile apps privacy policies and react accordingly given the increased surveillance concerns and awareness in our data we observe a general increasing trend in people opting out of location tracking before covid-19 if indeed people had more time at home after covid-19 and were checking their privacy settings more thoroughly 43 httpwebuseorgcovid 44 we found that blue cities on average were hit harder by covid-19 than red cities in terms of both infection rate and death rate as shown in table d in appendix d this is consistent with our observation of a pro-social cause and to some extent explains why blue cities witnessed a larger drop in opt-out rate after covid we would expect to see more opt outs given the general increasing trend in privacy concern hence this indicates that time availability may negatively affect peoples willingness to share location data we also saw such evidence from the weekend effect in the datawhen people have more free time during weekends they are more likely to opt out of location tracking compared with during weekdays this pattern becomes less prominent after covid-19 potentially due to a blurred boundary between weekends and weekdays particularly after the stay-at-home order therefore whether a consumer is more likely to share location data or not after covid-19 depends on which force plays the dominant role interestingly our results show that on average people were more likely to share their location data after covid-19 this indicates that the pro-social cause seems to play a more dominant role in the entire american population this trend is especially prominent for the low-income groups this could potentially be due to the fact that many low-income people are essential workers and did not experience a marked increase in time availability after covid-19 in contrast we observed that high-income people became more privacy-concerned and more likely to opt out of location tracking this seems to indicate that the effect of time availability plays a more dominant role in this case-high-income people having received a stronger positive shock to their time availability after covid-19 given the more practical nature of highincome groups they would be more likely to use such increased time availability to checkrevise privacy settings 45 to validate the robustness of our findings we conducted a number of falsification tests 1 alternative treatment dates first we were interested in testing whether the treatment the covid-19 national emergency declaration on mar 13 indeed has brought a negative shock to peoples privacy opt-out behavior or if there was simply a downward trend over time the week day-of-week dummies and day index in our model could help to a large extent to control for such time trends besides as we can see in figure 3  the predominant drop in the opt-out rate does not appear until after the treatment to further validate our results we reran our analyses using alternative hypothetical dates prior to march 13 as treatment dates because march 13 is a friday we chose two alternative fridays in january jan 17 jan 24 and two in february feb 14 feb 28 and ran our estimations separately again overall we did not find a similar statistically significant drop in peoples opt-out behavior under the hypothetical treatment dates 45 our finding is also consistent with several recent studies eg chiou and tucker 2020 showing that people from higher-income regions display more compliance with social distancing and remain-at-home orders hence enjoying a higher increase in time availability we conducted this falsification test for all of the cities we illustrate the results in table 6 using dc as an example we can see that the estimated treatment effects are mostly statistically insignificant and moreover the direction of the effects is mostly positive as opposed to a negative effect after the actual treatment of mar 13 2 exogeneity of treatment second there might be a concern that the treatment is not completely exogenous for example the mainstream media articles on location tracking could have appeared because they had observed significant changes in peoples willingness to share their location data we argue that this is very unlikely first of all those articles were written in response to the recent emergence of contact-tracing technologies developed by tech companies like google and apple instead of in reaction to the observation of changes in consumers opt-out behavior furthermore the development of contact-tracing technologies has been in response to the covid-19 pandemic which is completely exogenous and has nothing to do with consumer privacy behavior in addition to further test this we also ran a set of prediction models to see if peoples opt-out behavior can predict the treatment variable we found the predictive performance to be rather low eg taking washington dc as an example the correlation between previous opt-out rate and future treatment was statistically insignificant the prediction accuracy was merely 67  p  010  p  005  p  001  p  0001 finally a potential alternative explanation to our main finding is that the observed decreasing trend of opt outs in the post-treatment period could have been due to an overall decrease in peoples mobile app usage in particular people could simply uninstall an app due to lack of interest in it instead of just opting out of location tracking the uninstallation behavior could also lead to the cessation of location data however it is important to note that in order to completely disappear from our location-data set the individual needs to simultaneously uninstall all of the affiliated apps that use the location tracking sdk provided by our location-data partner given the market share of the company and the coverage of their client apps this is very unlikely to occur a related confounder is that the observed drop in opt outs after covid-19 could also have been due to a sudden increase of new app installations-that is because more people were stuck at home they could have been installing new apps for convenience some of which may require location tracking to function eg uber eats for food delivery this could potentially lead to more opt ins to location sharing but it would have nothing to do with peoples existing privacy perspectives week before last day to further test these alternative explanations we conducted robustness tests to check individuals app usage behavior before the last day of observation ie before the user opted out specifically if our result were due to uninstallations of all of the affiliated apps we would expect to see a pre-existing decreasing trend for the opt-out users in their daily app activities before the opt out in contrast if our result were due to an increase in the new app installation we would expect to see a pre-existing increasing trend in the users daily app activities in our main analyses we explicitly controlled for all of the app-usagerelated factors eg total usage time unique app categories daily number of locations over time at both the individual and block levels and we found our findings to be highly robust this step to a large extent controls for the pre-existing trends in app usage behavior moreover based on a further comparison of the distribution of individual-level app activities we did not find either a decreasing or an increasing trend before the opt out for illustration we show in figure 8  the distributions of the total individual-level numbers of app activities for washing dc 46 for each opt-out user we plot the total app activities on the last day of observation onetwothree days before the last day and one week before the last day as we can see in figure 8  the distribution remains highly consistent across all days suggesting no significant preexisting trend in user app activities our paper has some limitations first we cannot necessarily ascertain if the privacy opt-out behavior we observed is because of pro-social behavior or because people had more available time while they were at home that might make them want to change their privacy choices that being said we did observe that there was a general increasing trend of people opting out of location tracking over time before the covid-19 crisis but that after the national emergency declaration and the state-specific lockdown dates there was a reduction in the opt-out rates if indeed people had more time at home after covid-19 and were reading the privacy policies of mobile apps and checking their privacy settings more thoroughly we would have expected to see more opt outs given the general increasing trend in privacy concern but we in fact saw fewer opt outs and so this partially mitigates the concern about time as opposed to pro-social behavior being the driving factor however we do acknowledge that to unpack the mechanisms we will likely need to conduct a survey that is outside the scope of this paper we leave it to future research having used a granular individual-level dataset consisting of over 22 billion records from ten blue democratic and ten red republican us cities we present some of the first evidence of how americans responded to increasing privacy concerns during the covid-19 pandemic we demonstrate a significant decrease in the opt out of location sharing in the us while areas with more democrats were 46 we have also provided a similar analysis of total app usage time in figure e in appendix e more privacy-concerned than areas with more republicans before the advent of the covid-19 crisis there was a decrease in the overall opt-out rates after covid-19 and this effect was more salient among the democratic than republican cities people who practice social distancing were also less likely to opt out whereas the converse was true for those less compliant with social distancing this effect appeared to be more salient among the democratic than republican cities finally we show that high-income populations cities with a higher proportion of the white population and males in general were more privacy-concerned relative to low-income populations cities with a more diverse population and females thus demographic differences influenced the extent of pro-social behavior exhibited by americans our results are consistent with recent surveys held in the post covid-19 period that indicate that a majority of american are willing to allow mobile apps to disclose their locations in order to help public officials flag hot spots of covid-19 and help slow the spread of the virus thereby our work can help dictate where more physical resources may be necessary for local governments to invest in order to curb the spread of covid-19 in places that people are more likely to opt-out from location data sharing overall our research demonstrates that americans in both blue and red cities generally formed a unified front in sacrificing personal privacy for the societal good amid covid-19 while simultaneously exhibiting a divergence in the extent of such a sacrifice along the lines of political affiliation social-distancing compliance and demographics  p  010  p  005  p

distancing to mitigate covid-19 sean young d john schneider   telemedicine coverage policies are complex dynamic and geographically specific much of the current policies have limited the extent to which patients can be cared for remotely many jurisdictions have strict requirements as to the type of provider the location of the patient and medium of communication in addition barriers to engaging patients where they are are driven by early conceptions for telehealth for example hiv-related telemedicine was primarily developed as a way for hiv specialists or consultants to provide care to remote areas including rural contexts or to inaccessible patients such as incarcerated persons in such cases there is local control on both ends of the connection with well-established and controlled systems in illinois for example the provision of care required patients to be in a clinical setting this system has recently been upended by the covid-19 pandemic in order to increase social distancing on march 17th 2020 the telehealth waiver in medicare under hr 6047 was implemented allowing for an expanded fee for services provision 1 2 while the provision did not expand the allowable types of secure digital platforms or disciplines of care providers this change importantly eliminated site limitations for patients such that a patient-centered approach can be deployed allowing for patients to be seen where they wish clearly this is perfect social distancing in a covid-19 context it ensures that providers and patients are kept as safe as possible with the additional benefit of helping providers avoid clinical contexts that have additional coronavirus transmission risk particularly in hyperepidemic locations such as new york city as a case example of illinois academic medical centers such as the university of chicago and federally qualified health centers such as howard brown health rapidly transitioned scheduled patients to telemedicine developed telemedicine protocols billing algorithms and hippaa compliant communication videoconferencing platforms this occurred over days with clinical flows and patient acceptability still being examined from an implementation science perspective there are several important questions around telemedicine effectiveness feasibility acceptability and contextual variation 3 in addition while covid-19 presents a unique solution to social distancing it is unclear how telemedicine will change as we move to the post-covid era and how hiv and routine prep care may be impacted social media chatbots and mobile apps have been studied across a number of clinical and public health settings including patient outreach screening and monitoring intervention delivery remote vital sign assessment as well for providing treatment recommendations and retaining patients in care for example social media discussions about hiv and syphilis-related risk behaviors can be modeled with artificial intelligence to monitor and predict future cases within regions helping to inform interventions that can be digitally delivered and tailored to at-risk populations 4 social media and mobile apps can also be used to engage and retain patients at risk for and living with hiv helping to keep them connected to clinical care during times when non-essential in-person visits are discouraged the already widespread use of these technologies makes them appropriate tools for keeping patients engaged in care automatically-responding chatbots can be also be integrated into health settings such as by asking questions and routing patients to appropriate educational resources or next steps for treatment eg setting up an appointment based on responses for example specific to covid-19 the cdc has released a coronavirus self-checker tool to assess symptoms and provide recommendations for next steps based on screening results 5 tools like this could be adapted for the special needs of hiv populations including items on substance use-related risk behaviors and hiv medication adherence in order to assess comorbid risks between hiv covid-19 substance and mental health biosensors and wearable including non-wearing remote sensing devices can assist with clinical care especially in settings where remote patient monitoring of behaviors vital signs and other clinical outcomes is needed 6 in addition to the most common sensors being used that track sleep activity and heart rate sensors are also available to track respiratory rate sweat temperature breathing abnormalitiescoughing and oxygen saturation all important covid-19-related signs and symptoms biosensors and wearables can be used to assist with clinical monitoring and care while maintaining social distancing and stay-at-home orders for example respiratory oxygen saturation and temperature sensors can be used to monitor vital signs among patients such as for substance useaddiction medicine treatment monitoring hypertensive medication adherence and pulmonary care patients biosensor technologies can also facilitate social distancing between patients and between high-risk covid-19 patients and providers newer approaches eg digital contact tracing are using bluetooth signals to identify whether and when people have been socialphysical distancing by assessing distances between 2 or more phonesmobile devices data from these devices can be used to not only inform social distancing efforts but also to inform hiv research efforts as these methods of measuring distances between phones might be integrated into hiv studies to hypothesize whether and when people are engaging in sexual risk behaviors similar to early studies on electronic health records studies integrating telehealth technologies into hiv prevention interventions have had mixed results on health outcomes for various practical and intervention design reasons however studies including a report from the agency for health research and quality largely support use of these tools to remotely monitor patients and keep them engaged if used correctly 7 findings suggest that these tools are especially impactful when delivered based on specific rather than general needs eg keeping hiv patients engaged in socially-distanced care and on evidenced-based behavioral and social science frameworks although this note has categorized and separated the technologies above to help distinguish their use the most effective approaches would likely integrate several of these technologies because of their complementary features a number of potential issues need to be addressed before implementing fully-integrated systems however including ethicalrisk monitoring patient engagement costs and staffing requirements due to the rapid changes required related to covid-19 it is expected that these issues will be addressed quickly covid-19 will continue to impact the way that technologies are integrated into hiv clinical care and research long after the removal of social distancing policies making it important to begin investing in the knowledge infrastructure and implementation of these technologies now to be prepared for the future  scientific and ethical basis for social-distancing interventions against covid-19 joseph lewnard a nathan lo c   on dec 31 2019 the who china country office received notice of a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology in the chinese city of wuhan hubei province1 the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has since risen exponentially now affecting all who regions the number of cases reported to date is likely to represent an underestimation of the true burden as a result of shortcomings in surveillance and diagnostic capacity affecting case ascertainment in both high-resource and low-resource settings2 by all scientifically meaningful criteria the world is undergoing a covid-19 pandemic in the absence of any pharmaceutical intervention the only strategy against covid-19 is to reduce mixing of susceptible and infectious people through early ascertainment of cases or reduction of contact in the lancet infectious diseases joel koo and colleagues3 assessed the potential effect of such social distancing interventions on sars-cov-2 spread and covid-19 burden in singapore the context is worthy of study since singapore was among the first settings to report imported cases and has so far succeeded in preventing community spread during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov outbreak in singapore numerous non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented successfully including effective triage and infection control measures in health-care settings isolation and quarantine of patients with sars and their contacts and mass screening of school-aged children for febrile illness4 each of these measures represented an escalation of typical public health action however the scale and disruptive impact of these interventions were small compared with the measures that have been implemented in china in response to covid-19 including closure of schools workplaces roads and transit systems cancellation of public gatherings mandatory quarantine of uninfected people without known exposure to sars-cov-2 and large-scale electronic surveillance5 6 although these actions have been praised by who5 the possibility of imposing similar measures in other countries raises important questions populations for whom social-distancing interventions have been implemented require and deserve assurance that the decision to enact these measures is informed by the best attainable evidence for a novel pathogen such as sars-cov-2 mathematical modelling of transmission under differing scenarios is the only viable and timely method to generate such evidence koo and colleagues3 adapted an existing influenza epidemic simulation model7 using granular data on the composition and behaviour of the population of singapore to assess the potential consequences of specific social-distancing interventions on the transmission dynamics of sars-cov-2 the authors considered three infectivity scenarios basic reproduction number r
0 of 15 20 or 25 and assumed between 75 and 500 of infections were asymptomatic the interventions were quarantine with or without school closure and workplace distancing whereby 50 of workers telecommute although the complexity of the model makes it difficult to understand the impact of each parameter the primary conclusions were robust to sensitivity analyses the combined intervention in which quarantine school closure and workplace distancing were implemented was the most effective compared with the baseline scenario of no interventions the combined intervention reduced the estimated median number of infections by 993 iqr 926999 when r
0 was 15 by 930 815997 when r
0 was 20 and by 782 590944 when r
0 was 25 the observation that the greatest reduction in covid-19 cases was achieved under the combined intervention is not surprising however the assessment of the additional benefit of each intervention when implemented in combination offers valuable insight since each approach individually will result in considerable societal disruption it is important to understand the extent of intervention needed to reduce transmission and disease burden new findings emerge daily about transmission routes and the clinical profile of sars-cov-2 including the substantially underestimated rate of infection among children8 the implications of such findings with regard to the authors conclusions about school closure remain unclear additionally reproductive number estimates for singapore are not yet available the authors estimated that 75 of infections are clinically asymptomatic although data on the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic are scarce as shown by koo and colleagues in sensitivity analyses with higher asymptomatic proportions this value will influence the effectiveness of social-distancing interventions additionally the analysis assumes high compliance of the general population which is not guaranteed although the scientific basis for these interventions might be robust ethical considerations are multifaceted9 importantly political leaders must enact quarantine and social-distancing policies that do not bias against any population group the legacies of social and economic injustices perpetrated in the name of public health have lasting repercussions10 interventions might pose risks of reduced income and even job loss disproportionately affecting the most disadvantaged populations policies to lessen such risks are urgently needed special attention should be given to protections for vulnerable populations such as homeless incarcerated older or disabled individuals and undocumented migrants similarly exceptions might be necessary for certain groups including people who are reliant on ongoing medical treatment the effectiveness and societal impact of quarantine and social distancing will depend on the credibility of public health authorities political leaders and institutions it is important that policy makers maintain the publics trust through use of evidence-based interventions and fully transparent fact-based communication

sars-cov-2 is 96 identical to that of a bat coronavirus kucharski et al 2020 cao et al 2020 sars-cov-2 seemingly had made its transition from animals on an animal market in wuhan city in china although the efforts to identify potential intermediate hosts seem to have been neglected in wuhan and the exact transmission route have to be clarified the primary clinical symptoms of the sars-cov-2- linked disease covid-19 which permitted the case detection as pneumonia recently literatures report the description of gastrointestinal symptoms and asymptomatic infections especially among young children the average incubation period is ranging from 0 to 24 days li et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 as we are writing these lines the pandemic affects 200 countries and territories with around 1357382 infected subjects more than 120 438 deaths and 456773 recovered patients according to the johns hopkins university as who has declared the fast spreading of covid-19 as an epidemic the citizens around the globe hastened to go home for instance in the case of wuhan city in china which has been the epicenter of the pandemic with over than 11 million people is shown to have produced 200 tons of clinical trash on a single day exactly 24 february2020 which is four times the amount the citys only dedicated facility can incinerate per day as coronavirus is spreading rapidly to other parts of the world very soon the medical waste management could be a big issue medical health organizations waste management companies have already taken step in coronavirus decontamination services it is becoming very crucial for governments to find solutions soon at the meantime it is every individuals duty to follow the regulations while discarding of their face masks and other medical wastes luan and ching 2020 to the end it is possible only by mutual understanding and willingness and world will emerge stronger than this epidemic some people are at higher risk of adverse effects from contact to medical wastes as well including cleaners trash collectors and some other people who have to spend a great amount of time in public places all over the world governments stopped students to go to schools and universities and a lot of employees are being asked to work from home only those who are maintaining the cleanliness of cities have to go to their jobs daily that makes them among the most vulnerable groups and one that is highly susceptible to the virus from respiratory shed droplets on the masks they may also be infected by other pathogens existing in the discarded pieces of garbage for instance meningitis and hepatitis b the masks are made up of plastic based materials that are liquid- resistant and are long lasting after they are discarded ending up in ocean or landfill the surgical masks should not be worn longer than one day discarding them and empty bottles of hand sanitizer along with solid tissue papers are ending up to a huge trail of medical waste in the environment for instance in hong kong where covid- 19 infection started in late january2020 the medical wastes have already polluted the environment recently an environmental ngo ocean asia in soko islands took a survey according to it in hong kong a large amount of discarded single-use masks washed up to a 100-meter stretch of beach gary stokes the director of the ocean asia ngo who has been monitoring the ocean surface trash his team has seen a few masks over the years but now they were spotted all along the high tide line and seashore with new deposits coming with each current while this recent covid-19 outbreak the general public have started wearing surgical masks in order to take precautionary measures when 7 million people suddenly start wearing one or a couple of masks daily single use gloves and hand sanitizers the amount of trash created is going to be substantial the contrary impacts of such medical wastes are far-reaching when these are remained discarded in an animals natural habitat in both land and ocean this could cause animals to mistakenly eat this as food and lead in their death hellewell et al 2020 the diagram below illustrates the problems of polluting the environment by medical wastes while covid-19 pandemic fig 1
 covid-19 does not affect everyone in the same way there are several reasons thats why different socioeconomic groups are affected by this pandemic in different ways to understand the consequences and to predict how this pandemic affects differently with various socioeconomic groups is not easy and good data is the key to it these socioeconomic factors include population density urban and rural settings education level lifestyle the size of household and homeowners  tenants sometimes only a single block distance neighborhood household within the socioeconomic spectrum can make a huge difference in ones life demonstrate form the us in club vitas us longevity map therefore sometimes it is very unfortunate that people who are feeling the effects of covid-19 very severely are probably in your neighbors messner 2020 majority of the countries are now trying different tactics to stop the spreading of the disease and trying to limit only a subset of the people would catch the disease it has been indicated that groups with lower socioeconomic status could be more at danger from the spread of the covid-19 based on the analysis of new york showing that poor neighborhoods have been affected highly covid-19 spreads by droplets shed of the respiratory system by someone with the virus which means it would spread with higher proximity of people larger contact networks and lower levels of hygiene there are some factors which increase the risk of catching the virus1-population density close contact among people is very high in urban areas rather than rural areas2-household size a big household will have a higher chance to bring the virus home while in household where one person lives alone heshe will have to catch the virus outside the household in sweden social-distancing regulations are not taken very strictly due to the high proportion of single person household whereas in italy based on the multi-generational homes apparently contributed to the multiplication of the coronavirus3-social distancing level social distancing is very effective to stop the spread of the disease but several reasons that various groups might show dissimilar levels of social distancing
official advice might be dependable between regions for instance guidance in the us has varied even between neighboring towns access to local guidance might be different between socioeconomic groups for instance guidance might be provided online or in particular languagesworking from home might reduce social contact but can only be available to some people focused in jobs linked to higher socioeconomic statusstay at home regulations would be more than a challenge for those who live in smaller and crowded houses or without outside spacesome groups would be obedient to social distancing regulations not allnot all who are infected by the covid-19 will react severely to it there are some factors that contribute to the risk of covid-19 but they are probably felt differently by different socioeconomic groups lipsitch et al 2020people who have had medical problems of diabetes chronic respiratory disease cardiovascular disease or even high blood pressure and cancer are at higher risk from coronavirus giannis et al 2020 fang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020who has warned the smokers that they might be highly at risk because to the obvious effects of smoking on the lungs and smoking is common in lower socioeconomic groupsdifferent socioeconomic groups do not have access to the same level of healthcare services this would particularly common in countries like us where the huge number of uninsured population is concentrated in certain industries not to universal health care system
 therefore some socioeconomic groups are more likely at risk compared to others so logically higher numbers of deaths can be expected from certain parts of society this can be highly related for pension plans using analysis of this experience of the population to predict future mortality rates the post pandemic population may look more different compared to the start point of this outbreak the annual percentage change in gross domestic products is shown in table1
 the short-term scenarios of the covid-19 environmental aspects raise many questions china is struggling to rebound from the epidemic and has to limit the re-entry of covid-19 to its region by put a check on travelers coming from abroad bogoch et al 2020 in a country with such a high population where the majority of its population has not yet experienced covid-19 and has no immunological contact with this virus the possibility of second wave is a big risk european and north american countries has not yet reached to the peak of the epidemiological curve one crucial aspect seems obvious the fast control of the outbreak done by china could not be implemented to democratic countries where rights of individuals are very high therefore outside china no leader has the capability to enforce these measures at the level of china bai et al 2020 the question is what will happen in countries of indian sub-continent the middle-east and south america where they live in crowded forms traditionally big gatherings are common and the public health systems are insufficient the possibility of secondary peak appearance could not be estimated in the mid-term the scenario in the southern hemisphere should be considered not almost all south american and african countries have access to national health systems and sufficient health care services many of these nations decided to close the borders however very late when they already had patients of covid-19 inside all these indications show that the southern hemisphere would not escape from this pandemic the outbreak is widening in the southern hemisphere now and this is happening while the higher income nations are struggling over their own problems in i applying control actions ii trying to recuperate from the massive social and economic impacts and iii focusing in preventing re-entry of covid-19 by foreign travelers chinazzi et al 2020 the long-term scenario of probable secondary waves of outbreak is concerning as well a second wave might be devastating more than the first one based on other pandemics in history economists have shown serious concerns about the economic effects of control measures taken during this crisis hemida and abduallah 2020 however there are many models that show the economic impacts of the disease and majority of the economists are challenged by the social and economic depth of the pandemic they are trying to understand the control as soon as possible although the economic losses are obvious but still economists are not able to grasped the extending nature of the outbreak that is causing far more economic damage compared to drastic measures taken to end the pandemic globally as soon as possible meo et al 2020 anderson et al 2020 the covid-19 pandemic will have severe impact on socioeconomic growth across the globe as shown in table2
 general actions to decrease person to person transmission of coronavirus are needed to control the present outbreak special restrictions strategies and efforts should be applied to protect the highly vulnerable populations such as children health care workers and older aged people kucharski et al 2020 a guideline has been already published for the medical employees health care providers and public health individuals and researchers who are interested in working in the coronavirus mossa-basha et al 2020 the major death cases of coronavirus outbreak are happening mainly in old people probably because of a poor immune system that allows rapid growth of viral infections the public services must provide in decontaminating reagents for sanitizing hands multiple times on a daily basis luan and ching 2020 physical contact with contaminated and wet things must be counted in dealing with the coronavirus particularly agents which could be a possible rout of transmission china and some other countries such as the us applied travel screening that could control and prevent the spread of the virus epidemiological alterations in coronavirus infections must be observed the probable routes of transmission and subclinical infections adaptation progression must be taken into consideration and spreading of virus among people and potential intermediate animals and reservoirs should perceived moreover still there are significant numbers of questions that need to ponder these are but not limited to details about how many people have been tested how many of them turned positive and whether this range stays constant or fluctuating additionally only fewer pediatric cases have been reported to date that could be due to lack of testing and not due to true infection rothan and byrareddy 2020 only in a period of few months the world has changed thousands of people have been deceased and hundreds of thousands have been infected by covid-19 and the rest of people who are not infected their entire life has been changed by this virus in italy the most massive travel restrictions are being placed since second world war in london the normal busy bars theatres and other public places have been closed and people are asked to stay in their homes the flights are being canceled in all over the world majority of people are staying at home practicing social distancing and working remotely harapan et al 2020 it is all happening to control the spread of coronavirus and to decrease the death rate however all these changes have led some unexpected consequences as industries transportation systems and all other bossiness have shut down it has caused a sudden drop in carbon emission compared to this time last year levels of air pollution in new york have dropped at almost 50 due to measures that have been to restrict the spread of virus in china emissions data shows a 25 decrease at the starting point of the year as people were told to stay at home factories closed and coal use feel by 40 at chinas largest power plants since the last three months of 2019 according to the ministry of ecology and environment the amount of good quality air was around 114 compared with the same time last year in more than 330 cities all over china in europe nitrogen dioxide no2 emission dropped over northern italy spain and uk as shown in satellite images ficetola and rubolini 2020 this epidemic has also caused extensive job losses and threatened the sustenance of millions of people as businesses are struggling and are shut down to control the spread of virus economic activities have been stopped and stock markets dropped along with the falling carbon emission on contrary it is definitely a decarbonized maintainable economy that many have been supporting for decades an epidemic of this type that is taking peoples lives definitely should not be seen as a route of bringing about environmental change either first of all it is not certain for how long this dip in emission will be when the epidemic finally subside carbon and pollutant emissions get back then it would be as if this clear skied interlude never happened and the changes we see today will not have lasting impact mccloskey and heymann 2020 another unexpected environmental impact of coronavirus has been observed in venice italy as the tourists numbers culled due to the coronavirus the waters in venices canals are cleaner compared to the past while motorboats sediment churning and other water pollutants have been dropped efficiently residents got amazed by seeing the clear water and the fish could be seen once again in the canals one of the other effects of coronavirus on environment is the noticeable drop in coal consumption this contributed in a large scale drop in air pollutants in china the number of airborne pollutants like co2 co and nitrous oxides has fallen too as millions of people are holding on lockdown across the globe energy consumption profiles in buildings are being disturbed as many people working from home nowadays domestic energy consumption is predicted to rise very quickly the predictions data showed that this has risen around 6 to 8 in the us this pandemic would ultimately save energy and also might have an effect on reducing the consumption of polluting fuels in power stations as the demand has been dropped lau et al 2020 the covid-19 pandemic has changed the air quality in many cities across the world as shown in the fig 2
 the covid-19 pandemic is spreading very quickly every day and the number of people putting on lockdown is increasing to date more than 120 438 people have died across the globe and there is a direct loss to the world economy however many think that there is a good side that the spread of virus has been decreasing air and water pollution and probably even saved lives in this process nevertheless this epidemic which is taking peoples lives certainly should not be seen as a way of bringing about positive environmental change first of all it is not certain for how long this dip in emission will be when the epidemic finally subside then carbon and other pollutant emissions get back then it would be as if this clear sky view never happened and the changes we see today will not have lasting impact general actions to reduce person to person transmission of covid-19 are required to control the current outbreak special attention and labors should be applied to save the highly vulnerable populations including children health care workers and old people there is already published guideline available for the medial employees health care providers and public health individuals and researchers who are interested in working in the coronavirus most of death cases of coronavirus outbreak are happening largely in old people possibly due to a weak immune system that permits rapid growth of viral infections the public services must provide decontaminating reagents for sanitizing hands multiple times on a routine basis physical contact with contaminated and wet things must be taken into count while dealing with coronavirus particularly agents that could be a possible route of transmission epidemiological alterations in coronavirus infections must be observed taking into consideration the probable routes of transmission and subclinical infections furthermore to the adaptation progression and spreading of virus among people and potential intermediate animals and reservoirs there are still some remaining doubts that have to be considered the most important thing is about the details of how many people have been tested how much of them turned positive and whether this range stays constant or variable a less number of pediatric cases have been reported to date that could be due to lack of testing and not due to true infection  the covid-19 global pandemic implications for people with schizophrenia and related disorders nicole kozloff benoit mulsant h vicky stergiopoulos aristotle voineskos n   starting in january 2020 coronavirus disease-19 covid-19 has rapidly developed into a global pandemic with the number of deaths continuing to climb worldwide1 the world health organization who and many governments have promulgated social distancing and social isolation to slow the spread of the virus ie flatten the curve2 these public health efforts are targeting the entire population however these strategies may be less effective for certain marginalized groups notably those with schizophrenia and related disorders referred as schizophrenia in the rest of this manuscript features of these disorders such as delusions hallucinations disorganized behavior cognitive impairment and poor insight and sociodemographic characteristics including living in congregate housing and homelessness3 may put these individuals at higher risk of becoming infected with covid-19 furthermore people living with schizophrenia are at greater risk for adverse outcomes including death because compared with the general population they typically have poorer physical health46 greater socioeconomic disadvantage7 are more socially disconnected8 and experience pervasive stigma and discrimination9 here we discuss 1 why people with schizophrenia are at increased risk of infection with covid-19 and poor outcomes 2 possible mental health consequences of covid-19 infection in people with schizophrenia 3 possible consequences for health professionals and institutions that serve patients with schizophrenia and 4 potential adverse impact on clinical research related to schizophrenia people with schizophrenia may be more susceptible to transmission of covid-19 due to a number of factors cognitive impairment lower awareness of risk and barriers to adequate infection control including congregate living10 as schizophrenia is characterized by impairments in insight and decision-making capacity11 it may be harder for people with schizophrenia to adopt and adhere to the protective measures recommended to prevent infection eg hand washing social distancing or isolation confinement12 comorbid substance use disorders highly prevalent in schizophrenia may compound impairments in judgment and decision-making13 furthermore people with schizophrenia are overrepresented in vulnerable populations that are at increased risk for covid-19 outbreaks including prisoners and individuals experiencing homelessness1415 for these groups as well as people living in congregate housing such as rooming houses and mental health supportive housing social distancing is near impossible multiple factors increase the risk of poor outcomes from covid-19 in people with schizophrenia smoking which is prevalent in more than 60 of people with schizophrenia16 may increase the risk of disease progression and severe complications from covid-19 including death via its effects on lung health and immune responsiveness17 early but robust data indicate that mortality from covid-19 is particularly elevated in people with comorbid conditions in particular cardiovascular disease diabetes and chronic respiratory disease1819 all of which are more common in people with schizophrenia than the general population2022 antipsychotic medications commonly prescribed in schizophrenia particularly clozapine appear to be associated with risk of death from pneumonia related to impaired swallowing sedation and hypersalivation which worsen during the immune response due to a feedback loop that increases clozapine concentrations23 while we are unaware of evidence specifically linking clozapine to deaths from coronaviruses there is at least a hypothetical risk several other factors put people with schizophrenia at risk they experience substantial disparities in access to health care related in part to the effects of stigma on help-seeking2425 and discrimination when they access care they are more likely to experience underdiagnosis of comorbid physical illnesses less likely to receive screening and definitive interventions and generally receive poorer-quality care26 the who recommends that isolating testing and treating every suspected case and tracing every contact is the best way of preventing widespread community transmission2 barriers to uptake of protective measures and appropriate use of health care services among people with schizophrenia could have profound implications for containment of the pandemic furthermore preexisting health disparities could be exacerbated in the context of limited resources failure to promote fair and equitable resource allocation could result in more severe complications for people with schizophrenia including death27 mechanisms and guidelines to uphold the rights to health for people with schizophrenia and promote equitable outcomes are urgently needed previous outbreaks have had persistent mental health effects following the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars pandemic significantly elevated rates of psychiatric disorders and psychological distress were present28 researchers have already sounded the alarm on how the covid-19 pandemic may affect the mental health of the general population and more specifically patients with mental disorders10 if the stress related to the covid-19 pandemic and corresponding public health measures worsens mental health in the general population one would expect that their impact might be even higher in people living with schizophrenia29 in addition covid-19 infection itself may exacerbate symptoms in people with schizophrenia as coronaviruses may be associated with psychotic symptoms through an immune-related mechanism30 furthermore symptoms associated with coronaviruses and their treatment have been associated with distress related to symptom severity and isolation as well as psychosis secondary to steroids and other interventions31 social distancing whereby governments have discouraged and imposed restrictions to reduce physical proximity has been widely adopted in order to decrease community transmission of covid-19 fears of contracting covid-19 along with significant social isolation have led to more than half of the general public surveyed in china to report that the outbreak had a moderate or severe psychological impact on them32 social distancing practices could have a particularly negative impact on individuals with schizophrenia typically individuals with schizophrenia on average have smaller and poorer-quality social networks than the general population33 thus they may be more able to comply with and tolerate social distancing directives however social support has been associated with higher scores on recovery measures in schizophrenia34 and broad community supports including casual contacts at pharmacies grocery stores and cafes have also been associated with improved recovery and community integration scores in schizophrenia35 these casual contacts will be disrupted by social distancing putting patients at risk among people with schizophrenia social isolation may increase the risk for suicide36 and stress has been associated with aggressive behavior37 social distancing may also disproportionately impact the ability of people with schizophrenia to maintain their basic needs given their high reliance on income support and other community services that become more difficult to access38 for those with substance dependence changes in the ability to access substances and their treatments including agonist therapies can precipitate crises thus developing approaches to maintain social connection to instrumental supports in the face of social distancing may be especially crucial for people with schizophrenia video conferencing apps are widely used to maintain face-to-face connection during the outbreak similarly programs and government agencies that provide essential services to the community should strive to find ways to maintain their efforts to ensure continued and safe delivery of services to vulnerable populations the covid-19 pandemic has created challenges for the health professionals and programs that provide services to patients with schizophrenia continuity of care is critical for these patients to prevent decompensation and its consequences including emergency department visits and hospital admissions resulting in further strain on the health care system mental and physical deterioration and even deaths39 in february 2020 a cluster of approximately 50 patients and 30 medical staff were diagnosed with covid-19 at the wuhan mental health center40 factors hypothesized to have increased the risk of outbreak on an inpatient psychiatric unit included crowded wards lack of isolation of suspected or early cases and lack of clinical pathways to prevent infectious diseases in mental health settings40 a covid-19 outbreak in a south korean inpatient psychiatric unit infected 100 of its 102 patients and resulted in 7 deaths at the time accounting for nearly half the covid-19-related deaths in the country41 factors identified as having contributed to this outbreak were the lack of ventilation due to windows having been sealed shut to prevent suicides and restrictions on the use of hand sanitizer due to fears that some patients would drink it42 the recommendations of the wuhan group included use of a preadmission observation ward screening of admitted patients screening of hospital staff temporary prohibition of in-person visitors external food and clothing and improved skills among psychiatric care providers to identify and treat physical diseases40 similar practicesincluding isolation of at-risk individuals infection control training and auditswere successfully implemented on some psychiatric inpatient units during the 2003 sars outbreak43 additional concerns for psychiatric inpatient units include managing agitation given the risk of contagion and managing patients and staff who may have been exposed to covid-19 in the face of shortages of both personal protective equipment and staff44 strategies implemented at the centre for addiction and mental health in toronto canada modeled after a system developed during the 2003 sars outbreak involve designating different units to segregate patients with suspected infection diagnosed infection or absence of infection and assignment to every inpatient psychiatrist of backup outpatient psychiatrists prepared to seamlessly assume care in the event that an inpatient psychiatrist becomes unable to work the immediate impact of covid-19 could be even greater in outpatient settings where the majority of mental health care is delivered evidence-based models of care for schizophrenia including assertive community treatment and intensive case management emphasize in-person contacts in the community and in patients homes45 while outreach visits increase the risk of transmission to both patients and providers abrupt changes to how mental health services are delivered could increase the risk of service disengagement medication nonadherence and distress all leading to decompensation and relapse phone and video consultations have been rapidly implemented as an alternative to in-person clinical care during the covid-19 outbreak4647 however there is little research examining the suitability of telepsychiatry for schizophrenia compared with other less severe mental disorders eg depressive and anxiety disorders for which it has been typically used to date48 a recent randomized-controlled trial of adjunct videoconferencing in patients with severe mental illness compared with usual care found high levels of satisfaction associated with the service but low use over the 18-month study period49 while mobile phone ownership approaches 100 in the general population in north america or europe the use of digital technologies is lower in those with psychosis5051 despite these challenges outpatient services should strive to reduce in-person contacts when it is safe to do so through the use of telepsychiatry and the provision of longer prescription durations in addition to digital solutions used to deliver direct patient care automated text messages52 and mobile applications53 can augment care and provide support between appointments in the midst of the pandemic providers should be flexible and payers should remunerate care provided over either videoconferencing or phone to ensure access and uptake54 despite its merits virtual care cannot completely replace in-person care for schizophrenia for example the ability to detain someone involuntarily still requires in person assessment and hearings in many jurisdictions the covid-19 pandemic may lead to an increase in the acceptability of telepsychiatry for these quasilegal processes much as it has facilitated novel funding mechanisms for the expanded delivery of telehealth services54 furthermore in-person visits are required for the administration of long-acting injectable antipsychotic medications which are increasingly used in the management of schizophrenia given the role of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in reducing hospitalizations compared with oral medications55 it is prudent to continue using them even if these visits may increase the risk of infection for patients and providers similarly clozapine is associated with superior outcomes and reduced mortality in treatment-resistant schizophrenia but it requires regular bloodwork56 in response to the covid-19 pandemic the us food and drug administration fda has changed some of their regulations for laboratory monitoring requirements on an emergency basis57 thus during the pandemic the frequency of blood monitoring required for clozapine maintenance could be reduced however the risks and benefits of such a change need to be carefully considered the fda58 and national institutes of health nih59 have provided guidance for researchers conducting clinical trials and human subject studies impacted by covid-19 emphasizing safety of study participants suggestions include coordination with institutional review boards to limit study visits to those needed for participant safety or coincident with clinical care conducting virtual study visits and arranging for required laboratory tests or imaging needed for safety monitoring to occur at local laboratories or clinics certain self-administered investigational products typically picked up at the study site may be delivered through alternative secure methods58 in addition to upholding the safety of research participants it is important to safeguard the integrity of research efforts in schizophrenia which despite its substantial global public health burden has historically lagged in research funding compared with physical health conditions60 clinical trials in schizophrenia typically have smaller sample sizes than in physical disorders associated with comparable disability and costs reducing their statistical power and the generalizability of their results a prolonged cessation of new recruitment into ongoing research studies coupled with the reduction or elimination of in-person research visits will exacerbate the challenges already present in schizophrenia research including challenges in study retention ensuring the safety of both participants and research staff should be the foremost priority however research with participants with schizophrenia should continue through the use of remote assessments and delivery methods in order to prevent worsening disparities in the progress of schizophrenia research61 the covid-19 global pandemic is expected to have an outsized impact on people with schizophrenia further exacerbating health and economic disparities they experience public health interventions designed to slow and curb the spread of the virus flatten the curve will likely disproportionately affect people with schizophrenia we propose the following recommendations for consideration to temper the effect of covid-19 on people with schizophrenia we suggest that thoughtful consideration of the implications of covid-19 for people with schizophrenia may not only reduce the burden of the global pandemic on people with schizophrenia but also on the population as a whole  a fundamental model and predictions for the spread of the covid-19 epidemic baolian cheng yi-ming wang  the spread of the novel coronavirus is characterized by two phases i a natural exponential growth phase that occurs in the absence of intervention and ii a regulated growth

and a metric describing the degree of isolation and social distancing in a given community or region country state county or city these two parameters are calibrated to data from the community so the

the earlier outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 2002-2003 3  and middle east respiratory syndrome mers 2012ongoing 4  all three viral infections commonly present with fever and cough and confirmation of the infections requires nucleic acid testing of respiratory tract samples eg throat swabs most secondary transmission of sars and mers occurred in hospital settings however this is not a major means of covid-19 spread rather there is evidence that people without symptoms are fueling the spread it appears that considerable transmission of covid-19 is occurring among close contacts a study in germany suggests that people are mainly contagious before they have symptoms and in the first week of the disease a cdc study 5 shows as many as 25 percent of people infected with the new coronavirus in the us have no symptoms this unique characteristic presents a major risk to public health and a great challenge to controlling the epidemic spread many spreading models have been proposed 6 7 8 9 10 11 13  most existing models are flu based and simulate the covid-19 virus spreading exponentially based on unvalidated assumptions they often fit past existing data well but poorly predict future developments most models overpredict the data ahead with large uncertainties in the tail nearly all existing models including ihme have lowered their predictions of minimum covid-19 deaths in the us dramatically in less than five days 14 15  these models are only as good as the data that shape them a better model that can predict weeks ahead with lower uncertainties on the outcome of the outbreak would be highly beneficial and desired a mathematical model considering the unique transmission of covid-19 and deficiency of current epidemic models we take into account the following factors in modeling the trajectory of covid-19 spreading 1 the virus does not always spread exponentially 2 isolation and social distancing play a crucial role in flattening the curve and slowing the spread 3 the process of spreading is stochastic and self-organized and the model parameters vary spatially and temporally and are locally dependent 4 the spread of covid-19 has two unique phases i a long period of exponential infection that is spread by asymptomatic transmission and lack of social distancing and ii a regulated growth period that reflects the impacts of enforced social distancing and isolation transmission eventually slows when the number of susceptible individuals is depleted typically leading to the end of the first epidemic wave however effects of possible mutations after the peak infection rate is not included in this model we model the spread of covid-19 with a saturated all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission was not certified by peer

the undetectable infection period  0  the first term grows exponentially with time and the second term flattens the curve by isolation and social distancing here p 0 the number of infected people at a time t 0  and  the average community transmission rate the spreading rate minus the recovering rate which varies with time space environment and demographics the parameter d represents the degree of social distancing with values ranging from 0 no isolation and social distancing to 1 complete isolation and contained or infinite social distance depending on people behavior usually d is close to zero until the pandemic has caused significant disturbance in the society in phase i with no isolation and no social distancing g  0 and p t  f e t  the virus spreads exponentially with time when isolation and social distancing are enforced at the beginning of phase ii g  0 which will reduce infections and bend the curve downward to a plateau the total infected population p t will be saturated clearly maximizing social distancing is key to controlling this epidemic given the unique characteristics of covid-19 ie asymptomatic spreading over a certain time period  0  7 to 14 days one infected person could transmit to e 0 others a number which depends on the transmission rate in the local community without even knowing he or she is transmitting thus this novel coronavirus would have a much longer natural exponential growth phase than other known coronaviruses as has been observed in several epidemic centers the number of daily new infection cases is given by the expression at g  0 no social distancing dpdt  e t  and the number of daily cases grows exponentially with time with complete isolation infinite social distance dpdt  0 and no new cases arise the doubling period  2  is calculated as when the degree of social distancing d  1  2  ln 2 the number of days from t 0 to the day that the new infection rate peaks daily new cases is once the community transmission rate and the degree of social distancing are calibrated this model uniquely determines the total infections daily new infection rate and peak time of new infections we should point out that at the time of the peak infection rate the death rate will not have reached its peak there will be a delay following the peak infection rate because people do not die immediately the death rate also depends on preexisting medical conditions of the patients and hospital capacities at the time nevertheless cumulative death counts could be estimated by multiplying the actual mortality percentage to the total predicted infections determination of model parameters the spread in phase i grows exponentially in time when isolation and social distancing are enforced people change their behavior and the spread enters phase ii in this phase the exponential growth starts bending downward and the average community spread rate becomes steady we then determine the two model parameters -the average community spread rate  and social distancing parameter d -by selecting two points in time t 0 and t 1 in phase ii and a third point t 2 several days later we then solve the effective community spread rate   lnp 1 p 0  and the local social distancing parameter d  p 0 p 2  e t2t0  thus the trajectory of total infections and the daily new cases are analytically determined the social distancing parameter of the community is estimated in the beginning of phase ii but as the number of deaths climb people become more alert and improve their social distancing behavior which can further flatten the curve therefore our model overpredicts the total number of infections and daily new cases and provides an upper limit of the total infections for the community applications and predictions we apply our model to a number of communities and regions that are pandemic centers taking the data from john hopkins university 16 and wwwworldometerinfo we first applied the model to south korea where the first confirmed case of covid-19 was announced on 20 january 2020 17  on 19 february the number of confirmed cases increased by 20 and on 20 february by 58 or 70 giving a total of 346 confirmed cases on 21 february 2020 which led to the cancellation of mass gatherings and enforced social distancing across the country 17  we select the first two data points in phase ii to be t 0  02232020 all rights

predicted the total infections and daily infection rate as a function of time figures 1a above and 1b below compare our model predictions with the data from south korea the model does well in predicting the trajectory of spreading date of peak daily infections and date of the onset of the plateau 18  as expected the model overpredicts the total infections of the plateau because we used the value for degree of social distancing from the beginning of phase ii but as the total infections and deaths increased the degree of social distancing changed as peoples behavior improved we have found that the actual plateau is always lower than the plateau predicted based on parameters calibrated in the beginning of phase ii we note that south korea currently reports a very low steady number of new cases daily which could be the result of relaxing of social distancing and possible second-time infections next we applied the model to the us as a single community the first known case of covid-19 in the us was confirmed on 20 january 2020 19  on 31 january the us declared a public health emergency and announced restrictions on travelers arriving from china since 19 march 2020 social distancing has officially been in place the us has advised its citizens to avoid all international travel and against any gatherings of more than 10 people 19  we take t 0  3232020 when p 0  44056

germany and 40 of under testing for louisianan at time t 0  our model predicts that the daily infection rate in germany peaked near 2 april and the total infections will reach the plateau in the end of april if the same level of the social distancing as time t 0 is maintained the daily infection rate in the state of louisiana has peaked near 2 april and the total infections should have reached 96 of the plateau around 22 april 2020 however the louisiana data continue showing a uniform low daily infections even 30 days after the t 0  this could be due to the relaxing of the social distancing from the level at t 0  ie 21 march 2020 our analysis shows that among the regions considered south korea has nearly gone through the course and reached the plateau south korea reached peak infection rate around 3 march and achieved the plateau within 20 days from the the selected initial date around 12 march germany and several other european countries france spain italy etc are moving towards the plateau treating the united states as a whole our model predicts that the us will reach the plateau nearly 50 days after 23 march if the social distancing and people behavior are maintained at the level on 23 march 2020 constant level of social distancing results in a symmetric daily infection rate before and after the peak daily infections any relaxing of social distancing will cause complications and delay to reaching the plateau conclusion the spread of covid-19 is characterized by two phases i a natural exponential growth phase that occurs in the absence of intervention and ii a reg- ulated growth phase that reflects enforcement of social distancing and isolation a fundamental spreading model for the covid-19 epidemic is presented this model contains two parameters the

december 2019 chinese authorities notified the world health organisation who of an outbreak of pneumonia in wuhan city which was later classified as a new disease 1 following identification of cases in countries outside china on 30 january 2020 who declared the outbreak of covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern 1 in the uk the first cases of covid-19 were diagnosed at the end of january 2020 and community transmission was reported a few weeks later 2 3  government measures to control the epidemic were first announced on 22 january 2020 and included travel advice information for those returning from affected countries testing of suspected cases isolation and contact tracing this was followed in early february by a public health information campaign advising people to adopt hygiene measures to protect themselves and others including more frequent handwashing with soap and water using hand sanitiser if soap and water are not available and covering mouth and nose with a tissue or sleeve when coughing or sneezing 4  then on 3 march 2020 the uk government published its action plan setting out the uk-wide response to the novel coronavirus the uk governments response outlined measures in four key areas containing the outbreak delaying its spread mitigating the impact and research to improve diagnostics and treatment 5  on march 16 2020 five days after the who declared the outbreak of covid-19 a pandemic the uk prime minister announced a shift to the delay phase of the uk response with measures aimed at suppressing the spread of the infection in the population through nonpharmaceutical interventions npis including social distancing of the whole population isolation of cases for 7 days and quarantine of their household members for 14 days 6  the public was advised to stop non-essential contact with others and all unnecessary travel including working from home where possible and avoiding pubs theatres restaurants and other social venues 6  this shift in response was prompted by a mathematical modelling study which showed that a combination of social distancing of the entire population home isolation of cases and household quarantine of their family members and possible school and university closure was required to suppress transmission to a level that would enable the nhs to cope with the surge in cases requiring hospital admission and ventilation 7  the effect of npis to reduce transmission rates is dependent on compliance with public health advice on social distancing in the initial stages of the uk epidemic this advice was voluntary and not enforced by the government this was criticised due to concern that likelihood of being infected with covid-19 under the uk governments current preventive measures severity was measured by asking respondents about perceived seriousness of symptoms if they were infected with covid-19 preventive behaviours included information on perceived effectiveness and actual adoption of preventive behaviours to protect oneself and others to prevent both contracting covid-19 and onward transmission and were collected under three categories 1 hygiene practices wearing a face mask washing hands more frequently with soap and water using hand sanitiser more regularly disinfecting the home covering nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing 2 travel avoidance travel to affected countries and travel to areas inside and outside the uk regardless of whether they were affected 3 social distancing avoiding public transport social events going out in general going to hospital or other healthcare settings crowded places and contact with people who have a fever or respiratory symptoms willingness and ability to self-isolate if asked by a healthcare professional were measured using two questions developed for this survey at the time the survey was conducted public health englands operational definition of self-isolation was if you have symptoms of coronavirus infection  however mild do not leave your home even to buy food or essentials or have any visitors for 7 days from when your symptoms started this includes not going to work school or other public places and avoiding public transport or taxis selfisolation is the same as voluntary quarantine12 we worked with yougov to optimise question clarity and ease of understanding for the uk

population in the two days following the government introduction of recommendations on social distancing 6 we found high levels of self-reported behaviour change notably the most-adopted measures washing hands more frequently with soap and water using hand sanitiser and covering nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing prominently featured in national public health campaigns from relatively early on in the epidemic 4 and mirrors results seen in previous pandemics 13  however there were marked differences between the perceived effectiveness and adoption of npis this suggests that lack of knowledge on what measures are effective against covid-19 is not a key driver of compliance in the uk population in contrast a similar study conducted in hong kong showed comparatively high perceived effectiveness and adoption of preventive measures 11  our results highlighted significant differences across demographic and socio-economic strata for social distancing behaviour ability to work from home and the ability and willingness of people to self-isolate adoption of social distancing measures was almost twice as likely in people over 70 compared to adults aged 18 to 34 years notably those that were single were less likely to practice social distancing there was a strong association between socioeconomic deprivation and ability to adopt npis although willingness to self-isolate

existence of structural barriers to adopting preventive behaviours in these groups the strength of this study is in the representative sample of the uk adult population the ability to achieve our sample size quickly and the timeliness in relation to changing government recommendations this study has three limitations first with an online approach responses of those without internet access were under-represented second the survey tool consisted of predominantly closed-ended questions thus we were unable to explore responses in more depth third surveys collecting self-report data are generally subject to limitations including honesty introspective ability and interpretation of the questions our findings highlight the stark choices faced by those in lower socio-economic groups and suggest that unless the government intervenes to support these individuals the impact of this epidemic will likely be felt unequally in our society not only this but if a large proportion of the population continues to work while unwell low compliance will render the various forms of social distancing less effective as low-income workers are forced to choose between financial and physical health indeed this behaviour has already been observed in the workplace in previous pandemics workers without access to paid sick leave were more likely to work while unwell than those with paid sick leave 14  a study in china after the h7n9 epidemic found that only 7 of people reported willingness to self-quarantine 15  also during the middle east respiratory syndrome mers outbreak in korea in 2015 there was heterogeneous uptake of preventive interventions 16  in the absence of a vaccine and treatments over the short-term high compliance with social distancing self-isolation and household quarantine is paramount to reduce transmission and the impact of covid-19 and as the epidemic evolves it is likely that compliance with preventive behaviours will continue to evolve too npi compliance risk perception and behaviour are not consistent across cultures social status or time indeed previous studies have shown that perceptions and behaviours often change over time 13  therefore current modelling projections of the impact of npis on morbidity and mortality are always provisional 7  future covid-19 models should explore the variation captured in this and  cc-by-nc 40 international

httpsdoiorg1011012020040120050039 doi medrxiv preprint previous studies to better estimate the impact of differential uptake of npis in the uk and beyond it is also important to monitor behaviour throughout the epidemic to know when to implement further public health messaging and when further or alternative government actions might be required to mitigate falling compliance our findings highlight that those most economically disadvantaged in society are less able to comply with certain npis likely in part due to their financial situation whilst one approach may be to better tailor public health messaging to this subpopulation this must be done alongside considered fiscal and monetary policy to mitigate the financial costs of following government public health advice therefore it is imperative that the uk government and governments around the world quickly develop and implement policies to support the most vulnerable in a bid to minimise the long-term social and economic harm caused by covid-19 government policy should recognise the disparity in impact across socio-economic groups particularly across the labour market and should aim to support workers equitably across the income spectrum this would likely help increase compliance across the population to the levels required to suppress transmission and thereby reduce the strain on national health services both in the uk and abroad although the uk government has since announced a range of measures to support public services individuals and businesses in part to facilitate compliance with current lockdown measures 17 it is uncertain how long these protections will be in place for and whether they will continue once lockdown restrictions are lifted in summary the populations response to public health advice is currently the key factor in tackling the covid-19 epidemic and whether the curve is flattened sufficiently to allow health services to cope 7  factors affecting uptake and compliance with preventive measures are critical those from socioeconomically more deprived backgrounds in particular may need further financial assurance and assistance from the government to be able to implement

parajuli   severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which causes the novel beta coronavirus 2019 disease covid-19 has emerged as a life-threatening infection affecting more than 57 million people worldwide and caused the death of more than 350000 patients as of may 2020 1 categorized as a global pandemic by the center for world health organization who covid-19 has created global health care and economic crisis 2 the immediate objective of healthcare systems is to facilitate the management of critically ill patients with severe respiratory symptoms requiring hospitalization due to covid-19 given the lack of effective treatment strategies and herd immunity the main focus of public health efforts have been social distancing to flatten the curve of covid-19 case growth rates thereby offsetting the significant influx of patients into the healthcare environment 34 however social distancing along with additional psychosocial factors including fear of healthcare systems and economic strain resulting in potential hardships including loss of employment or health insurance in the private payor model can impact the behavior of the patients with chronic medical conditions including those with history of transplant 5 in general solid organ transplant recipients require extensive monitoring of patient and graft well-being and close follow up by a multidisciplinary team that includes members from the transplant center including nephrology surgery nursing social work and pharmacy as well as the patients local primary care provider 6 how these issues associated with social distancing and covid-19 will influence long-term outcomes in the transplant recipients is unknown 6 covid-19 appears to more negatively affect patients with chronic co-morbid conditions studies exist demonstrating patients with cardiovascular disease diabetes and the elderly have more severe clinical manifestations and have an increased risk of negative outcomes 7 many of these are co-occurring conditions found in ktrs 8 recent case series describing ktrs with covid-19 have demonstrated an incidence of intensive care unit admission from 27 to 100 acute kidney injury from 16 to

morbidity and mortality the collateral damage of the massive changes to the provision of chronic medical care due to the pandemic in this population is less apparent 1415 therefore the purpose of this manuscript is to review and describe potential ramifications of the pandemic on the routine care of the renal transplant recipient and present strategies to address these challenges in an attempt to prevent adverse outcomes as aforementioned the primary public health measure to contain covid-19 has been government-mandated social distancing practices these orders are endorsed by national health bodies including the center for disease control cdc and who and practically interpreted at the discretion of state governments 24 in the healthcare setting these orders have resulted in the cancelation of non-emergent elective procedures to limit face-to-face contact with patients 2526 to maintain contact with patients centers have turned to the use of telehealth telehealth is a complex enterprise and raises multiple challenges at different levels multiple studies showed that telehealth implementation involves a set of professional legal technological and strategic factors 27 28 29 telemedicine also offers significant potential for improving access continuity of care and quality for the benefit of society 3031 the cdc recommends increased utilization of telehealth services to maintain providerpatient contact while still following social distancing measures 32 while telemedicine can help fill the void created by covid-19 several factors limit its effectiveness including barriers to using the technology lack of internet lack of device etc hesitancy from patients to share less severe problems with providers and difficulty in understanding changes in medications over the telephone furthermore physical examination by providers cannot effectively take place via a virtual visit and significant findings like an assessment of volume status may be missed although this approach helps to maintain social distancing it can expose ktrs to potential unintended consequences due to ongoing economic pressures healthcare systems have been required to adopt cost-reduction strategies which include reducing work hours and income of the transplant providers coordinators nurses and pharmacists furthermore in areas more significantly impacted by covid-19 redeployment of transplant providers to the front-line for covid-19 related care also functionally reduces transplant-related work hours the effect of these on the care of ktrs is unknown but may affect both short-term and long-term patient and allograft outcomes the pandemic exposes the weaknesses of the current private payor health system in the united states where help from the federal government has been required to keep the system functional 33 non-adherence to immunosuppressant medications by ktrs is associated with increased risk of allograft rejection which in turn is associated with increased morbidity and mortality 3435 despite the adverse outcomes associated with non-adherence rates of non-adherence to medication in ktrs has been reported to be 20 to 70 36 the government-issued shelter at home orders increasing unemployment and loss of health insurance during the covid-19 pandemic can threaten adherence again highlighting the limitations of a private payor based healthcare system over a public system as is found in europe this non-adherence can then be amplified by difficulties in procuring medications due to issues with transportation accessibility and affordability indeed in our center-specific experience we have had a number of ktrs present with acute allograft rejection due to non-adherence with laboratory monitoring and medications due to their interpretation of shelter at home orders and fear of healthcare exposure article recently published will provide reference later due to the journal double-blind review policy several studies have shown that ktrs are at increased risk of emotional distress and affective disorders such as anxiety and depression 37 38 39 the enormity of social distancing economic crisis and grief over the death of loved ones related to covid-19 has the potential to affect mental health significantly wang et al conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques in immunocompetent people the survey collected information on demographic data physical symptoms covid-19 exposure and symptoms they also looked into the psychological impact of covid-19 by using depression anxiety and stress scale dass-21 the study found that 538 of respondents rated the psychological impact of the pandemic as moderate or severe 165 reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms 288 reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms and 81 reported moderate to severe stress levels female gender student status specific physical symptoms and poor self-related health status were significantly associated with the psychological impact of the pandemic p  05 40 based on previous experiences from prior outbreaks patients with chronic health conditions are most susceptible to the stress of this crisis 41 beyond covid-19 related exacerbation of anxiety and depression the lack of access to primary care physicians social workers and transplant providers can potentiate anxiety and depression in the ktrs there is also concern that the current crisis can trigger unhealthy behaviors including excessive smoking increased alcohol intake poor sleep reduced activity and dysregulated eating in patients with pre-existing psychiatric or other medical conditions 42 43 44 this maladaptive stress response can have a significant impact on ktrs given their reliance on medication adherence for positive outcomes as well as common co-morbid conditions that would be exacerbated by these behaviors to minimize viral exposure for patients and transplant providers many transplant centers have adopted virtual modalities for routine visits a virtual visit despite its shortcomings is preferable to delaying or skipping a routine visit increased frequency of virtual visits may be needed for those patients considered to be at the highest risk including patients with multiple medical conditions underlying anxiety and depression devices and platforms that facilitate visual communication including video chat allow for interpretation of visual conversational cues as well as some physical examination with the recent changes in reimbursement policies by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms to expand virtual visits most of the virtual visits will be reimbursed 45 reimbursement for medicaid varies by state though many states have expanded telehealth coverage in response to this crisis frequent checking of vitals and reporting to the transplant team when abnormal is encouraged patients should be educated about the symptoms of covid-19 infection with any concerning symptoms patients should inform their primary care physicians andor the transplant centers and should be instructed if covid-19 testing is warranted it is important to note that even if a patient has not had an exposure or is at low risk for covid-19 due to social distancing a fever in a ktr still requires clinical workup the infectious complications that plague kidney transplantation continues during this era including urinary tract infection cytomegalovirus infection pneumonia and other opportunistic infections patients should be similarly educated about the need for ongoing vigilance in monitoring for these and other infections mobile phlebotomy services to obtain routine laboratory blood work from transplant patients are an exciting avenue to explore during the pandemic services such as this are available for cytomegalovirus virus cmv molecular diagnostics as well as routine blood work these alternative strategies will both allow the transplant team to monitor important indicators of kidney function and avoid potential covid-19 exposure from visiting phlebotomy laboratories the cell-free dna and active rejection in kidney allograft dart study suggests that the use of a non-invasive allosure test to measure donor-derived cell-free dna can be used to diagnose rejection in the kidney allograft 46 the allosure test has been approved by medicare for clinical use when kidney transplant rejection is suspected high-risk patients who might previously have undergone a protocol biopsy for routine surveillance can be closely monitored by allosure testing during the evolving pandemic the negative allosure testing will be reassuring and patients can potentially be observed without being called into the hospital for the kidney allograft biopsy those protocol biopsies can be delayed based on the allosure testing in patients with stable renal allograft function however the patients with abnormal kidney allograft function with elevated creatinine increasing urine protein creatinine ratio or denovo or rising donor-specific antibodies will still need transplant kidney biopsy as standard of their care while the covid-19 pandemic presents challenges to medication adherence we offer several strategies to address these issues below1pharmacy avoidance utilization of mail order over brick and mortar pharmacies should be encouraged the education of patients regarding delays related to shipments should occur to avoid disruption of therapy2stockpiling the cdc has encouraged patients to obtain an extended supply of medications during the covid-19 pandemic to avoid the need for frequent refilling 47483cost mitigation strategies manufacturer sponsored patient assistance programs pap should be explored for patients that qualify based on income those who are under-insured or have high deductibles may be eligible for manufacturer-sponsored co-pay assistance plans both pap and co-pay assistance are typically only available in the setting of branded drug products pharmacy specific generic-drug programs as well as the good rx drug credit program can be explored in the setting of generically available drugs or those patients that do not qualify for papco-pay assistance ie patients with state and government-funded insurance programs co-payment waivers during covid-19 is another option that has been suggested 4950 most importantly the 3-year medicare coverage issue needs to be addressed to improve access to ongoing coverage of immunosuppressive medications and avoid returns to dialysis
 as mentioned earlier ktrs are at increased risk of depression anxiety and stress especially during the time of the covid-19 pandemic specific strategies should be adopted to deal with this ktrs should be encouraged to stay in touch with their family and friends through phone or video technologies with more severe symptoms of anxiety and depression they should contact their health care providers several studies have shown that mediation programs can reduce multiple negative dimensions of psychological stress 51 the continuation of physical activity during this crisis is essential regular exercise is an effective reducer of stress and anxiety 5253 although many government policies enforce quarantineslockdown if physical distancing is upheld outdoor exercise is allowed even when outdoor activities are not possible regular indoor exercise should be done many virtual exercise classes are now available for high-risk individuals and should be encouraged various challenges and strategies are summarized in fig 1
 the covid-19 pandemic will have a long-lasting effect on our health system to avoid long-lasting effects on our patients strategies to prevent adverse outcomes are needed these strategies must address both risks associated with covid-19 as well as risks associated with a lack of proper maintenance care of the allograft in the absence of clear guidelines for the type or frequency of monitoring during the pandemic we suggest that rigorous medical and psychosocial patient-centered risk stratification strategies avoid adverse outcomes in stable solid organ transplant recipients increased utilization of technology newly developed immune-monitoring assays and patient and provider vigilance will all contribute to this goal this era of covid-19 necessitates the multidisciplinary collaboration and inventive spirit that is central to the field of solid organ transplants the authors have no financial disclosures no grant funding directly supports this manuscript all authors declare no conflict of interest  visible insights of the invisible pandemic a scientometric altmetric and topic trend analysis sujit bhattacharya shubham singh  the recent sars-cov-2 virus outbreak has created an unprecedented global health crisis the disease is showing alarming trends with the number of people getting infected with this disease new cases and death rate are all highlighting the need to control this disease at the earliest the strategy now for the governments around the globe is how to limit the spread of the virus until the research community develops treatmentdrug or vaccination against the virus the outbreak of this disease has unsurprisingly led to huge volume of research within a short period of time surrounding this disease it has also led to aggressive social media activity on twitter facebook dedicated blogs news reports and other online sites actively involved in discussing about the various aspects of and related to this disease it becomes a useful and challenging exercise to draw from this huge volume of research the key papers that form the research front its influence in the research community and other important research insights similarly it becomes important to discern the key issues that influence the society concerning this disease the paper is motivated by this it attempts to distinguish which are the most influential papers the key knowledge base and major topics surrounding the research covered by covid-19 further it attempts to capture the societys perception by discerning key topics that are trending online the study concludes by highlighting the implications of this study  coronaviruses are viruses that circulate among animals and are named because of the crownlike spikes protein spikes that protrude from their surface resembling the suns corona the first transmission of this type of virus from animals to humans happened in 2002 in the guangdong province of china which resulted in sars severe acute respiratory syndrome bats were thought to be the potential source of this virus a novel coronavirus ncov was identified in early january 2020 which was traced to the severe pneumonic outbreak of an undocumented cause in early december 2019 in the city of wuhan china similar to sars bats are seen as the potential source from which this virus has spread to humans due to rapid spread of the virus within a short time globally resulting in health emergencies in a number of countries who declared this as a pandemic on 11 th march 2020 initially the virus was named 2019-ncov but later was named sars-cov-2 due to its genetic relationship to the sars-cov-1 virusmedscape 2020 the entire human population is at potential risk as being a new virus nobody has prior immunity to it there is no vaccine and no specific treatment for the disease and is highly transmissible epidemiological estimation at present is that on an average one infected person will infect between two to three other people the spread has been from respiratory droplets and from contaminated surfaces the world is facing a common challenge how to control the spread of and what can be the effective interventions to control mortality the early examples from china suggested the most effective method to control the spread of the virus is through lockdowns and social distancing measures the example of south korea suggested testing as the major component of the mitigation measures some studies pointed out the importance of hand hygiene and face masks in controlling the virus with new hotspots emerging the number of new cases and those not able to recover are raising new concerns every day risk and uncertainty behind this disease control has generated a global concern for health economy and for persons at large the alarming spread of the virus has shocked people across the world pushing among others researchers to understand the virus-its structure transmission replication mechanism latency etc and promising interventions that can effectively control it extensive global efforts are undertaken to develop vaccine and drug this is unsurprisingly leading to huge volume of research activity within a short period of time increasing at an exponential rate as the recent editorial published in the lancet highlights the whole-genome sequence of sars-cov-2 had been obtained and shared widely by mid-january a feat not possible at such speed in previous infectious disease outbreaks the editorial points out the importance of the need for development of effective diagnostics therapeutics and vaccine for the virus examining from the dimensions database as of 22 april it was found that 1633 clinical trials are being conducted on the virus and 171 policy documents have been published so far the number of research papers clinical trials at different phases within such a short period is unprecedented and shows the intensive efforts of the global research community to understand the different aspects of this disease and address it seven patents have also been granted it is important to capture insights of influential research and innovation from this ongoing activity for policy makers and research scholars from cross-disciplinary areas to build up further on this valuable repository societal impact and what aspects are of concern to the people at large are difficult to capture one useful method would be from online trends surrounding this disease that would indicate to some extent the key issues that are influencing the society at large the present study is motivated by this and applies tools and techniques of scientometrics to uncover insights from research papers scientometrics applies various mathematical and statistical techniques to capture insights of research activity from research papers and patents and other published sources including online sources altmetrics by constructing various types of indicators citation based analysis is a prominent method to capture academically significant and theoretically relevant material see for example glanzel 2003  keeping in view the research activity in this area started primarily with the outbreak of this disease impact captured through citations would not give a correct picture as citations takes time to accrue this is true for research paper as well as patent citations citations that influence current research activity would however be useful to construct the present knowledge base one of the useful method that can do so is based on cocitation analysis which captures frequency with which two documents are cited together small 1973  co-citation establishes an intellectual relationship with earlier literature in a fieldsubfieldarea of research strength of relationship based on frequency of co-citation pairs the rise of social networking websites like twitter facebook etc provides researchers a wider scope to share their scholarly publications altmetrics allows to track and capture online impact of scholarly research and thus broadly indicates papers that are influencing the research community to put it in a proper perspective one can borrow from william 2017 altmetrics are measurements of how people interact with a given scholarly work altmetrics or article level metrics according to das and mishra 2014 is a new trendsetter to measure impact of scientific publication and their social outreach to intended audience it reflects a scholarly articles popularity usage acceptance and availability by using an altmetric score google trends which was launched in 2006 primarily shows how frequently a particular search term is entered in comparison with all other search terms in different regions and languages google 2017 in google trends level of interest in a topic is approximated using search volume of google sullivan 2016 estimated searches on google trends reached 2 trillion in 2016 thus this is one of the most significant source of data if it is properly analysed one of the most influential study was by ginsberg et al 2006 which showed that google trends traced and predicted the spread of influenza earlier than the centers for disease control and prevention jun et al 2018 provides a good assessment of research studies in the past decade which have utilized google trends they highlight the diverse fields in which this has been used for from merely describing and diagnosing research trends to forecasting changes according to mavragani et al 2018 google trends shows the changes in online interest for time series in any selected term in any country or region over a selected time period for example a specific year several years 3 weeks 4 months 30 days 7 days 4 hours 1 hour or a specified time-frame they argue that as the internet penetration is increasing web based search activity has become a valid indicator of public behaviour the paper positions itself in this direction applying various tools and techniques of scientometrics altmetrics and google trends to draw meaning from the huge volume of research papers and online activity surrounding this pandemic the study attempts to answer the following research questions  what are the key papers that captures the most relevant research areas and topics on covid-19  what is the knowledge base that influences current research on this pandemic  what are the key aspects of this pandemic that is influencing the society at large the study has used various types of data sets and analytical techniques as highlighted below to capture the research trends and also assess this disease influence on the society the dimensions database wwwdimensionsai was used for this study this database has various unique features which makes it very useful to capture various aspects of research activity it provides dynamic altmetrics score for each article the database unlike source based classification journal classification used in indexing articles in sci and scopus database uses article level classification only when an article cannot be classified individually due to lack of information it uses the fields of research for classification system the for 2 has three hierarchical levels divisions represents a broad subject area or research discipline with the next two levels groups and fields representing increasingly detailed subsets of these categories in for there are 22 divisions 157 groups and 1238 fields dimensions has incorporated only the groups in its classification system thus classification article level provides a more informed assessment of the topic covered by it then based on journal level classification which is a macro level classification these features motivated us to use this database for this study the articles on this virus were extracted using the search string covid-19 or sars-cov-2 or sars-cov2 or 2019-ncov on april 12 2020 from this database the final search string was developed based on review of contemporary studies and deleting those search keywords that lead to noises for example it was found that ncov which some studies have used also identifies papers that cover mers middle-east respiratory syndrome this was first reported in 2012 was initially called novel coronavirus or ncov as it was a species of coronavirus many studies had applied search string without hyphen which also results in extracting papers not covering this disease the search string applied on the publications database of dimensions resulted in 9146 papers containing 7332 articles and 1814 pre-prints this data set of 9146 papers were further used for analysis influential papers were distinguished by using altmetric score which is a weighted count of all the online attention of a research paper the altmetrics data was captured from dimensions database which draws data from altmetricscom of capturing online activity of research papers on facebook twitter blogpost news reports etc the score changes as people mentioning the paper increases only one mention per user is considered each category of mention carries different base amount so a news article contributes more than a blog post which in turn contributes more than a tweet in the final score country wise analysis showed that around 78 percent of the total papers were contributed by ten countries further analysis of research activity of the ten identified countries was done using altmetric and citation analysis word cloud provides a high visual representation of concepts that a paper had frequently applied it is based on burst algorithm that captures the sudden rise in the usage of a word mane and borner 2004 highlighted the usefulness of burst words as according to them it helps humans mentally organize and electronically access and manage large complex information spaces using r programming tools word cloud was constructed from keywords of the data set the words with higher frequency in the overall corpus of papers herein 9146 have a larger font size and acquires more space in a visualisation word cloud was used to get visualisation of 70 most frequent words the number of words chosen was limited by the clarity of visualisation co-citation analysis helps to capture papers that are co-cited together in a large number of papers the highly co-cited papers is seen as the core knowledge base of research area at a particular period this analysis was undertaken to identify the key knowledge base behind the identified papers dimensions database was used to extract a bibliographic mapping file for the papers two softwares pajek and vosviewer were used for co-citation analysis initially the bibliographic mapping file was run on the vosviewer software to identify the most co-cited papers the co-cited papers were identified at four levels trim levels to have a deeper insight of the core knowledge base level 1 identified 51 papers co-cited 77 or more times level 2 identified 26 papers co-cited 126 or more times level 3 identified 10 papers co-cited 277 or more times and level 4 identified 5 papers co-cited 463 or more times for each of the trim levels a network file was obtained from the vosviewer software the network file was then run on pajek software to create a refined co-citation network map so as to avoid overlapping of nodes the final visualisation was done for the refined map in the vosviewer software data for the policy documents referencing these top ten co-cited papers was done by accessing altmetricscom directly from the dimensions database another question which the study explored is the impact of this virus on the society primarily what are the key aspects of and related to this disease that has influenced the society at large google trend analysis of key topics have been undertaken to capture this aspect google trends website httpstrendsgooglecomtrendsgeous was first accessed on 10 th april 2020 the topics were chosen based on closely monitoring the news items and also finally choosing from a large set of topics choice for example of pandemic was seen to have initial burst but declined quickly vaccine was trending highly but we found lot of noise in this term the final six topics chosen were social distancing quarantine covid-19 coronavirus face mask and hydroxychloroquine data for each of the topics was finally taken on 16 april 2020 for country specific comparison data for five countries having maximum cases of covid-19 namely usa italy spain france germany and two emerging economies india and brazil was also obtained hydroxychloroquine was not used in country specific search as it was only visible trending for three countries among the chosen seven countries google trend analysis was not done for china as there is much restricted access to google in that country one of the first important observation is the intensity with which research on covid-19 and related aspects is going on globally search conducted in two different time periods 28 th march and then on 12 th april showed that 2172 and 9146 papers were published in these two periods almost 320 percent growth during such a short time the insights that we draw from our analysis of the 9146 papers is presented in different sections below ten most popular research papers among the 9146 covid-19 papers were extracted on the basis of their altmertrics score on april 12 2020 table 1 highlights these influential papers 2020 the study most popular on social media platforms number of tweets more than three times the next popular paper commented that sars-cov-2 is the seventh coronavirus to infect humans the study found that sars-cov-2 is not a product of purposeful manipulation and is most likely the result of natural selection of human or human-like ace2 receptor the study also found that sars-cov-2 spike protein has high affinity to bind to human ace2 receptor the study also estimated that the undocumented cases contagiousness or transmission rate was 55 of documented infections yet 79 of documented infection cases were due to these undocumented infections the suggestion of this study that undocumented infections isolation and identification is necessary to fully control the virus is very important and the spread of this virus may be seen as a consequence of this this study also was cited in policy documents leung et al 2020 explored the importance of respiratory droplet and aerosol route of transmission by quantifying the amount of respiratory virus in exhaled breath of participants that have acute respiratory virus illness ari the 246 participants were divided in two groups one wearing surgical face mask and other not wearing face mask the study found that surgical face masks can efficaciously reduce the respiratory droplet emission of influenza virus particles but not in aerosols they also found that surgical face masks can be used by ill patients of covid-19 to reduce onward transmission face mask is getting increasing attention and now being incorporated as essential guideline in health policies of different countries table 2 points to some interesting aspects of research activity in this area these ten countries account for almost 78 percent of total papers with china and usa accounting for 45 percent of the total china usa and uk are actively collaborating among themselves and also with other countries this is a good indication as global collaborative efforts pooling each other resources are required to meet the challenges posed by this disease a few leading universities can be discerned which are actively involved in this research popularity of a paper can also be seen influenced by journals papers with high altmetrics score strongly correlate with journals that have high reputation in the field high impact factor leading journal of the community table 3 highlights the areas covered in the covid-19 papers the table provides a broad indication of intensity of research happening in different fields figure 1 presents a word cloud of most frequently used terms in covid-19 papers the word cloud shows key aspects that have been part of many studies the word cloud maps the topics of research surrounding this disease the two keywords for example pandemics and china that have maximum occurrence in papers indicated by large font size which shows that these two aspects were discussed in many papers it is known that china was the source of this infection and who declared this disease as a pandemics thus increasing research mention of these two keywords is not surprising coronavirus primarily affects animals sars disease as a result of transmission of coronavirus from animal to humans travel has contributed maximum to the spread of this disease are all visible prominently in this word cloud thus examination of the word cloud is useful to have a broad view of key areas of research in the 9146 papers figure 2 shows co-citation networks at four trim levels it can be observed from figure 2 that trim level 4 that contains top 5 co-cited papers is a complete cluster a complete cluster according to gmr 2003 is when each reference is connected to other references and there is no dominant document within the cluster table 4 highlights the details of these co-cited papers at trim level 3 which identifies top 10 cocited papers it also includes the top 5 co-cited paper at trim level 4 refer methodology for details pandemics influence on the society figure 3 provides global google trends of six topics refer methodology for details currently talked about extensively on social media news reports or in general public discussion it can be observed the otherwise flat line of covid-19 started seeing spikes in late february 2020 this is because the term came into existence when who on feb 11 named the disease from the virus as covid-19 coronavirus disease 2019 it can also be observed that the term reached maximum level of interest during the end of march as cases started showing significant increase in countries usa india etc measures like quarantine has strong societal influence and thus useful to look at trend in this topic another topic pandemic saw maximum interest around march 11 as who announced covid-19 pandemic on that day it can also be seen that the interest about this topic fell shortly thereafter as discussed in the methodology this topic hence was not chosen further in this study for google trend examination hydroxychloroquine term has seen a great amount of interest from middle of march 2020 this can be traced to the study by reputed french physician and microbiologist didier raoult who highlighted the use of this antimalarial drug in the treatment of this disease it led to french president and us president endorsing this line of treatment which created favourable public opinion in many countries towards this drug liu et al 2020 whose work has also attracted high altmetrics attention found the drug to be effective in inhibiting sars-cov-2 in vitro this line of treatment and the robustness of the methodology and findings have also generated critical comments see for example grens 2020  india has become a key source for this medicine and already exported it to number of countries thus a high degree of activity in google as seen through google trend can be due to various factors positive as well as adverse reactions similar public opinion generated by studies and endorsement can be seen in youtube searches in face mask source google trends figure 4 provides the comparison of google trends of social distancing covid-19 quarantine and lockdown and face mask from 16 feb to 14 april 2020 figure 4 a presents a global picture of these topics and figure 4 b shows data for five countries having maximum cases of covid-19 namely usa italy spain france germany and two emerging economies india and brazil three of the five topics chosen restrict peoples movement social distancing which basically means keeping a safe distance of around 6 feet from others and avoiding places where this kind of distance cannot be made like schools workplaces a sports game or a temple the second one is quarantine which applies to a person who have been in exposed to coronavirus or patients having coronavirus the person has to avoid contact with people till the specified incubation period of the virus to see if they develop symptoms third lockdown the term mainly used to describe the confinement of prisoners to their cells has now a changed definition during this outbreak through lockdown people are not allowed to leave their local area building and it is used as a control measure to prevent covid-19 disease transmission it can be seen from figure 4 b that lockdown is the most popular topic worldwide as well as at the country level according to world economic forum 26 billion people ie one thirds of the world population are under some kind of lockdown 3 this figure alone constitutes indias 13 billion the largest lockdown in the world thus it is unsurprising to see the popularity of this topic over others in india these control measure have major economic psychological and social impacts and in turn affects lives of all the people involved a worrying trend is the low comparative interest in social distancing in most of the countries and almost negligible comparative interest in countries like indian and brazil the stand taken by brazil through her president of opening up and has been critical of measures like social distancing and lockdown may have contributed to this type of trend  predicting covid-19 spread and public health needs to contain the pandemic in west-africa beaugard taboe hmaho kolawol salako valre calistus ngonghala n romain kaka gll  the novel coronavirus pandemic is causing devastating demographic social and economic damage globally understanding current patterns of the pandemic spread and forecasting its long-term trajectory is essential in guiding policies aimed at curtailing the pandemic this is particularly important in regions with weak economies and fragile health care systems such as west-africa we formulate and use a deterministic compartmental model to i assess the current patterns of covid-19 spread in west-africa ii evaluate the impact of currently implemented control measures and iii predict the future course of the pandemic with and without currently implemented and additional control measures in west-africa an analytical expression for the threshold level of control measures involving a reduction in the effective contact rate required to eliminate the pandemic is computed considering currently applied health control measures numerical simulations of the model using baseline parameter values estimated from west-african covid-19 data project a 60 reduction in the daily number of cases when the epidemic attains its peak more reduction in the number of cases will be achieved if additional public health control measures that result in a reduction in the effective contact rate are implemented we found out that disease elimination is difficult when more asymptomatic individuals contribute in transmission or are not identified and isolated in a timely manner however maintaining a baseline level of asymptomatic isolation and a low transmission rate will lead to a significant reduction in the number of daily cases when the pandemic peaks for example at the baseline level of asymptomatic isolation at least a 53 reduction in the transmission rate is required for disease elimination while disease elimination is also possible if asymptomatic individuals are identified and isolated within 2 days after the incubation period combining two or more measures is better for disease control eg if asymptomatic humans are contact traced or identified and isolated in less than 3 days then only about a 31 reduction in the disease transmission rate is required for disease elimination furthermore we showed that the currently implemented measures caused the time-dependent effective reproduction number to reduce by approximately 37 from february 28 to august 24 2020 we conclude that covid-19 elimination requires more control measures than what is currently being applied in west-africa and that mass testing and contact tracing in order to identify and isolate asymptomatic individuals early is very important in curtailing the burden of the pandemic  a new strain of coronavirus sars-cov-2 that emerged from wuhan china is the cause of the covid-19 pandemic that is currently ravaging the world 1 2 3  as of may 12 2020  about 4 337 602 confirmed covid-19 infections and 292 451 deaths were reported worldwide 4 5 6 7  although the pandemic originated from china most of the reported cases are now from the united states of america approximately 1 408 636 infections and 83 425 deaths the epicenter of the pandemic is expected to shift to sub-saharan africa which as of may 12 2020 had reported about 46 976 confirmed cases and 1 111 deaths of these about 19 750 confirmed cases and 428 deaths were from west-africa the first confirmed west-african case was in nigeria on february 27 2020 ie approximately two months after the first case was officially announced in china 1  the highest burden of the disease in west-africa on may 12 2020 is in ghanawith about 4 700 cases and 22 deaths and nigeria with about 4641 cases and 150 deaths 8  a multilayered-risk assessment based on nine risk factors identified nigeria as the west-african country with the highest covid-19 risk 9  martinez-alvarez et al 10 projected that some west-african countries eg burkina faso and senegal might experience sharp increases in the number of covid-19 cases that are similar to those observed in european countries in march and april 2020 humans can acquire the novel coronavirus when they come into contact with contaminated surfaces or from droplets released by infectious symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals 11  mild to moderate infection symptoms of the disease include fever cough sore throat nasal congestion malaise headache muscle pain and shortness of breath or tachypnea in children in severe cases fever is associated with severe dyspnea respiratory distress and tachypnea 12  currently there is no vaccine or widely accepted drug for covid-19 therefore governments and individuals are forced to rely on public health preventive measures such as basic hygiene travel or movement restrictions social-distancing wearing masks etc current control measures being implemented in west-africa include regular hand washing with hydroalkolic solutions quarantine of suspected cases isolation of confirmed cases social distancing eg travel restrictions school closures and banning gatherings involving more than 10 people contact tracing and testing and treating identified cases additionally wearing of masks in public was recently recommended as another control measure in many countries in this region unfortunately it is difficult to implement these basic public health measures effectively in some west-african countries due to wide-spread poverty and poor investment in health care staff equipment and infrastructure for example in many west-african countries less than five hospital beds and less than two medical doctors are allocated to every group of 10 000 inhabitants 13  furthermore the annual per capita spending on health for about half of the countries in the region is less than us50 ie about 50 times below the average per capita health spending in countries like italy and spain-two european countries with high covid-19 burden 14  as a result of poor investment in health care and health care systems the region has been an epidemic hotspot for emerging and neglected tropical diseases including the ebola virus ebov lassa virus lasv and buruli ulcers in recent years 15 16  with such inadequate healthcare systems and personnel in the region the impact of covid-19 might be catastrophic to compound matters some countries in west-africa are still not well prepared to tackle this pandemic despite the observed devastating impacts and trend of the pandemic in the us and europe 10  there is therefore the need to exploit every existing tool andor develop new tools that can be useful in guiding public 2 health decision-making in the fight against the pandemic this includes developing and using new qualitative and quantitative methods such as mathematical models there has been an influx of mathematical models to assess the impact of covid-19 and to guide public health response in different cities countries and regions of the world see for example 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27  few of these mathematical model frameworks have focused on the covid-19 pandemic situation in west-africa as a whole among these few models some have focused only on one or two countries eg nigeria and ghana while others have used used basic regression or exponential growth models 25 26 to analyze and predict disease trends martinez-alvarez et al 10 used a simple graph-plot based comparative analysis of observed covid-19 data for the first 23 days of the pandemic to examine the future trajectory of the epidemic in six west-african countries burkina faso senegal nigeria cte divoire ghana and the gambia this far only one study has considered the entire region of west-africa 27  in this study a co-variate-based instrumental variable regression framework was used to predict the number of disease cases 28 million by june 30 2020 and to assess the epidemiological socio-economic and health system readiness of the region to the pandemic in this study we develop a new susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered seir-type mathematical model for covid-19 in west-africa and use it to i study the current transmission pattern of covid-19 ii evaluate the impact of currently implemented public health control measures such contact tracing social distancing and use of face masks on covid-19 transmission and iii predict the future course of the pandemic with and without currently implemented and additional control measures in west-africa in addition to incorporating various basic public health control measures in our model it accounts for asymptomatic infectious individuals -a class of individuals that render disease control more difficult since they do not exhibit clinical disease symptoms although they contribute to disease transmission 21  to our knowledge this is the first study that has used an explicit seir-type compartmental mathematical model together with data for the west-african pandemic period from february 28 2020 to april 23 2020 to understand the spread of the covid-19 pandemic in the region assess the impact of current control measures and discuss possible further control measures that might be required to better control the pandemic in the region we develop a deterministic seir-type model framework where the entire population of west-africa is subdivided in four categories susceptible s exposed e infectious asymptomatic i a  infectious symptomatic i s  infectious at treatment or isolation centres i c  and recovered r the model accounts for public health control measures that lead to a reduction in the force of infection  such as social distancing and face mask use following the approach in ngonghala et al 17 we model the force of infection as 1   a i a   s i s   c i c s  e  i a  i s  r where  k k  a s c is the disease transmission rate by individuals in the i k class and 0    1 is the percentage reduction in disease transmission due to public health control measures such as social distancing and face masks use note that   0 implies that no public health control measure leading to a reduction in disease transmission is applied and that   1 implies that implemented public health control measures are efficient enough to stop disease transmission after the average incubation period

after the outbreak in the region since mass testing in the region only started around april 24 2020 and since many countries in the region are not carrying out mass testing yet we avoid using data collected after april 23 in our study therefore the data considered for this analysis spans the period from february 28 2020 ie one day after the first case through to april 23 2020 before mass testing started ie 39 days after the start of control measures this allowed us to assess the dynamics of the disease before the start of control measures ie the worst case scenario and for the entire period with control measures by estimating model parameters for the first 17 days of the outbreak when no control measures were put in place and then for the entire period of data collection feb 28-apr 23 in west-africa the reported confirmed cases are infectious symptomatic individuals who have been tested at a treatment center or infectious asymptomatic individuals who have been contact-traced and then tested at a treatment centre hence we assume that confirmed disease cases correspond to individuals in the i c class ie isolated infectious individuals at isolation or treatment centers we use the cumulative number of cases in west-africa downloaded from the global rise of education website 8 to fit our model and estimate some of the key parameters presented in table   1  the fitting was done using a nonlinear least squares procedure and involved finding the best set of parameter values that minimized the sum of the square differences between the observed number of daily cases in west-africa and the predicted cumulative number of cases from our model we repeated this procedure 5000 times to approximate the distribution of each of the parameters by a normal distribution and obtain the mean value with a 95 confidence interval the goodness of fit of our model assessed using the root mean squared error rmse was 225 and 7062 respectively for the fits before the onset of interventions and for the entire period of data collection the estimated parameters are presented in table 1 and the model fit is illustrated in fig 2 a b the other model parameters that were extracted from the literature or estimated based on covid-19 information from west-africa are presented in table 2 it is worth noting that the choice of parameters to estimate

also delay the peak to mid september 2020 improved control measures resulting in 35 and 45 reduction in disease transmission will lead to reductions of 76 and 92 respectively in the number of

complemented with any other measure but such identification and isolation must occur in a timely manner eg within 1 day ie  a  1 fig 5 b  on the other hand disease elimination is also possible if more exposed humans develop symptoms at the end of the incubation period and asymptomatic humans are detected and isolated in a timely manner for example if only 78 of humans fail to develop symptoms at the end of the incubation period then asymptomatic humans must be identified and isolated within 3 days for disease elimination to be possible fig 5 e  thus disease control is more difficult if it takes long to contact trace and isolate asymptomatic humans our results also show that timely isolation of symptomatic cases is important in reducing the disease burden in west-africa although disease elimination is only possible if isolation of infectious symptomatic cases is complemented with another control measure fig 5 c d  in particular if symptomatic humans are identified and isolated within 3 days ie  s  039 then a 43 reduction in the disease transmission rate is required for disease elimination while if it takes a long time to isolate symptomatic infectious individuals eg within 10 days a 51 reduction on the disease transmission rate is required to contain the pandemic in west-africa fig 5 c  when isolation of symptomatic infectious disease cases is complemented with identification and isolation of asymptomatic infectious cases disease elimination is only possible through timely identification and isolation of asymptomatic cases fig 5 d  thus identifying and isolating asymptomatic individuals in a timely manner contributes more in curtailing the pandemic in west-africa than isolating symptomatic infectious individuals furthermore if more exposed humans develop

if 58 of exposed humans develop clinical disease symptoms at the end of the incubation period then symptomatic infectious humans must be isolated within 2 days in order to eliminate the disease

the course of the disease and in assessing the impacts of basic public health control measures 17 18 19 23  in this study we develop a mathematical model to inform the covid-19 trend and possible course of control measures in west-africa the model is trained with covid-19 data from west-african countries for the period from february 28 2020 to april 23 2020 and used to compute the reproduction

slow compared to other parts of world this low transmission in the region can be attributed to a number of factors eg the pandemic might still be in the early stage since the statistics for west-africa within the first seven weeks of the pandemic 3 661 cases and 79 deaths are similar to those of france and higher than those of the us 1 025 cases and 28 deaths when these countries were within the same outbreak time-frame also the low transmission could be due to the fact that there is limited movement of individuals within 12  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made

under-reporting of cases as was the case in peru 40  this is supported by the growing number of asymptomatic infectious individuals observed in our study de leo et al observed a similar trend in mexico where over 90 of the infectious population was asymptomatic 21  in the absence of sufficient test kits in many west-african countries and with the limitations in health care facilities and personnel identifying cases is difficult 41  irrespective of the current trend the covid-19 pandemic is still a more serious health problem in west-africa compared to previous outbreaks like the 2014 ebola outbreak 150  r c  160 42 43 or the lassa fever outbreak in nigeria 129  r c  137 44  although most countries in west-africa started implementing basic control measures since march 17 2020 our simulation results indicate that improvements are necessary to effectively control or eliminate the pandemic from the region because there is currently no safe and effective vaccine or drugs against the novel coronavirus basic public health control measures have been used to curtail the pandemic in many parts of the world including west-africa these measures include contact tracing isolation and measures that lead to a reduction in disease transmission eg mask use and social or physical distancing 17  in the absence of such measures the worst case scenario prediction for west-africa from our model is over 2 million confirmed covid-19 cases by mid may 2020 when the epidemic peaks this projection is within the range 517 489 -15 056 314 in 27 for the same west-african region although the peak in the latter study was predicted to occur in june 2020 the higher upper limit in 27 might be linked to the fact that the authors used linear models and considered the rate of infection between the first and second weeks of the epidemic in countries in which the number of cases might have been overestimated we found out that basic public health control measures especially those associated with a reduction in the disease transmission rate such as social distancing and mask use have a significant effect on reducing the burden of the disease eg at baseline values control measures reduce the number of cases when the epidemic peaks by about 60 and the disease transmission rate by about 25 also improving control measures such about an estimated 45 reduction in the disease transmission is attained reduces the number of confirmed cases when the epidemic attains its peak approximately 92 such interventions are useful in reducing ensuring that the already limited and fragile health care systems are not overwhelmed by the covid-19 burden 19  our results suggest that early identification and isolation of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious individuals is an important step towards curtailing the burden of the pandemic in particular identifying and isolating asymptomatic individuals early enough eg within 1-2 days after the end of the incubation period can result in disease elimination even without any other control measure the same is not true with identifying and isolating symptomatic individuals or when it takes a longer time to identify and isolate infectious asymptomatic individuals in this case the measure must be complemented with another measure that involves a reduction in the disease transmission rate in order to eliminate the disease asymptomatic infectious individuals can be identified through contact-tracing and testing however since mass testing in most west-african countries only started during the last week of april the primary way in which asymptomatic individuals were identified in west-africa during the study period was through manual contact tracing and then testing the contacts suspected to have the virus one way in which contact tracing has been used successfully to identify and isolate both pre-symptomatic and 13  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted

infectious individuals is through mobile phone applications see for example ferretti et al 45  we showed that a higher reduction in the disease transmission rate eg through social distancing or using masks will be required to eliminate the disease if a higher proportion of exposed humans do not develop clinical disease symptoms after the incubation period these results highlight the importance of early identification and of disease cases and are consistent with the results of previous studies on ebola virus and lassa fever virus in west-africa 43 46  the results are also consistent with those of a study by hellewell et al 47  who used simulated data to illustrate that contact tracing and isolation is highly effective in controlling the pandemic and can lead to disease elimination within 3 months although contact tracing is already being implemented in west-africa the measure is not very effective due to the lack of resources and the high community transmission in the region for example as of april 8 2020 about 4 in every 5 reported cases in the region resulted from community transmission 5  therefore increased compliance with measures like social distancing and mask use is very important for the region since the disease can be transmitted from one human to the other through droplets from infected individuals that can travel though a few meters in air 23 48  using masks and social distancing are very important in the fight against the pandemic masks play a dual role-they prevent acquisition of the virus by infected individuals and also prevent infectious individuals from spreading the virus 17  both using masks and social distancing are ongoing in many west-african countries however the effectiveness of these measures in reducing the spread of the virus is linked to the extent to which they are applied the compliance level by public and how long they will last 17 21  our analyses show covid-19 can be eliminated in west-africa through social distancing and using masks if 45 of the population complies with the measures this is consistent with recent results in 17 23 49  where strict compliance with social distancing and mask use can lead to disease elimination some west-african countries eg benin have implemented measures involving isolating some densely populated portions of the country especially overcrowded urban areas with dilapidated sanitary facilities and limited basic amenities like clean water 28  this has a positive effect on reducing the spread of the virus finally our study suggests that mass application of control measures coupled with appropriate testing and timely isolation of asymptomatic humans will go a long way in keeping disease numbers low however with the fragile economic conditions and health care systems in the region interventions like complete lock-down as observed in most european countries for a couple of months can be more catastrophic than the disease itself therefore the choice of interventions by public policy makers in the region should aim at balancing the prevention of the epidemic with the need for maintaining livelihoods and social cohesion our study confirms the fact that the novel coronavirus covid-19 is highly contagious and that infectious humans who do not show clinical disease symptoms asymptomatic or unreported cases contribute significantly in disease transmission this study also indicates that early identification of these unreported cases through contact tracing or mass testing and then isolating individuals who test positive plays a significant role in diminishing the burden of covid-19 in west-africa furthermore this study suggests that social distancing measures such as stay-at-home orders closing educational institutions  cc-by-nc-nd 40

these control measures we conclude that mass-testing contact tracing and isolation of confirmed disease cases as well as improvements to the other existing basic public health measures eg social distancing and mask use in the region are required to better manage or eliminate the pandemic also due to uncertainties and various disparities between the economies and health care systems of countries within the region we conclude that country-level studies are necessary and will provide more insights into disease dynamics and control in the region  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it

 government of india and its prime minister have commended the job of medical community in these pandemic times indian government has amended epidemic diseases act of 1897 for providing safety to doctors medical attendants paramedical staff medical community can now perform duties fearlessly and translate data generated into good ethical research12
 after careful appraisal of literature and addition of personal reflectionopinion authors have compiled following points and management suggestion to mitigate the impact on research and academic front fig 1
1
prepare to work and collaborate virtually laptop charger webcam will be most required armamentarium to disseminate knowledge world has already shrunk and it is quite easy to engage and convince stalwarts and eminent scientists to share their knowledge on various live streaming softwares
 as suggested in previously new authors in scientific writing are recommended to join experienced researchers this is can be easily done by virtual collaborations13

14 collaborations with experienced and expert stalwarts in ethics politics or public policy have positive implications on final submitted research work for publication15 topics like biomedical ethics can be easily imbibed at grass root level by these online team work2
check deadlines it is obviously possible that federal agencies and other funders including indian council of medical researchdepartment of biotechnologydepartment of science and technology might extend deadlines for project submissions in these pandemic times principal investigator should take a lead here and share how the crisis has affected team-work and how team plans to keep progressing with deadlines in mind16

 it is recommended that students are not pressurised for deadlines and that teachers show flexibility in submission dates as many of students might be stranded or might be compromised in establishing communication due to limited online resources authorities should know that too many deadlines pressure to publish and api annual performance index score for promotion are responsible for plagiarism13

alter research methodology online institutional review board should be constituted in all the universities so that virtual approval can be provided many of the project and research work might change methodologies which rely on face-to-face interaction to collect data4
have plan b these are infectious times and chances of co-workers falling sick is possible hence cross training of staff is important single investigator maintaining and storing entire data should be avoided maintaining data on spread sheet with multiple access is recommended5
maintain communication and virtual socialization frequent communication is key to not only keeping the research going but also safeguarding mental health of students and researchers17 bregman d et al 2020 suggests what we need in a pandemic is not social distancing but physical distancing with social connectedness18

 many of the stalwarts can use these pandemic times for self-promotion of own articles ethically for increasing scientific impactcitation bloggingtweetingresearch gate etc platforms can be used for increasing academic foot print it may be noted here that sharing data ethically does lead to increased citations over a longer period of time19

time to upgrade the pandemic crisis lock down time gives each student and academician a chance to increase their academic outputs the researchers can utilise their time in writing proposals for grants and simultaneously also enhance their skills and knowledge by various online pedagogical learning courses or discussions government of india wwwswayamgovin has initiated and designed online courses which are interactive free of cost available to any learner7
build-up a support system as a student its important to keep in touch with authorities so that a support system can be build up to tackle any kind of critical situations since many of universities have told students to vacate hostel immediately its important that teachers ensure that students reach respective homes safely8
rapid sharing of data in policy brief developed by the who working group on ethics  covid-19 states that research projects should be coordinated nationally and internationally to avoid wasteful duplication and underpowered studies and to ensure that priorities and activities are consistent with response efforts20

pandemic reading and writing covid-19 has disrupted life all over the world but one practice relatively unaffected by the pandemic is reading students and academicians should have a daily read list to make best out of these social distancing times online free access journals can be handy in this teachers and mentors should share favourite titles and abstracts to initiate discussions and drive students to read articles various online modes like google classrooms can be effectively used for sharing presentations books assignments and also hold quiz or interactive discussions with students
 students teachers researchers etc can hone skills of writing both scientific and casual text during these crisis times the entire focus can be to disseminate knowledge which can be utilized by students and researchers once lockdown and isolation conditions are removed above mentioned suggestions are not exhaustive and can be modified as per individual situations since the scientific knowledge and related data keeps on increasing these guidelines can be modified to suit region based cases most of the recommendations provided can be applied in global perspective also 
the show must go on - freddie mercury  queen bohemian rhapsody
 who has declares covid-19 outbreak as pandemic on the march 11 2020 and entire world including indian sub-continent is under lock down isolation has given science a whole new perspective on health care related research and academics non-contact mode of teaching and research is new mantra of safe-studying at universities including ones involving health care givers however at the same time it has also given an opportunity to healthcare researchers academicians and also students to build up their research quotient utilising virtual connectivity and spend their time effectively to upgrade their skills and knowledge the article suggests online ethical reviews for speeding up proposals while easing the deadlines in the current scenario also at the same time compliments the government on their initiatives of quality online courses for benefit of academic community in the midst of all the confusion and shock caused by covid-19 it is crucial that universities and research intuitions providing health care should stick to their basic principles and ethical standards which will offer a sense of direction and legitimacy to patient care academics and research india and abroad medical community comprising of doctors nurses paramedical staff and accredited social health workers and students shall face these dark times fearlessly collectively and shall act today to define future of mankind  the impact of public safety measures on the spread of covid-19 in the united states assessed by causal model-based projections of the pandemic keshav amla tarun amla  the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 and the disease it causes covid-19 was declared a pandemic on march 11 2020 by the world health organization since then the disease has spread all over the world with the united states becoming the country with the highest number of cases governments around the world have undertaken varying degrees of public safety measures including recommendations and ad campaigns for improved hygiene practices enacting social distancing requirements and limiting large public gatherings and stay-at-home orders and lockdowns in the united states while the response has varied greatly from state to state we clearly see that the effect of these public safety measures is significant and if these measures continue to remain in effect or are expanded to a nationwide lockdown the pandemic can be controlled and the disease likely overcome with mitigated consequences in this paper we model the spread of the novel coronavirus using a causal model we find that with continued lockdown measures the united states can according to this model limit the total number of infections to 135 million and the total number of deaths to 72 thousand a 60 day lockdown can save countless lives  covid-19 was first observed as a zoonotic disease in a human in december of 2019 in wuhan because sars-cov-2 the virus that confers covid-19 has several methods of spread and because of its relative ease of communicability from human to human this disease has been spreading around the world at a very high pace having been declared a global pandemic by the world health organization on march 11 2020 countries all around the world have been working to try to combat the pandemic through public safety measures which predominantly involve promoting improved hygiene practices like frequent and lengthy hand washing enactment of social distancing measures such as guidelines for keeping more than six feet apart from others and cancellation of large events and bans on gatherings of more than a few people and stay-at-home or lockdown orders requiring the closing of non-essential businesses and banning outdoor movement except as it pertains to health sustenance necessities or those businesses deemed essential this is in addition to schools and universities having been closed and most workplaces shifting exclusively to a workfrom-home model the united states has become the worst hit in terms of the number of cases and as a result has enacted many of these public safety measures though there is no nationwide lockdown most states have issued stay-at-home orders and have closed all non-essential businesses in addition to social distancing measures the current social distancing and lockdown measures are vital to our societys survival and we simply wished to provide a brief simple analysis to make it clear why that is and to implore people to obey these measures we further argue that increased social distancing measures can serve to further prevent this disease from getting completely out of control we are not epidemiologists but rather engineers the bulk of what is being pushed by experts in the field however is proving inaccurate due to the reliance on analogy to previous outbreaks of similar viruses and also ineffective in making the case for the importance of continued implementation and obedience of these public health measures as a result we intend to make this case in a clear accessible fashion in this short paper in this paper we present a statistical treatment of the covid-19 outbreak in the united states this is implemented through the use of a causal model to describe the effect of the public safety measures as enacted this causal model is used to describe the decreased growth rate in the days since strong public safety measures have gone into effect in the country this model allows us to make reasonable indicative projections on the spread of the disease and its impact in terms of hospitalizations and deaths over time the paper is organized as follows in section ii we introduce and justify our assumptions and methodology for building our model which is constructed using the data available from the covid tracking project 1  next in section iii we show the results of the projection of our model forward in time for infections hospitalizations and deaths and highlight the impact of the public safety measures lastly we provide a discussion of the primary takeaways of our findings and conclude with some recommendations as well as acknowledge the limitations of the analysis conducted herein the limited understanding of the virus epidemiologically has limited the ability of experts to apply science-derived models that depend on knowing several key properties of the virus and the kinetics and means of its spread its incubation period and additional mechanistic behavior about sars-cov-2 while we recognize that these types of science-based models which may or may not be enhanced by statistical learning are generally very powerful and tend to prove superior to black-box statistical approaches the current state-of-the-art sciencebased approaches in the field of epidemiology have been relatively unsuccessful in this particular instance the reason for this is that a lot of early modeling was built by assuming some of these sophisticated models apply but using properties analogous to other similar viruses such as sars or mers for which there was ample data available however this particular virus seems to behave very differently from those previous outbreaks thus rendering those models inaccurate because these efforts have proven difficult due to the ad-hoc manner in which they must be applied we thought it best to demonstrate our point through straightforward implementation of statistical analysis pure regression of a causal model with very limited assumptions the implementation is relatively straightforward and is meant to provide an accessible explanation of just how powerful the precautionary measures of social distancing and stay-at-home orders are and how important it is that the public obey them we looked at the data in two segments before any relevant lockdownstay-at-home measures were implemented and after they were implemented in significant portions of the country we observed the direct data for the period before the quarantine and modeled that as an exponential growth curve malthusian model of the form where is the intercept is the exponential growth coefficient and is time in days this provided us with a benchmark model for unmitigated spread of the virus it should be noted that we did not account for any damping effect as larger portions of the population are infected we ignored the effect of the predator-prey-like population damping as this only becomes significant as society approaches herd-immunity levels which are generally posited as being 60 of the population 2 and we feel it would be irresponsible to even model such a scenario since any competent society would fight tooth-and-nail to avoid this especially because of the high cfr case fatality rate of the disease which is estimated at 14 3  though the reported cfrs from the current data suggest a number that may be much higher for reference the spanish flu of 1918 had a cfr of 25 and resulted in more than 50 million deaths 4  so the 14 cfr of covid-19 is of grave concern especially when coupled with how freely transmissible it is as a result in order to maintain justifiable accuracy while avoiding indicating scenarios that should not occur in practice we only project out the beforelockdown data a few days well in advance of any damping effect or predator-prey behavior takes hold the intent of projecting the no lockdown data out is to demonstrate how significant the impact of the lockdown and similar measures has been and will continue to be and this point is sufficiently clear without the need to project out to potentially cataclysmic levels of infection in addition we applied a modified exponential growth model for the after lockdown period this was done by treating the exponent as not constant but rather a function of time meant to represent the impact of the lockdown this function of time was implemented as a causal model of exponential decay as before the only damping force that was modeled was that of the impact of the public safety measures as the projected levels of infection come nowhere near the level at which herd-immunity and predatorprey-like damping becomes relevant this can be thought of as treating social distancing and stay-at-home orders as analogous to the addition of control rods to a nuclear reaction in the absence of the control rods the fission continues unobstructed as there is no shortage of particles enabling extremely frequent collisions however the introduction of the control rods reduces the frequency of the collisions because the control rods absorb the particles reducing the number of free-moving particles that can collide in the same way the number of people freely moving who can spread the disease or unto whom the disease can be spread is greatly reduced by these social distancing and lockdown measures which is akin to the reduction of collisions in our analogy due to the noise in the data which comes largely as a result from the data being discretized on a daily basis and thus a highly limited number of data points are available and due to the high degree of variability of number of tests conducted and inconsistent testing we chose to smooth the data as a three-day moving average of the growth rate this is what was actually modeled for the exponential decay of the exponent this prediction model is constructed as follows the general assumption of an exponential growth curve for the spread of the virus is maintained therefore the following equation describes the growth is the same as equation 1 except that is no longer treated as a constant as it was for the unmitigated growth case rather is described by a causal model to account for the damping force of the public safety measures as follows where 1 and are both positive valued constants that are fit to the growth rate over time and and are the same as before this exponential decay function that was fit to the exponent was then applied to the data as a simple multiplicand between subsequent days and projected out as described in the following recursion relation where the and  1 subscripts indicate the results on the  and   1  day respectively as an additional note we also only used country-wide data 1 as the state-by-state data lacks granularity for more meaningful analysis further the state-by-state data is far noisier due to local variations in testing rates backlogs incomplete reporting and inconsistent response to the coronavirus pandemic a more macroscopic country-wide view smooths out this data and allows for more statistically significant analysis it should be further understood that the delineation between the prior to lockdown and post-lockdown data is not very clear due to inconsistent implementation across states plus there is a lag factor due to several factors including the time between testing and obtaining results  results our analysis of the unmitigated prior to lockdown effects growth of infections see figure  1  produced the following model similarly we acquired the following causal model for the exponential decay of the growth rate of the post-lockdown effect growth rate of infections see figure 2  from these models we were able to construct figures 3 and 4 which show the daily and cumulative infections respectively in figure 3  our model indicates that daily infections under continued lockdown protocols should peak on april 09 2020 day 37 at 39329 new infections on that day the rate of new infections drops below 1000 new cases per day on day 96 june 7 2020 in figure 4  our model indicates that the total number of covid-19 infections should plateau at 135 million cases with fewer than 100 additional daily cases on day 126 july 7 2020 due to the nature of an exponential growth model with exponential decay of its exponential coefficient there is a very long tail to continuing introduction of low levels of new cases a real world scenario would likely see a slightly more rapid de-escalation than our model describes in the region that is well past the peak daily infection rate to model the hospitalizations we used the number of hospitalizations in the covid tracking project to calculate a percentage of new cases requiring hospitalization as well as calculating the mean cycle time for hospital stay which ends in either death or recovery from this data we found that 1324 of cases require hospitalization and that the mean hospital stay is 6 days modeled using littles law thus we modeled the active case hospitalizations by building a recursive relationship    1   6  1324 6 where  is the number of active case hospitalizations the subscripts represent the day and is the daily infection rate from this we constructed figure 5 which shows that our model predicts that hospitalizations should peak on april 11 2020 day 39 at 30966 hospitalizations should this prediction hold true it will be a great relief as it would be manageable by our nations healthcare system however as a note since we are looking at nationwide data there is a possibility for inequitable distribution of these hospitalizations such as may be the case in certain parts of new york or new jersey where locally the system may become overloaded from the hospitalizations we similarly extracted the death rate we analyzed the covid-19 death data to determine a percentage of hospitalizations that end in death and used the same cycle time for hospitalization as determined before as a note there is likely a difference in terms of cycle time for recovery vs cycle time for death but for lack of granularity no knowledge of when each subset would have arrived at the hospital we continued with the same mean hospital stay we found that 40 of hospitalizations end in death and used the mean hospital stay of 6 days thus we modeled the death rate by building a recursive relationship from this we constructed figures 6 and 7 figure 6 shows that the death rate according to our model is expected to peak on april 15 2020 day 43 at 2083 daily deaths this rate will drop below 200 daily deaths on day 85 may 27 2020 and below 100 daily deaths on day 95 june 6 2020 as shown in figure 7  our model indicates that the total death rate will plateau at 72000 deaths as a result of covid-19 while this is certainly a very high number it is a fraction of what would occur if lockdown protocols are not continued it should also be noted that this prediction is a far lower number than those of many existing studies most notably the numbers put out by the cdc and white house coronavirus task force 5  we do not subscribe to the notion that the prevalence of the virus is much higher as posited by some researchers to the level of herdimmunity even counting for asymptomatic cases the number of ill people testing as positive for covid-19 is relatively low 20 this is a clear statistically significant indication that even if the total tally is not capturing 100 of cases we are nowhere near herd-immunity levels beyond rendering any analysis moot such a notion which has no meaningful statistical or scientific basis is irresponsible and dangerous as it promotes an idea that it is safe to break lockdown while we could attempt to draw declarative quantitative conclusions about exactly how many deaths there will be the ventilator and icu bed needs the total number of cases when we will hit our peak and when we will see the last case of covid-19 we choose to avoid falling for this trap there is significant noise in the data there is high sensitivity in the models we have provided our models and projections and they should be thought as indicative of the number of cases deaths hospital requirements and peak and fall of the pandemic but not taken as declarative fact as another point as mentioned earlier the model predicts a very long tail to the infection while a long tail is generally expected for a pandemic to end the causal model implemented by its very nature is a lot less aggressive in its rate of descent as the infection rate falls to low levels after the peak a real world scenario would likely be more aggressive in the latter stages than our model indicates we also did not build a stochastic model and as such do not have error bars on our projections the data being discretized only on a daily basis was too limited to construct such a model as such this is a limitation to our analysis what is very clear from this analysis however is that the effect of the stay-at-home and lockdown measures are profound and the absence of them or disobeying them is devastating bootsma and ferguson in a paper studying the impact of the united states public health and safety measures taken in response to the outbreak of the 1918 spanish flu in europe found a profound link between the speed with which such measures are implemented how long and effectively they are maintained and how effective they are in mitigating the spread and death rate caused by the pandemic 6  as a result the united states did not suffer nearly as terrible of consequences as europe did during that pandemic a 60 day nationwide lockdown would most likely see us through the covid-19 pandemic maintaining of general social distancing practices and use of face-masks and improved hygiene habits washing hands frequently avoiding physical contact etc for a period of time thereafter upon lifting of lockdown would allow us to transition back to a new normal while allowing us to limit the level of the overall outbreak as best we can ideally this period of continued social distancing and general precautions would last until at least a vaccine has been developed and is readily available or similarly an adequate anti-viral pharmaceutical treatment or cure is on the market and accessible to the masses for more specificity on what that should look like we would defer to the appropriate experts and authorities namely the cdc and the united states federal government once we reach that juncture  singing away the social distancing blues art therapy in a
time of coronavirus nisha gupta   one mental health consequence of social distancing is the terrible loneliness that
can prevail as people are necessitated to remain inside our homes and away from the
communal comradery of our daily lives which we may have taken for granted until
now our worlds can feel eerily quiet and small when mandated to work and school
from home avoid restaurants and bars and stay at a six-foot distance from others
for weeks or months to come physical distancing can certainly be experienced as a
psychological distancing without intentional efforts to offset the isolation health
care professionals are well aware of these mental health consequences they
encourage frequent virtual check-ins with one anotherparticularly those that are
most vulnerable to covid-19 such as our beloved eldersto preserve our sense of
intimate community bonding in this time of self-quarantining as a therapeutic form of art music offers that bonding power historically music
has been used by people to remain motivated resilient and united in the face of
collective challenge from the sea shantis that sailors in the 18th
century chanted together as they labored to weather harsh ocean tides to the
freedom songs sung by the black community in the 20th century amid the tiring fight
for civil rights tracey nicholls
2014 writes about musics emotional power to join people in solidarity
and build movements togetherit is because of the way music feeds into our emotional lives and because of
the sense of social well-being we get from sharing emotional states with
others that music so frequently accompanies movements that build and depend
upon solidarity whereby solidarity is defined as the harmony of interests and responsibilities among
individuals in a group especially as manifested in unanimous support and collective
action for something laurence
 urbain 2011 p 5 musical solidarity has the therapeutic ability
to puncture the isolation of social distancing to foster resiliency by lifting the
collective spirit and to move peoples emotions toward spirited
actioneven if that action in these circumstances means
staying home to save the lives of others music can also assuage the stress
inflicted by social distancing and the covid-19 pandemic by soothing the autonomic
nervous system through rhythm and melody thoma et al 2013 in this time of coronavirus examples of therapeutic music-making unceasingly flow
as a psychology professor who teaches art therapy my undergraduate students and i
were supposed to do a music therapy lesson last week and engage in an
improvisational jam-session together in the classroom each student was invited to
bring an object that can serve as an instrument be it a guitar or harmonica or
spoons or their voice to comply with the social distancing mitigation strategy
recommended by health care organizations we decided to move the class online via
zoom meetings as a last-minute plan yet social distancing did not impede our
musical solidarity instead the 20 students and i experimented with a virtual
improvisational jam session to join our spirits in a fun rhythmic flow of course
the rhythm was slightly delayed because of the internets lag-time of course our
harmony could not find perfect synchronization through our laptops and phones yet
still we sang together clapped together strummed together and laughed together
accessing a primal mode of communal being-together through collective sound making
across our individual screens our improvisational virtual jam session brought us
enough joy and love to overpower the terror of covid-19 for just a little while but
the next day i awoke to something all the more moving one of the most poignant
demonstrates of musical solidarity i have ever seen a video was circulating of the
people in italy who are currently undergoing a national quarantine because of the
rapid uncontainable spread of the infection across their nation at a capacity that
far overwhelms their health care capacities and has led to dire life-and-death
decisions in the hospitals with warning that the united states may follow suit if
we do not social distance now the situation in italy is tragic
there can be no denying the collective trauma among covid-19 patients and health
care providers and self-isolated citizens alike and yet this video of the italians
conveys unbridled joy viewable at httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv8r357ugh7hu the video captures
them congregating on the balconies of their apartments strumming and shaking
whatever instruments are available to them and joining the voices to sing together
into the wide open air they are laughing dancing and clapping in celebration of
one another it brings the viewer to tears to witness such a delightful display of
community it brings me close to tears to write this even now the antidote of
musical solidarity in a time of coronavirus provides a joyful reminder of the deep
human will to always find our way back to one another even a nationwide quarantine
or a deadly pandemic cannot prevent us from connecting and supporting each other
through lifes darkest hours since this video of the italians impromptu concert
went viral social media has become abundant with musicians generously sharing
virtual concerts for the general public to watch from the safety of their homes
such as members of the atlanta symphony orchestra john legend coldplay and many
of my musical friends on facebook in the days to come i imagine these bonds of
music will exponentially grow to remind each of us that we are not alone one challenge in mobilizing the masses to understand the severity of threat of
covid-19 and the importance of social distancing is the invisibility of the disease
our eyes cannot literally see how the coronavirus spreads from
person to person in the united states at the time of writing this essay many of
us can also not yet see the tragic effect of the disease on our
community members or loved ones with the exception of the major epicenters of the
outbreak such as washington and new york at this point the pandemic remains
shrouded in invisibility to most american eyes lest we find the courage to watch
news clips of the traumatic hospital scenarios in china and italy similar to a
psychological understanding of climate change apathy it is difficult to hold
tangible concern for a future calamity that appears intangible to us in present day
thus health care professionals pleas for american citizens to take seriously the
adoption of health precautions and social distancing practices can fall on apathetic
ears and eyes what can help people reverse apathy and confront reality is the
restoration of visionof literally seeing the coronavirus and its
impact on us and our loved ones vision is    one of the means by which we
interact with and relate to the world and by increasing our visual awareness we
extend and intensify our relationship to life mcniff 1981 p 155 as a therapeutic vehicle the visual arts help make the unconscious conscious
creating an image brings tangible form to psychological realities which remain
typically unseen to the human eye thereby allowing us to become aware of and
confront these realities during crisis experiences that are emotionally difficult
to confront such as the threat of covid-19 an image can act as an external
container within which to place our inner disturbances so we can safely understand
and work through them as mcniff
1998 statesthe art of placing a troublesome experience or thought into a creative space
we have made literally changes its place within our lives the artistic act
will often have a corresponding effect on our overall relationship with the
disturbance    when we use our disturbances as materials of expression we
see that everything in life is fuel for the creative process p 74 after making visual artwork we can then examine our image at a safe distance so a
new perspective can be discovered which allows our feelings and relationship to the
crisis to transform as tangible products our artwork can also be shared with
others inviting them to dialogue with our image discover personal meanings in it
and emotionally connect to it as shared human experience thus visual artwork can
offer collective healing finally visual artworks can have an everlasting and
historical quality behaving as tangible memorials that forever commemorate this
present moment in our personal and collective histories shulman  watkins 2008 memorial
making during times of collective crisis can bring healing prior to most countries enforcing or strongly encouraging social distancing it is
amazing to witness the coronavirus street art that sprung up as if overnight in
london street artist pegasus painted a mural on a street corner featuring prime
minister boris johnson urging people to stop panic-buying supplies in grocery stores
as they prepare to social distance he wanted to remind them to be considerate to
others during this crisis in rome street artist laika painted a mural above a
popular restaurant to address the ignorance and xenophobia toward chinese people in
italy as a result of covid-19 the image includes a chinese woman dressed in
surgical attire and a face mask with a speech bubble that reads theres an
epidemic of ignorance going around    we must protect ourselves in naples
artist nello petrucci erected a giant street mural of the simpsons
family wearing face masks on their couch with the words stay home spray-painted
onto the image from within their homes adults and children are transforming
boredom into creativity by crafting their own images to share with the public in
italy many quarantined families hang colorful painted banners outside their
balconies with words of encouragement such as andra tutto bene meaning
everything will be fine in the united states where a national quarantine has not
yet been administered the visual arts are embraced to make the invisible visible
remind americans of the gravity of the situation and offer encouragement and
precaution i painted an acrylic painting called social distancing blues which
visualizes the coronavirus hovering across the sky in bright red paint outside my
apartment windows i shared the image on social media as a public service
advertisement with the message even though the virus looks pretty from afar dont
trust it stay at home folks a few days later my mother a senior citizen who is
in the high-risk category of covid-19 was inspired to create her own graphic image
as a public service announcement she used the phone app bitmoji to create a comic
strip of herself as a cartoon character social distancing in the comic strip she
offers healing greetings and safety strategies to help others cope with covid-19
good day thinking of you all are you ok i am social distancing cuz i want
to listen to the cdc advice and so should you wash your hands dont touch your
face nature walks healing through the internet no peeking at the 401k
hang in there dont panic we can do it what is so moving about these
examples is that in the process of making and sharing coronavirus art a shift seems
to occur where we become empowered to do something about the
covid-19 crisis we seem to be creating images to help slow the virus down spread
reminders of kindness and nurture collective resiliency just as mcniff suggested
that placing a troublesome experience into an artistic container can transform our
relationship to it making visual art about coronavirus and social distancing can
help transform collective anxiety into collective support and action thus this
time in history may forever be memorialized as a moment of precious human
solidarity 

 

 

 one stressful aspect of coronavirus is that it is a new pandemic we do not know much
about our understanding is evolving day by day moreover mixed messages are being
disseminated from politicians health care professionals organizational leaders
and our intimate social circles this lack of information and mixed messaging breeds
anxiety by making us feel out of control and unsure of what to believe the future
feels unknown and we struggle to find a secure leg on which to stand grasping for
some semblance of certitude with which to anticipate a narrative about the impending
days weeks and months to come cinema is increasingly embraced as a form of expressive art therapy because movies
offer relatable narratives with characters and plotlines that can express the shared
human experience cinematherapy is the intentional use of movie
viewing to gain self-insight and psychological transformation as audiences
emotions and perspectives transform while watching a movie berg-cross et al 1990 sharp et al 2002 most
films offer narratives with a reliable temporal structurala
beginning in which a conflict emerges a
middle during which the crisis is grappled with and an
ending during which the conflict is resolved if we watch a
movie whose crisis is similar to our own we can find incredible catharsis and
relief by witnessing a resolution to our crisis offered by the movies storyline
moreover because movies are a multisensory experience they can evoke the full
spectrum of emotion about a situation onscreen cinemas ability to express strong
emotion through sight sound and motion can offer emotional catharsis and
containment for audiences allowing us to externalize our own inner suffering by
viewing it onscreen the movie offers a container for our strong emotions aside
from watching movies cinematherapy also includes therapeutic filmmaking
interventions ordinary people can shoot edit and produce videos and films that
express their difficult psychological experiences johnson  alderson 2008 it can be
empowering to control the narrative by making a film of ones own making movies
helps us restore agency gain mastery and reduce the anxiety that corresponds with
feeling out of control in crisis situations an interesting trend during this coronavirus crisis has been the plethora of people
flocking to watch the 2011 fictional film contagion on their movie
streaming platforms contagion is a movie about a deadly fictional
pandemic named mev-1 whose outbreak kills 26 million people worldwide the virus in
the film kills 25 to 30 of people who catch it as opposed to the 2 of covid-19
despite this significant difference contagion is nevertheless a
pretty terrifying flick to watch at this time the film gruesomely depicts the
health and social impacts of a deadly pandemic so why has it become one of the top
movies streamed from netflix and itunes since our own pandemic broke loosea film
which appears more and more like a medical documentary than fictional thriller each
day because despite the massive death toll that the film depicts the movie ends
with a vaccine developed which effectively immunizes human beings from mev-1
despite the emotional rollercoaster the audience endures as the film world explodes
because of a deadly pandemican emotional journey that likely mirrors what we will
experience as the pandemic develops in our real worldby the end of the movie the
audience can breathe a sigh of relief as the crisis is resolved and daily life
returns to normal thus contagion offers audiences a cathartic
container for our panic a sense of control to combat uncertainty and hope for
whats to come aside from the healing power of watching movies agency and hope can
also be discovered by therapeutic filmmaking in this time of coronavirus i will
again reference the magnificent art pouring from the italians amid their current
situation of enforced national quarantine a filmmaking collective in milan called a
thing by recently created a video compilation of italians talking to their former
selves from 10 days ago which can be viewed here httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvocimrzkxosfeatureyoutube
the italians in the video have a dialogue with the camera of what they wish they
could tell themselves 10 days ago hello daniele-from-10-days-ago are you scared
nah im speaking to you from the future i know youre busy but wait a second i
want to update you on italys latest a huge mess is about to happen     the
video showcases italians imploring their former selves to take seriously the threat
of the virus such that they can adopt social distancing and health precautions
before it is too late while they cannot turn back time i imagine this video was
cathartic to make by providing an expressive container for feelings of regret and
despair moreover the italians may regain agency and control in making this video
for it is being shared by the cdc in the united states to warn americans of whats
to come if they make the same mistake through therapeutic filmmaking the italians
may experience empowerment by helping the rest of the world avert the crisis that
they themselves endured as the pandemic spreads across the world i imagine in-home
video production will be embraced as significant therapeutic vehicle as we
collectively seek to tell the story of our time across the history of our species crisis has always been intertwined with
creativity humans are called again and again to discover and harness our primal
will to create which resides within us all in order to survive existential

1975 suggestedif you wish to understand the psychological and spiritual temper of any
historical period you can do no better than to look long and searchingly at
its art for in the art the underlying spiritual meaning of the period is
expressed directly in symbols this is not because artists are didactic or
set out to teach or to make propaganda    they have the power to reveal
the underlying meaning of any period precisely because the essence of art is
the powerful and alive encounter between the artist and his or her world
p 52 it is still early in the game but if i am learning anything about the meaning of
this time from the artists among us it is that there is a profound desire to
protect each other sacrifice for each other and be together-in-solidarity as an

borders balconies and computer screens  exploring the effect of 2019-ncov containment policies on crime the case of los angeles gian campedelli maria alberto aziani serena favarin  the global spread of 2019-ncov a new virus belonging to the coronavirus family forced national and local governments to apply different sets of measures aimed at containing its outbreak los angeles has been one of the first cities in the united states to declare the state of emergency on march 4 th  progressively issuing stronger policies involving-among the others-social distancing the prohibition of crowded private and public gatherings and closure of leisure premises these interventions highly disrupt and modify daily activities and habits urban mobility and micro-level interactions between citizens one of the many social phenomena that could be influenced by such measures is crime exploiting public data on crime in los angeles and relying on routine activity and pattern theories of crime this work investigates whether and how new coronavirus containment policies have an impact on crime trends in a metropolis using bayesian structural time-series bsts models the article specifically focuses on nine urban crime categories daily monitored from january 1 st 2017 to march 28 th 2020 the analyses have been updated bi-weekly up to march 16 th and up to march 28 th 2020 to dynamically assess the short-term effects of mild and hard interventions to shed light on how crime adapts to such structural modification of the environment the results show that overall crime in las angeles is significantly decreasing as well as robbery shoplifting theft and battery no significant effect has been found for stolen vehicle burglary assault with deadly weapon intimate partner violence and homicide in the last section of this article policy implications are also discussed  introduction places eg shops restaurants and stations and canceling private and public events eg funerals music festivals and sporting events by the first two weeks of march several countries and regions of the world had adopted social distancing measures in the second half of the month several countries have also forced people to stay at home closing public places and reducing even more the possibilities of contact between people these measures impact considerably on citizens and communities distancing measures simultaneously affect the daily routines and the social interactions of millions of people daily commuters are forced to spend their days at home household members share the same living spaces throughout the entire day people cannot connect to their peers in person but only telematically yet the impact of the lock-down policies and the virus itself outreach the alteration of peoples daily routines and social relations restrictions on national and international movements of people and-to a lesser extentgoods together with the emergent needs of a sick population alter both demand and supply of goods in the medium term the losses due to the slowdown of the economic system may transform in higher unemployment and destitution for many the scale social distancing and lock-down policies adopted to mitigate the deadly consequences of the 2019-ncov constitute an unprecedented instrument to investigate contemporary societies despite the attention of scientists in assessing social and psychological consequences of quarantine during public health emergencies as epidemics and pandemics to date no research exists that investigates the effects of these measures on criminal activities several newspapers have already started to report and describe micro-level short-term changing these major societal modifications to the lives of millions of people influence urban crime occurrence specifically it is crucial to understand what types of crime if any are mostly influenced by the forced modification of daily habits and behaviors this quasiexperimental context will help in explaining what are the main changes that are plausible to foresee in these situations and what may be the underlying factors that lead to trend variations social distancing and quarantine inherently modify micro-and meso-level human interactions within an urban setting increasing or decreasing criminal opportunities based on newly adopted behaviors as well as new criminal motivations the modi operandi and the hotspots for crime are likely to change too theoretical implications of the results obtained are numerous due to the extent of transformations introduced by these policies and the novelty of the research proposed shedding light on these potential mechanisms can also help in theoretical advancing and in providing law enforcement agencies with indications regarding new threats and patterns in urban criminal activity minimizing uncertainty in the face of emerging or persistent crime patterns provides an effective response to these challenges the paper develops around the following structure section 1 highlights the gap of knowledge specifically addressed by this study and frames it within the criminological theoretical debate section 2 then justifies the use of the 2019-ncov emergency to answer to our research question and outlines the adopted methodology and the data used for the analyses relying on two post-intervention time windows the first one considering daily data points from march 4 th to march 16 th  the second one including all data points from march 4 th to march 28 th  the present study allows to dynamically compare the effects of milder containment policies prompted during the first two weeks of march with stronger interventions put in place in the second half of the month this design provides a unique informative framework to comprehensively assess the evolution of the effects as a result of policy tightening 1 section 3 presents then the statistical outcomes for the selected crime categories and the overall number of crimes in the city of los angeles the models show up to march 28 th  a significant decrease in shoplifting -31-32 thefts -24-25 robberies -21-19 and battery -11-76 furthermore the overall trend of crimes in the city of los angeles exhibit a reduction -15-14 finally section 1 readers interested in accessing the previous version of the manuscript considering only data points up to march 16 th can freely read it downloading version 2 from httpsosfiogcpq8 4 reviews the most important results of the analyses focusing on the future expected patterns and the most important policy implications entailed by the study 1 research background recent history has been marked by the outbreak of several pandemics that considerably affected the worlds population to different extents in 1918 the so-called spanish flu was a h1n1 influenza virus that infected about 27 of the worlds population up for an almost three-year period with death estimates ranging from 17 to 50 million globally taubenberger and morens 2006  in 1957 a new influenza denominated asian flu led on march 11 th  the who declared 2019-ncov a global pandemic as the virus spread widely across continents leading to a dramatic increase in the number of positive cases and deaths as the virus first originated in china and rapidly diffused across asia and then europe the americas and africa countries experienced delayed contagion patterns and consequently started to react with policies and interventions at different periods wilder- smith and freedman 2020  at this point most countries have already implemented or are moving towards policies that encompass social distancing as the most promising countermeasure to slow down the diffusion of the virus as to protect their citizens and safeguard public health systems from collapse due to exponential or nearly-exponential increase of cases country-wise as governments issue new directives regulations and recommendations to their citizens to proactively respond to the virus cities and communities are progressively experiencing consistent changes in the way in which daily life occurs social distancing as the most relevant strategy clearly affects the way in which society behaves impacting collective socialization jobs mobility and the economy regardless of the specific policies public health emergencies consistently modify and influence many components of human society in the past researchers investigated these changes from different standpoints analyzing the consequences of pandemics or other major epidemics economic accounts of such phenomena are among the most discussed strands of research brainerd and siegler 2003 investigated the impact of the spanish flu on the united states in the period 1919-1930 showing a strong positive effect of the influenza pandemic on per capita income growth the same question was explored by karlsson et al 2014 focusing on economic performance in sweden hivaids epidemic has marked debates all over the world in the second half of the twentieth century in connection to its impact several scholars analyzed its effect on economies all over the world bloom and mahal 1997 dixon 2002 mcdonald and roberts 2006  similar research has addressed the economic effects of other epidemic and pandemic outbreaks including avian flu kuo et al 2009 lean and smyth 2009 sars hai et al 2004 gupta et al 2005 keogh-brown and smith 2008 and swine flu page et al 2012  scholars have not solely focused on the economic impact of large epidemics and pandemics given the manifold consequences posed to society researchers have also focused on the characteristics of policy-making politics and international responses to such public health international and global crises notable works in this area targeted the historical study of tuberculosis investigating the role of segregation of infected individuals and the eradication of bovine tuberculosis fairchild and oppenheimer 1998  the responsiveness of disease surveillance at the international level in tackling avian influenza scoones 2010  the need for a more resilient and sustainable society in the aftermath of the ebola outbreak in west africa heymann et al 2015  and also the study of political agendas and comparative measures to fight hivaids boone and batsell 2001 lieberman 2007  several studies have also analyzed the social implications of epidemics and pandemics among these implications populations perception of the risks related to an epidemic is strongly relevant in understanding the effectiveness of containment and prevention policies and the medium-and long-range effects of a viral disease within a community helleringer and kohler 2005 studied how social interactions can be relevant to shape risk perceptions in the context of hivaids increasing individual awareness by investigating spousal communication about the epidemic in rural malawi smith 2006  instead proposed to re-evaluate the importance of risk perception and communication as a strong instrument to reduce the negative effects of future epidemic and pandemic outbreaks relying on the scrutiny of the processes related to sars another line of research instead aimed at assessing the psycho-social effects of pandemics many studies in this regard have attempted to delineate and analyze the social and psychological effects of hivaids in different regions of the world keogh et al 1994 danziger 1994 barnett et al 2000 piot et al 2001 mcdowell and serovich 2007 subramanian et al 2009  more recently scholars have also devoted efforts to highlight psycho-social mechanisms related to the massive ebola epidemic that hit western africa from 2013 to 2016 relying on an ethnographic research design pellecchia et al 2015 demonstrated how the epidemic reinforced condemnation stigmatization and socio-economic distress of liberian citizens similarly van bortel et al 2016 studied the main negative psychological outcomes of the ebola outbreak showing that individuals affected by the disease were likely to lead to stigmatization to feel guilty and to loss of truth in health services finally an area of scientific inquiry related to the present article pertains to the psychological investigation of the effects of quarantine on individuals besides being infected scientists have evaluated the impact of self-isolation on the mental health of individuals living in areas particularly hit by infective diseases maunder et al 2003 wang et al 2011 rubin and wessely 2020  in a recent article brooks et al 2020 conducted a review finding acute stress disorder post-traumatic stress high depressive symptoms anxiety anger alcohol abuse or dependence among the most significant negative psychological effects of quarantine additionally the study listed several specific stressors during quarantine comprising the duration of the quarantine itself the fear of infection frustration and boredom and inadequate supply of basic commodities services and information the literature indeed shows how policies aimed at imposing social distancing as a cornerstone intervention to limit a disease outbreak directly modify peoples behaviors attitudes and psychological conditions at the micro-level opening unanswered questions related to the criminological consequences of these measures besides few studies focusing on the relation between sars and suicides in hong kong chan et al 2006 cheung et al 2008 and a newly published working paper on the impact of social distancing during covid-19 pandemic on crime in indianapolis mohler et al 2020  and despite the relevance of the topic scientists have not yet answered questions related to the possible consequences of quarantine social distancing and self-isolation on crime and deviant trends failing thus to provide empirical assessments on whether and how criminal behavior evolves in periods of epidemics or pandemics outbreaks whether we do not have an understanding of the effects of pandemics and massive social distancing measures structured theories of urban criminality help us in hypothesizing possible future scenarios routine activity cohen and felson 1979 and crime pattern theories brantingham and brantingham 1984 outline how the characteristics and interactions of individual-level activities command the spatial and temporal distribution of offending and victimization assuming these perspectives members of a community can be modeled as potential offenders potential victims and potential guardians moving around and interacting in a socio-geographical space moving from these premises routine activity theory postulates that offenders and victims or targets usually meet during daily non-criminal activities brantingham and brantingham 1984  behavioral decisions then determine how the various agents react to each others presence and actions crime occurs in the context of the everyday routines as the three factors converge in space and time a motivated offender a victim or potential target and the absence of a capable guardian brantingham and brantingham 1984  nowadays many crime studies especially those on volume and urban crimes rely on ideas emerging from theories that focus on situations and opportunities as triggers of crime cohen and felson 1979 brantingham and brantingham 1981 birkbeck and lafree 1993 brantingham and brantingham 1995 clarke 1995 wortley et al 2008 clarke 2009  because of the strong attention these theories pose to ordinary interaction in the geographical and social space we also rely on them to formulate our hypotheses on the short-term impact of the 2019-ncov-related social distancing measures on march 4 th  six new cases of 2019-ncov were confirmed in los angeles county rising the total number of cases for the county up to seven following this the los angeles county board of supervisors and the department of public health declared a health emergency from that moment on the los angeles population had been invited to adopt simple social distancing strategies that limit their exposure to others-eg remaining home when sick-and to prepare for the possibility of more significant social distancing requirements it is march 16 th  when more stringent measures were adopted the county health officer prohibited all indoor and outdoor public and private events and gatherings within a confined space where fifty or more people are expected to attend at the same time to require social distancing measures and temporary closure of businesses where patrons stay in contact with each other for extended periods of time such as movie theaters gyms and fitness centers arcades bowling alleys bars and nightclubs that do not serve food on march 19 th  the california department of public health ordered all individuals living in california to stay at home county of los angeles 2020 all in all these measures cause people to spend more time at home and to loosen the density of social interactions accordingly crime opportunities and places where crimes occur are likely to change drastically from past observations and experiences in response to social distancing in the short run we can expect a contraction in most urban crimes as victim or target density reduces in many areas of the city angel 1968 we hypothesize crime reduction will be strong in crime generators areas which we intend as particular areas to which large numbers of people are attracted for reasons unrelated to any particular level of criminal motivation they might have or to any particular crime they might end up committing brantingham and brantingham 1995 p7  in los angeles typical examples might include the hollywood entertainment district the financial district with its high concentration of offices and the famous staple center also flows of people to some crime attractor areas are going to be reduced as people have to avoid concentrating in bars nightclubs or shopping malls but also in high-intensity drug trafficking and prostitution areas to various extents we foresee a reduction in the number of batteries assaults with deadly weapons homicides robberies burglaries shoplifting thefts and stolen vehicles as a consequence of a reduced interaction of people in the urban environment we hypothesize burglaries and shoplifting to reduce the most there is an extensive agreement over the fact that burglars prefer to target unoccupied homes mustaine 1997 shover 1991 tseloni et al 2002  people forced at home will guard their houses for longer hours minimizing their exposure to burglaries the reduction in the number of open shops and the limitations in the number of entrances-only a certain amount of people are allowed to be simultaneously in the shops depending on the premises square meters-reduce the opportunities for crime by simultaneously increasing the guardianship and reducing the exposure of targets to potential offenders conversely intimate partner assaults are likely to increase patriarchy and gender inequality are considered as the root causes of intimate partner violence yet situational determinants are also recognized to influence this form of crime wilkinson and hamerschlag 2005  as a consequence of the spread of 2019-ncov couples-including dysfunctional ones-spend more time together with reduced supervision of possible informal guardians as relatives and acquaintances two factors that may lead to an increase in violence hayes 2018  polices attention to urban crimes may reduce thus partially countering the crime mitigating effect driven by looser social interactions law enforcement agencies indeed are often required to enforce the emergency measures to contain the rapid spread of the virus in this respect it is paradigmatic the decision of the philadelphia police department which decided to delay arrests for several low-level criminal offenses due to the burden given by the 2019-ncov situation newall 2020 the reduction of police capabilities is likely to have an only marginal effect on intimate partner violence which are serious crimes that take place in a private environment we expect to observe a stronger impact of hard social distancing policies on these crimes compared to mild policies we consider mild the policies that have been implemented in the temporal window from march 4 th to march 16 th -from the declaration of health emergency to the implementation of more stringent measures of social distancing on march 16 th -and strict the policies that have been put in force in the temporal window from march 17 th to march 30 th -from the implementation of the more stringent measures of social distancing to the order to stay at home for all individuals living in california announced on march 19 th  evaluating the causal link and impact of certain policies is a crucial aspect of research and practice criminologists have long attempted to assess the extent to which public policies aimed at reducing crime are actually effective in pursuing their mission populated areas of research are the evaluation of measures aimed at reducing street crime anglin et al 1999  drug-and alcohol-related offenses strang et al 2012 humphreys et al 2013  police practices braga 2005 braga et al 2014 braga et al  2015  and gun violence ludwig and cook 2004  the gold standard for assessing the causal impact of a certain intervention is represented by randomized controlled trials rct rubin 1974  however this research design is often unfeasible due to issues related to financial costs ethics or practical obstacles eg complex regulatory requirements also in the context of this work it is impossible to imagine the possibility to design a meaningful and correct rct to evaluate the extent to which a 2019-ncov counter-policy would cause a change in criminal trends three main reasons explain this impossibility in the scope of our analysis first social distancing and self-isolation policies issued in los angeles apply to the entire city thus making impossible to define a setting in which we compare the trends across treated and non-treated precincts or neighborhoods second these policies are becoming universally applied to the entire country making it impossible to use other american cities as controls third even in the case in which only certain cities were affected by the restrictive measures it would be difficult to compare criminal trends across treated and non-treated cities due to the potentially high number of unobserved factors determining the underlying trends associated to the different contexts while pearl 2009 demonstrates that post-facto observational studies cannot provide any answer to the investigation of true causal inference due to the potential presence of confounding factors several quasi-experimental alternatives have been proposed to overcome the impossibility to run rct in certain scientific fields among these methods stands interrupted time series interrupted time series have gained popularity in sociology and criminology and they have been applied to several different research problems biglan et al 2000 humphreys et al 2013 pridemore et al 2013 pridemore et al  2014 humphreys et al 2017  this method allows to assess the effect of a certain policy analyzing the change in the level and slope of the time series after an intervention has been applied compared to the structure of the temporal dynamic before the intervention more recently however scientists have developed a framework for evaluating the causal influence of a certain intervention relying on bayesian statistics following this later evolution this work specifically investigates the effect of social distancing and related measures in the attempt to contain 2019-ncov on criminal trends in los angeles using bayesian structural time-series bsts models brodersen et al 2015  specifically we apply a method relying on diffusion-regression state-space which predicts a counterfactual trend in a synthetic control that would have occurred in a virtual scenario with no intervention thus in a scenario where no containment policies are promulgated this approach allows us to quantify the impact and statistical significance of a certain event on our variable of interest namely the number of crimes over time bsts are state-space models specifically defined by two equations the first ie the observation equation being where y t is a scalar observation z t is the d-dimensional output vector and  t  n 0  2 t  and  t is a scalar observation error with noise variance  t  the observation equation connects the observed data y t to a latent d-dimensional state vector  t  the second equation instead is the state equation which reads this second equation specifically governs the dynamic change of the state vector  t through time the inferential dimension in the model comprises three components first draws of the model parameters  and the state vector  given y 1n  ie the observed data in the training period are simulated second the model uses posterior simulations to simulate from p n1m  y 1n  which is the posterior predictive distribution with n1m as the counterfactual time series and y 1n as the observed time series before the intervention third using posterior predictive samples the model compute the posterior distribution of the point-wise impact y t  t for each time unit t to conduct our analysis we have first relied upon the los angeles open data portal these two additional datasets are used to include controls in our analyses as the literature has long found relationships between temperature and variation in crime trends cohn 1990 field 1992 and between festivities and holidays and criminal temporal clustering cohn and rotton 2003 towers et al 2018  as requested by the method these two covariates have not been affected by policies this is trivial in the case of average temperature while holidays may be affected in the future if restrictions will be prolonged for months it is worth noting that this method generally recommends using more than two controls to evaluate the effect of an intervention on the response time series however in our research design we assume that it is highly unlikely that any other daily predictor of crime in los angeles left out from this analysis has been influenced by the issued containment policies the decision to exploit time series spanning more than three years has been made to reduce the potential biases arising from the exclusion of hidden trend dynamics preserving the seasonality and long-term dependencies of crime as a complex social phenomenon  this section presents the results of the causal impact of the policy intervention starting on march 4 th per each offense type per each crime the same analytical structure is provided we run two different models the first one is a univariate model that only considers the time series of interest without controls the second model instead integrates two covariates as to control for spurious effects and unobservable dynamics as anticipated before these two covariates are the average daily temperature and the presenceabsence of a holiday for each time point furthermore we presented these two models for the time period up to march 16 th and up to march 28 th  2 these two post interventions time-windows enable us to obtain a more comprehensive and inherently dynamic description of the reality in fact given the progressive tightening of imposed restrictions avoiding a comparative analysis of the evolution of the effects over different weeks would somehow oversimplify and overly aggregate our statistical estimates conversely the possibility to observe the evolution of the effects help us in assessing the strength of a trend anticipating the likely developments and hopefully better explaining its behaviour framing it into our theories of reference in light of this in the first time period we are expecting to observe the effect of mild containment policies whereas in the second time period the effect of more stringent policies of social distancing figure 2 shows the time series of the considered crimes  an assault with a deadly weapon occurs when an individual attacks a victim through a physical attack conducted with a physical object other than a firearm that can seriously injure or even inflict dead depending on the circumstances assault with a deadly weapon can be considered either a felony or a misdemeanor the most common types of deadly weapons are for instance knives but also other objects can be classified as deadly like bottles bats hammers while generally hands and feet are not considered deadly to a statistically significant outcome and it is possible that this negative effect will show statistically significant results in the upcoming weeks although these two offenses are coded as a single one in the original database california assault law disciplined by penal code 240pc provides two distinct definitions for battery and assault a simple assault is the attempt to use force or violence against someone else while battery is the actual use of force or violence against one or more individuals results of the analyses are reported in table 4  table 3  the effect is not only non-significant posterior probability of a causal effect is 58 in the univariate case and 59 in the multivariate one but it also changes direction when the two models are compared conversely if we consider the introduction of more stringent measures of social distancing it is possible to observe a statistically significant reduction of this crime the models up to march 28 th show a relative effect of -11 in the univeriate model and of -76 in the multivariate one the posterior probability of a causal effect is respectively 98 and 96 indicating statistically significant outcomes for both models in california according to the penal code burglary is defined as the act of entering any structure room or locked vehicle with the intention to commit a theft or a felony furthermore an individual can be considered guilty of burglary even if the intended crime once entered is never been committed our initial hypothesis is that containment policies should have a clear impact on this crime category as people encouraged or forced to stay in their houses increase guardianship thus reducing the chance for an individual to enter a property without being noticed table 5 shows statistical results for burglary in spite of our hypothesis the policies to contain the spread of 2019-ncov have not yet produced any significant effect on burglaries similar to what happened for battery and simple assaults in the first time period considered the effects report diverging direction between the two models the univariate model shows an increase of 089 with respect to the predicted value in absence of an intervention while the multivariate displays an effect equal to -058 with posterior probabilities respectively being 56 and 50 the models run up to march 28 th show a statistically non-significant reduction of burglaries in the city with a higher posterior probability for both the univarate and the multivariate models respectively 80 and 91 compared to the previous time-frame analyzed it is likely that burglaries will be more affected by the stricter rules to fight the virus in the upcoming weeks and show a statistically significant reduction in the next future table 6 suggest that the policies adopted have not prompted any significant change in intimate partner assaults hitherto the models considering the period from march 4 th to march 16 th as period of intervention show non-significant negative effects -40 and -25 the univeariate model considering the entire period identifies a small non-significant negative effect -028 finally the multivariate model indicates an increase in intimate assaults due to the policies 33 yet such increase is not statistically significant the explanation behind the absence of a clear and significant signal in the post-intervention period may be connected to the fact that dynamics of this crime are complex and the forced cohabitation of partners is not an immediate trigger of violence within the household while in the case of shoplifting for example the closure of shops has a direct impact on the thefts within the shops themselves in the case of intimate partner violence the increase might be delayed once tensions intensify california penal code defines robbery as the act of taking personal property from someone else against the targeted victims will using force or fear robberies are classified as felonies table 7 provides the results of the statistical analysis related to robberies robbery shows a significant effect in the post-intervention period this applies to both the univariate and the multivariate cases for both the selected temporal windows in the univariate case the relative effect is estimated in a reduction of 24 in robberies with a cumulative total of 202 cases against a predicted 266 in a non-intervention scenario in the first time period and in a reduction of 21 with a cumulative total of 439 cases against a predicted 533 in a non-intervention scenario in the second time period in the multivariate case the effect is slightly reduced in both the time periods respectively -23 and -19  for the scope of the present work we have combined in the general category theft both petty thefts and grand thefts california penal code defines petty theft as the act of stealing or wrongfully taking an object belonging to someone else when the value of the property is equal to 950 or less grand theft instead represents a more serious offense and pertains acts in which the property has a value higher than 950 table 9 displays the outcomes of the analysis performed for thefts in line with what we have found for robbery and shoplifting thefts also appeared to be affected by the application of the 2019-ncov-related policy interventions all models show a reduction of thefts in the first period analyzed up to march 16 th  the models reported a 91 decrease in the univariate case significant at the 9667 level and a 96 reduction in the multivariate one significant at the 9833 in the second period considered up to march 28 th  the models estimated a 21 decrease in the univariate case significant at the 9965 level and a 25 reduction in the multivariate case significant at 9989 level theft robbery and shoplifting are offenses involving a direct act targeting a property thus making reasonable to think that a common underlying principles eg reduced opportunities increased guardianship govern the similar trends for these crimes table 9  causal impact analysis -thefts this category refers to two different offenses namely grand theft auto and the unlawful taking or driving of a vehicle the main difference between the two pertains the duration of the crime itself if for instance a person steals a car with the intent to keep it this is often considered grand theft auto conversely if the offender aims at using the car for a ride or in any case for a short timeframe the act is usually considered as the unlawful taking or driving of a vehicle in the former case the offense can be considered either a felony or a misdemeanor depending on the circumstances while in the latter the offense is generally classified as a misdemeanor table 11  causal impact analysis -homicides 2019-ncov containment policies do not show any statistically significant effect on homicides overall in none of the two selected temporal windows the model detects a sufficient statistically strong variation in the trend nonetheless compared to first batch of data-up to march 16 th - the last update seem to point in a two-fold direction first the relative effect has increased going from -15 and -10 in the univariate and multivariate models respectively to -28 and -24 second the posterior tail-area probability p has decreased thus increasing the posterior probability of a causal effect which went from 67 and 63 in the first batch of results to 86 and 80 while still non-significant these findings may suggest that the trends is moving towards a more stable reduction and future analyses may confirm this hypothesis while so far fluctuations hold a random nature it cannot be completely excluded that future data streams may highlight a statistically significant effect instead especially if the relative effect continues to increase klein et al 1991 meehan and ocarroll 1992 phillips 2012  the potential resulting disruption of 2019-ncov containment policies on the drug market may impact also on gang-related activities and in turn on systemic drug violence while these at this stage are pure speculations future works may investigate these dynamics finally we considered all reported crimes in the two selected temporal windows under analysis for the city of los angeles it is worth to note that this aggregated variable also accounts for all those offenses that go beyond the previous considered categories finally to facilitate the reading of the results and summarize the statistical outcomes of the models figure 3 displays the evolution of the post-intervention relative marginal effect in the two considered time periods for all crimes and model types cohen and felson 1979 and crime pattern theory brantingham and brantingham 1981  only mild policies were applied to the city of los angeles robbery has the largest decrease -23-24 depending on the statistical specifications followed by shoplifting -14-15 and thefts -91-96 overall crimes are also in decline -54-56 as partially showed also by poston 2020 these results are confirmed after stricter containment policies have been put in place as expected in most of the cases the reduction in crimes is larger the models considering the entire period up to march 28 th show a significant reduction for shoplifting -31-32 thefts -24-25 robberies -21-19 and for the overall crimes -15-14 in addition battery -11-76 is also starting to experience a significant decrease after the adoption of strict distancing policies contrarily assaults with a deadly weapon homicides burglaries intimate partner assaults and stolen vehicles do not report any significant effect some of these crimes burglaries or intimate partner assaults for example should be more effected by the order to stay at home-compared to soft recommendations so it is likely to hypothesize a possible statistically significant outcome in the near future for these crime categories in addition while there are crimes that are immediately affected by these policies eg shoplifting when shops close there might be other crimes that could show an increase or decrease in the medium run eg intimate partner violence in general what our models suggest is that more rational crimes seem at this point to be influenced by codiv19 containment policies to a higher extent compared to more complex and expressive offense categories the former set of crimes is directly influenced by the sensible reduction of social interactions and the sudden modification of daily habits ie shoplifting theft and robbery the latter categories instead may experience a stronger delay with smoother effects that cannot be captured in the short-term aftermath of a policy intervention ie homicide intimate partner violence and assaults with deadly weapon while situational crime prevention theories are extremely powerful in addressing the first class of criminal behaviors they are less effective in capturing the dynamics of more complex crimes and should therefore need to be integrated with broader set of theories hayward 2007  in this regard two potential concurring and complementary approaches that are potentially able to explain future emerging trends are the theory on crime precipitators wortley 2001  as complementary to the classic rational choice approach and the strain theory of crime agnew 1992  which could be critical in delineating explanation of emerging trends as a consequence of the sudden amplified cohabitation of stressors resulting from covid19 containment measures can play a role in reporting abuses paquin 1994 besides crime evolution as a product of the reduction of opportunities and the evolution of social life mental stress and fear of crime will also likely have a role in these dynamics given the strong scientific evidence on the negative psychological outcomes of quarantine brooks et al 2020  and the recent news showing a dramatic increase in the purchase of firearms in the united states oppel 2020 lee and chabria 2020  it is not unreasonable to expect anomalous peaks of violent crimes in the following weeks nonetheless analyses on the medium term should be conducted more carefully given that as time passes say in the order of weeks or months other factors will potentially become part of the explanation on the variation of crime trends depending on the social and economic policies that will be adopted among these are for instance impoverishment and unemployment the change of the socioeconomic context may reverberate on crime and on crime motivation thus calling for the integration of situational theories of crime with structural theories additional caution should be made in interpreting the results obtained as the extant criminological literature clearly demonstrates crime is clustered in time and space mean-ing that its geographical and temporal distribution is not random doran and lees 2005 grubesic and mack 2008 mohler et al 2011 weisburd 2015 haberman et al 2017  there are thus very few reasons to think that this patterned nature will change despite the containment measures that have been or will be issued our hypothesis which future work should systematically test is that changes in criminal trends are not uniform across different urban areas due to the different economic destination of the neighborhoods and because of their different social fabrics crime displacement is also likely to occur cornish and clarke 1987 guerette and bowers 2009  at least in response to the change in police routines and activities a further consideration involves potential alternative dynamics that cannot be shown by the set of crime categories chosen for this work in fact while research suggests that offenders just like any other individual will routinely visit the same areas eg activity space and are less likely to venture into unknown areas of equal opportunities birkbeck and lafree 1993  there could be several other types of crime exhibiting completely different dynamics in this broad set of offenses we hypothesize cyber-related and -mediated crimes frauds human smuggling and trafficking and organized crimerelated crimes alternative forms of criminal displacement as tactical-or perpetratordisplacement guerette and bowers 2009  could also occur as a result of new opportunities arising in the aftermath of a situation of emergency and high uncertainty also with respect to these crimes it has to be observed that short- medium- and long-term effects might be significantly different due to emerging needs by the population-eg the need for funds to save endangered businesses-and criminal adaptation capabilities-eg reorganization of drug dealing this work has underlined how 2019-ncov-containment policies have influenced criminal trends in the city of los angeles already in the first weeks after their introduction and has policy implications that should be kept in mind first studying criminal dynamics in this extraordinarily anomalous time could help in creating protective measures for the most vulnerable subjects influenced by these changes including homeless women and children homeless for instance could experience an increase in the likelihood of becoming victims of crimes as a consequence of lower guardianship and social control furthermore as people are forced to spend more time at home the probability of intimate partner violence could become extremely high research found that intimate partner violence is as prevalent in lesbian gay bisexual and transgender lgbt relationships as it is in heterosexual ones although modalities of intimate partner violence may differ ford et al 2013  for this reason and to safeguard all the citizens involved in this health crisis a systematic analysis of crime should also serve to the purpose of empowering remote contact points facilitating distance reporting to make it easier for victims of domestic violence and abuse to connect with the law enforcement agencies distance reporting for instance could include text messaging services to reduce the risk of being stopped or heard by the abusive member of the household second evidences showing an overall reduction of crimes should motivate the launch of campaigns aiming to dissuade citizens from arming themselves as they do not face an increased likelihood of being victimized public communication is a fundamental and critical resource especially in rare emergency situations and should be directed towards the dissuasion to buy arms in order to prevent 1 a likely more violent escalation of interpersonal violence and 2 the potentially lethal mix between weapon possession and psychological negative effects eg stress depressive syndrome emerging during quarantine and self-isolation finally as crime takes new forms and dynamics law enforcement agencies will be called to modify or re-define resource allocation for the new priorities the task especially in highly populated and extremely heterogeneous cities as los angeles can be herculean in fact while many police departments and law enforcement agencies in the us have tailored their actions based on predictive policing software these models can suddenly become of little help depending on the extent to which these policies will force crime to change beyond mere temporal trends predictive models built on millions of past observation may not be informative anymore this situation thus urges for alternative predictive tools that can take into account major disruptions of social life as the triggers of new criminal risks

there was not significant incorporation or discussion of the multiple factors that have an interdependent impact on how and where different levels of pollution are found this omission makes it difficult to demonstrate an explicit relationship between decreased air pollution and the stay-at-home orders both articles did not analyze or discuss such factors and believe have led to overstating and misleading scientific conclusions for example authors did not report that no2 and some other air pollutant concentrations tend to be lower in the spring and summer than in the fall and winter so it is normal to see air pollutant levels in april lower than in january february or march this is in line with other studies that have detected similar seasonal patterns in cabauw the netherlands and calcutta india demuzere et al 2009 mondal et al 2000  during cold seasons atmospheric stability as a result of frequent inversion layer that happens when the upper air layer is warmer than a lower one leads to the accumulation of pollutants tiwari et al 2015  here we provide a more robust examination of the multiple drivers of air pollution in any given period and plot the average weekly wind speed temperature and precipitation in new york city between february 1 and may 1 2020 to illustrate examples of the complexity of interactions between no2 and weather conditions figure 2  the covid-19 orders to stay at home and practice social distancing began in new york city on march 16 2020 an inverse relationship with wind speed with the concentration of no2 during this time period can easily be observed and can likely be explained by higher wind speed affecting the dispersal of the no2 concentration precipitation and temperature data also reveal inverse relationships with no2 especially during windy weather conditions figure 2 highlights two peaks of no2 concentration during the weeks started on february 22 before the lockdown and april 4 during the lockdown although the peak of april 4 is lower than february 22 the weather variables were not the same while the wind speed and precipitation rates were slightly different during the two weeks the temperature was significantly higher in the week of april 4 higher temperatures help accelerate the oxidization of no2 in the air and therefore lower the no2 concentration khoder 2002  additionally chemical interactions between different air pollutants including no2 particulate matter 25 microns sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide would help to understand the likely multiple drivers of observations of decreased urban air pollution during the covid-19 pandemic data presented in figure 2 were collected from the copernicus sentinel-5p satellite data which provides one of the most accurate satellite measurements of no2 to avoid underoverestimation of no2 we selected only those no2 retrievals for the clear sky for which cloud radiance fraction  10 this is an important procedure as clouds can bias measurements by obscuring the sensors view of the lower atmosphere affecting both air pollution and land surface temperature thus we demonstrate how these other rapidly published studies could be and should be improved weekly weather data shown here were collected from phase 2 of the north american land data assimilation system nldas-2 nldas-2 which provides hourly weather data and is a collaboration project among several groups in north america including nasa national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa princeton university and the university of washington from our analysis and review of the literature we find that it remains unclear to what extent social distancing policies and stay-at-home orders that impact human behavior have contributed to observations of improvement of environmental quality such as observed decreases in air pollution any study that claims that covid-19 social distancing policies or similar efforts to reduce the spread of the coronavirus had a significant impact on the environment must include more comprehensive and detailed research into multiple factors including at minimum weather variables and air quality regulations that may be as or more important to social distancing policies in explaining temporal changes in environmental quality funding this material was supported by a us national science foundation rapid project

determinants and impacts shenyang guo ruopeng an timothy mcbride d danlin yu linyun fu yuanyuan yang  background to combat the covid-19 pandemic in the united states many states and washington dc enacted stay-at-home order and nonpharmaceutical mitigation interventions this study examined the determinants of the timing to implement an intervention through an impact analysis the study explored the effects of the interventions and the potential risks of removing them under the context of reopening the economy method a content analysis identified nine types of mitigation interventions and the timing at which states enacted these strategies a proportional hazard model a multiple-event survival model and a random-effect spatial error panel model in conjunction with a robust method analyzing zero-inflated and skewed outcomes were employed in the data analysis  determinants of the implementation timing of mitigation strategies why did some states in the united states respond rapidly to the pandemic while others did not of various determinants we are primarily concerned with the prevalence rate of the confirmed cases vis--vis the time when each mitigation strategy was enacted delay in taking intervention actions during this period may directly affect the speed and scope of the covid-19 spread the second question focuses on the correlations between the timing of enacting mitigation and the serial incidence of covid-19 cases and deaths for this preliminary assessment of the impact of mitigation interventions the observational window was extended to 4152020 the impact study aims to address a key question is an initial response observed precisely during this period many states had begun to reopen their economies and public life by may 11 32 states chose to do so 6 in light of these decisions the purpose of this paper is to explore the initial impact of nonpharmaceutical mitigation interventions in the event that re-opening the economy is associated with a second wave of covid-19 disease and a second round of mitigation becomes necessary in this study we define the enactment of social distancing strategies as the exact hour at which a mitigation intervention was implemented as stipulated by state government documents the study window is defined as the period from the time when a national emergency was declared to the time when the last enacting state issued a stay-at-home order more precisely the zero hour for this study is 12 pm march 13 us eastern time and the ending hour is 6 pm april 7 which is one hour after the last enacting state ie south carolina implemented its stay-at-home order 5 pm april 7 us eastern time states declined to issue a mitigation order are considered censored at 6 pm on april 7 2020 within this 2525-day or 606-hour window we study not only whether a state enacted mitigation interventions but also the exact times at which these interventions were implemented the timing of the national emergency is a natural starting point for the study because before that date none of the migration strategies was enacted in the united states a special caveat should be put on the word zero it does not mean that the covid-19 pandemic started at that point because as anderson et al pointed out most countries are likely to have spread of covid-19 at least in the early stages before any mitigation measures have an impact 6 qualitative content analysis was used to analyze large quantities of text data from governmental documents we examined all relevant documents a total of 1470 executive orders pertinent to the social distancing orders from the state-government websites for all 50 states and washington dc a content-codinganalysis 7 was performed by two researchers review and coding guidelines were developed in advance the two reviewers separately examined all documents and resolved discrepancies in coding by consensus in a discussion considering variation across states in the frequency of use of alternative social distancing strategies and prior literature on social distancing we extracted information on 9 types of the mitigation interventions stay-at-home order strengthened stay-at-home order public school closure all school closure large-gathering ban of more than 10 people any gathering ban restaurantbar limit to dining out only non-essential business closure and mandatory self-quarantine of travelers the exact timing to implement each of these 9 nonpharmaceutical interventions ie the hour when a specific strategy was implemented was recorded a state that did not enact a particular intervention by the end of the study window ie 6 pm april 7 was considered censored for that strategy and was coded as having the longest time of 606 hours on length of time it took to enact the measure censoring under the current setting refers to the fact that the event of interest did not occur by the end of the study window but might occur in future the theoretical model guiding the selection of potential determinants for inclusion in our models of social distancing orders is the social determinants of health sdoh framework 8 originally developed by who the framework emphasizes the strong relationship between societal factors and health outcomes especially crucial activities needed to close gaps and inequalities in health care concerning socioeconomic status gender traditionculture and raceethnicity to adapt this framework for the us the national academies of science engineering and medicine organized a special group to further articulate strategies for integrating social care into the delivery of health care to improve the nations health report of the academies was published on september 25 2019 immediately following its publication a congressional briefing was convened to discuss the implementation of sdoh-related strategies 9 the academies report underscores five key health care activities to better address the sdoh and integrate social care with health care awareness adjustment assistance alignment and advocacy these activities help us to identify important variables for the determinant study all rights reserved no reuse allowed without

based on the available census data and other published statistics we identified the following five blocks of state-level variables for inclusion as potential determinants in modeling social distance orders demographic characteristics economic well-being information public heath infrastructure information related to politics and international connectivity to measure state governmental awareness of the covid-19 we included in the study a time-varying covariate of cumulative covid-19 cases per 10000 population one-day before the time when a mitigation strategy was enacted this measure is analogous to the prevalence rate of covid-19 disease to explore the impacts of mitigation interventions we conducted statistical analyses that link the timing of each mitigation order to various case counts of covid-19 this is a correlational rather than causal analysis due to lacking an accurate or even a proxy estimate of counterfactual a counterfactual in the current setting refers to what would have happened had we not enacted a mitigation strategy the outcome data come from johns hopkins university coronavirus data stream that combines who and cdc case data 10 based on the original input data we employed 9 variables in the investigation cumulative cases cumulative deaths new cases new deaths cumulative cases per 10000 population cumulative deaths per 10000 population cumulative new cases per 10000 population cumulative new deaths per 10000 population and death rate defined as the number of cumulative deaths divided by the number of cumulative cases these measures are computed as of the time of this study and may underestimate the actual cases and deaths the study employed daily counts on each of the 9 outcome measures from march 11 two days before the national emergency was declared to april 15 about one week after the last state enacted the stay-at-home order the analysis of determinants of each mitigation strategy employed a proportional hazards model 11 12 the analysis of overall determinants pulled together all nine episodes of mitigation interventions and employed the wlw model this model is designated by the first initials of the developers last name 13 14 the wlw model is a robust approach developed to control for the autocorrelations of study events under the framework of cox proportional hazards model the hazard function for the i th state to enact the k th type of mitigation intervention is expressed as   1     denotes the covariate vector for the i th state with respect to the k th type of order 0   with   1    is the unspecified

the overall model probably due to the inclusion of other predictors given that the doubling time and related serial interval of covid-19 are short ie 44-75 days taking mitigating actions within a short period is crucial states that experienced less disease responded in a faster fashion this finding helps explain why new case counts of covid-19 in the united states remained high for a longer period than other developed economies globally the finding suggests that even following the national emergency declaration some states did not react and missed the opportunity to prevent the spread of covid-19 to better understand the effect of prevalence rate on the timing of enacting mitigation interventions we present the model-based predictions of survival curves for all eight models and descriptive figures in figure 2  fig 21 shows the survival functions which in the current setting indicates the proportion of states that did not enact certain measure at a given time as such the bottom survival line indicates the fastest speed to enact while the top survival line indicates the slowest the figures indicate that states with high prevalence rates enacted the mitigation measures slowly fig 22 shows prevalence rates of covid-19 cases at the time one day before each mitigation intervention was enacted states on the x-axis are ordered by the timing of the enactment with the state closer to the origin enacted earlier as all figures clearly show states issued later ie those on the right-hand side had high covid-19 cases per 10000 population ie high bars indicating that the higher the prevalence rate the slower the speed moving to the enactment this pattern applies to all mitigation measures in summary the covid-19 prevalence rate population size unemployment the proportion of uninsured poverty level of economic development proportion of minority people and public health infrastructure are the key determinants affecting the timing to enact nonpharmaceutical mitigation interventions table 3 presents the results of the exploratory impact study we conducted onetailed tests on all coefficients because based on a strong theoretical justification we

intervention period to date the united states continues to experience high levels of covid-19 disease this study offers two observations that may help explain why this is the case one is that some states may have missed optimal timing to implement social distancing based on prior research during epidemics it is important to implement social distancing swiftly the key is not whether such measures should be taken but when the second is that in the short run of 5 weeks mitigation interventions should be expected to have only limited effects on slowing down the spread of disease of nine

selfquarantine of travelers are important but perhaps -in the early stages of trying to control a highly infectious disease -are not as important as the large-gathering ban of more than 10 people non-essential business closure and restaurantbar limits these three restrictions focus on avoiding large gatherings and interacting crowds observing an effect from other mitigation strategies may require more time school closures for example may take a longer time to demonstrate an effect because in this epidemic young people appear to have been less affected and they were more likely to be asymptomatic second staying at home may not reduce new disease if home is a collective such as a long term care facility and if exposure occurs in home settings in this regard very quick tracing may

notwithstanding applying advanced technology using big data and mobilizing digital tools to better target health care system resources is recommended by the national academies 9 thirdly during the study window many us policymakers and officials considered reopening the economy by removing some or all mitigation interventions as of may 11 or about three weeks after the study window was closed 32 states did so 6 our exploratory findings suggest that at least three mitigation strategies were having an effect at that time because there is no preventive vaccine and because there are few potentially effective treatments recent reductions in new cases and deaths must be due in large part to the social interventions delivered by states the removal of these social interventions in the absence of effective pharmaceutical interventions carries a high risk for a relapse finally it is worth noting that this analysis is based on the decisions made by governors at the state level so may imprecisely measure the exact variation of impacts across the us since in many cases social distancing policies were implemented at the substate level eg counties at different periods reflecting different mitigation strategies and leading to different outcomes the unprecedented implementation of social distancing is projected to cost at least 2 trillion us dollars on march 27 an over 2 trillion economic relief package the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act was passed by congress with bipartisan support and it was signed into law by president trump 20 social distancing interventions are also associated with a large number of job losses in the seven weeks ending may 2 335 million people made initial claims for unemployment in the us a record number of unemployment claims the official unemployment rate reached 147 in april the highest rates observed since the great depression 21 undoubtedly policymakers are facing a tough decision how to balance

carefully the pros and cons of lifting the mitigations given that these measures were already associated with a huge cost and economic resources  the correction of a non-normal outcome variable with inverse-normal transformation results show that the inverse-normal transformation method appropriately transformed the zero-inflated and skewed outcome into a normally distributed variable fig s1 shows an example  findings of the predictor of covid-19 cases per 10000 population or the prevalence rate are contradictory to our hypothesis states with a lower prevalence of covid-19 cases per 10000 population reacted more quickly to the outbreak to ensure that this pattern did exist we conducted several sensitivity analyses we first replaced this variable with the growth rate of covid-19 cases per 10000 population from five days ago to one day ago in conjunction with the case count five days ago we tested both the linear growth rate and exponential grown rate the analysis was performed on all eight mitigation measures results from these analyses confirmed that states with high prevalence rates enacted mitigation strategies slowly surprisingly the results from table 3 seem to suggest that the stay-at-home order does not have significant impact on any of the nine outcome variables we suspect that the stay-at-home order does not necessarily confine people from contacting one another since the order is more like the opposite of go-to-work the stay-at-home order hence might not be a good measure for social distancing as was intended while the order was issued most will simply not go to work but gather as they would do after work the three significant factors that are found in the four models non-essential business closure large-gathering ban restaurantbar limit are probably the real measures for social distancing we experimented with the same random effect spatial error panel models but removed the three significant predictors the modified models still suggest that the stay-at-home order does not have a significant impact on any of the outcome variables these results suggest that social distancing strategy indeed works against the spread of covid19 while stay-at-home order was initially thought as a means for social distancing it fails to achieve real social distancing nationwide in addition the timing of when the stay-at-home order was issued also suggests a spatial clustering pattern figure 1  a spatial autocorrelation test of the timing when the stay-at-home order was issued produces a morans i of 0348 with a p-value  000024 using the soi spatial configuration the test suggests that the timing of issuing stay-at-home order might have a clear spatial clustering trend in which one state is more likely to enact the stay-at-home order if its neighbors are enacting the order and vice versa all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by peer review is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license

profiling at the times of covid-19 massimo stella valerio restocchi simon de deyne  the covid-19 pandemic forced countries all over the world to take unprecedented measures like nationwide lockdowns to adequately understand the emotional and social repercussions a large-scale reconstruction of how people perceived these unexpected events is necessary but currently missing we address this gap through social media by introducing mercurial multi-layer co-occurrence networks for emotional profiling a framework which exploits linguistic networks of words and hashtags to reconstruct social discourse describing real-world events we use mercurial to analyse 101767 tweets from italy the first country to react to the covid-19 threat with a nationwide lockdown the data were collected between 11th and 17th march immediately after the announcement of the italian lockdown and the who declaring covid-19 a pandemic our analysis provides unique insights into the psychological burden of this crisis focussing on i the italian official campaign for self-quarantine iorestoacasa ii national lockdown italylockdown and iii social denounce sciacalli our exploration unveils evidence for the emergence of complex emotional profiles where anger and fear towards political debates and socio-economic repercussions coexisted with trust solidarity and hope related to the institutions and local communities we discuss our findings in relation to mental well-being issues and coping mechanisms like instigation to violence grieving and solidarity we argue that our framework represents an innovative thermometer of emotional status a powerful tool for policy makers to quickly gauge feelings in massive audiences and devise appropriate responses based on cognitive data  the stunningly quick spread of the covid-19 pandemic catalysed the attention of worldwide audiences overwhelming individuals with a deluge of often contrasting content about the severity of the disease the uncertainty of its transmission mechanisms and the asperity of the measures taken by most countries to fight it 1 2 3 4  although these policies have been seen as necessary they had a tremendous impact on the mental well-being of large populations 5 for a number of reasons due to lockdowns many are facing financial uncertainty having lost or being on the verge of losing their source of income moreover there is much concern about the disease itself and most people fear for their own health and that of their loved ones 6  further fueled by infodemics 2 3 1  finally additional distress is caused by the inability of maintaining a normal life 7  the extent of the impact of these factors is such that in countries greatly struck by covid-19 such as china the population started to develop symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder 8  during this time more than ever people have shared their emotions on social media these platforms provide an excellent emotional thermometer of the population and have been widely explored in previous studies investigating how online social dynamics promote or hamper content diffusion 2 9 1 10 11 and the adoption of specific positivenegative attitudes and behaviours 9 12 13  building on the above evidence our goal is to draw a comprehensive quantitative picture of peoples emotional profiles emerging during the covid-19 crisis through a cognitive analysis of online social discourse we achieve this by introducing mercurial multi-layer co-occurrence networks for emotional profiling a framework that combines cognitive network science 14 15 16 with computational social sciences 9 12 2 17 18  before outlining the methods and main contributions of our approach we briefly review existing research on understanding emotions in social media much of the research on emotions in social media has been consolidated into two themes on the one hand there is the data science approach which mostly focused over large-scale positivenegative sentiment detection 9 and recently identified the relevance of tracing more complex affect patterns for understanding social dynamics 19 20 21 16  on the other hand cognitive science research makes use of small-scale analysis tools but explores the observed phenomena in much more detail in the light of its theoretical foundations 22 23 24  specifically in cognitive science the massive spread of semantic and emotional information through verbal communication represent long-studied phenomena known as cognitive contagion 24 and emotional contagion 24 25 23  respectively this research suggests that ideas are composed of a cognitive component and an emotional content much alike viruses containing the genomic information necessary for their replication 1  both these types of contagion happen when an individual is affected in their behaviour by an idea emotions elicited by ideas can influence users behaviour without their awareness resulting in the emergence of specific behavioural patterns such as implicit biases 23  unlike pathogen transmission no direct contact is necessary for cognitive and emotional contagion to take place since both are driven by information processing and diffusion like it happens through social media 26 27  in particular during large-scale events ripples of emotions can rapidly spread across information systems 27 and have dramatic effects as it has recently been demonstrated in elections and social movements 28 12 25  at the intersection of data-and cognitive science is emotional profiling a set of techniques which enables the reconstruction of how concepts are emotionally perceived and assembled in usergenerated content 17 18 9 19 15 29  emotional profiling conveys information about basic affective dimensions such how positivenegative or how arousing a message is and also includes the analysis of more fine-grained emotions such as fear or trust that might be associated with the lockdown and peoples hopes for the future 9 30 22  recently an emerging important line of research has shown that reconstructing the knowledge embedded in messages through social and information network models 31 14 32 successfully highlight important phenomena in a number of contexts ranging from the diffusion of hate speech during massive voting events 12 to reconstructing personality traits from social media 17  importantly to reconstruct knowledge embedded in tweets recent work has successfully merged data science and cognitive science introducing linguistic networks of co-occurrence relationships between words in sentences 16 33 21 and between hashtags in tweets 12  however an important shortfall of these works is that these two types of networked knowledge representations were not merged together thus missing on the important information revealed by studying their interdependence we identify three important contributions that distinguish our paper from previous literature and make a further step towards consolidating cognitive network science 14 as a paradigm suitable to analyse peoples emotions first we introduce a new framework exploiting the interdependence between hashtags and words addressing the gap previously discussed this framework multi-layer co-occurrence networks for emotional profiling mercurial combines both the semantic structure encoded through the co-occurrence of hashtags and the textual message to construct a multi-layer lexical network 34  this multi-layer network structure allows us to contextualise hashtags and therefore improve the analysis of their meaning importantly these networks can be used to identify which concepts or words contribute to different emotions and how central they are second in contrast to previous work which largely revolved around english tweets 4 20  the current study focusses on italian twitter messages there are several reasons why the emotional response of italians is particularly interesting specifically i italy was the first western country to experience a vast number of covid-19 clusters ii the italian government was the first to declare a national lockdown 1  iii the italian lockdown was announced on 10th march one day before the world health organization who declared the pandemic status of covid-19 this enables us to address the urgent need of measuring the emotional perceptions and reactions to social distancing lockdown and more generally the covid-19 pandemic third thanks to mercurial we obtain richer and more complex emotional profiles that we analyse through the lens of established psychological theories of emotion this is a fundamental step in going beyond positiveneutralnegative sentiment and to provide accurate insights on the mental well-being of a population to this end we take into account three of the most trending hashtags iorestoacasa english i stay at home sciacalli english jackals and italylockdown as representative of positive negative and neutral social discourse respectively we use these hashtags as a starting point to build multi-layer networks of word and hashtag co-occurrence from which we derive our profiles our results depict a complex map of emotions suggesting that there is co-existence and polarisation of conflicting emotional states importantly fear and trust towards the lockdown and social distancing the combination of these emotions further explored through semantic network analysis indicates mournful submission and acceptance towards the lockdown perceived as a measure for preventing contagion but with negative implications over economy as further evidence of the complexity of the emotional response to the crisis we also find strong signals of hope and social bonding mainly in relation to social flash mobs and interpreted here as psychological responses to deal with the distress caused by the threat of the pandemic the paper is organised as follows in the methods section we describe the data we used to perform our analysis and describe mercurial in detail in the results section we present the emotional profiles obtained from our data which are then discussed in more detail in the section discussion finally the last section highlights the psychological implications of our exploratory investigation and its potential for follow-up monitoring of covid-19 perceptions in synergy with other datasetsapproaches we argue that our findings represent an important first step towards monitoring both mental well-being and emotional responses in real time offering policy-makers a framework to make timely data-informed decisions in this section we describe the methodology employed to collect our data and perform the emotional profiling analysis first we describe the dataset and how it was retrieved then we introduce cooccurrence networks and specifically our novel method that combines hasthag co-occurrence with word co-occurrence on multi-layer networks finally we describe the cognitive science framework we used to perform the emotional profiling analysis on the so-obtained networks we gathered 101767 tweets in italian to monitor how online users perceived the covid-19 pandemic and its repercussions in italy these tweets were gathered by crawling messages containing three trending hashtags of relevance for the covid-19 outbreak in italy and expressing three different sentiment polarities  iorestoacasa english i stay at home a positive-sentiment hashtag introduced by the italian government in order to promote a responsible attitude during the lockdown  sciacalli english jackals a negative sentiment hashtag used by online users in order to address unfair behaviour rising during the health emergency  italylockdown a neutral sentiment hashtag indicating the application of lockdown measures all over italy we refer to iorestoacasa sciacalli and italylockdown as focal hashtags to distinguish them from other hashtags we collected the tweets through complex science consulting complexconsult which was authorised by twitter and used the serviceconnect crawler implemented in mathematica 113 the collection of tweets comprises 39943 tweets for iorestoacasa 26999 for sciacalli and 34825 for italylockdown retweets of the same text message were not considered for each tweet the language was detected pictures links and non-italian content was discarded and stopwords ie words without intrinsic meaning such as di english of and ma english but removed other interesting datasets with tweets about covid-19 are available in 35 20  word co-occurrence networks have been successfully used to characterise a wide variety of phenomena related to language acquisition and processing 16 36 37  recently researchers have also used hashtags to investigate various aspects of social discourse for instance stella et al 12 showed that hashtag co-occurrence networks were able to characterise important differences in the social discourses promoted by opposing social groups during the catalan referendum in this work we introduce mercurial multi-layer co-occurrence networks for emotional profiling a framework combining  hashtag co-occurrence networks or hashtag networks 12  nodes represent hashtags and links indicate the co-occurrence of any two nodes in the same tweet  word co-occurrence networks or word networks 16  nodes represent words and links represent the co-occurrence of any two words one after the other in a tweet without stop-words ie words without an intrinsic meaning we combine these two types of networks in a multi-layer network to exploit the interdependence between hashtags and words this new resulting network enables us to contextualise hashtags and capture their real meaning through context thereby enhancing the accuracy of the emerging emotional profile to build the multi-layer network we first build the single hashtag and word layers for sake of simplicity word networks are unweighted and undirected 2  note that the hashtag network was kept at a distinct level from word networks eg common words were not explicitly linked with hashtags as reported in figure 1  each co-occurrence link between any two hashtags a and b coronavirus and restiamoacasa in the figure is relative to a word network including all words co-occurring in all tweets featuring hashtags a and b the hashtag and word networks capture the co-occurrence of lexical entities within the structured online social discourse words possess meaning in language 31 and their network assembly is evidently a linguistic network similar to words in natural language hashtags possess linguistic features that express a specific meaning and convey rich affect patterns 12  the resulting networks capture the meaning of a collection of tweets by identifying which wordshashtags co-occurred together this knowledge embedded in hashtag networks was used in order to identify the most relevant or central terms associated within a given collection of thematic tweets rather than using frequency to indicate centrality which makes it difficult to compare hashtags that do not co-occur in the same message the current work relies on distance-based measures to detect how central a hashtag is in the network the first measure that implements this notion is closeness centrality closeness ci identifies how many links connect i to all its neighbours and is formalised as follows where d ij is the network distance between i and j ie the smallest amount of links connecting nodes i and j in co-occurrence networks nodes ie hashtags and words with a higher closeness tend to co-occur more often with each other or with other relevant nodes at short network distance we expect that rankings of closeness centrality will reveal the most central hashtags in the networks for iorestoacasa sciacalli and italylockdown in line with previous work in which closeness centrality was used to measure language acquisition and processing 39 14 32  importantly closeness is a more comprehensive approach compared to the simpler frequency analysis imagine a collection of hashtags a b c d  computing the frequency of hashtag figure 1  top example of co-occurrence networks for different hashtags distantimauniti english distant but united in iorestoacasa on the left incapaci english inept in sciacalli in the middle and futuro english future in italylockdown on the right clusters of co-occurring hashtags were obtained through spectral clustering 38  these clusters highlight the co-occurrence of european-focused content featuring hashtags like bce ie european central bank lagarde and spread ie spread between italian and german bonds together with social distance practices related to iorestoacasa bottom in mercurial any link in a co-occurrence network of hashtags left corresponds to a collection of tweets whose words co-occur according to a word network right larger words have a higher closeness centrality a co-occurring with hashtag b is informative about the frequency of the so-called 2-grams ab or ba but it does not consider how those hashtags co-occur with c d etc in other words a 2-gram captures the co-occurrence of two specific hashtags within tweets but does not provide the simultaneous structure of co-occurrences of all hashtags across tweets for which a network of pairwise co-occurrences is required on such a network closeness can then highlight hashtags at short distance from all others ie co-occurring in a number of contexts in the featured discourse in addition to closeness we also use graph distance entropy to measure centrality this centrality measure captures which hashtags are uniformly closer to all other hashtags in a connected network combining closeness with graph distance entropy led to successfully identifying words of relevance in conceptual networks with a few hundreds of nodes 32  the main idea behind graph distance entropy is that it provides info about the spread of the distribution of network distances between nodes ie shortest path a statistical quantity that cannot be extracted from closeness which is conversely a mean inverse distance considering the set d i  d i1   d ij   d in  of distances between i and any other node j connected to it 1  j  n  and m i  m axd i  then graph distance entropy is defined as where p k is the probability of finding a distance equal to k therefore hi is a shannon entropy of distances and it ranges between 0 and 1 in general the lower the entropy the more a node resembles a star centre 34 and is at equal distances from all other nodes thus nodes with a lower hi and a higher closeness are more uniformly close to all other connected nodes in a network words with simultaneously low graph distance entropy and high closeness were found to be prominent words for early word learning 34 and mindset characterisation 32  in addition to hashtag networks we also build word networks obtained from a collection of tweets containing any combination of the focal hashtags iorestocasa or sciacalli and coronavirus for all tweets containing a given set of hashtags we performed the following 1 subdivide the tweet in sentences and delete all stop-words from each sentence preserving the original ordering of words 2 stem all the remaining words ie identify the root or stem composing a given word in a language such as italian in which there is a number of ways of adding suffixes to words word stemming is essential in order to recognise the same word even when it is inflected for different gender number or as a verb tense for instance abbandoneremo we will abandon and abbandono abandon abandonment both represent the same stem abband 3 draw links between a stemmed word and its subsequent one store the resulting edge list of word co-occurrences 4 sentences containing a negation ie not underwent an additional step parsing their syntactic structure this was done in order to identify the target of negation eg in this is not peace the negation refers to peace syntactic dependencies were not used for network construction but intervened in emotional profiling instead see below the resulting word network also captures syntactic dependencies between words 16 related by online users to a specific hashtag or combination of hashtag we used closeness centrality to detect the relevance of words for a given hashtag text pre-processing such as word stemming and syntactic dependencies was performed using mathematica 113 which was also used to extract networks and compute network metrics the presence of hashtags in word networks provided a way of linking words which express common language with hashtags which express content but also summarise the topic of a tweet consequently by using this new approach the meaning attributed by users to hashtags can be inferred not only from hashtag co-occurrence but also from word networks an example of mercu-rial featuring hashtag-hashtag and word-word co-occurrences is reported in figure 1 bottom in this example hashtags coronavirus and restiamoacasa co-occurred together left in tweets featuring many co-occurring words right the resulting word network shows relevant concepts such as incoraggiamenti english encouragement and problemi english problems highlighting a positive attitude towards facing problems related to the pandemic more in general the attribution and reconstruction of such meaning was explored by considering conceptual relevance and emotional profiling in one or several word networks related to a given region of a hashtag co-occurrence network as a first data source for emotional profiling this work also used valence and arousal data from warriner and colleagues 40  whose combination can reconstruct emotional states according to the well-studied circumplex model of affect 41 30  in psycholinguistics word valence expresses how positivelynegatively a concept is perceived equivalently to sentiment in computer science the second dimension arousal indicates the alertness or lethargy inspired by a concept having a high arousal and valence indicates excitement and joy whereas a negative valence combined with a high arousal can result in anxiety and alarm 30  finally some studies also include dominance or potency as a measure of the degree of control experienced 40  however for reasons of conciseness we focus on the two primary dimensions of affect valence and arousal going beyond the standard positivenegativeneutral sentiment intensity is of utmost importance for characterising the overall online perception of massive events 9  beyond the primary affective dimension of sentiment the affect associated with current events 12 can also be described in terms of arousal 42 and of basic emotions such as fear disgust anger trust joy surprise sadness and anticipation these emotions represent basic building blocks of many complex emotional states 23  and they are all self-explanatory except for anticipation which indicates a projection into future events 18  whereas fear disgust and anger trust and joy elicit negative positive feedback surprise sadness and anticipation have been recently evaluated as neutral emotions including both positive and negative feedback reactions to events in the external world 43  to attribute emotions to individual words we use the nrc lexicon 18 and the circumplex model 30  these two approaches allow us to quantify the emotional profile of a set of words related to hashtags or combinations of hashtags the nrc lexicon enlists words eliciting a given emotion the circumplex model attributes valence and arousal scores to words which in turn determine their closest emotional states because datasets of similar size were not available for italian the data from the nrc lexicon and the warriner norms were translated from english to italian using a forward consensus translation of google translate microsoft bing and deepl translator which was successfully used in previous investigations with italian 44  although the valence of some concepts might change across languages 40  word stemming related several scores to the same stem eg scores for studio english study and studiare english to study were averaged together and the average attributed to the stem root stud in this way even if non-systematic cross-language valence shifting introduced inaccuracy in the score for one word eg studiare averaging over other words relative to the same stem reduced the influence of such inaccuracy no statistically significant difference   005 was found between the emotional profiles of 200 italian tweets including 896 different stems and their automatic translations in english holding for each dimension separately z-scores  196 then we build emotional profiles by considering the distribution of words eliciting a given emotionvalencearousal and associated to specific hashtags in tweets assertive tweets with no negation were evaluated directly through a bag of words model ie by directly considering the words composing them tweets including negations underwent an additional intermediate step where words syntactically linked to the negation were substituted with their antonyms 45 and then evaluated source-target syntactic dependencies were computed in mathematica 113 and all words targeted by a negation word ie no non and nessuno in italian underwent the substitution with their antonyms to determine whether the observed emotional intensity ri of a given emotion in a set s of words was compatible with random expectation we perform a statistical test z-test using the nrc dataset remember that emotional intensity here was measured in terms of richness or count of words eliciting a given emotion in a given network as a null model we use random samples as follows let us denote by m the number of words stemmed from s that are also in the nrc dataset then m words from the nrc lexicon are sampled uniformly at random and their emotional profile is compared against that of the empirical sample we repeated this random sampling 1000 times for each single empirical observed emotional profile ri i  to ensure the resulting profiles are indeed compatible with a gaussian distribution we performed a kolmogorov-smirnov test   005 all the tests we performed gave random distributions of emotional intensities compatible with a gaussian distribution characterised by a mean random intensity for emotion i r  i and a standard deviation   i for each emotion a z-score was computed in the remainder of the manuscript every emotional profile incompatible with random expectation was highlighted in black or marked with a check since we used a two-tailed z-test with a significance level of 005 this means that an emotional richness can either be higher or lower than random expectation the investigated corpus of tweets represents a complex multilevel system where conceptual knowledge and emotional perceptions are entwined on a number of levels tweets are made of text and include words which convey meaning 31  from the analysis of word networks we can obtain information on the organisation of knowledge proper of social media users which is embedded in their generated content 16  however tweets also convey meaning through the use of hashtags which can either refer to specific words or point to the overall topic of the whole tweet both words and hashtags can evoke emotions in different contexts thus giving rise to complex patterns 17  similar to words in natural language the same hashtags can be perceived and used in language differently by different users according to the context the simultaneous presence of word-and hashtag-occurrences in tweets is representative of the knowledge shared by social media users when conveying specific content and ideas this interconnected representation of knowledge can be exploited by simultaneously considering both hashtag-level and word-level information since words specify the meaning attributed to hashtags in this section we use mercurial to analyse the data collected we do so by characterising the hashtag networks both in terms of meaning and emotional profiles precedence is given to hashtags as they not only convey meaning as individual linguistic units but also represent more general-level topics characterising the online discourse then we inter-relate hashtag networks with word networks finally we perform the emotional profiling of hashtags in specific contexts the combination of word-and hashtag-networks specifies the perceptions embedded by online users around the same entities eg coronavirus in social discourses coming from different contexts the largest connected components of the three hashtag networks included 1000 hashtags and 8923 links for italylockdown 720 hashtags and 5915 links for sciacalli 6665 hashtags and 53395 links for italylockdown all three networks are found to be highly clustered mean local clustering coefficient 38 of 082 and with an average distance between any two hashtags of 21 only 126 hashtags were present in all the three networks table 1 reports the most central hashtags included in each corpus of tweets thematically revolving around iorestoacasa sciacalli and italylockdown the ranking relies on closeness centrality which in here quantifies the tendency for hashtags to co-occur with other hashtags expressing analogous concepts and therefore are at short network distance from each other see methods hence hashtags with a higher closeness centrality represent the prominent concepts in the social discourse this result is similar to those showing that closeness centrality captures concepts which are relevant for early word acquisition 39 and production 46 in language additional evidence that closeness can capture semantically central concepts is represented by the closeness ranking which assigns top-ranked positions to coronavirus and covid-19 in all three twitter corpora this is a consequence of the corpora being about the covid-19 outbreak and of the network metric being able to capture semantic relevance in the hashtag network built around italylockdown the most central hashtags are relative to the coronavirus including a mix of negative hashtags such as pandemia english pandemic and positive ones such as italystaystrong similarly the hashtag network built around sciacalli highlighted both positive facciamorete english lets network and negative irresponsabili -english irresponsible hashtags however the social discourse around sciacalli also featured prominent hashtags from politics including references to specific italian politicians to the italian government and hashtags expressing protest and shame towards the acts of a prominent italian politician conversely the social discourse around iorestoacasa included many positive hashtags eliciting hope for a better future and the need to act responsibly eg andratuttobene -english everything will be fine or restiamoacasa -english lets stay at home the most prominent hashtags in each network cf table 1  indicate the prevalence of a positive social discourse around iostoacasa and the percolation of strong political debate in relation to the negative topics conveyed by sciacalli however we want to extend these punctual observations of negativepositive valences of single hashtags to the overall global networks to achieve this we use emotional profiling hashtags can be composed of individual or multiple words by extracting individual words from the hashtags of a given network it is possible to reconstruct the emotional profile of the social discourse around the focal hashtags sciacalli italylockdown and iorestoacasa we tackle this by using the emotion-based 18 and the dimension based 30 emotional profiles see methods the emotional profiles of hashtags featured in co-occurrence networks are reported in figure  2 top the top section of the figure represents perceived valence and arousal represented as a circumplex model of affect 30  this 2d space or disk is called emotional circumplex and its coordinates represent emotional states that are well-supported by empirical behavioural data and brain research 30  as explained also in the figure caption each word is endowed with an x y table 1  top-ranked hashtags in co-occurrence networks based on closeness centrality higher ranked hashtags co-occurred with more topic-related concepts in the same tweet in all three rankings the most central hashtag was the one defining the topic eg italylockdown and was omitted from the ranking -0606 represents a point of strong negative valence and positive arousal ie alarm figure 2 reports the emotional profiles of all hashtags featured in co-occurrence networks for italylockdown left sciacalli middle and iorestoacasa right to represent the interquartile range of all words for which valencearousal rating are available we use a neutrality range histograms falling outside of the neutrality range indicate specific emotional states expressed by words included within hashtags eg pandemia contains the word pandemia with negative valence and high arousal in figure 2 left top the peak of the emotional distribution for hashtags associated with italylockdown falls within the neutrality range this finding indicates that hashtags co-occurring with italylockdown a neutral hashtag by itself were also mostly emotionally neutral conceptual entities despite this main trend the distribution also features deviations from the peak mostly in the areas of calmness and tranquillity positive valence lower arousal and excitement positive valence higher arousal weaker deviations closer to the neutrality range were present also in the area of anxiety this reconstructed emotional profile indicates that the italian social discourse featuring italylockdown was mostly calm and quiet perceiving the lockdown as a positive measure for countering responsibly the covid-19 outbreak not surprisingly the social discourse around sciacalli shows a less prominent positive emotional profile with a higher probability of featuring hashtags eliciting anxiety negative valence and increased states of arousal as it can be seen in figure 2 center top  this polarised emotional profile represents quantitative evidence for the coexistence of mildly positive and strongly negative content within the online discourse labelled by sciacalli this is further evidence that the negative hashtag sciacalli was indeed used by italian users to denounce or raise alarm over the negative implications of the lockdown especially in relation to politics and politicians actions however the polarisation of political content and debate over social media platforms has been encountered in many other studies 21 13 12 and cannot be attributed to the covid-19 outbreak only finally figure 2 top right shows that positive perception was more prominently reflected in the emotional profile of iorestoacasa which was the hashtag massively promoted by the italian government for supporting the introduction of the nationwide lockdown in italy the emotional figure 2  emotional profiles of all hashtags featured in co-occurrence networks for italylockdown left sciacalli middle and iorestoacasa right top circumplex emotional profiling all hashtags representing one or more words were considered for each word valence x-coordinate and arousal y-coordinate scores were attributed see methods resulting in a 2d density histogram yellow overlay relative to the probability of finding an hashtag in a given location in the circumplex the higher the probability the stronger the colour regions with the same probabilities are enclosed in grey lines a neutrality range indicates where 50 of the words in the underlying valencearousal dataset would fall and it thus serves as a reference value for detecting abnormal emotional profiles distributions falling outside of this range indicate deviations from the median behaviour ie interquartile range see methods bottom nrc-based emotional profiling detecting how many hashtags inspired a given emotion in a hashtag network results are normalised over the total number of hashtags in a networks emotions compatible with random expectation were highlighted in gray profile of the 6000 hashtags co-occurring with iorestoacasa indicate a considerably positive and calm perception of domestic confinement seen as a positive tool to stay safe and healthy the prominence of hopeful hashtags in association with iorestoacasa as reported in the previous subsection indicate that many italian twitter users were serene and hopeful about staying at home at the start of lockdown hashtag networks were emotionally profiled not only by using the circumplex model see above but also by using basic emotional associations taken from the nrc emotion lexicon figure 2 bottom  across all hashtag networks we find a statistically significant peak 3 in trust analogous of the peaks close to emotions of calmness and serenity an observed in the circumplex models however all the hashtag networks included also negative emotions like anger and fear which are natural human responses to unknown threats and were observed also with the circumplex representations the intensity of fearful alarming and angry emotions is stronger in the sciacalli hashtag network which was used by social users to denounce complain and express alertness about the consequences of the lockdown in addition to the politically-focused jargon highlighted by closeness centrality alone by combining closeness with graph distance entropy see methods and 32  we identify other topics which are uniformly at short distance from others in the social discourse around sciacalli such as mascherine english protective masks which was also ranked high by using closeness only amuchina the most popular brand and synonym of hand sanitiser supermercati english supermarkets this result suggests an interesting interpretation of the negative emotions around sciacalli beside the inflaming political debate and the fear of the health emergency in fact a third element emerges italian twitter users feared and were angry about the raiding and stockpiling of first aid items symptoms of panic-buying in the wake of the lockdown the above comparisons indicate consistency between dimension-based ie the circumplex and emotion-specific emotional profiling since the latter offers also a more precise categorisation of words in emotions we will focus on emotion-specific profiling importantly to fully understand the emotional profiles outlined above it is necessary to identify the language expressed in tweets using a given combination of hashtags see also figure 1  bottom as the next step of the mercurial analysis we gather all tweets featuring the focal hashtags italylockdown sciacalli or iorestoacasa and any of their co-occurring hashtags and build the corresponding word networks as explained in the methods closeness centrality over these networks provided the relevance of each single word in the social discourse around the topic identified by a hashtag only words with closeness higher than the median were reported figure 3 shows the cloud of words appearing in all tweets that include sciacalli displayed according to their nrc emotional profile similar to the emotional profile extracted from hashtags co-occurring with sciacalli the words used in tweets with this hashtag also display a polarised emotional profile with high levels of fear and trust thanks to the multi-layer analysis this dichotomy can now be better understood in terms of the individual concepts eliciting it by using closeness on word networks we identified concepts such as competente english competent continua english continue keep going and comitato english committee to be relevant for the trust-sphere these words convey trust in the expert committees appointed by the italian government to face the pandemic and protect the citizens we find that other prominent words contributing to make the discourse around sciacalli trustful are aiutare english to help serena english serene rispetto english respect and verit english truth which further validate a trustful open-minded and fair perception of the political and emergency debate outlined above this perception was mixed with negative elements mainly eliciting fear but also sadness and anger the jargon of a political debate emerges in the word cloud of fear dif-ficolt english difficulty criminale english criminal dannati english scoundrel crollare english to break down banda english gang panico english panic and caos english chaos these words indicate that twitter users felt fear directed to specific targets a speculative explanation for exorcising fear can be finding a scapegoat and then target it with anger the word cloud of such emotion supports the occurrence of such phenomenon by featuring words like denuncia english denouncement colpevoli english guilty vergogna english shame combattere english to fight and colpa english blame the above words are reflected also in other emotions like sadness which features also words like cadere english to fall and miseria english misery out of grace these prominent words in the polarised emotional profile of sciacalli suggest that twitter users feared criminal behaviour possibly related to unwise political debates or improper stockpiling of supplies as showed by the hashtag analysis our findings also suggest that the reaction to such fearful state which also projects sadness about negative economic repercussions was split into a strong angry denounce of criminal behaviour and messages of trust for the order promoted by competent organisations and committees it is interesting to note that according to ekmans theory of basic emotions 23  a combination of sadness and fear can be symptomatic of desperation which is a critical emotional state for people in the midst of a pandemic-induced lockdown the same analysis is reported in figure 4 for the social discourse of italylockdown top and iorestoacasa bottom in agreement with the circumplex profiling for both italylockdown and iorestoacasa the intensity of fear is considerably lower than trust however when investigated in conjunction with words the overall emotional profile of italylockdown appears to be more positive displaying higher trust and joy and lower sadness than the emotional profile of iorestoacasa although the difference is small this suggests that hashtags alone are not enough to fully characterise the perception of a conceptual unit and should always be analysed together with the natural language associated to them figure 3  emotional profile and word cloud of the language used in tweets with sciacalli words are organised according to the emotion they evoke font size is larger for words of higher closeness centrality in the word co-occurrence network relative to the hashtag see methods every emotion level incompatible with random expectation is highlighted with a check mark the trust around italylockdown comes from concepts like consigli english tips advice compagna english companion partner chiara english clear abbracci englishhugs and canta english sing these words and the positive emotions they elicit suggest that italian users reacted to the early stages of the lockdown with a pervasive sense of commonality and companionship reacting to the pandemic with externalisations of positive outlooks for the future eg by playing music on the balconies 4  interestingly this positive perception co-existed with a more complex and nuanced one despite the overall positive reaction in fact the discourse on italylockdown also shows fear for the difficult times facing the contagion contagi and the lockdown restrictions restrizioni and also anger identifying the current situation as a fierce battle battaglia against the virus the analysis of anticipation the emotional state projecting desires and beliefs into the future shows the emergence of concepts such as speranza english hope possibile english possible and domani english tomorrow suggesting a hopeful attitude towards a better future the social discourse around iorestoacasa brought to light a similar emotional profile with a slightly higher fear towards being quarantined at home quarantena english quarantine comando english command order emergenza english emergency both surprise and sadness were elicited by the the word confinamento english confinement which was prominently featured in the network structure arising from the tweets we analysed in summary the above emotional profiles of hashtags and words from the 101767 tweets suggest figure 4  emotional profile and word cloud of the language used in tweets with italylockdown top and iorestoacasa bottom words are organised according to the emotion they evoke font size is larger for words of higher closeness centrality in the word co-occurrence network relative to the hashtag see methods every emotional richness incompatible with random expectation is highlighted with a check mark that italians reacted to the lockdown measure with 1 a fearful denounce of criminal acts with political nuances and sadnessdesperation about negative economic repercussions from sciacalli 2 positive and trustful externalisations of fraternity and affect combined with hopeful attitudes towards a better future from italylockdown and iorestoacasa 3 a mournful concern about the psychological weight of being confined at home inspiring sadness and disgust towards the health emergency from iorestoacasa in the previous section we showed our findings on how italians perceived the early days of lockdown on social media but what about their perception of the ultimate cause of such lockdown covid-19 to better reconstruct the perception of coronavirus it is necessary to consider the different contexts where this hashtag occurs figure 5 displays the reconstruction of the emotional profile of words used in tweets with coronavirus and either italylockdown sciacalli or iorestoacasa our results suggest that the emotional profiles of language used in these three categories of tweets are different for example when considering tweets including sciacalli which the previous analysis revealed being influenced by political and social denounces of criminal acts coronavirus is perceived with a more polarised feartrust dichotomy although coronavirus was perceived as trustful as random expectations when co-occurring with sciacalli z-score 169  196 it was perceived with significantly higher trust when appearing in tweets with iorestoacasa z-score 305  196 and italylockdown z-score 351  196 to reinforce this picture the intensity of fear towards coronavirus was statistically significantly lower than random expectation in the discourse of iorestoacasa z-score -235  -196 and italylockdown z-score -301  -196 this difference is prominently reflected in both the circumplex model  figure 5  right and the nrc emotional profile  figure 5 left  although in the latter both emotional intensities are compatible with random expectation these quantitative comparisons provide data-driven evidence that twitter users perceived the same conceptual entity ie covid-19 with a higher trust when associating it to concrete means for hampering pathogen diffusion like lockdown and house confinement and with a higher fear when denouncing the politics and economics behind the pandemic however social distancing lockdown and house confinement clearly do not have only positive sides rather as suggested by our analysis they bear complex emotional profiles where sadness anger and fear towards the current situation and future developments have been prominently expressed by italians on social media this study delved into the massive information flow of italian social media users in reaction to the declaration of the pandemic status of covid-19 by who and the announcement of the nationwide lockdown by the italian government in the first half of march 2020 we explored the emotional profiles of italians during this period by analysing the social discourse around the official lockdown hashtag promoted by the italian government iorestoacasa together with a most trending hashtag of social protest sciacalli and a general hashtag about the lockdown italylockdown the fundamental premise of this work is that social media opens a window on the minds of millions of people 17  monitoring social discourse on online platforms provides unprecedented opportunities for understanding how different categories of people react to real world events 9 12 15  here we introduced a new framework multi-layer co-occurrence networks for emotional profiling mercurial which is based on cognitive network science and that allowed us to i quantitatively structure social discourse as a multi-layer network of hashtag-hashtag and word-word co-occurrences in tweets ii identify prominent discourse topics through network metrics backed up by cognitive interpretation 14  iii reconstruct and cross-validate the emotional profile attributed to each hashtag or topic of conversation through the emotion lexicon and the circumplex model of affect from social psychology and cognitive neuroscience 30  our interdisciplinary framework provides a first step in combining network and cognitive science principles to quantify sentiment for specific topics our analysis also included extensive robustness checks eg selecting words based on different centrality measures statistical testing for emotions further highlighting the potential of the framework the analysis of concept network centrality identified hashtags of political denounce and protest against irrational panic buying eg face masks and hand sanitiser around sciacalli but not in the hashtag networks for italylockdown and iorestoacasa our results also suggest that the social discourse around sciacalli was further characterised by fear anger and trust whose emotional intensity was significantly stronger than random expectation we also found that the most prominent concepts eliciting these emotions revolve around social denounce anger concern for the collective well-being fear and the measures implemented by expert committees and authorities hope this interpretation is supported also by plutchiks wheel of emotions 22  according to which combinations of anger disgust and anticipation can be symptoms of aggressiveness and contempt however within plutchiks wheel trust and fear are not in direct opposition the polarisation of positivenegative emotions observed around sciacalli might be a direct consequence of a polarisation of different social users with heterogeneous beliefs which is a phenomenon present in many social systems 21 but is also strongly present in social media through the creation of echo chambers enforcing specific narratives and discouraging the discussion of opposing views 13 2 47 11 10  emotional polarisation might therefore be a symptom of a severe lack of social consensus across italian users in the early stages of the lockdown induced by covid-19 in social psychology social consensus is a self-built perception that the beliefs feelings and actions of others are analogous to ones own 48  destabilising this perception can have detrimental effects such as reducing social commitment towards public good or even lead to a distorted perception of society favouring selfdistrust and even conditions such as social anxiety 48  instead acts such as singing from the balconies together can reduce fear and enhance self-trust 42  as well as promote commitment and social bonding 49  which is also an evolutionary response to help coping with a threat in this case a pandemic through social consensus when interpreted under the lens of social psychology the flash mobs documented by traditional media and identified here as relevant by semantic network analysis for italylockdown and iorestoacasa become important means of facing the distress induced by confinement 48 42 49  anger and fear permeated not only sciacalli but were found to a lesser extent also in association with other hashtags such as iorestoacasa or italylockdown recent studies cf 50  found that anger and fear can drastically reduce individuals sense of agency a subjective experience of being in control of our own actions linking this behaviouralemotional pattern also to alteration in brain states in turn a reduced sense of agency can lead to losing control potentially committing violent irrational acts 50  consequently the strong signals of anger and fear detected here represent red flags about a building tension manifested by social users which might contribute to the outbreak of violent acts or end up in serious psychological distress due to lowered self-control one of the most direct implications of the detected strong signals of fear anger and sadness is represented by increased violent behaviour in cognitive psychology the general aggression model gam 51 is a well-studied model for predicting and understanding violent behaviour as the outcome of a variety of factors including personality situational context and the personal internal state of emotion and knowledge according to gam feeling emotions of anger in a situation of confinement can strongly promote violent behaviour in italy the emotions of anger and anxiety we detected through social media are well reflected in the dramatic rise in reported cases of domestic violence for instance the anti-violence centers of dire donne in rete contro la violenza reported an anomalous increase of 745 in the number of women looking for help for domestic violence in march 2020 in italy 5  hence monitoring social media can be insightful about potential tensions mediated and discussed by large populations a topic in need for further research and with practical prominent repercussions for fighting covid-19 as discussed we found the hashtag coronavirus to be central across all considered hashtag networks however our analysis outlined different emotional nuances of coronavirus across different networks in psycholinguistics contextual valence shifting 52 is a well-known phenomenon whereby the very same conceptual unit can be perceived wildly differently by people according to its context this phenomenon suggests the importance of considering words in a contextual manner by comparison to each other as it was performed in this study rather than alone indeed contexts can change the meaning and emotional perception of many words in language we showed here that the same connotation shifting phenomenon 52 can happen also for hashtags online users perceived coronavirus with stronger intensities of trust and lower fear than random expectation when using that hashtag in the context of iorestoacasa and italylockdown but not when associated to sciacalli this shifting underlines the importance of considering contextual information surrounding a hashtag in order to better interpret its nuanced perception to this aim cognitive networks represent a powerful tool providing quantitative metrics such as graph distance entropy that would be otherwise not applicable with mainstream frequency approaches in psycholinguistics mercurial facilitates a quantitative characterisation of the emotions attributed to hashtags and discourses nonetheless it is important to bear in mind that the analysis we conducted relies on some assumptions and limitations for instance following previous work 12  we built unweighted and undirected networks neglecting information on how many times hashtags co-occurred including these weights would be important for detecting communities of hashtags beyond network centrality notice that including weights would come at the cost of not being able to use graph distance entropy which is defined over unweighted networks and was successfully used here for exposing the denounce of panic buying in sciacalli another limitation is relative to the emotional profiling performed with the nrc lexicon in which the same word can elicit multiple emotions since we measured emotional intensity by counting words eliciting a given emotion plus the negations see methods a consequence was the repetition of the same words across the sectors of the above word clouds building or exploiting additional data about the predominance of a word in a given emotion would enable us to identify words which are peripheral to a given emotion reduce repetitions and offer even more detailed emotional profiles recently forma mentis networks 29 32 have been introduced as a method to detect the organisation of positivenegative words in the mindsets of different individuals a similar approach might be followed for emotions in future research acting upon specific emotions rather than using the circumplex model would also solve another problem in that the attribution of arousal to individual words is prone to more noise even in mega-studies compared to detecting word valence 53  another limitation is that emotional profiles might fluctuate over time the insightful results outlined and discussed here were aggregated over a short time window thus reducing the impact of aggregation itself future analyses on longer time windows should adopt time-series for investigating emotional patterns addressing key issues like non-stationary tweeting patterns over time and statistical scarcity due to tweet crawling see also 12  the current analysis has focused on aggregated tweets but previous studies have shown both stable individual and intercultural differences in affect 54  especially for dimensions such as arousal similarly some emotions are harder to measure than others which might affect reliability and thus underestimate their contribution the current approach estimates emotional profiles on the basis of a large set of words which will reduce some language-specific differences the collection of currently missing large-scale italian normative datasets for lexical sentiment could further improve the accuracy of the findings this study approaches the relation between emotions and mental distress mostly from the perspective that attitudes and emotions of the author are conveyed in the linguistic content however the emotion profile might also have implications for readers as well as recent research suggests that even just reading words of strong valencearousal can have deep somatic and visceral effects eg raising heart beat or promoting involuntary muscle tension 55  furthermore authors and readers participate in an information network and quantifying which tweets are liked or retweeted depending on the structure of social network can provide further insight on their potential impact 12 21 10 4 56  which calls for future approaches merging social networks cognitive networks and emotional profiling finally understanding the impact of nuanced emotional appraisals would also benefit from investigating how these are related to behavioural and societal outcomes including the numbers of the contagion eg hospitalisations death rate etc and compliance with physical distancing 57  given the massive attention devoted to the covid-19 pandemic by social media monitoring online discourse can offer an insightful thermometer of how individuals discussed and perceived the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown our mercurial framework offered quantitative readings of the emotional profiles among italian twitter users during early covid-19 diffusion the detected emotional signals of political and social denounce the trust in local authorities the fear and anger towards the health and economic repercussions and the positive initiatives of fraternity all outline a rich picture of emotional reactions from italians importantly the psychological interpretation of mercurials results identified early signals of mental health distress and antisocial behaviour both linked to violence and relevant for explaining increments in domestic abuse future research will further explore and consolidate the behavioural implications of online cognitive and emotional profiles relying on the promising significance of our current results our cognitive network science approach offers decision-makers the prospect of being able to successfully detect global issues and design timely data-informed policies especially under a crisis when time constraints and pressure prevent even the richest and most organised governments from fully understanding the implications of their choices an ethical and accurate monitoring of online discourses and emotional profiles constitutes an incredibly powerful support for facing global threats ms acknowledges daniele quercia nicola perra and andrea baronchelli for stimulating discussion
