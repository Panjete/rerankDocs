asymptomatic cases with sarscov2 infection yishan wang hanyujie kang xuefeng liu zhaohui tong   the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 has become a global pandemic till 31 march 2020 there were more than 82 600 confirmed cases in the mainland china and 855 000 cases worldwide leading to over 42 000 cases of death causing heavy economic loss and continually threatening life safety the infection with sarscov2 seems to spread more easily than other diseases including seasonal influenza calculations of r0 the number of people on an average one infected person will pass on the virus suggest a range of 2 to 25

 coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 cases in china stared rapid decline in march covid19 cases or cases with sarscov2 infections slowly increased in a few countries south korea and japan while these cases have been rapidly increasing in most countries worldwide on 31 march 2020 chinese health authorization announced that numbers of asymptomatic cases with sarscov2 infection will be made to the public daily this was a very important step since different counties have different capacities for the detection of sarscov2 infection and control strategy for the covid19 outbreak we summarized in this article how asymptomatic covid19 cases have been screened and managed in china recently asymptomatic infection also known as hidden coronavirus infections httpswwwsciencemagorgnews202002labs-scramble-spot-hidden-coronavirus-infections or covert coronavirus infections httpswwwnaturecomarticlesd41586-020-00822-x have been given public concerns researchers began to dig into the underlying infectiousness of the asymptomatic infected patients asymptomatic carrier refers to patients who have mild or nonsymptoms but with a positive test for the viral nucleic acid of sarscov2 or with a positive test for serum specific immunoglobulin m antibody national health commission of the peoples republic of china covid19 prevention and control protocol 6th edition 2020 httpwwwnhcgovcnjkjs35772020034856d5b0458141fa9f376853224d41d7shtml there are two classes of asymptomatic cases with sarscov2 infection first cases with little or mild symptoms within the incubation period but with symptoms onset in the coming 14day quarantine period or typical changes on the chestradiograph the other refers to the patient with no symptoms all the time but tested positive for viral nucleic acid or antibodies asymptomatic cases are often screened for close contacts both in the clinic and in community such as cohabiting family members of covid19 patients or suspected patients or individuals who have exposed to covid19 patients within a short distance and relatively long time other circumstances include screening for clustering occurrence or tracing the source of infection currently asymptomatic cases are not included in the confirmed patients in everydayreport according to the novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment protocol 7th edition trial once found the patient will be put into medical isolation for up to 14days if the patient has symptoms onset within the isolation period heshe will be reported as a confirmed case immediately evidence is accumulating on the existence of many asymptomatic or presymptomatic cases on 5 february 2020 a japan cruise ship called the diamond princess hosting 3711 people underwent a 2week quarantine after a former passenger was found with covid19 after debarking national health commission of the peoples republic of china novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment protocol 5th edition trial 2020 httpwwwnhcgovcnyzygjs7653p20200346c9294a7dfe4cef80dc7f5912eb1989shtml until 20 february 634 persons onboard tested positive for sarscov2 of the 634 confirmed cases a total of 306 and 328 were reported to be symptomatic and asymptomatic the asymptomatic proportion was 505 320634 the asymptomatic cases reported in the article consists of both true asymptomatic cases with sarscov2 infection and cases who had not yet developed symptoms at the time of data collection but became symptomatic later as predicted using a statistical model the estimated total number of true asymptomatic cases was at 1133 and the estimated asymptomatic proportion among all infected cases was 179 another study reported that the asymptomatic ratio was estimated at 308 among evacuees tested positive for sarscov2 using the information on japanese nationals that were evacuated from wuhan china

 in this study the length of observation was long enough to cover the covid19 incubation period

 a recent study reported a familial cluster with three asymptomatic cases studies from singlecenter reported 4 to 6 cases with sarscov2 did not develop any symptom during the course of the disease

 thus there is very little probability that the viruspositive asymptomatic individuals will develop symptoms later the ratio is slightly smaller than that of influenza which was estimated at 56 to 80 recently a preprint published on medrxiv analyzed the evolving epidemiology before and after nonpharmaceutical interventions put into effect using an seir model the study indicated at least 59 of infected cases were unascertained in wuhan which included both asymptomatic and mildsymptomatic cases the study further assumed if no unascertained cases in the initial state the estimated cases would be much lower on 23 and 25 january besides there would be about 2 weeks delay in the predicted ending date of the epidemic when taking the unascertained cases into account therefore substantial unascertained cases have important implications for the evaluation and control of the covid19 epidemic with the extension of the epidemic trend of covid19 more and more researchers begin to question about the contagious capacity of these asymptomatic cases on 21 february 2020 jama reported the first case of transmission of sarscov2 from an asymptomatic carrier with normal chest computed tomography findings
7
 five family members were most likely been infected by one asymptomatic family member who lives in wuhan and traveled to anyang on 10 january 2020 the event suggests that sarscov2 may have been transmitted by the asymptomatic carrier for the first time later on in a study described the demographic and clinical features of 24 asymptomatic patients in nanjing china seven cases showed normal computed tomography ct images and had no symptoms from beginning to the end
7
 strikingly through epidemiological investigation researchers observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members which in the most serious case even caused severe covid19 pneumonia one recent research focused on the epidemiological characteristics of pediatric patients with covid19 and found over 90 of all pediatric patients were asymptomatic mild or moderate cases the clinical manifestation of childrens covid19 cases were generally less severe than those of adults patients thus children infected with covid19 were more likely of being asymptomatic cases
11
 there is no evidence on asymptomatic children as potential infection sources since most children have relatively few opportunities to expose themselves to pathogens or sick patients and were usually infected by other family members in a study assessing viral loads of different time points and samples providing proof of active virus replication in upper respiratory tract tissues
12
 pharyngeal virus shedding was very high during the first week of symptoms the virus can be detected at a very early stage of the disease when symptoms are relatively mild or in the prodromal stage suggesting a more efficient transmission of sarscov2 through active pharyngeal viral shedding at a time when symptoms are still mild another study monitored sarscov2 viral loads in upper respiratory specimens obtained from 18 patients including one patient who never developed symptoms along with unremarkable ct scan findings
13
 the asymptomatic patients nasal swabs and throat swabs tested positive on days 7 10 and 11 after contact the viral load detected in the asymptomatic patients was similar to that in the symptomatic patients suggesting the transmission potential of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients one study reported that an asymptomatic case tested for positive in feces but not in nasopharyngeal swabs suggesting the possibility of transmission via fecaloral route
14

 although grooming evidence suggest possible transmission of sarscov2 from asymptomatic cases the world health organization declared that coronavirus has relatively low risk transmitted through asymptomatic cases from past experience in the middle east respiratory syndrome asymptomatic cases are unlikely the major driver of transmission in covid19 otherwise more cases of infection would have been presented besides the process of viral shedding of asymptomatic patients is limited by the lack of symptoms such as coughing and sneezing reduced the risk of infection the relatively low viral loads of asymptomatic patients also limit their capacity of transmission and being the socalled superspreader testing positive for viral nucleic acid is subjected to viral loads and activity thus physicians should be cautious in interpreting the result of the viral nucleic acid test status of livingdead of the virus should be taken into consideration according to covid19 prevention and control protocol 6th edition asymptomatic patients should be quarantined and monitored for 14 days quarantine ends when two consecutive samples of the nucleic acid test showed negative the interval between sampling should be more than 24 hours national health commission of the peoples republic of china covid19 prevention and control protocol 6th edition 2020 two writers advocated the application of antibody tests which might help screen different age groups of humans to determine how many people become infected with few or no symptoms and illuminate the actual rate of confirmed cases httpswwwsciencemagorgnews202002labs-scramble-spot-hidden-coronavirus-infections httpsdoiorg101126scienceabb2651 with the existence of disagreement in the actual number of asymptomatic cases and their infectivity larger observational studies including serological tests with a longer period are needed

 currently for asymptomatic patients to follow strict quarantine is of great importance in the control of the covid19 epidemic if various feasible measures are taken to control the transmission then the outbreak could be ended as soon as possible the authors declare that there are no conflict of interests yw and hk contributed equally to this work conception or design of the work yw hk zt data

through more in-depth and comprehensive statistical analysis we conclude that there is no difference in the transmission rates of coronavirus between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients which is consistent with the original findings in chen et al 1  since outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 in december 2019 the coronavirus has spread over the world at an unprecedented rate by april 2 2020 more than 150 countries have been affected by covid-19 with a total of close to one million confirmed cases and over 47000 deaths the covid-19 has been declared as an international public health emergency by the world health organization who during the incubation period a percentage of coronavirus carriers may have no symptoms or minimal symptoms and thus often go undetected these covert coronavirus carriers may not even be aware of the infection themselves who however would be confirmed as positive cases if tested using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr if the percentage of asymptomatic carriers is large and if their transmissibility of coronavirus is as high as the symptomatic cases this would pose a great threat to the public therefore it is critical to determine the percentage and transmissibility of asymptomatic coronavirus carriers in the population it has been reported that the viral load detected in the asymptomatic patients was similar to that in the symptomatic patients which suggests the potential transmissibility of asymptomatic patients 2   cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has

china on the transmission rates of the coronavirus by the symptomatic and asymptomatic cases the estimated transmission rates for the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were 0063 and 0041 respectively and the chi-squared test yielded a p-value of 0288 which indicates that there is no statistically significant difference between the two transmission rates they further investigated the transmission rates for different relationships and different types of contact with the infected patients including both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases and concluded that the differences in the transmission rates are statistically significant across different relationships and types of contact respectively the closer the contact with the infected patients the higher chance of infection however in their original statistical analysis 1  the chi-squared tests were unduly used because the counts in some cells of the contingency tables are rather small and even zeros which violates the assumptions of a chi-squared test and thus casts doubt on the validity of the hypothesis test moreover when comparing the transmission rates of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases chen et al 4 included the cases associated with a super-spreader who mainly transmitted the disease in an air-conditioned bus and a buddhism activity gathering however this may reduce the generalization of the findings as the super-spreader should be regarded as an outlier and removed from the primary analysis from january 21st to march 6th 2020 there were 157 symptomatic cases and 30 asymptomatic cases in the ningbo covid-19 data 1  these infected cases resulted in 2147 close contacts with them among which 2001 exposures were caused by the symptomatic cases and 146 by the asymptomatic cases the average number of close contacts by the symptomatic cases is 13 and that by the asymptomatic cases is 5 and the difference is statistically significant with a p-value of 610 -6 from a permutation test  cc-by 40

table and the other separates them leading to a 23 table as shown in the top panel of table 1  from the results summarized in table 1  we conclude that there is no significant difference in the transmission rates between the symptomatic and asymptomatic cases either including or excluding the cases associated with the super-spreader however the tests excluding the cases associated with the super-spreader yield larger p-values 0842 when combining the numbers of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases and 0107 when separating them as a result there is no evidence in the data to rule out the transmissibility of asymptotic carriers in comparison with symptomatic cases the odds ratio estimated transmission rates and their difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases as well as the corresponding 95 confidence intervals are presented in the bottom panel of table 1  the odds of transmitting the coronavirus to a healthy individual by a symptomatic patient is 12 times of that by an asymptomatic patient which however is not statistically significant as the 95 confidence interval covers one furthermore as the 95 confidence intervals for the difference of transmission rates cover zero we conclude there is no difference in the transmissibility of coronavirus through close contacts between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases which is consistent with the findings using fishers

understanding the nature and behavior and why and how this particular virus is developing some other factors like population mobility by air travel the documented human-to-human transmission low air temperature and low humidity highly affect the transmission of coronavirus 1 11   according to the world heath organization who 1878489 confirmed cases 119044 confirmed deaths of novel coronavirus disease 2019 2019-ncov has been reported throughout the world as of april 15 2020 including 11439 confirmed cases 377 deaths from india 1  the outbreak was first announced by the health commission of hubei province china a cluster of unexplained cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology unknown cases 2  which is lethal was first identified in wuhan the capital city of hubei and seven largest city of china on december 31 2019 3 4 5  later on the novel coronavirus disease was called officially as covid-19 by who 1  the epidemic was announced a major public concern worldwide on january 30 2020 by the world health organization 2  coronavirus an enveloped virus described by a single-stranded positive-sense rna belonging to the family of coronaviridae and the nidovirales order and extensively disseminated among humans as well as mammals 6  the ongoing coronavirus epidemic has been announced a pandemic by the world health organization who on january 30 2020 and the govt of india has announced 21 days nationwide lockdown from march 25 2020 to april 14 2020 to prevent stage-iii spreading of the virus or human-to-human transmission coronavirus causes typically mild infections but sometimes lethal communicable disorders leading to severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers and in present covid-19 pandemic and in general it can be thought as sarsr-cov 7  which is mostly observed in bats-could create a future disease outbreak 8 9  the most important modes of transmission of coronavirus are respiratory droplets and contact transmission contaminated hands and it has incubation period 2-14 days 3 10  from the confirmed cases of coronavirus the symptoms range from fever sneeze or even a runny nose dry cough fatigue breathing problem and lung infiltration to severely ill and dying 10  shared surfaces are also an important risky since the virus clings on to surfaces and propagates as soon as another person touches the shared surface the virus also can remain active for about 3 hours after aerosolization droplets carrying virus mixed with air on plastic for fifteen hours and on metallic surfaces for five-six hours the continuing coronavirus outbreak has been announced a widespread by the world health organization as of march 16 2020 the united nations public health agency has authenticated 167511 confirmed cases including 6606 deaths across 151 countries throughout the world 1 3  as countries start shutting down borders cutting off international marketing and quarantining their cial places as well as contacts of cases quarantine surveillance contact tracing 17  the route of an outbreak can be described by a series of important factors but some of which are extremely difficult to understand at present coronavirus disease the basic reproduction number r 0 is one of the most crucial quantities in infectious diseases as r 0 measures how contagious a disease is r 0 designates the number of secondary infections infected by one infected individual in a whole susceptible class or more specifically the area under epidemic curve for r 0  1 the disease is expected to stop spreading but for r 0  1 an infected individual can infect on an average 1 person that is the spread of the disease is stable the disease can spread and become epidemic if r 0 must be greater than 1 r 0 can help us to understand the effectiveness of the disease that is under what condition the disease can stop or spread  the values for r 0 in china is around 25 in the primary stage of the outbreak of coronavirus 18  the spread of coronavirus outbreak depends on the infectivity of the virus and the availability of susceptible individuals mathematical modeling play a vital role to better understand the disease dynamics and designing policies to manage quickly spreading infectious diseases in lack of effective vaccine or specific antivirals 19  recently many mathematical model have already been studied to understand the complicated dynamics of novel coronavirus and some of these are cited in our references 3 5 12 20 21 22 23 24 25  a novel coronavirus model has been established by chen et al 20 and find the basic reproduction number imai et al 21 studied a computational model for novel coronavirus disease 2019 in wuhan a city of china and their model mainly focused on human-to-human transmission tang et al 5 established a compartmental model for coronavirus by incorporating symptomatic ill class to obtain the patients epidemiological status they obtained the basic reproduction number 647 which is very high for the infectious diseases nadim et al 23 studied a mathematical to investigate the coronavirus disease where they performed stability analysis and they validated their model with the data from hubei the city of china their model is originally established by gumel et al 7 for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak wu et al 25 established a coronavirus model by considering four classes namely susceptible exposed infected and recovered to study the human-human transmission dynamics based on the data from december 31 2019 to january 28 2020 they computed the reproduction number approximately 268 for coronavirus disease the conventional models governing the outbreak of infectious diseases mainly depend on the interplays among susceptible infected and exposed classes moreover the other aspects such as vaccination huge news coverage educational campaigns and rapid information flow can create great psychological effects on the population and thus remarkably change the publics behavior and affect the implementation of individuals intervention and control strategies 26  it is mainly the awareness program due to media which make the individuals enlighten regarding the disease to take safeguards such as vaccination wearing protective masks social distancing etc to minimize their risks of being infected 27 28  how long and how effectual media related impact persists is thus an important issue for future outbreak and quantifying this impact through a modeling process falls within the scope of our investigation several mathematical models have been incorporated with the assumption that the media related awareness has an impact on reducing the contact rate of susceptible and infected population 26 29 30 31 32 33  influenced by those literatures we develop and analyze a mathematical model for coronavirus to study the impact of media related awareness program to obtain a better insight into the important factors related with the control of novel coronavirus in a community and throughout the world we investigate a dynamic model to study the epidemic of coronavirus and its control in four mostly affected states namely maharashtra delhi kerala west bengal and the overall india we estimated most important parameters namely  s   a  q a   h  h   i and  i by using least square method we calculate the basic reproduction for our model for four different states as well as the india here we extend the classical deterministic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed seir compartmental model refined by introducing contact tracing-hospitalization strategies to study the epidemiological properties of coronavirus  we calibrate our mathematical model using data gained form confirmed cases of coronavirus in india and estimated the basic reproduction number for the disease transmission in order to make our mathematical model more realistic we consider the following assumptions  the model involves a net inflow rate of susceptible individuals  s per unit time  the model has no zoonotic infections of coronavirus considering only the epidemic spread through human beings  there is no effective control measures before april 10 2020  the model involves some demographic effects by accepting a proportional natural mortality in each of the sub-populations in the underlying dynamic model the total population nt is classified into six subpopulations classes namely susceptible st exposed et asymptomatic at clinically ill or symptomatic it hospitalized ht and recovered rt respectively the coronavirus outbreaks in the population throughout the world and so the news concerning coronavirus epidemics through different media including television social networking sites and newspaper as well as educational programs from government non-government organization and local bodies the source of information density of media is assumed to be proportional to the number of symptomaticinfective individuals and will alter as the symptomatic population alters herein mt denotes the cumulative density of media in individual such that mt  0 for it  0 this is mimic to the mathematical model developed by donofrio et al 27  in the case of non-delayed model and mimics to the media variable as incorporated there this media creates the behavioral alteration in the susceptible populations to save themselves from contracting infection as for example government of senegal has taken an initiative through sms campaign to spread the information regarding ebola awareness 34  albeit individuals are informed through media not everyone responses to it due to insufficiency of resources irresponsive nature and economic condition etc therefore a part of susceptible individuals with news regarding coronavirus responding to the news for corona symptoms and altering their behavior to avoid infection and will move to the recovered individuals the rate of behavioral response through media has been considered to be a function of both the densities for susceptible populations and media that is f st mt moreover we assume that the source of media is a function of it that is f m it as the source of media depends on the density of symptomatic populations a schematic representation of the above biological mechanism of coronavirus in human upon which our model is based is shown in the figure 1  the dynamics of novel coronavirus model is governed by the following system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations the susceptible individual is recruited into the population with a constant inflow rate  s and decreased by a natural mortality mortality rate  s  here  s  a represents the transmission coefficient of the asymptomatic individuals to susceptible  s  i is the transmission coefficient of symptomatic infected classes to the susceptible and  s  h denotes transmission coefficient of the hospitalized classes to susceptible population we consider  s is the disease transmission coefficient for both the infectiousness of covid-19 and contact rates with adjustment factors  a for asymptomatic classes  i for symptomatic classes and  h for hospitalized individuals albeit coronavirus is supposed to be spread completely by symptomatic populations a very lower rate of transmission by asymptomatic populations cannot even be ruled out the adjustment parameter  a  0 take into accounts for varying levels of hygiene preventions through asymptomatic an analogous explanation can be drawn to the adjustment parameters  i and  h during symptomatic and hospitalization respectively as the asymptomatic symptomatic and hospitalization programmes and hygiene preventions during asymptomatic symptomatic and hospitalization were executed and enriched progressively after an epidemic of coronavirus the spreading coefficients  a  s   i  s and  h  s  asymptomatic symptomatic and hospitalized rates could be modeled as a time-dependent parameters in computations moreover the interplay among susceptible and infected population asymptomatic symptomatic and hospitalized is modeled utilizing standard homogeneous mixing incidence 35 36  in the form of total individuals the rate of change of susceptible individuals can be represented by the following ordinary differential equation ode b dynamics of exposed individuals et the population who are exposed individuals but not yet developed clinical symptoms of coronavirus the exposed individual is declined by asymptomatic individuals at the rate  e and natural death at the rate  e  the constant per-capita rate  e modeled progression from the exposed individuals e to either the asymptomatic individuals a or symptomatic individuals i the constant q a 0  q a  1 represents budget for the rate of progress of population who move to either the asymptomatic partially-infectious class a or symptomatic class i at the per-capita rate  e  the corresponding model dynamics for exposed population can be presented by the following ode asymptomatic populations were exposed to the coronavirus but not infectious for the community the exposed classes move to the asymptomatic classes at the rate  e by a constant portion 1  q a  the asymptotic individuals progress to the recovered class at the per-capita rate  a and natural mortality rate  a  the rate of change of asymptomatic individuals is govern by the following ode the symptomatic individuals are produced after the progression of clinical symptoms of coronavirus diagnosed by the clinicians by the asymptomatic individuals the exposed individuals move to the symptomatic classes at the per-capita rate  e by a constant portion q a  the symptomatic or clinically ill individuals progress to the hospitalized or isolated class h at the percapita rate  i and natural mortality rate  i  it can be assumed that  i  the per-capita rate at which symptomatic or clinically ill classes seek clinical attention and are therefore put into the hospitalized class is bigger than  e  the per-capita rate at which the exposed individuals progress to the asymptomatic classes the clinically ill classes class i are moved to the recover classes without being diagnosed at the per-capita rate  i  the transmission dynamics of symptomatic populations are governed by the following ode  f dynamics of recovered individuals rt it can be assumed that the recovered population have enduring immunity against coronavirus albeit to date this has neither been confirmed nor contradicted the asymptomatic symptomatic and hospitalized individuals recover from the coronavirus at the per-capita rates  a   i and  h  respectively the recovered individuals die at the per-capita rate  r  the rate of change of recovered individuals can be written by the ode we assume that the source of media related information index is proportional to the number of symptomatic individuals the function f m i represents the growth of information index rate which depend on the symptomatic individuals while the coronavirus outbreaks the world health organization who health agencies social media government and non-government organization become dynamic to spread the information or media awareness in concerning the prevalence of coronavirus as for the function f m i one can consider any function satisfying f m 0  0 and f  m i  0 33  the most easiest example is f m i   m i with  m  0 1 that is i is linear function of the present prevalence of the coronavirus which could represent for instance current standardized incidence of serious cases of the coronavirus 27  one more example could be f m i  mi 1mi  where i indicates the nonlinear increasing function for the prevalence of the coronavirus which could be considered as a measure of the perceived risk for the infection rather than the original one 28 37  here  m represents the source rate of the information index and  m is half saturation constant thus we consider the following ode model for media awareness program based on the above biological assumptions and schematic representation of coronavirus see the figure 1  together with specific forms we formulate a mathematical model of novel coronavirus with media awareness given by the following seven-dimensional nonlinear system of odes the model is satisfied the following positive initial conditions since the model system 8 monitors the dynamics of human population all state variables are assumed to be positive the basic reproduction number symbolized by r 0  is the expected number of secondary cases produced in a completely susceptible population by a typical infective individual 38 39  the dimensionless basic reproduction number provides a threshold which play a crucial role in determining the disease persists or dies out from the individual in a more general way r 0 can be stated as the number of new infections created by a typical infective population at an infection free equilibrium r 0  1 determines on average an infected population creates less than one new infected population during the course of its infective period and the infection can die out in reverse way r 0  1 determines each infected population creates on average more than one new infection and the disease can spread over the population the basic reproduction number r 0 can be computed by using the concept of next generation matrix 38 39  in order to do this we consider the nonnegative matrix f and the non-singular mmatrix v expressing as the production of new-infection and transition part respectively for the system 8 are described by the jacobian matrix for the system 8 can be computed at an infection free state e  a  represents the spectral radius for a next generation matrix f v 1  thus from the system 8 we get the basic reproduction a detailed elucidation on the computer simulations for the coronavirus model system 8 figure 2 designates the prcc results which implies that the highest positively correlated parameters are the disease transmission coefficient rate  s  proportion rate of exposed individuals q a  the rate  h by which the hospitalized class converted to recovered class the rate  h by which susceptible individuals converted to exposed class and the highly negatively correlated parameters are the rate  i by which symptomatic individuals become recovered the rate  i by which symptomatic individuals converted to hospitalized class and the rate  a by which the asymptomatic individuals moved to recovered individuals account for most uncertainty with respect to the symptomatic population thus our prcc analysis yields these 7 parameters  s  q a   i   i   h   h and  a are the most effective parameters out of 17 parameters therefore we estimated the 7 parameters by using least square method now we have calibrated our coronavirus disease model 8 table iv  the output of our model for daily new cases are shown in figure 3  also the observed daily new coronavirus cases are overlapped on the fig 3  it is also important to observe the total number of coronavirus cases in a province only so the observed daily cumulative confirmed coronavirus cases and the model simulation has been plotted in the fig 4  to assure the performance of our coronavirus system without media 8  where table iii  the fitting data enables us to quantify the basic reproduction number r 0 from the expression of 10 whereas the slope of the simulated curve is relatively high for the state kerala to describe how best to diminish human impermanency and morbidity due to novel coronavirus it is very essential to see the relative significance of various factors responsible for its transmission the initial disease transmission is completely associated to the reproduction number r 0  and we calculate the sensitivity indices with regard to r 0  to the parameters for the system 8 the sensitivity indices describe us whether or not the infectious diseases will develop throughout the individulas sensitivity analysis is mainly utilized to describe the robustness of the reproduction number r 0 to fluctuation in the system parameters it also give us to identify the relative change in a state variable when a system parameter alters the normalized forward sensitivity index for r 0 with respect to the parameter p is defined as follows as we have the explicit expression for r 0 in 10 we obtain the analytical formulae for sensitivity indices of r 0   r 0 p  to each of fourteen parameters stated in the table vi  as for example the sensitivity index of r 0 with regards to  s is independent of any parameters this represents that r 0 is the increasing function with respect to  s  it implies that the probability of disease transmission has a high impact on coronavirus control and management other parameters have their sensitivity indices are specified in the table vi  from the table vi  it can be noticed that some of the indices are positive and some of the indices are negative which indicate that the indices having  signs increase the value of r 0 as one increase them and those having - signs decrease the value of r 0  as they are increased the most sensitive parameter is the disease transmission coefficient  s  where sensitivity index  r 0 s  1 indicates that the increasing  s by 10 will increase r 0 by 10 also the sensitivity index of  a  that is  r 0 s   0844286 represents that increasing  a by 10 will decrease r 0 by 844286 similarly we can interpret the other parameters too we plot the sensitivity indices of r 0  for each of the model parameters using in the table vi has been shown in the figure 6  in order to control the coronavirus outbreaks we must target the most sensitive parameters who has the great impact in controlling the system dynamics for instance the disease transmission coefficient  s is the most effective parameter in controlling the coronavirus diseases which can easily be identified from the figure 6 as well as in the table vi to control the coronavirus outbreaks the draw the contour plots for the r 0 with respect to the positively correlated parameters namely disease transmission coefficient  s and the clinical outbreak rate q a for all the infected classes in the figure 7  the contour plot represents the dependence of r 0 for the four states kerala delhi west bengal maharashtra and the republic of india contour plot indicates that for the higher values of  s and q a the reproduction number r 0 become high which means the coronavirus may enter the stage-3 and it spread through the community therefore to control r 0 must be restrict the values of the transmission coefficient  s and the portion q a by which the exposed class become symptomatically ill to keep the mortality rate as low as possible we must be take the values of  s and q a as small as possible the figure   6 and table vi represents that the adjust factors  a   i and  h are positively correlated with the basic reproduction number r 0  thus we must have to reduce the adjust factors too thus we may conclude that to reduce the coronavirus disease outbreak we need to maintain social distancing limit or stop taking fairs and theaters performances etc to study the impact of media related awareness for the coronavirus disease we simulate our system 8 for four provinces namely kerala maharashtra delhi west bengal and the republic of india with respect to the parameter values specified in the table i we also investigate the media related awareness for the novel coronavirus diseases for the republic of india and four provinces namely kerala maharashtra west bengal and delhi with respect to parameters listed in the table i and rest of the estimated parameters listed in the table   ii with initial individuals are listed in the table iv  the impact of media awareness effect for the daily cumulative confirmed cases of coronavirus diseases for symptomatic classes are shown in the to study the future outbreaks of coronavirus diseases we simulate our system 8 for a long days of the infected individuals namely asymptomatic individuals and symptomatic or clinically ill individuals for the parameters are listed in the table i and we have considered the estimated   parameters for the table ii in case of indian data only with initial population sizes are given in the table iv  the model simulation represented that the people from overall india can experience future epidemics if the control policies are not implemented more effectively as shown in the figure 10  the number of infected individuals asymptomatic and symptomatic are oscillate around 130 days and around 320 days this can be interpreted as the reproduction number r 0 is always greater than unity in india see the table v for india  otherwise we can say that the impact of media related awareness is a dynamic process and the media has a great impact in reducing the transmission of coronavirus outbreaks at the initial stage of an epidemic the factors like low air temperature and as well low humidity has a great impact on the transmission of novel coronavirus 11  moreover to control the future outbreaks of novel coronavirus the media related awareness programme and the control strategy must be implemented properly in this manuscript we propose a compartmental epidemic model on novel coronavirus diseases by incorporating the effect of media awareness to predict and control the outbreak in our model we noted that media awareness play a key role in generating public consciousness and encouraging disease measures 42  in our proposed model we consider two infectious individuals namely asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals with former being a fast spreader of the coronavirus diseases our model formulation is based on the work by gumel et al 7  where we estimate the system parameters based on the prcc sensitivity analysis at an early stage of the outbreak in which the number of cumulative classes grow exponentially we calibrated the proposed model to fit with the data from four different states namely maharashtra kerala delhi west bengal and the republic of india the most important part is to perform the sensitivity analysis of 17 model parameters and its estimation to identify the key input parameters which contributed to the symptomatic outcome strongly assisted the implementation of an integrated policy for various measures involving the epidemic during different phases of the diseases we use the sensitivity analysis by using prcc techniques prcc analysis yields the most sensitive parameters are  s  q a   i   h   a and  h out of 17 input parameters without incorporating media impact then we estimated these 7 parameters based on the data from four different states and from the entire india by fitting data on novel coronavirus cases during january 30 2020 to march 31 2020 in the four different states of india and the overall india to our proposed model we were able to get estimates of the unknown parameters for our system by fitting our proposed model simply the classical model without considering media impact system 8 with real data obtained from india covid-19 tracker httpswwwcovid19indiaorg we were able to get acceptable estimations for the system parameters and curve fitting as shown in the figures 3 and 4  to ensure the performance of our system without media we compute the numerical errors namely e m ae and e rm se  within the reasonable set of parameters the model simulations without incorporating media awareness obtained relatively good fits to novel coronavirus data as plotted in the figures 3 and 4  from the basic reproduction number r 0 in table v  it can be compared that the province kerala is highly effective by coronavirus diseases compare to other three provinces and the republic of india nevertheless our model-based analysis also demonstrates that the basic reproduction number in india and four different provinces remains greater than unity the estimation of basic reproduction number r 0 indicates that the strengthen control involvements are mandatory to reduce andor eradicate the future coronavirus diseases thus in this scenario the public must have to give utmost priority to stay home quarantine and successful the lock-down to combat against coronavirus pandemic in this situation media related awareness is mandatory to aware each and every people such that they can maintain social distancing wear mask to protect themselves and avoid cultural programme from the sensitivity indices see table vi and the figure 6  for the basic reproduction number r 0  we observed that the disease transmission coefficient  s and the portion q a clinical outbreak rates in all infected classes are positively correlated with r 0  this indicates that to reduce coronavirus diseases the social distancing is the most important factor and we reduce the values for  s and q a to control the diseases as we know for r 0  1 the diseases can be died out thus to keep control the value of r 0 we must reduce  s and q a  while investigating the contour plot we observe that for the lower values for  s and q a  the reproduction number can be controlled and reduced to less than unity as shown in the figure 7  thus if we are able to control the social distancing then we are able to control the basic reproduction number r 0 and hence we are able to eradicate the coronavirus diseases since r 0 quantifies the initial epidemic transmission its sensitivity indices enable us to establish the relative significance of various parameters in coronavirus transmission from the sensitivity of basic reproduction number r 0  we can conclude that the most effective control measures are the isolation of all close contacts and strengthening the self-protection ability for susceptible individuals table ii thus our calibrated model predicted that the increasing pattern of coronavirus diseases will be continued if the people not aware about the diseases thus the public must have to take the precautions and the health care agencies should concentrate on successful implementation of control mechanisms to reduce andor eradicate the disease in order to study the long-term dynamics of our model we observed the most interesting switching phenomena as plotted in the figure 10  maybe this is happen due to the impact of media awareness as it is a dynamic process on disease epidemic also the media awareness has a good impact in mitigating the disease transmission at an initial stage of an epidemic it is worthy to mention that the media impact is not always remain efficacious for mitigating disease transmission throughout the epidemic 43  a detailed understanding of media awareness during an outbreak can help in the progression of an implementable public health strategy a particular interest to the designers of such strategies are the effects of media awareness on some significant epidemic features such as the size of the peak its timing and the whole number of diseases our proposed model and its simulation like those in earlier investigations 26-33 37 42 43  allow that quantifying these media effects gives additional insights our model simulation and prediction suggests that the novel coronavirus diseases has a potentiality to exhibit oscillatory dynamics in the future but can be controllable by maintaining social distances and effectiveness of isolation or hospitalization our model forecasts that isolation or hospitalization of populations with coronavirus symptoms under stringent hygiene safeguards and social distancing be able to effectual control in a community and may even eliminate the diseases our study also suggests that the size and duration of an epidemic can be considerably affected by timely implementation of the hospitalization or isolation programme based on the model simulations and prediction to control the coronavirus diseases we provide some particular inferences to face with emerging diseases i avoidance of mass gatherings rallies social distancing and implement extensive lock-down ii provide essential personal safeguard to the staff who are involved in emergency services iii timely give the statistics of the coronavirus diseases to the community including the number of asymptomatic cases symptomatic cases hospitalized cases and so on iv increase the media awareness to aware the population organize the targeted health care education and self-protection and remove the public mental disorder table i and rest of parameters are estimated and   taken from the table ii for

world health organization who officially named this disease coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 on february 11 2020 at the same time the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv announced that the new coronavirus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 since the outbreak covid-19 has brought major harm and challenges to more than 200 countries and regions around the world to date more than 3000000 cases have been confirmed worldwide and the cumulative deaths have exceeded 2000001

 covid-19 initially has been divided into four types mild moderate severe and critical cases3 however with the global outbreak of coronavirus there is increasing evidence that many infections of covid-19 are asymptomatic but they can transmit the virus to others asymptomatic infections refer to the positive detection of nucleic acid of sars-cov-2 in patient samples by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr but have no typical clinical symptoms or signs and no apparent abnormalities in images including lung computed tomography ct4 the clinical characteristics of asymptomatic infections and other types of covid-19 are shown in table 1
 early recognition of an infected person and cutting off the route of transmission are key points to control covid-19 however most asymptomatic infections do not seek medical assistance due to no obvious clinical signs and poor prevention awareness which contribute to the rapid spread of covid-19 therefore it is a great challenge to prevent and control this specific type of patient globally which requires more attention worldwide asymptomatic infections have the same infectivity as symptomatic infections5 it has been reported that a 53-year-old uk patient with an asymptomatic covid-19 infection may cause 11 infections6 a report pointed out that one asymptomatic person who experienced 19 days from contact with the source of infection to rt-pcr confirmation may have infected 5 people7 these asymptomatic cases may play a role in the transmission and therefore pose a significant challenge to infection control estimates of the incidence of asymptomatic infections will clarify the epidemiological potential of covid-19 transmission and understanding of the true universality of the disease there are many studies on the incidence of asymptomatic infections table 2
 but each study has its limitations first of all due to insufficient awareness of asymptomatic infections and limited detection capabilities in the early stage of the outbreak chinas 16 may be underestimated8 on the contrary another study investigated 565 japanese citizens evacuated from wuhan at the end of january and found that the incidence of asymptomatic infections was 3089 another example is the diamond princess cruise ship which was isolated in japanese waters in early february due to covid-19 infection found that the incidence of asymptomatic infections was 51710 some researchers suggested that the above two studies overestimated the incidence but in fact a person truly has a higher risk if he has close contact with diagnosed or suspected infected persons in a relatively confined space incidence of asymptomatic infections from other studies had some shortcomings such as those in korea11 and washington12 which showed inaccurate results due to the small sample size one case in wuhan tracked the prevalence of 1391 children under 15 years old who had been in close contact with infected or suspected cases13 the incidence of asymptomatic infections in the children is lower than that of the whole population we propose that it is related to the special immune response and ace2 level in the childrens bodies14 according to these studies the ability of asymptomatic infections to spread the virus is not low and these patients are likely to cause a new round of outbreaks therefore finding asymptomatic infections is the key point for early prevention and control of covid-19 worldwide the incubation period is the approximate time from the first exposure to the virus until the clinical symptoms or signs onset and patients can also transmit the virus in this period15 asymptomatic infections have no special incubation due to no clinical signs however a recent research found that the viral load detected in asymptomatic populations were similar to that in symptomatic patients indicating that asymptomatic infections have the potential for transmission which may occur early in the course of infection16 since the viral nucleic acid positivity refers to that the virus load in samples reaches a certain limit but the infectivity mainly depends on whether the virus is in a reproductive state17 that is sometimes despite ongoing high viral loads no live virus can be isolated which means that viral nucleic acid positivity does not indicate infectivity18 it is also proved by a clinical study in which the recovered covid-19 patients who had no obvious clinical symptoms were detected to be positive for sars-cov-2 by hyper-sensitive viral nucleic acid re-examination methods but these patients had not caused new infections19 due to the limited data from current studies we think that it is necessary for us to be highly vigilant to asymptomatic infections moreover viral nucleic acid positivity has been reported not to be always considered and more clinical studies are still needed to verify that a previous study found that the median period of asymptomatic patients from viral nucleic acid positive to negative was 95 days the longest was up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases20 then in another study found that the median period from contact to diagnosis and the last positive nucleic acid test was 19 days 824 days and 215 days 1036 days respectively21 the median period from diagnosis to negative nucleic acid test was 75 days 220 days with normal or atypical chest ct infections and 125 days 822 days with typical ct findings21 however an asymptomatic infection should be quarantined for 14 days until now22 more studies are still needed to assess the infectivity duration of asymptomatic cases and if necessary more attention should be paid to some special infectious individuals who need longer segregation due to the result of nucleic acid test the most likely source of asymptomatic infections is close contacts of patients who have been diagnosed or suspected and family clusters have been presented before also colleagues friends and people who coincide with the trajectories of diagnosed or suspected patients are all regarded as high-risk populations familial cluster has made the epidemic challenging to prevent and control some family members do not have any clinical manifestations but the nucleic acid test result is positive and this has become a major difficulty in the prevention and treatment of covid-19 in one case report all three of the family members were diagnosed with covid-19 and only one family member had clinical symptoms23 another family cluster report showed that the first patient was in good health without clinical manifestations including fever and cough and denied having primary diseases he went to the local hospital for treatment only because of urticaria the patient stated that he had lived in the local area for a long time and had not been to the epidemic area however the investigation of the disease control experts found that the patient had close contact with his relatives in hubei province one week before the onset of symptoms finally by investigating the family members and close contacts of the patient three pulmonary ct scans were normal but the nucleic acid test results were positive24 family members of covid-19 patients even without any symptoms should be closely monitored and examined to rule out infection these cases also highlight the need for a close epidemiological investigation to prevent the omission of possible sources of contamination different individuals may have different clinical signs studies have shown that asymptomatic infections are more common in populations of young and middle-aged individuals with functional performance status without underlying diseases it was reported that asymptomatic cases were more common in middle-aged people in shenzhen median age49 years 309 between 30 and 49 years25 and a few younger people in nanjing median age325 years20 above all age and body condition may play an important role in the severity of covid-19 and this is related to different immune responses and other potential pathogenesis similar to sars-cov sars-cov-2 invades cells by using angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as its receptor26 because ace2-mediated angiotensin ii ang ll degradation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of severe lung failure after a viral infection the severity of the virus infection is closely related to the maturity and binding capacity of ace227 therefore we supposed that a lower level of ace2 and weaker binding capacity with sars-cov-2 should be a major factor that leads to the absence of any clinical manifestations for asymptomatic infections it has been reported that only a specific mild immune response is caused by the sars-cov-2 invasion in asymptomatic patients28 however more clinical samples should be collected and a relative examination of ace2 should be performed and compared for different types of covid-19 cases as this would be helpful to explain its pathogenesis the main mode of transmission of covid-19 is through droplet and contact transmission and high-concentration aerosols droplet transmission occurs when nearby people ingest or inhale respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes the successful isolation of live virus from throat swabs is a significant difference from sars suggesting that viral replication in upper respiratory tissues is active and that sars-cov-2 is more effective than sars-cov in spreading through active shedding of pharyngeal viruses18 a german team found that some people with covid-19 had high levels of virus in their throat swabs when their initial symptoms were mild meaning that the pathogen was quickly released and transmitted to others by coughing or sneezing droplet transmission29 this means that protective measures including wearing protective masks can prevent infection with new coronavirus to a certain extent most people with an asymptomatic infection do not seek medical assistance due to no obvious clinical signs and poor prevention awareness more epidemiological methods including close contact screening cluster epidemic surveys and follow-up surveys of the source of infection were used to identify people with asymptomatic infections the significance of asymptomatic infections as a source of infection depends on the distribution in the population and the amount and duration of virus elimination however clinical symptoms are hidden and we can only rely on immunology or nucleic acid detection technology to obtain information about the infection therefore this kind of infectious source cannot be effectively identified making it very difficult to prevent and control nucleic acid testing should be performed in persons who have contacted diagnosed or suspected covid-19 patients a person with an asymptomatic infection should be quarantined for 14 days22 after the quarantine period expires in principle those who have negative test results for two consecutive samples of nucleic acid sampling interval of at least 24 h can be released from quarantine if symptoms occurred during quarantine the person should be admitted immediately however due to the limitations of specimen collection and detection methods the influence of the high false-negative rate of the rt-pcr should be paid attention to which may lead to missed diagnosis or delay in effective diagnosis30 for this purpose the combination of repeated nucleic acid detection and chest ct imaging examination should be effectively carried out for those highly suspected sars-cov-2 infections31
 the latest guidelines from the chinese health authorities indicate3 for the treatment of covid-19 suspected and confirmed cases should be treated in isolated hospitals with effective isolation and protection conditions divided into 1 general treatment close monitoring of vital signs and symptomatic support treatment 2 antiviral therapy patients with a positive nucleic acid test result can be given -interferon lopinavirritonavir ribavirin chloroquine phosphate etc 3 mechanical ventilation treatment and rehabilitation plasma treatment for severe patients 4 traditional chinese medicine treatment there is currently controversy regarding the treatment of asymptomatic infections some researchers supported that antiviral therapy could fasten viral clearance on asymptomatic infections20

24 while it has been reported that isolation and close observation are enough for asymptomatic infections in one report lopinavirritonavir and abidol were not reported to be effective in improving symptoms or accelerating viral clearance32 it was also reported that despite the treatment of aerosolized interferon ifn 2 and two tablets of lopinavirritonavir 200mg50 mg were used twice a day for 10 days viral nucleic acid results were still positive which showed that these antiviral drugs did not seem to be effective in addition side effects were observed after antiviral therapy such as liver impairment33 therefore antiviral treatments not suggested for asymptomatic infections now maybe more clinical studies are needed to further confirm its effectiveness until now isolation and close observation are regarded as a better option for these asymptomatic infections a few people with an asymptomatic infection may develop into symptomatic cases during isolation but the vast majority will heal on their own a study of 24 asymptomatic patients showed that all asymptomatic patients did not develop severe disease or death of which 18 750 were virus cleared after antiviral treatment 9 were discharged from the hospital and 9 were kept in the hospital for observation in particular one case was positive again even after the nucleic acid test negative for twice20 they can only be discharged after having at least two consecutive negative nucleic acid test results tested 24 h apart2 some patients turn positive again after being discharged so further isolation treatment and continuous nucleic acid testing can also be recommended for discharged patients it is recommended to continue the isolation management and health examinations should be continued for 14 days after being discharged and regular follow-up visits should be conducted in the 2nd and 4th weeks after being discharged3
 this manuscript reviewed the epidemiological characteristics and prevention measures of people with an asymptomatic infection of covid-19 however the research evidence is very limited and the specific characteristics of asymptomatic infections need to be further clarified in summary rigorous epidemiological investigations and laboratory testing are helpful in identifying people with asymptomatic infection to better prevent and control the risk of covid-19 disease it is recommended to screen for high-risk populations such as close contacts especially in one confined space with diagnosed or suspected infected patients which will be helpful for early control this global epidemic effectively  epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 26 asymptomatic sars-cov-2 carriers

sars-cov-2 carriers are important potential infection sources of covid-19 and may have a long carrying period of sars-cov-2 patients with normal chest cts had a shorter period from diagnosis to being sars-cov-2-negative than those with typical ct changes background we retrospectively analysed 26 persistently asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 carriers methods epidemiological and clinical characteristics from the 26 asymptomatic patients with positive results for sars-cov-2 rna testing were obtained results twenty-two patients 846 correlated with clustering occurrence the median period from contact to diagnosis and the last positive nucleic acid test was 19 8-24 days and 215 days 10-36 days respectively the median period from diagnosis to negative

opacities on ctn10 385 125 days8-22 days p001 seven patients 700 with initial positive nucleic acid test results had a negative result simultaneously with improved ct findings obvious improvement in ct findings was observed in three patients 300 despite positive nucleic acid test results conclusion in asymptomatic patients changes in biochemical and inflammatory variables are small and changes on chest ct can occur it is worth noting the long existence of sars-cov-2 in some asymptomatic patients and false-negative results need to be considered in sars-cov-2nucleic acid test  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is the causation agent of a novel respiratory infectious coronavirus disease termed covid-2019 which has disseminated quickly among people since its initial outbreak in wuhan china was reported in december 2019 there have been 1279722 cases worldwide up to april 7 2020 1 2  covid-19 is highly contagious with rapid transmission and people are general susceptible to this new coronavirus patients with sars-cov-2 infection may show covid-19-related symptoms asymptomatic carriers have also been found 3  for instance there are reports documenting a substantial fraction of truly asymptomatic individuals with covid-19 from the diamond princess cruise ship approximately 18 and japanese evacuees out of wuhan 4 5  there are a few other case reports in various journals in table 1 3 6 7 8 9 10  these reports mainly focus on the estimated asymptomatic proportion mode of transmission some radiological findings and solutions to identify and isolate asymptomatic patients emerging evidence suggests that patients with clinical manifestations are contagious with analysis of their clinical characteristics 11 12  however there are few studies reported the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic patients a few studies have described the clinical characteristics of asymptomatic patients but some of the asymptomatic patients in these studies were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis but later developed symptoms so they cannot truly represent the clinical characteristics of asymptomatic patients 13 14  here we identified a total of 26 persistently asymptomatic patients with positive test results for sars-cov-2 nucleic acid to determine the clinical characteristics and asymptomatic carrier transmission of covid-19 infection a total of 26 hospitalized patients with a sars-cov-2 epidemiological history and positive sars-cov-2 nucleic acid test results were identified to analyze the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of covid-19infected asymptomatic carriers these patients sputum and throat swab were sampled for sars-cov-2 confirmation and tested using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr an epidemiological history was defined as a close contact with a diagnosed or possible case of covid-19 or had a history of residence in or travel to wuhan informed consent was obtained from each registered patient and this study was reviewed and approved by the medical ethics committee of zhengzhou university a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 5 detailed information regarding the epidemiological history and information of other family members of each patient was obtained we also collected information regarding patient age sex previous medical history clinical manifestations laboratory tests chest computed tomography ct scans treatment measures and prognosis normally distributed continuous variables are presented as mean  standard deviation sd and were compared using the t-test non-normally distributed data are described as the median and were analyzed using the rank sum test of two groups categorical variables are show as percentages all statistical analysis was performed using the spss software version 220 a total of 26 patients with asymptomatic sars-cov-2 infection were collected in this study of whom 16 615 were men and 10 385 were women the median age was 295 years 2 to 80 years and the age of 18 patients 692 ranged from 20 to 60 years two patients had a history of smoking both for over 20 years with an average of 20 cigarettes per day two patients had a history of hypertension and one had coronary heart disease regarding the source of the infection six patients 230 has a history of travel to wuhan with no clear contact with a source of infection exact contacts with confirmed or possible patients were found in eighteen cases 692 and the contact history was unknown in two patients 78 among patients with a clear source of infection 10 cases 556 had previously talked to or had a meal with a confirmed covid-19 patient and eight cases 444 lived with a confirmed patient the sources of infection in these cases included confirmed patients with clinical symptoms n16 888 a possible covid-19 patient with clinical symptoms n1 56 and a confirmed patient without clinical symptoms n1 56 in addition 22 cases 846 were a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 6 found to be correlated with a local cluster the close contacts of these 26 enrolled patients were traced and only two sars-cov-2-infected patients were identified in the six patients with a recent history of travel to wuhan the median period from leaving wuhan to a covid-19 diagnosis was 15 days 14-19 days in 18 patients with a clear source of infection the median period from contact with a confirmed or possible case to the confirmed to diagnosis was 19 days 8-24 days this period was longer than 14 days in 14 cases 778 and over 20 days in four cases 222  figure 1  the initial leukocyte counts were slightly lower than the normal value in two patients slightly higher in one patient and normal in the other patients the lymphocyte count was normal in 26 patients regarding coagulation function there was an elevated platelet count in four patients higher prothrombin time in one patient and increased d-dimer in four patients procalcitonin was slightly elevated in three cases all of which were less than 1 ngml and c-reactive protein was normal in 26 patients additionally investigations revealed three patients with reduced albumin four patients with mildly abnormal transaminase and two patients with slightly elevated creatinine levels five patients had slightly lower serum sodium concentration and one patient had higher serum potassium concentration lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase levels were slightly elevated in three patients and one patient respectively there was no statistical significance between the initial and following results for all the above indicators p005 being sars-cov-2-free was defined as two consecutive negative nucleic acid results with an interval of at least 24 hours the period from diagnosis to being confirmed sars-cov-2-free was 10 days in 15 patients 20 days in 23 patients and more than 20 days in three patients 20 days 20 days and 22 days respectively the exact time of contact with a confirmed or possible covid-19 case was clear in 18 patients the median period from contact to the last positive covid-19 nucleic acid test was 215 days 10 to 36 days and in four patients this was over 30 days in a case originating from wuhan the period from leaving wuhan to the last positive covid-19 nucleic acid test was 35 days figure 1  there were positive test results for sars-cov-2 following a negative result in two patients in particular in one patient the sars-cov-2 nucleic acid tests repeatedly had positive and negative results figure 1  a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 7 chest ct scans were performed an average of 3-4 days after the initial ct examination and each patient had at least two ct scans the results of the first ct scan of the 26 patients were as follows nine patients 346 with normal ct scans 10 patients 385 with typical manifestations patch-like ground-glass opacities distributed in the extrapulmonary zone seven patients with changes in a unilateral lung and three patients with changes in bilateral lungs in seven patients 269 ct scans showed atypical ct manifestations chronic inflammation and small cord shadows including a small strip shadows in three patients 115 small nodular shadows in one patient thickened bronchial vascular bundles in two patients and a small manifestation of chronic inflammation in one patient in patients with normal ct scans on admission the chest ct manifestations did not significantly change during hospitalization and seven patients with atypical ct manifestations also showed no significant changes on chest ct scans for patients with typical chest ct manifestations improved chest cts were observed in seven patients and three patients showed improvement after an initial progression of lesions  figure 2  patients with normal or atypical chest ct findings had a relatively short period from diagnosis to continuous negative covid-19 nucleic acid results with a median period of 75 days 2-20 days in patients with typical patchy or ground-glass opacities the median period was 125 days 8-22 days this difference was statistically significant p 001 of the 10 patients with typical chest ct manifestations seven patients showed improved chest ct results that synchronized with the negative sars-cov-2 nucleic acid test result while three patients had a marked improvement in ct results

patients were treated with oral arbidol 200 mg tid and one patient developed purulent tonsillitis during hospitalization and was treated with antibiotics one patient developed nausea during hospitalization which may have been caused by lopinavirritonavir another case developed a transient fever which was related to suppurative tonsillitis this patient felt better after antibiotic treatment neither of the two symptoms was associated with sars-cov-2 infection the remaining cases were asymptomatic during hospitalization discharge criteria for covid-19 were as follows 1 normal body temperature for more than 3 days 2 significantly improved respiratory symptoms 3 significantly improved chest radiography and 4 two consecutive negative sars-cov-2 nucleic acid test results

infection is an important measure to control this current epidemic 2 18  infected individuals with clinical symptoms can be tracked according to their clinical symptoms while those who are asymptomatic especially those without an epidemiological history are difficult to track these asymptomatic cases may also capable of transmitting sars-cov-2 which could cause difficulties in covid-19 prevention and control at present there are few studies of asymptomatic disease most of which focus on the proportion of asymptomatic patients and the evidence of asymptomatic transmission the description of clinical features of asymptomatic patients is technically a description of asymptomatic disease at the time of diagnosis with some patients going on to develop symptoms there is also little research on asymptomatic epidemiology the infectiousness and effect of the asymptomatic epidemiological characteristics and disease clinical characteristics of dynamic change are not clear therefore this study focused on persistently asymptomatic cases of covid-19 by tracing and isolating the contacts of people who were diagnosed or possible covid-19 patients this study identified a total of 26 asymptomatic patients asymptomatic carriers were found to be of any age mainly concentrated in the 20-60 years age range and are characterized by local clusters disease transmission from two asymptomatic patients was included in this study infected patients may have clinical symptoms or may be asymptomatic the study found that asymptomatic cases were mostly infected by symptomatic patients and a few were infected by asymptomatic patients only two asymptomatic of the 26 enrolled asymptomatic patients infected others therefore we speculate that asymptomatic carriers may be less infectious than symptomatic patients in asymptomatic carriers there was a long period between contact with the infection source to diagnosis with a median of 19 days these asymptomatic carriers were identified only when they contacted diagnosed or possible covid-19 patients suggesting the difficulty in detecting these asymptomatic carriers the period from diagnosis to negative nucleic acid test tests was within 20 days for 23 885 patients  figure 1  the duration of sars-cov-2 infection in asymptomatic patients is unclear the median period from contact with diagnosed or possible cases to the last positive nucleic acid test was 215 days 10-36 days most patients will miss the a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t real last positive assays since nucleic acid tests for sars-cov-2 were not performed every day so this time might be shorter than the actual time the period was longer than 30 days in four patients of whom one patient talked with a covid-19 patient for 1 hour without contact with any other confirmed or possible patients contacted 35 days previously figure 1  in addition this period of 35 days was for a patient with a wuhanrelated history figure 1  therefore asymptomatic patients may carry sars-cov-2 for more than one month suggesting that this virus is carried in asymptomatic patients for a long period in two patients there was a positive nucleic acid test after an initial negative result and one patient had recurrent alternation of positive and negative results this phenomenon may be caused by false-negative results of assays and detection can be affected by factors including the specimens reagents and operations thus positive nucleic acid tests cannot be used as the only criterion for covid-19 diagnosis standardized operation and repeated verifications are required to improve the positive rate patients with normal chest cts had a shorter period from diagnosis to being sars-cov-2-negative than those with typical ct changes in some patients conversion of nucleic acid test results from positive to negative was synchronized with an improvement in chest ct findings but this change may also occur later than the improvement on ct therefore ct improvement cannot be used to indicate that a patient is not infectious indices of blood cell counts liver and renal function and inflammation in asymptomatic patients did not change significantly during the disease reduced lymphocyte and leukocyte counts are characteristics of clinically symptomatic covid-19 but these changes were not common in the asymptomatic patients in this study chest ct in asymptomatic patients can be normal or present with typical ground-glass opacities usually limited to a unilateral lung but sometimes occurring in bilateral lungs three patients with asymptomatic infections developed lung infections during treatment and then improved although these asymptomatic patients appear normal some relatively light damage may have already been produced this study also has some limitation for example only 26 patients were included in this study in addition this retrospective analysis did not include daily nucleic acid tests for sars-cov-2 large-scale prospective studies are needed to validate our findings in summary asymptomatic infections can occur at any age and appear to be correlated with local clusters of diseases asymptomatic transmission may be less contagious but should still be recognized as an infection source for covid-19 transmission there were no significant changes in the biochemical and inflammatory variables in these patients however changes on chest ct may occur in these patients it is necessary to note a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t multiple patchy ground glass opacities can be seen in the right lung on february 6 the infection progressed more than before on february 11 on february 16 the signs of viral pneumonia in the right lung improved slightly and on february 26 the chest ct improved a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t  asymptomatic middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov infection extent and implications for infection control a systematic review jaffar al-tawfiq a philippe gautret   we searched medline and scopus databases for articles in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma guidelines httpwwwprismastatementorg 32 we included the following terms1 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus or mers or mers-cov or novel coronavirus2 asymptomatic 3 transmission4 1 and 2 and 3
 early in the course of the mers outbreak the term mers was not yet coined and the term novel coronavirus was used thus we also conducted a focused search to identify any missed relevant publications we included articles describing transmission of mers-cov in animals and humans from asymptomatic infection in a rabbit model of mers-cov infection mers-cov was detected in the lungs without significant histopathological changes and no symptoms 42 in an evaluation of contacts of a positive dromedary camel 2 58 of 34 dromedary contacts tested positive and were asymptomatic 43 the proportion of asymptomatic mers probably remained unchanged or even declined with implementation of personal protection measures asymptomatic case identification increased by change in testing recommendations this change had also resulted in the reduction of case-fatality rate from 65 mainly in severe cases to 445 in mixed population 44 this reduction was partially related to an increase in the rate of asymptomatic individuals from 0 to 286 in early reports 44 a summary of studies addressing asymptomatic mers cases in humans is shown in table 1 in early cases from april 2012 to october 2013 there were 144 laboratory-confirmed mers-cov cases including 18 125 asymptomatic individuals 33 in one study from saudi arabia 4 08 of 520 asymptomatic hcws screened were positive 35 in south korea 3 05 of 591 asymptomatic hcws were detected positive via pcr screening 34 in a recent study from saudi arabia 17 out of 879 hcws tested positive for mers-cov and 53 of them were asymptomatic by pcr 41 in a seroepidemiologic survey conducted in south korea of 1610 asymptomatic hcws and non-hcws contacts only 1 non-hcw 006 tested positive 36 asymptomatic persons were identified in the jeddah outbreak there were 64 25 asymptomatic of 255 individual tested including 41 hcws and 23 non-hcws 6 in a total of 280 household contacts 12 individuals were identified by pcr or serology of whom 11 39 were asymptomatic 37 asymptomatic individuals were less likely to have underlying condition 42 compared to 86 of fatal cases 45 however serologic evaluation of contacts and patients may underestimate the extent of the disease as antibodies wane over time and is related to disease severity 46 of particular interest is that most of the identified pediatric cases were asymptomatic with no clear explanation 38 39 4047 overall the detection rate of mers cases among asymptomatic contacts when screened was less than 1 in the available studies included in this review table 1 the proportion of asymptomatic cases among all confirmed cases widely differed in the available reports the differences between the study setting and the populations studied did not allow any reliable comparison according to the last who update 21 of the 2228 cases confirmed mers-cov cases were reported to have no or mild symptoms while 46 had severe disease or died 48 imported mers-cov cases were treated in healthcare settings more than 20 travel-related mers-cov had occurred as summarized previously 28 however there were no reported asymptomatic cases travel related mers-cov occurred infrequently among pilgrims performing umrah 2849 the role of asymptomatic individuals was evaluated in a family cluster 50 the index case in that study was thought to have acquired mers infection from an unrecognized mild or asymptomatic case 50 however the link was not established in this case one study suggested the possible transmission of mers from an asymptomatic individual the index case of a family cluster acquired infection 14 days after hospitalization suggesting that the infection occurred from an asymptomatic person 50 this is based on an incubation period of 710 days in the south korea outbreak 82 contacts of an asymptomatic or mild mers-cov infection were tested by rt-pcr and serology and all of them were negative 51 in a study from abu dhabi of 34 case-patients 91 were asymptomatic with no evidence of transmission 52 in another study most of the cases were either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic 53 mers-cov was cultured from a patient with mild respiratory symptoms confirming the ability of such patients to transmit mers-cov 54 the role of asymptomatic travelers in the potential transmission of the infection to household contacts is a concern however so far no such event had been reported the risk of mers-cov infection seems to be low in travelers 49 and there were multiple cases described in travelers 28 the risk of mers-cov was evaluated in a mathematical study and the model included all middle east countries with reported locally acquired cases and 41 of the travel-imported cases outside the middle east were in the top ten countries 55 although india was the most at-risk country there had been no reported cases from this country the initial 2012 hajj season started few weeks after the first case of mers-cov infection was reported 56 however there were no reported cases among pilgrims in 2012 57 58 59 60 thus the saudi ministry of health utilized the mers-cov case definition for monitoring any occurrence of the disease during hajj for early detection of cases among pilgrims 61 an enhanced surveillance system was established for the detection of mers-cov cases the disease remains limited to the middle east with the exception of sporadic travel associated infections and the large outbreak in south korea 22286263 in one study conducted september 2012october 2013 77 travelers from the middle east met the possible case definition for mers and two of them tested positive for mers 28 in a small study of 14 retuning pilgrims all patients were hospitalized for respiratory symptoms and none of them tested positive for mers-cov in marseille france in october 2013 64 furthermore nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from suspected cases and all samples tested negative for mers-cov 56 another small study of 7 pilgrims in 2014 in austria none had mers-cov 65 mathematical models estimated the risk of mers-cov among pilgrims to be 17 cases per hajj and 310 per umrah per year 66 it was estimated that 62 pilgrims may develop mers-cov symptoms during the hajj and 4 pilgrims may become infected and return home before symptoms development 67 however systematic screening of pilgrims for mers-cov showed no positive cases 596568 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 systematic surveillance of returning pilgrims was done in several studies in egypt iran france ghana iran and saudi arabia 64687172 few studies examined mers-cov among symptomatic pilgrims and none was positive for mers-cov 56596581 there had been an extensive surveillance of mers-cov among pilgrims and only 4 cases have been linked to umrah mini-hajj 82 83 84 85 86 the occurrence of asymptomatic infection of mers and the possibility of transmission to other individuals is of particular importance for healthcare settings and for travelers these rt-pcr positive persons with mild or no symptoms are usually identified when conducting laboratory screening tests as part of active case monitoring or contact investigations asymptomatic health care workers may contribute to healthcare associated transmission and asymptomatic travelers may potentially transmit the infection to household contacts the who recommends the isolation of asymptomatic pcr-positive individuals and daily follow up for the occurrence of symptoms those individuals should be tested at least weekly and hcws should not return to work until two consecutive upper respiratory tract samples are rt-pcr negative 87 in a study of severe cases and those with mild disease the latter group cleared mers-cov at an earlier time than patients with severe disease whereby on day 12 30 of mild cases and 76 of severe cases were positive for mers-cov by pcr 88 another study reported prolonged nasal virus rna detection more than 5 weeks from one asymptomatic rt-pcr positive health-care worker 89 in conclusion the proportion of asymptomatic mers cases were detected with increasing frequency as the disease progressed overtime those patients were less likely to have comorbid disease and may contribute to the transmission of the virus all authors have no funding all authors have no conflict of interest to declare  estimating the effects of asymptomatic and imported patients on covid19 epidemic using mathematical modeling tingzhe sun dan weng   the early pneumonia cases were identified in december 2019 with unclear origin
1
 the novel coronavirus has been named by the world health organization as coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 which shares similarity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2
 especially older people and individuals with coexisting diseases are particularly susceptible to covid19 and are more commonly seen in patients with severe diseases
1
 now the covid19 has spread to many countries over the past 2 months and become a serious threat to public health worldwide to impede the outbreak of covid19 series of precautionary measures nationwide have been taken such as activation of emergency response system quarantine isolating suspicious cases community surveillance and epidemiological investigations
3
 as a result the transmission of covid19 in china has been effectively blocked however the occurrence of asymptomatic patients asp has posed a novel challenge regarding the epidemic of covid19
1
 
4
 asp are not quarantined but also have considerable infectivity
5
 the viral loads in asp were quantitatively similar to those identified in patients with symptoms
5
 meanwhile the asp have not been diagnosed as the laboratoryconfirmed cases
6
 therefore imported cases and asp have become novel challenges in china modelingbased work may provide critical insight into the impact of interventions and epidemic of covid19
7
 recently many models have been developed to estimation the epidemic trend and evaluate the effect of controlled interventions

 however the epidemic data have been updated and the number of laboratoryconfirmed cases fall to zero on march 20 at several provinces in china therefore novel datadriven model should be reconstructed to better characterize the epidemic features of covid19 in current work we developed a refined model with two novel features we considered the effect of maximum capacity in healthcare facility on the recovery rate of infected cases meanwhile we also incorporated the asp into our model these two features significantly improved the model fitting under strongly controlled measures asp or imported cases would not lead to a concomitant outbreak however if the average effective contact rate within population was increased our model could predict a second outbreak with only a few asymptomatic or imported patients meanwhile the asp will accelerate the epidemic outbreak of covid19 with reduced latent period and larger outbreak size compared with imported patients our model may provide guidance for formulating controlled measures and reevaluation of the diagnostic criteria for covid19 jiangsu and anhui are two provinces adjacent to wuhan hubei province in china we collected the number of confirmed and cured patients from 23 january to 31 march on the official website for commission of health of jiangsu and anhui provinces
15
 
16
 the total susceptible population was set to be the total population in jiangsu and anhui provinces respectively the data were collected from national bureau of statistics httpwwwstatsgovcn we obtained that the initial susceptible population at jiangsu and anhui provinces 2019 was 807 and 63659 million respectively owing to the epidemiological features of covid19 and declaration of public health emergency in jiangsu and anhui provinces immediately following the closure of wuhan on 23 january 2020 interventions such as isolation precaution and quarantine have been implemented therefore the migration of population was cutdown and we did not consider wuhan returnees since 23 january as previously described
17
 
18
 the effect of wuhan returnees after 23 january was discussed in supporting information discussion 11 to simplify model construction we divided the total population in jiangsu and anhui provinces into five variables termed as susceptible population with no resistance to disease s closely observed population c including the individuals under public health intervention or people with potentially close contacts infected patients i recovered r cureddead and asp a the total infected population i was of interest for monitoring the epidemic of covid19 the complete model was formulated as follows
1dsdtc1sc2saa3sidcdt1sc2sa1c2cc3sididt2c3aknkncninidrdtknkncninidadt1ca3a
 is a theoretical reversal rate discharged from quarantine or close observation period a usual period for covid19 is around 14 days corresponding to   114 however c all includes potential close contacts without quarantine the actual  should be larger than 114 and reestimated in model 
i i  1 2 3 describes the average effective contact rate between the susceptible population s and closely observed population c asp a and infected patients i respectively  is the assumed selfrecovery rate for asp

 describes the average recovery rate for infected patients since the healthcare facilityworkers in the hospital has maximum capacity a reasonable assumption argues that higher number of inpatients or quarantined cases will lower the recovery rate as the number of infected cases decreased the clinical care and treatments may be improved these concerns may lead to threshold behavior in recovery rate we used a hill function to depict the dependence of  on asymptomatic to diagnosed patients in which k denotes the threshold and n is the cooperativity the initial values of susceptible population s were set to be the total population in jiangsu and anhui provinces as described above the initial value for i and r commission of health in jiangsu and anhui provinces r  0
15
 
16
 the initial values of close contacts and asp were estimated the simplified version of the model without the effect of asp and healthcare capacity related recovery rate is described by following equations
2dsdtc1sc3sidcdt1sc2cc3sididt2cidrdti
 a more complex mutant model without the effect of asp was described by following equations
3dsdtc1sc3sidcdt1sc2cc3sididt2cknkncninidrdtknkncnini
 the parameter estimation was performed using the potterswheel
22
 the trust region method was adopted during simulation initial values of s i and r were fixed other parameters and initial conditions were allowed to vary with lognormal distributions a fit sequence with at least 400 stochastic runs was implemented to exclude the potential local minima in parametric space the basic 
2 criteria was used for model identification 
2n  1 where n denotes the number of data points
22

 local sensitivity analysis provides dynamic responses to an infinitesimal disturbance in kinetic parameters and initial conditions a dynamic system can be defined by xf x  where x and  donate state and parameter vector respectively relative sensitivity s is defined as
simaximaxlnimaxln
 note that this sensitivity coefficient is only locally valid in parameter space the ordinary differential equations were integrated using ode23s solver in matlab r2018b we first formulated a simplified model similar to the seir model 
23
 which captured the major interactions among susceptible population close contacts infected patients and recovered cases model 2 with reasonable guess for parameter values we performed model fitting to reported data from jiangsu province
15
 a total of 400 stochastic runs were performed however the best fit from 400 runs did not satisfy the basic criteria for a convincible model 
2n  1 for both infected and recovered population figure s1a a speculation argued that the actual recovery was slower than model predictions at early time points figure s1a right notably the temporal recovery exhibited a moderate cooperativity with a hill coefficient 4857 95 confidence interval 47 5014 implying that the recovery rate  might be dynamically adjusted since the number of healthcare facilityworkers in hospital might affect the maximally admitted inpatients and medical treatment we modified the recovery rate  by multiplying a scaling factor model 3 we assumed that higher infectedquarantined cases may lower the recovery rate the cooperativity was also subject to model fitting results suggested that the 
2 penalty from model fitting was significantly decreased figure s1b however the model could not faithfully match the infected numbers 
2n  1 figure s1b left since the occurrence of asp had raised extensive concerns about a possible outbreak and community spread of covid19
19
 
20
 
21
 we then incorporated the effect of asymptomatic cases model 1 the complete model we found the fitting was markedly improved and several fits to epidemic data from jiangsu province had even reached a 
2n  01 figure 1a parameters were shown in table s1 we further fit our model to data from anhui province kinetic parameters c and a were reestimated table s1 and the results showed that the revised model formulation could also faithfully match the data figure 1b these results suggested that the effect of asp and threshold behaviors in healthcare capacity contributed significantly to model fitting we next performed local sensitivity analysis to identify critical parameters for covid19 epidemic we used maximal infected patients as the metric to evaluate the local sensitivity we found that only a small fraction of parameters exhibited strong or moderate sensitivities the sensitivity patterns were qualitatively similar between jiangsu and anhui model figure 2ab the discharge rate  showed strong negative regulation for maximally infected patients in both models figure 2ab the transition from close contacts to asp 
1 and contacts between susceptible population and close contacts 
1 profoundly increased the maximal infection not surprisingly the size of susceptible population s and close contacts c positively contributed to viral outbreak these results characterized the locally sensitive parameters which potentially affected viral outbreaks to avoid fitting bias toward local minimum in parametric space we then performed model fitting from stochastic parameter sets totally 400 runs were performed and the top 50 200 sets with a maximal total 
2n  00904 were selected for analysis we found that parameters related to asp were not significantly different between jiangsu and anhui provinces suggesting that asymptomatic cases had similar epidemic 
3 
1  and 
2 figure 3 the discharge rate  in anhui province was faster figure 4 meanwhile patient recovery rate  was also significantly larger than that in jiangsu province figure 3 which is consistent with the epidemic data that all infected patients were cured before march 9 upto 6 days ahead compared with jiangsu province during stochastic fitting we found that the initial number of asp approached zero 00024 in jiangsu province and 01268 in anhui province therefore we set initial asp to zero the parameter n in jiangsu and anhui model was only slightly larger than one implying minimal cooperativity however the threshold level for healthcare capacity k in jiangsu province was significantly larger than that in anhui province p  26982  107 figure 3 implying better healthcare resources in jiangsu province the initial number of close contacts c and their interaction with susceptible population 
1 were enhanced in jiangsu province possibly owing to the larger population in jiangsu province figure 3 collectively the stochastic parameter fitting could unravel both the differences and similarity of covid19 epidemic in jiangsu and anhui provinces the asp covert cases or patients with no symptoms have become a new epidemiological puzzle and may potentially trigger a secondary outbreak

 under strong controlled interventions such as quarantine and community surveillance the mutual contact among susceptible population close contacts infected patients and asymptomatic cases was almost completely blocked ie extremely low 
i i  1 2 3 however if the strong intervention becomes mild the mutual contacts among all population will be increased ie larger 
i the increased fold in all 
i values was simulated by multiplying 
i with a contact factor f 
i  f  
i i  1 2 3 therefore f  1 indicated strongly controlled interventions whereas higher f 1 values indicated mild or no interventions we also varying the number of asp and then recorded the maximal infected population if there was a covid19 outbreak the latent period was defined as the time when the total infected cases became monotonically increased and finally reached a high peak at least two orders of magnitude larger than the initial patient numbers an exemplified case was shown figure 4a when asp  100 and controlled intervention was slightly reduced ie mutual contact was increased f  15 the infected cases were rapidly tolerated figure 4a left however if f was increased to 4 there would be an outbreak figure 4a right extensive simulations showed there was no outbreak if f  16 irrespective of the initial asymptomatic populations figure 4b however if f  16 even a small size of asymptomatic population asp  20 would lead to outbreak although the latent period seemed longer figure 4b top for f  28 the latent period was less than 10 days figure 4b top the latent period and outbreak size were sensitive to contact factor f increase mutual contact among populations while remained relatively insensitive to initial number of asp figure 4b similar behaviors could be observed in anhui model although the threshold for f was reduced to 13 figure 4c these results suggested that strongly controlled intervention to reduce mutual contact is highly effective to block viral outbreak there are more and more imported patients in china since the coronavirus outbreak surges worldwide we then investigated the effect of imported cases to viral epidemic we varied the initial population of imported patients and contact factor f to explore whether an outbreak would be initiated we found that mutual contact contact factor f among different populations susceptible close contact infected and asymptomatic was also the major determinant for viral outbreak in both jiangsu and anhui models figure 5ab the latent period and the outbreak size were both sensitive to changes in contact factor f in both jiangsu and anhui models figure 5ab we further considered dynamic importation a daily importation occurs with different numbers of imported patients results suggested that the mutual contact markedly affected the outbreak size see supporting information discussion 12 taken together lowering mutual contact remains a sensitive strategy to impede coronavirus spreading the latent periods and outbreak sizes were compared for identical contact factor f and initial importedasymptomatic populations results suggested that the latent period for imported cases was uniformly longer than that of asymptomatic cases figure 6a accordingly the outbreak size for asymptomatic cases were larger than that of imported cases figure 6b collectively the simulation suggested that asp can more rapidly trigger a coronavirus outbreak with larger outbreak sizes in current work we used modelingbased approaches to investigate the impact of asymptomatic and imported cases on the potentially new outbreaks we developed a model with two novel features asymptomatic cases and threshold behavior in recovery our model can faithfully fit the epidemic data from jiangsu and anhui provinces in china the model predictions indicated that asymptomatic cases are a more serious threat compared with importation into china the asymptomatic or covert patients can trigger outbreaks more rapidly and terminate with larger outbreak sizes if the strongly controlled measures become mild based on the daily reports from jiangsu and anhui commission of health we constructed a refined model after the closure of wuhan the start of outbreak in china we evaluated the epidemic features based on unbiased parameter estimation results suggested that both jiangsu and anhui provinces have implemented highly effective interventions low 
i values upto 1012 specifically there is stronger control in jiangsu province with significantly lower 
1 possibly leading to fewer total infections in jiangsu province furthermore based on the temporal data the proportion of asymptomatic cases in dynamic and we estimated a median proportion approximately 4446 interquartile range 37315372 which is consistent with a recent report
19

 from the sensitivity analysis we found that regulating 
2 or 
3 alone plays neglectable role to block coronavirus outbreak there is no feasible way to alter total population s and discharge rate  either the seemingly only way to impede viral transmission is simultaneously lowering mutual contacts 
i we found that the latent periods and outbreak sizes are remarkably sensitive to the contact factor f note that the surface plot was removed if there was no predicted outbreak under strong interventions f approaches 1 our model predictions suggested that even a total of 500 imported or asp will not lead to coronavirus outbreak figures 5 and 6 however if the strict interventions were attenuated f  16 in jiangsu and 13 in anhui there will be a predicted outbreak a recent estimation of mutual contact suggested that under uncontrolled situations the average contact rate ie mutual contact is increased by aproximately 30799 1032469 fold
17
 corresponding to a contact factor f  30799 in our model if f  3 our model predictions demonstrated that the latent period ie decision time to trigger an outbreak is less than 1 day and a potentially final outbreak size aproximately 107 therefore strongly controlled interventions are still required provided the undetectable populations of asymptomatic cases notably since the middle of march china has taken strong measures to control imported personnels in airports and railway stations eg quarantine and covid19 test the imported cases will be immediately isolated with no contact with susceptible populations however asp are not easily found and remain a major threat our model predictions emphasized that the asp seem to be a more devastating factor compared with imported patients identical numbers of asymptomatic cases give rise to faster outbreaks and larger outbreak sizes even minimal asp may result in significant viral transmissions or local outbreaks we suggested that covid19 tests should be used for individuals in dense populations eg students teachers or healthcare workers the extensive tests may help to identify the hidden asp to impede potential outbreaks since april 1 china has begun to include detected asymptomatic cases in daily report
24
 therefore strong interventions should be taken especially for asp owing to the unpredictable and covert features liu et al
25
 recently showed a model with asymptomatic patients however the asymptomatic patients all become diagnosed ones with symptoms and are more likely to be presymptomatic
26
 this is in contrast with the recent definition for asp
19
 
20
 
21

 our model also has limitations we did not incorporate death into our model similar to some recent models
8
 
18
 
27
 for jiangsu province there is no mortality in anhui province the mortality is extremely low 6990 06 the model can provide faithful fitting under these situations therefore our model might be helpful for understanding the epidemic features in most provinces from china however high mortality rates occur in wuhan china and several countries in europe a variable describing dead cases should be integrated with reestimated parameters the peak predictions in jiangsu and anhui model are lower than official epidemic data note that the coronavirus outbreak coincides with the traditional chinese new year the capacity for testing is therefore lowered at the start of epidemic a timevarying diagnosed rate could be incorporated to reach better model fitting despite the limitations above the current study faithfully fits the epidemic data our model has predicted that the asymptomatic cases are factors with higher risk compared with imported cases and emphasized the critical role of strict interventions the demographic stochasticity is worthy of further investigations using stochastic models the authors declare that there are no conflict of interests tzs and dw supervised the study

tan shousheng liu likun zhuang lizhen chen mengzhen dong jie zhang yongning xin   covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 formerly 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-ncov 1 broke out in wuhan china in december 2019 2 epidemics of covid-19 are now occurring worldwide 3 since the first covid-19 case in wuhan was identified on 12 december 2019 in less than 4 months 1 april 2020 the number of cumulative confirmed cases in the world has exceeded 800000 45 on 30 january 2020 the outbreak was declared an international public health emergency by the world health organization who 6 sars-cov-2 is not the first coronavirus to threaten the life and welfare of humans the years 2002 and 2012 saw the emergence of sars-cov and mers-cov 7 like sars-cov-2 the transmission of sars-cov or mers-cov is person-to-person 811 but they differ in crucial aspects most patients infected with sars-cov present with obvious clinical symptoms within a short period the disease progresses rapidly and peak viral shedding occurs in the late stage 8 few patients with sars are asymptomatic 11 mers is primarily a zoonotic disease and spread among humans was scattered and limited the symptoms were obvious and infection rarely preceded symptom onset nosocomial transmission was more troublesome than community spread 812 in contrast onset of sars-cov-2 is insidious when asymptomatic or the early symptoms are mild patients can move freely and transmit the virus 13 with an incubation period that is long and infectious 1415 these characteristics allow for easy spread and infection sources can be difficult to identify and isolate in addition the main routes of transmission are through respiratory droplets and contact 16 which is relatively easy to achieve 17 at present almost all countries in the world have recognized the seriousness of the covid-19 pandemic and implemented various measures to curb its development but asymptomatic patients are not always taken seriously by healthcare workers yet asymptomatic infections of sars-cov-2 are probably an important source of transmission the person with an asymptomatic confirmed case of infection has normal body temperature or is only slightly indisposed 18 these differences between covid-19 and sars or mers require a change in epidemic response plan only by fully researching the various characteristics and mechanisms of asymptomatic infections can we lay a theoretical foundation for deployment of the next steps in its control with that purpose this review summarizes the epidemic status transmission characteristics and clinical features of asymptomatic patients with sars-cov-2 infection multiple studies indicate that asymptomatic infections make up a large percentage of confirmed covid-19 cases a retrospective study in beijing collected data for 262 individuals with diagnosed covid-19 from 20 january to 10 february 2020 and 13 were asymptomatic 50 18 in addition 126 persons of german nationality were evacuated from hubei province to frankfurt germany on 1 february 2020 after strict screening and testing two were confirmed to have sars-cov-2 infection yet both patients were asymptomatic 19 a further epidemiological investigation 28 january to 9 february 2020 was conducted in clinics and communities in nanjing jiangsu province china the survey screened the close contacts of patients with confirmed or suspected infections the results of nucleic acid screening identified 24 confirmed sars-cov-2 carriers without any obvious symptoms of these five patients developed typical symptoms during the subsequent hospitalization while the other 19 patients remained asymptomatic 15 furthermore the ministry of health labor and welfare of japan announced on 5 march 2020 that among 696 people on the diamond princess cruise ship infected with sars-cov-2 410 were asymptomatic 20 all of the above indicates that in the community there may be a large number of unidentified asymptomatic people with contagious infections figure 1 sars-cov-2 has been detected in nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples from asymptomatic patients 11 the viral load detected in asymptomatic individuals was similar to that of symptomatic patients suggesting that people without symptoms have a strong ability to transmit the virus to others 21 in addition sars-cov-2 has been detected in the blood and stool samples of seemingly well patients 2224 and compared with the virus in respiratory secretions the virus in feces may take longer to clear 25 in general patients with symptoms of sars-cov-2 infection are admitted to hospital for detection and treatment under isolation however asymptomatic individuals may not be recognized by healthcare workers and do not self-isolate or seek treatment bai et al 14 showed that the incubation period of an asymptomatic patient was 19 days what is more hu et al 15 reported that the communicable period of asymptomatic covid-19 patient may be as high as 29 days multiple studies have found that there are asymptomatic sars-cov-2 infections in the process of crowds and family-clustered outbreaks among a family of six in shenzhen who traveled to wuhan from 29 december 2019 to 4 january 2020 five members were identified with covid-19 including an asymptomatic 10-year-old boy 11 a family of three who traveled on 22 january 2020 from wuhan to guangzhou china through the high-speed rail tested positive for sars-cov-2 but only one developed clinical symptoms and the other two members had no signs or clinical symptoms 26 infants also are not spared from sars-cov-2 infection the first pediatric case was confirmed asymptomatic in singapore the infant was part of a family transmission cluster in which its parents and their live-in helper were symptomatic 22 furthermore asymptomatic covid-19 patients can even become the source of infection in contagious outbreaks among families sars-cov-2 transmission from an asymptomatic infected person returning home from wuhan on 10 january 2020 was suspected as the cause of a family cluster epidemic of five members in anyang china 14 in fact any infected person symptomatic or asymptomatic may be the first to transmit sars-cov-2 to other members in a clustered and family-clustered outbreak at present cases of covid-19 continue to occur around the world so the rate of asymptomatic infections cannot be accurately determined identification and isolation of asymptomatic patients is essential to control virus outbreaks various studies have shown that asymptomatic persons with sars-cov-2 infection are generally not discovered until after their families relatives friends or close contacts have symptoms that are diagnosed 111421222628 therefore in order to not miss any infected patients it is best to perform screening for all close contacts of patients with confirmed or suspected infections 1519 the main tests used to diagnosis covid-19 are the sars-cov-2 nucleic acid test nat of nasopharyngeal swab samples the sars-cov-2 specific serological test and chest computed tomography ct scanning nat by reverse transcription-pcr rt-pcr is well established as the gold standard for the diagnosis of covid-19 29 but still the test is associated with false negatives due to problems with sample collection and the operating procedures 3031 therefore for cases that are highly suspicious of covid-19 but test negatively by nat diagnosis via screening with a sars-cov-2 specific serological test and chest ct scan may be of great value 283233 in one study of 285 covid-19 patients with acute antibody responses to sars-cov-2 in 19 days after the onset of symptoms 100 of the patients were positive for antiviral igg importantly the seroconversion of igg and igm occurs simultaneously or sequentially and the titers of igg and igm were found to be stable within 6 days after seroconversion 34 however if the nat result is negative and the sars-cov-2 specific serological test is positive the diagnosis still cannot be directly confirmed it is necessary to continue to observe and conduct multiple nat tests until either the nat result is positive or the sars-cov-2 specific serological test is determined to be a false positive a study conducted in the usa used 1020 serum specimens that were previously tested for hsv serology by western blotting in 2018 and 2019 prior to sars-cov-2 circulation and detected one false positive using the abbott sars-cov-2 igg test 35 in addition many studies on sars-cov-2 specific serological tests have shown that it is difficult to achieve 100 sensitivity and specificity 3637 thus for now the diagnosis of covid-19 remains a challenge globally no test method is completely mature and reliable but the combination of multiple testing methods can improve the effectiveness of screening 38 and avoid missed diagnoses and misdiagnoses as much as possible 33 it is important to note that some patients with covid-19 may experience only mild symptoms and signs kam et al 22 reported a 6-month-old infant who developed a temperature of 385c during hospitalization although for only 1 h hoehl et al 19 reported a 48-year-old german woman who experienced a mild rash and minimal pharyngitis after admission therefore persons with covid-19 may appear essentially asymptomatic but do experience very mild symptoms and can enter the recovery period without being detected therefore at the time of consultation healthcare workers should thoroughly interview the patient for any recollection of discomfort asymptomatic infection is not limited to young or middle-aged adults 21 but also children 11 infants 22 and even the elderly 27 hu et al 15 showed that asymptomatic patients were relatively young with a median age of 14 years in seven cases in addition asymptomatic infections were found in both males 19 and females 14 in general asymptomatic infected people do not suffer seriously but the virus they transmit can cause others to develop severe disease 15 those with asymptomatic infections did not always show lung changes such as ground glass opacities after ct examination and may appear normal 28 yet in other cases the typical changes in ct examination may be observed 27 changes in laboratory test indicators typical of sars-cov-2 infection have been found in some asymptomatic patients 112227 but for others indicators are normal table 1 141926 the number of people with covid-19 continues to increase asymptomatic infections are hidden and easily overlooked however their potential to spread the virus cannot be underestimated as the viral load they carried and their ability to infect close contacts may be similar to those of symptomatic individuals in addition asymptomatic infections can occur in any age range and either gender and there may be no abnormalities in laboratory tests or ct examination this complete isolation of all sources of infection in the covid-19 outbreak is a major problem for this reason measures of home quarantine and centralized isolation for observation over time have been and will continue to be necessary otherwise the pandemic will continue to cause great harm to the public and disease control will become even more complicated anyone who has had close contact with a confirmed or suspected case of covid-19 should be closely monitored and screened and therefore the centralized isolation for medical observation and related tests of covid-19 should be applied to the greatest extent possible even if they have no symptoms healthcare workers should give close attention to screening consultations and collect detailed information including the presence of even very slight symptoms overall we have objectively summarized the current transmission and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic patients with covid-19 which are deserve for further study and exploration in the future at present the number of confirmed cases of covid-19 continues to increase and various prevention and control measures continue to be needed with more in-depth research on covid-19 systematic treatment plans and guidelines have been improved so it is particularly important for patients to be diagnosed early and admitted to hospital for isolation treatment unfortunately asymptomatic patients with sars-cov-2 infection are a silent source of infection who can unknowingly place others at risk for infection therefore as more research is conducted to understand the mechanisms of sars-cov-2 infection and to develop treatment methods efforts to prevent the transmission of sars-cov-2 by asymptomatic individuals will be the key to reducing the spread of covid-19 while the epidemics of sars mers and covid-19 were all caused by coronaviruses and shared other similarities there are many differences among these diseases as well the number of cases of covid-19 far exceeds the case numbers for the other epidemics and of these three diseases covid-19 is the only one to cause a global pandemic notably this once insignificant and benign family of viruses the coronavirus has now generated three serious epidemics in the last two decades indicating the importance of remaining alert to this class of emerging infectious diseases this will be a long-term challenge and we cannot yet predict when the next coronavirus outbreak will occur what we can do is carry out more research and testing and develop better plans to handle such outbreaks in order to be better prepared when they emerge  a covid-19 case report from asymptomatic contact implication for contact isolation and incubation management chang-qiang zhu shi-ding gao yan

coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the world health organization who and coronavirus study group csg of the international committee proposed to name the new coronavirus as sars-cov-2 up to 2 march 2020 at least 80 151 cases were reported httpwwwgovcnxinwen2020-0303content5486171htm most of the patients had a history of visiting hubei province or contacting people who had ever stayed in or passed by hubei province or were exposed to symptoms 9 some patients got infected through only asymptomatic contact this study aimed to report the epidemic features and lab identification of a patient confirmed with covid-19 infection through only asymptomatic contact fig 1
 a 44-year-old man who lived in nanchang jiangxi province china got a fever of 388 c on 27 january 2020 he wore a mask and drove himself to see a doctor in a local hospital in nanchang on 30 january 2020 he was immediately hospitalized in an isolation room the pcr assay result was positive for the throat swab sample using a sars-cov-2 real-time rt-pcr kit fig 2 the patient was an instructor in a university and visited the city of huangmei hubei province he stayed with his parents and his brothers family but denied any exposure to a febrile patient or wild animals or visits to wet markets including the seafood market in wuhan
 before the onset of symptoms the patient along with his wife and son drove from nanchang to honghu city hubei province on 23 january 2020 where his parents and brother lived they did not stop by any of the expressway service area after arriving they stayed at home and did not visit any public place in honghu city in addition his parents stayed at home for 20 days with his younger brothers family before they got back his younger brother and one of his brothers children visited wuhan on 5 january and came home on 6 january 2020 after staying with his parents and brothers family for 3 days the patient drove back to nanchang and arrived on 25 january on the way back home they stopped by tongshan service area hubei province without any close contact with other people after arriving home in nanchang city jiangxi province none of them left their residence the patient began to have a cough on 27 january 2020 and took cefalexin capsules by himself fever symptoms appeared on 28 january with a maximum temperature of 388 c accompanied by cough sore throat headache fatigue muscle ache joint ache and other symptoms fig 3 the symptoms continued until he went to the doctor at the hospitals fever clinic he underwent blood routine examination and lung computed tomography ct examination fig 4
 he was not obese and had no previous basic disease on admission 30 january 2020 the physical examination revealed a body temperature of 388 c a respiratory rate of 1921 breaths per minute a pulse of 6288 per minute and a blood pressure of 76128 mmhg the initial chest radiography showed a glass density shadow of both lungs fig 4a-b on 31 january 2020 the blood routine examination revealed the following white blood cell wbc count 74  109l lymphocyte ly count 06  106l another routine test on 31 january showed the wbc count of 44  109l and a decreased c-reactive protein level of 49 mgl the lung ct examination at 800 pm showed lung lesions significantly larger compared with those on the previous day however high-resolution computed tomography on 3 february 2020 day 8 of illness revealed multiple ground-glass opacities located in both subpleural spaces fig 4c-d the blood routine examination showed mild changes in neutrophil and lymphocyte counts during admission he developed nasal congestion cough and pleuritic chest discomfort he received the following medicines treatment during hospitalization for 18 days including oral lopinavirritonavir 667167 mgkgday 12 h aerosol inhalation of interferon alpha 0833 gkgday 24 h oral lianhuaqingwen capsule 2333 mgkgday 8 h oral suhuang zhike capsule 225 mgkgday 8 h enteral nutrition 0833 gkgday 6 h thymalfasin for injection 2667 gkg3 days 72 h xuebijing injection 167 mlkgday 12 h in addition the hormone was only used for 5 days methylprednisolone sodium succinate 0667 mgkgday 24 h for 3 days methylprednisolone sodium succinate 0333 mgkgday 24 h for 1 day methylprednisolone sodium succinate 0167 mg kgday 24 h for 1 day and then stopping use hormone before the patients visit to honghu his relatives including his parents and brothers family had no disease or infection through contact or clustering after he was hospitalized the results of the coronavirus conventional pcr assay of his wife son brother and brothers wife performed once every other day were negative no farmers market was located near their residence the patient did not go to any farmers market his wife and son who were two close contacts with a final contact on 30 january 2020 had no symptoms or signs till 18 february 2020 figs 5 and 6
 this patient was diagnosed with sars-cov-2 infection his pcr test was positive but the test for seasonal influenza and adenovirus infection was negative despite flu-like symptoms and pneumonia during the first week of illness in this case report the covid-19 infection was diagnosed by a pcr test or based on clinical symptoms combined with a ct scan 10 the duration from infection to the appearance of symptoms of sars-cov-2 was not exactly known 11 generally it was thought to be 14 days but a research group at guangzhou reported the longest incubation period of 24 days 12 in addition asymptomatic transmission of sars-cov-2 is an important topic and asymptomatic infections of sars-cov-2 could complicate disease control 13 the report of diamond princess showed that a large number of asymptomatic carriers might remain undiscovered in the community 14 mao et al reported that the asymptomatic ratio of covid-19 was 26 2 out of 78 confirmed cases 15 nishiura et al estimated 416 of cases among 565 japanese individuals evacuated from wuhan china were asymptomatic case 16 as of 4 april 2020 150 asymptomatic case out of 915 confirmed cases were reported in hong kong giving a ratio of 164 17 hu et al provided evidence for transmission from an asymptomatic infector to close contacts that result in severe covid-19 pneumonia 18 these findings suggest that asymptomatic carriers should be considered a source of covid-19 infection in this study the patients wife son parents and brothers family had no symptoms or signs between 5 january and 18 february 2020 after the patient was hospitalized rt-pcr tests of his wife son brother and brothers wife performed once every other day were negative their pcr results were negative probably because the virus was eliminated due to the long-time interval or the viral load was too low to be detected or the test results were false negative moreover the patients parents and nephews a and b did not undergo the rt-pcr test for sars-cov-2 infection and hence whether they were carriers was not confirmed no suspected or confirmed cases were reported in nanchang within 14 days of the departure of the patient from the site on 23 january therefore it was difficult to predict who might have passed the virus to the patient any of the relatives could have served as an intermediary of the virus except for his wife and son fig 7
 this case report highlighted the possibility of developing sars-cov-2 infection through an asymptomatic contact it indicated the need for contact isolation especially for those who returned from the epidemic area without any symptoms 19 20 in addition this report suggested that in the early phase of covid-19 routine screening could miss diagnosing patients who were virus carriers the frequency of such transmissions of asymptomatic infection remains to be determined the scale of transmission through an asymptomatic contact during the early phase of infection should be explored urgently in conclusion this report indicated that highlighting travel history is of paramount importance for the early detection and isolation of sars-cov-2 cases the findings might be used as a reference for the prevention and control during this global outbreak of covid-19  ct imaging and clinical course of asymptomatic cases with covid-19 pneumonia at admission in wuhan china heng meng rui xiong ruyuan he weichen lin bo hao lin zhang zilong lu xiaokang shen tao fan wenyang jiang wenbin yang tao li jun chen geng qing   in december 2019 a novel coronavirus currently designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 formerly called 2019-ncov was first identified in wuhan china sars-cov-2 caused a respiratory disease called coronavirus 2019 covid-19 which was officially named by the world health organization who on february 11 2020 covid-19 had caused severe illness and death in china and had spread to countries around the world1 2 3 4 by march 30 2020 a total of 82447 confirmed cases have been reported in china5 moreover 552479 cases have been confirmed in other countries mainly in america italy and spain5 the main symptoms of covid-19 are fever dry cough fatigue sputum production shortness of breath and sore throat6 asymptomatic infected individuals called asymptomatic carrier or transmitter may also become the contagious source of sars-cov-2 and some of them progress rapidly even resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome ards with a high case-fatality rate7 8 9 10 however the positive rate of sars-cov-2 nucleic acid testing by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr which is the golden standard for the diagnosis of covid-19 is only about 30-50 the high false-negative result rate of sars-cov-2 nucleic acid testing inevitably increases the difficulty in managing the current covid-19 outbreak as the misdiagnosed patients might miss the best timing for proper treatment and cause the spread of disease11 the chest computed tomography ct especially high-resolution ct hrct is also the main diagnostic method followed by pneumonia diagnosis and treatment guideline for sars-cov-2 infection trial version 5 issued by national health commission of the peoples republic of china httpwwwnhcgovcn ct findings plays an important role in detecting lung abnormalities facilitate the early identification of the diseases we aimed to characterize the ct imaging features and clinical course of asymptomatic patients with covid-19 pneumonia admitted to our hospital in order to have a more comprehensive understanding of asymptomatic patients with covid-19 facilitate detection and isolation of patients with covid-19 pneumonia especially in the highly suspicious asymptomatic cases with negative nucleic acid testing the study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the declaration of helsinki the study was a retrospective analysis and approved by the ethics committee of renmin hospital of wuhan university

every 3-7 days the clinical data including gender age course comorbidities epidemiologic characteristics laboratory results and ct findings were collected and analyzed retrospectively all ct scans were obtained using one of the following scanners optima ct680 revolution ct bright speed ge healthcare system milwaukee wi usa  gehw healthcare system beijing china scans were done from the level of the thoracic entrance to the inferior level of the costophrenic angle with patients in a supine head-first position and breath-holding manner and the following parameters were used slice thickness 10125 mm tube voltage 120 kv the tube current was regulated by an automatic exposure control system asir ge healthcare images were reconstructed with a slice thickness of 0625mm and an interval of 0625 mm respectively using ge aw workstation aw 46 and aw47 the reconstructed ct images were transmitted to the workstation and picture archiving and communication systems pacs for multiplanar reconstruction post-processing all ct images were independently reviewed by two experienced thoracic radiologists blinded to the clinical data all discrepancies were resolved by consensus the features

 ggo was defined as hazy opacity that did not obscure underlying bronchial and vascular margins consolidation was the opacity with obscuration of bronchial and vascular structures reticulation is a collection of innumerable small linear opacities halo sign is a ground-glass opacity surrounding a nodule or mass interlobular septal thickening is thin linear opacities at right angles to and in contact with the lateral pleural surfaces near the lung bases crazy-paving pattern was defined as thickened interlobular septa and intralobular lines superimposed on a background of ggo resembling irregularly shaped paving stones12
 the clinical characteristics and laboratory results of this cohort are presented in table 1
 58 patients 26 male and 32 female were enrolled all patients had a clear exposure to covid-19 all 58 patients were asymptomatic at admission the average age of patients was 42601656 years old based on the ct findings of first reexamination after admission 58 patients were divided into four groups 1 absorption group 22 cases 379 2 improvement group 23 cases 3973 no change group 3 cases 52 4 progression group 10 cases 172 see figure 2
 among these asymptomatic patients 16 patients 276 presented symptoms after admission including fever 8 cases 50 cough 9 cases 563 fatigue 8 cases 50 shortness of breath 2 cases 125 and diarrhea 1 case 63 in these 16 patients 10 patients 625 were in lesion progression group 3 patients 1875 were in lesion improvement group and 3 patients 1875 were in no change group the average days before symptoms onset is 371286 days patients in lesion progression group have shorter days before symptoms onset 325277 day ct findings at admission showed abnormalities in all patients seen in figure 1 less than half of the patients 24 414 presented bilateral lesions 34 586 patients showed unilateral lung distribution including 14 241 in left lung and 20 345 in right lung the lesions mostly located in peripheral 44 759 and 14 241 patients presented central distribution the involvement of lower lobes right 689 vs left 621 was a bit more than that of the upper lobes right 517 vs left 534 24 414 patients had single lobe involved 14 241 patients had involved of two lobes and 20 345 patients had three or more lobes involved the most common pattern of ct findings was ggo 55948 including simple ggo in 30 cases 517 ggo with fine reticulation in 7 cases 121 ggo with subpleural curviliner line in 6 cases 103 ggo with air bronchogram in 5 cases 86 ggo with halo sign in 5 cases 86 and ggo with vascular enlargement in 2 cases 35 another ct feature consolidation was presented in 3 cases 52 compared with the ct images at admission there were evolution of ct manifestations in 10 patients at the first reexamination after admission lesions were fused to form patchy crazy-paving signs or diffusion pattern distributed in multiple lung lobes or bilateral and a few patients showed consolidation in ct imaging in these patients there were significantly lower lymphocyte countp0009 higher c-reactive protein p0023 than that in other cases the average days of hospitalization is 19801082 days and the hospitalization of patients 2860755 day in progression group was significantly longer than othersp0016 six previously known coronaviruses including the sars coronavirus sars cov which first appeared in china in 2003 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers cov which first appeared in the middle east in september 2012 are zoonoses and highly pathogenic coronaviruses the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 as the 7th coronavirus discovered has high contagion and pathogenicity so far more than 700000 thousand cases with covid-19 have been confirmed in the world with the global outbreak of sars-cov-2 more and more facts show that many patients with covid-19 pneumonia have no symptoms or only mild symptoms but they can transmit sars-cov-2 to others7 8 9 10 11 the latest research showed that 30 - 60 of patients with sars-cov-2 infected had no symptoms or mild symptoms but their ability to spread the virus was not low and these covert sars-cov-2 infections could be seeding new outbreaks7 it is essential to fully understand the asymptomatic or mild symptomatic cases covert sars-cov-2 infections to control the epidemic of sars-cov-2 the diagnosis of covid-19 is mainly based on the epidemiological history symptoms laboratory results imaging findings and virus nucleic acid detection according to the chinese guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment plan of sars-cov-2 infection by the national health commission trial version 513 although sars-cov-2 nucleic acid testing is the golden standard for the diagnosis of covid-19 due to qualification of the specimen sampling from nasopharyngeal swab and the detection kit the positive rate of sars-cov-2 nucleic acid testing is just about 30-5011 furthermore the supply of the detection kit limits its widespread use in the outbreak of covid-19 especially in those areas with limited health care resources chest ct scan is of great value in the diagnosis of covid-19 in the outbreak of covid-19 in this cohort all 58 asymptomatic cases with covid-19 pneumonia confirmed by sars-cov-2 nucleic acid testing and ct scan had history of exposure to sars-cov-2 at the time of admission all patients had not any symptoms but all had abnormal ct findings ggo was the main ct manifestation in this cluster of patients 55 948 consolidation was present in other 3 patients 52 the lesions of ct imaging in asymptomatic patients with covid-19 pneumonia were predominantly located in the peripheral and subpleural area of the lung 44 759 mostly involving one or two lung lobes 38 655 ggo lesions were inclined to distribute in the lower lobes left 621 vs right 689 in addition to pure ggo it is often accompanied by other characteristic imaging including fine reticuticulatio subpleural curviliner line halo sign air bronchogram and vascular enlargement14 15 16 17 the ct manifestations of covid-19 pneumonia had its pathophysiological basis18 since the diameter of sars-cov-2 is about 60-140nm and the size of the alveolar pores is about 10-15m after inhaled through the respiratory tract sars-cov-2 invades the bronchioles mainly involving the interstitium around bronchioles at the end of lobular bronchioles causing bronchiolitis and peribronchitis and spreads to the distal end therefore the lesion originates from a round-like nodule in the core of the secondary lung lobule which were usually shown as round ground-glass opacity at first and then extends to the whole secondary pulmonary lobules forming lobular patchy imaging sars-cov-2 mainly invades the interlobular interstitium resulting in the appearance of fine reticulation sign halo sign is the image that the lesion infiltrates from central nodule of lobule core to surrounding interstitium and accumulation of inflammatory cells in interstitium the virus spreads along both sides of reticular structure of the interlobular septa leading to the sign that the long axis of the lesion is parallel to the pleura inflammatory stimulation leads to thickening of blood vessels in the lesion which results in a corresponding alteration on imaging compared with the ct manifestation at admission there were significant changes presented in ct findings after short-term treatment including lesion absorption 22 cases 379 lesion improvement 23 cases 397 lesion no change 3 cases 52 and lesion progression 10 cases 172 after admission 16 patients 276 presented symptoms predominantly including fever 8 cases 50 cough 9 cases 563 fatigue 8 cases 50 the average days before symptoms onset is 371286 days patients in lesion progression group have shorter days than other group 325277 day in these 16 patients 10 patients 172 were in lesion progression group the results indicated in asymptomatic patients with covid-19 pneumonia with the disease progress about 25 cases present symptoms and the evolution of ct findings were shown in 17 patients in the short-term follow-up the average age of patients in lesion progression group was 57402254 much older than other patients p0016 this may indicate that younger patients with pneumonia have strong immunity and recover quickly with the progress of the inflammation scatttered lesion gradually fused to form patchy crazy-paving pattern even diffusion appearance in ct manifestation all the asymptomatic patients with covid-19 pneumonia discharged after treatment the mean days of hospitalization was 19801082 days and the hospitalization of patients in progression group was 2860755 day significantly longer than other cases p0016 the cases recruited in this study were all asymptomatic patients with covid-19 pneumonia which were confirmed by positive results of sars-cov-2 nucleic acid testing and abnormal findings in ct imaging the predominant feature of ct findings in asymptomatic patients with covid-19 pneumonia was ground glass opacity with peripheral distribution unilateral location and mostly involving one or two lobes often combined with subpleural curviliner line fine reticulation air bronchogram halo sign or vascular enlargement signs after a short-term follow-up a few asymptomatic patients presented clinical symptom mainly fever cough and fatigue and the evolution of ct findings was shown in patients with the progression of disease in summary ct images of asymptomatic cases with covid-19 pneumonia have definite characteristics since the asymptomatic patients with covid-19 is called covert transmitter covert sars-cov-2 infections could be seeding new outbreaks and some patients can progress rapidly in the short term therefore it is essential to pay attention to the surveillance of asymptomatic patients with covid-19 ct examination plays a vital role in managing the current covid-19 outbreak for early detection of covid-19 pneumonia especially in the highly suspicious asymptomatic cases with negative sars-cov-2 nucleic acid testing

is a continuously devastating public health and the world economy one of the major challenges in controlling the covid-19 outbreak is its asymptomatic infection and transmission which are elusive and defenseless in most situations the pathogenicity and virulence of asymptomatic covid-19 remain mysterious based on the genotyping of 20656 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 genome isolates we reveal that asymptomatic infection is linked to sars-cov-2 11083gt mutation ie leucine l to phenylalanine f substitution at the residue 37 l37f of nonstructure protein 6 nsp6 by analyzing the distribution of 11083gt in various countries we unveil that 11083gt may correlate with the hypotoxicity of sars-cov-2 moreover we show a global decaying tendency of the 11083gt mutation ratio indicating that 11083gt hinders sars-cov-2 transmission capacity sequence alignment found both nsp6 and residue 37 neighborhoods are relatively conservative over a few coronaviral species indicating their importance in regulating host cell autophagy to undermine innate cellular defense against viral infection using machine learning and topological data analysis we demonstrate that mutation l37f has made nsp6 energetically less stable the rigidity and flexibility index and several network models suggest that mutation l37f may have compromised the nsp6 function leading to a relatively weak sars-cov subtype this assessment is a good agreement with our genotyping of sars-cov-2 evolution and transmission across various countries and regions over the past few months  the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has spread to more than 215 countries and territories with 8385440 positive cases and 450686 fatalities as of june 19 2020 40  unlike sars-cov that mainly infects the lower respiratory tract sars-cov-2 is observed with a high level of shedding at the upper respiratory tract 41  a wide variety of covid-19 symptoms have been reported including fever or chills body or muscle aches headache stuffy or congested nose dry cough fatigue sore throat and loss of taste or smell 2-14 days after exposure to the virus 41  severe symptoms like high fever severe cough and shortness of breath indicate the onset of pneumonia less common gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea nausea and vomiting have been listed at the centers for disease control and prevention currently symptom-based testing contact tracing isolation and quarantine are the main strategies for controlling and combating covid-19 however viable viruses have also been isolated from asymptomatic cases 31  asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases can play an important role in transmitting coronavirus 23  elusive asymptomatic transmission is regarded as the achilles heel of current strategies to control covid-19 24  early studies with 235 cases of influenza virus infections indicate that the duration of influenza viral shedding was shorter and decayed faster and quantitative viral loads were lower in asymptomatic than in symptomatic cases 27 the epidemiological and virological characteristics of covid-19 asymptomatic pathogenicity remains a mystery sars-cov-2 is a non-segmented positive-sense rna virus that belongs to the -coronavirus genus coronaviridae family and nidovirales order many rna viruses such as the flu virus are prone to mutations due to the lack of proofreading in their genetic evolutions viral mutations are driven by a variety of factors including replication mechanism polymerase fidelity access to proofreading or post-replicative repair sequence context cellular environment and host immune responses or gene editing 34  benefit from an error-correction mechanism common to the nidovirales order the replication of coronavirus is regulated by a bi-functional enzyme nonstructure protein 14 nsp14 19  therefore sars-cov-2 maintains relatively high accuracy in virus replication and transcription compared with the flu virus nonetheless sars-cov-2 has had 10620 single mutations for the genome collected on january 5 2020 38 42  although the impacts of mutations on sars-cov-2 transmission and pathogenicity 2 20 and covid-19 diagnosis vaccine and medicine have been studied 38  little is known about the connection between viral evolution and asymptomatic transmissions this work reports the first association of a sars-cov-2 single nucleotide polymorphism snp variant and covid-19 asymptomatic cases based on the genotyping of 20656 sars-cov-2 genome isolates we reveal a significant correlation between asymptomatic infections and sars-cov-2 single mutation 11083gt-l37f on nsp6 nsp6 is a common protein of  and -coronaviruses that locate at the endoplasmic reticulum er 9  as a multiple-spanning transmembrane protein coronavirus nsp6 participates in viral autophagic regulation autophagy degrades alien components to provide an innate defense against viral infection and promote cell death and morbidity 32  in response to extreme cases of starvation autophagy generates autophagosomes to transfer long-lived proteins unnecessary or dysfunctional components to lysosomes for orderly degradation studies show that nsp6 undermines the capability of autophagosomes to transport viral components to lysosomes for degradation by rendering smaller diameter autophagosomes in nutrient-rich media and thus enhancing viral replication 9  additionally nsp6 proteins induce a higher number of autophagosomes per cell compared with starvation to facilitate the assembly of replicase proteins 4 9  although further studies are required to understand the molecular mechanism of the nsp6 regulation of autophagy it is clear that coronavirus nsp6 is extremely important to viral protein folding viral assembly and the replication cycle it is of paramount importance to understand how nsp6 mutation l37f leads to covid-19 asymptomatic transmission and reduced virulence we show that nsp6 is a relatively conservative protein and the region around residues is quite conservative over several sars-cov-2 related genomes to maintain the crucial regulative function of nsp6 using artificial intelligence ai topological data analysis tda and a variety of network models we further demonstrate that mutation l37f disrupts the folding stability of nsp6 we uncover the correlation between nsp6 mutation l37f and weakened sars-cov-2 virulence we also analyze the global transmission and find the decay tendency of nsp6 mutation l37f we prove that the evolutionary dynamics of l37f is ageand gender-independent we analyze 20656 sars-cov-2 complete genome sequences deposited in gisaid  httpswwwgisaido rg database up to june 19 2020 among them 7243 samples have patient status information recorded as asymptomatic symptomatic hospitalized icu deceased and so on in particular 83 samples are labeled with asymptomatic 53 and symptomatic 30 cases by genotyping 53 genome samples we find that mutation 1083gt is significantly relevant with asymptomatic infection with a p-value being much smaller than 005 mutation 11083gt changes leucine l residue at position 37 of nsp6 to phenylalanine f denoted as l37f in the following sections we investigate the relationship between mutation 11083gt-l37f and asymptomatic infections using both gene-specific analysis and protein-specific analysis the global evolution and transmission pathway of the mutation is studied as well our customized dataset generated from genotyping 20656 sars-cov-2 complete genome sequences downloaded from the gisaid database is summarized in table 1  here patient status referred to as incomplete records of asymptomatic symptomatic hospitalized deceased gender etc additionally our dataset contains data collection dates and locations of genome isolates the detailed information of our dataset is available in the supporting information we first analyze 83 sequences that have either asymptomatic or symptomatic labels submitted from japan the statistic analysis shows that the pearson correlation coefficient between asymptomatic records and 10083gt is 0606 moreover the p-value is 12910 9  which reveals the significant relevance between asymptomatic and single mutation 11083gt-l37f next we split our genotyping dataset of 20656 sequences into different countries and extract those records with the 11083gt mutation table 2 summarizes the total number of sequences related to 11083gt-l37f denoted as n l37f  the total number of sequences n s  the 11083gt-l37f ratio the number of total cases the number of total deaths and the death ratio of 25 countries up to june 19 2020 respectively a complete table for all countriesregions can be found in the supporting information table 2 suggests that the 11083gt-l37f ratio correlates with the death ratio for example singapore has the highest 11083gt-l37f mutation ratio as of 0644 a piece of recent news reported that half of the covid-19 cases in singapore are symptomless 25  which matches our finding that mutation 11083gt-l37f is relevant to the asymptomatic infections moreover singapore has the second-lowest death ratio as listed in table 2  suggesting that single mutation 11083gt-l37f may have weakened sars-cov-2 virulence a similar deduction can be obtained from the records of turkey jordan norway australia and south korea the relatively high 11083gt-l37f mutation ratio greater than 0200 with a correspondingly low death ratio less than 300 further validates that 11083gt-l37f may be relevant to the asymptomatic-induced the hypotoxicity of sars-cov-2 moreover 11 out of 17 countries whose mutation ratios are less than 0200 have a death ratio greater than 45 the death ratios of the united kingdom belgium france and spain are even higher than 10 which supports our assumption that mutation 11083gt-l37f weakens sars-cov-2 virulence figure 1 illustrates the number of complete sars-cov-2 sequences in our dataset with 11083gt-l37f detected versus the number of complete sars-cov-2 sequences without 11083gt-l37f detected every 10 days in singapore japan india china united kingdom italy united states australia and spain as well as two states in the united states new york and washington the blue and red bar represents the 11083gt-l37f counts and other mutation counts every ten-day period respectively similar bar plots for all countriesregions involving this specific mutation can be found in the supporting information singapores plot shows that 11083gt was widely found after march 24 2020 which is consistent with the report saying that at least half of singapores newly discovered covid-19 cases show no symptoms 25  almost all of the cases collected from february 12 to february 22 have 11083gt mutation with asymptomatic infections recorded which is the most robust evidence to associate the sars-cov-2 11083gt or l37f mutation on nsp6 with the asymptomatic infections india is one of the countries that also have a large number of 11083gt mutation cases recent news reported that 80 percent of all coronavirus patients in india were asymptomatic or showed mild symptoms 12  which supports our deduction that 11083gt correlates with the asymptomatic infection moreover one can see that mutation 11083gt in china the united kingdom and australia is not as abundant as in singapore japan or india furthermore as discussed before the asymptomatic infection may associate with the hypotoxicity of sars-cov-2 as well note that from figure 1  china the united states spain and italy have a relatively lower occurrence of 11083gt which may contribute to the relatively high death ratio however this specific mutation is not the only factor in determining the death ratio the number of total infected cases diagnostic testing medical and health conditions age structure nursing-home population etc are also critical factors for example japan has a second-highest ratio of 11083gt-l37f while the death ratio is greater than 5 percent similarly the united kingdom has the third-highest death ratio suggesting its ratio of mutation 11083gt-l37f is not at the last echelon one of the possible reasons is that the healthcare system was heavily broken by a sudden increase in infected cases the lack of proper healthcare attention to a large number of midsevere covid-19 cases resulted in a high mortality ratio note that although russia has the lowest 11083gt-l37f mutation ratio lists in table 2  its 137 death ratio caused by covid-19 is also relatively low one possible reason is russias relatively low median age in total 53 genome samples were related to 11083gt among 542 samples that were collected from may 14 to may 24 in new york after that fewer cases were collected in new york and the 11083gt mutation ratio decreased also the state of washington had a small proportion of 11083gt mutation before may 13 2020 in the first week of june 26 out of 27 genome sequences had mutation 11083gt which may indicate that the asymptomatic infection is becoming increasingly prevalent in washington during the last few months the proportion of the 11083gt mutation in the united kingdom has gone down as shown in figure 1  globally the ratio of samples with the 11083gt mutation over all samples shown in the middle chart of the last row in figure 1 decays over time suggesting the mutation is unfavorable to the viral transmission two abnormal peaks appeared on february 22 and june 2 in the ratio were due to the l37f mutation counts from japan and washington respectively the relatively small numbers of total genome sequences at these dates induce the jumps unfortunately the number of genome sequences decays rapidly after april as shown in figure 1  while globally the number of sars-cov-2 infections increasing steadily according to the whos daily situation reports  httpswwwwhointem ergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019situation-reports in this section we track the global transmission pathways of the single mutation 11083gt-l37f to understand its spread dynamics we found that the first genome containing single mutation 11083gt-l37f was sequenced in chongqing china on january 18 2020 which can be considered as the ancestor of 11083gt in our dataset however the complete genome sequences released on the gisaid do not include all of the infected cases mutation 11083gt also detected in a co-mutation record 8782ct 11083gt 28144tc in yunnan china one day earlier than chongqings sequence which indicates that the true ancestor of 11083gt might have occurred early than january 18 2020 note that the first sars-cov-2 sequence released in gisaid was collected in wuhan china on december 24 2019 chinas covid19 epicenter wuhan implemented a lockdown on january 23 2020 which explains why china has a relatively low ratio of 11083gt-l37f mutation the first confirmed case reported by the singapore government was on january 23 2020 interestingly the first genome sequence related to mutation 11083gt-l37f was found in singapore on january 292020 only a few days after the first confirmed cases therefore the transmission of covid-19 in singapore at the initial stage contains a large proportion of the11083gt-l37f mutation the prevalence of the11083gt-l37f mutation in singapores sars-cov-2 infections explains its low death ratio mutation 11083gt-l37f first appeared in the united states on january 22 2020 in arizona a 26year-old male with co-mutations 8782ct 11083gt 28144tc 29095ct which is the descendant of 8782ct 11083gt 28144tc found in china since then more records related to 11083gt have appeared in the united states at this stage 236 genome isolates from the united states in our dataset are relevant to 11083gt france and italy are the following countries that found the 11083gt mutation at an early stage both of them detected this mutation on jan 29 2020 although 11083gt mutation has arrived in the united states and the united kingdom at a very early stage different subtypes of sars-cov-2 spread vastly due to their large population which makes the 11083gt mutation non-dominated in jordan the earliest sequence released on gisaid is on march 16 2020 with 11083gt mutation which indicates the high 11083gt ratio in jordan note that multiple reasons may lead to a low death ratio of 090 in jordan one may be due to the hypotoxicity of sars-cov-2 caused by mutation 11083gt the other is that the healthcare system is in good condition due to the small number of infected patients the first confirmed covid-19 cases reported by the vietnamese government was on january 16 2020 however the first genome isolates related to mutation 11083gt in our dataset was collected on march 17 2020 the 11083gt was found in vietnam two months after the first confirmed cases which result in a low 11083gt mutation ratio surprisingly none of the patients died in vietnam as a low-middle income country with nearly 100 million population and a much less-advanced healthcare system than other countries such as italy the united kingdom and france vietnams success in tackling covid-19 attracts attention they immediately took action to ban the foreign nationals entries and implement strict social distancing rules which is the essential factor in keeping the coronavirus death toll at zero mutations the color of the dominated type of mutation decides the base color of each state one can see that oregon alaska texas and ohio have a higher proportion of 11083gt than the other states while the death ratio in oregon alaska and texas is lower than the average death ratio 547 in the united states as of june 19 2020 note that although the ratio of mutation 11083gt in nevada is 1 only one genome sequence was submitted from nevada hence it is insignificant in the statistics 20656 complete genome sequences 9923 cases have age labels and 9437 cases male cases 4993 and female cases 4444 have gender labels which are used for our age-related and gender-related analysis respectively overall male cases have a slightly higher ratio of the 11083gt-l37f mutation than female cases in terms of age distribution the ratio is significantly higher in the age group of 99-109 years however only 7 cases fall into this group and all data were collected from the united kingdom 2 cases and singapore 5 cases more data and further studies are required to draw any conclusion from this group therefore we conclude that mutation 11083gt-l37f is quite evenly distributed over age and gender groups implying that the mutation does not have a host-dependent behavior figure 3 depicts the sequence and structural information of nsp6 figure 3 a is generated by an online server 30  figure 3 b is plotted by pymol 11  and figure 3 c is created by 1  as shown in figure 3 a nsp6 is a multi-span membrane protein in mutation 11083gt-l37f both leucine and phenylalanine are -amino acids and non-polar however phenylalanine has a benzyl ring on the side chain making the secondary structure of nsp6 more compact as shown in figures 3a and c from the nsp6 protein residue position 34 to 37 the residues are fffl therefore there will be four continuous phenylalanine amino acid ffff after the l37f mutation as a result mutation l37f can stiffen the nsp6 structure by the aromatic-aromatic hydrophobic or -stacking interactions such an additional interaction can significantly change nsp6 function 4  figure 3 c presents the alignment of the sars-cov-2 nsp6 sequence with those of the other four coronaviruses including that of sars-cov the sequence identities between sars-cov-2 nsp6 and the nsp6s of sars-cov 28  ratg13 46  zc45 26  bm48-31 13 are 872 997 979 and 838 respectively note that the overall sequence identity between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov is 838 therefore nsp6 is relatively conservative additionally nsp6 position 37 is in a relatively conservative environment among different species position 37 for all other species is valine which is also hydrophobic and extremely similar to leucine two amino acids differ by one -ch 2 -unit a large region from 25 to 45 has only three mutations among five species indicating the region is potentially important for the protein function there three-dimensional 3d structure of nsp6 is displayed in figure 3 b to further understand the impact of mutation l37f on nsp6 we carry several theoretical analyses using ai 6  tda 8  flexibility and rigidity index fri 43  and a large number of other network theory models 15  our results are summarized in table 3  the protein folding stability change following mutations is defined by g  g m  g w  where g w is the free energy change of the wild type and g m is the free energy change of the mutant type 6  the folding stability change g measures the difference between folded and unfolded states thus a negative g means the mutation causing destabilization and vice versa we use a tda-based deep learning method 6 to compute g in this work as shown in table 3  a negative folding stability change g is found for the mutation indicating a destabilizing mutation l37f for nsp6 physically a large hydrophobic residue f at the lipid bilayer and solvent interface reduces nsp6 stability considering the sequence alignment in figure 3 c we have also carried a similar calculation for the mutation of l37v and found its g  071 kcalmol therefore leucine is favored at residue position 37 for sars-cov-2 nsp6 next the fri rigidity index r  measures the geometric compactness and topological connectivity of the network consisting of c  at each residue and the heavy atoms involved in the mutation 43  the scale parameter  determines the range of pairwise interactions in this work the parameter  is set to 8 as shown in table 3  the increase in the fri rigidity index r  is found indicating the increase in the rigidity of the first alpha helix of nsp6 it is known that protein flexibility is required to allow it to function through molecular interactions within the cell among cells and even between organisms 37  the quadruplet phenylalanine resulting from mutation l37f can significantly reduce nsp6s interactions with er moreover seven network models 15 are utilized to analyze the l37f mutation in nsp6 as shown in table 3  we consider the network of heavy atoms at residue 37 and c  atoms in nsp6 the connections are allowed between any pair of atoms within a cutoff distance of 80 the mutation-induced decrease in the edge density d is due to the factor that the mutation increases the edge on the surface of the protein the mutation induced the decrease in the average path length l is owing to the mutation increases the edge with shorter distances the mutation induced the decrease in average betweenness centrality c b is due to the increase in the crowd of vertices by the mutation residue the mutation induced the increase in average eigencentrality c e is because increase in the number of the connected components will enlarge the maximal eigenvalues the mutation induced the increase in the average subgraph centrality c s is due to the decrease in the average participating rate of each edge the mutation induced the decrease in average communicability m is due to the decrease in the neighbor edges participating rate of each edge finally the mutation induced the increase in average communicability angle  is due to the increase in the alignments among different edges together with the fri rigidity index and the

syndrome 2 sars-cov-2 have been reported worldwide in the past few months little is known about the formation mechanism and virological characteristics of asymptomatic infections this work parses 20656 complete genome sequences of sars-cov-2 and for the first time reveals the relationship between asymptomatic cases and a single nucleotide mutation 11083gt-l37f on nsp6 after genotyping 83 sequences with asymptomatic and symptomatic records we find 11083gt is significantly relevant to the asymptomatic infection by analyzing the distribution of 11083gt in various countries we unveil that the 11083gt mutation correlates with the death ratio in singapore the united states the united kingdom etc inferring the correlation between the asymptomatic infection and the hypotoxicity of sars-cov-2 moreover we track the dynamics of 11083gt mutation ratio globally and discover its decaying tendency indicating that 11083gt mutation hinders sars-cov-2 transmission furthermore the analysis of the distribution of 11083gt in different ages and genders unveils that 11083gt-driven mutation does not have a host-dependent behavior the protein-specific analysis is also taken into consideration the 11083gt mutation leads leucine l residue at position 37 of nsp6 changing to phenylalanine f by employing the graph network analysis and topology-based mutation predictor we find that 11083gt-l37f destabilizes the structure of nsp6 in protein-wise as one of the most conservative proteins of sars-cov-2 nsp6 involves in the viral autophagic regulation therefore this destabilized mutation may result in the inefficiency of nsp6 to participate in the viral protein folding viral assembly and replication cycle which underpins our deduction that 11083gt-l37f may be relevant to the asymptomatic infections and weaken the sars-cov-2 virulence bristol-myers squibb and pfizer the authors thank the ibm tj watson research center the covid-19 high performance computing consortium

the sars-cov-2 nsp6 l37f mutation the networks consist of heavy atoms of mutation site 37 and c atoms of sars-cov-2 nsp6 the differences of descriptors between the network with wild type leucine and

mutation site and at the c  atoms of sars-cov-2 nsp6 figures 5 a b  c and d present the mutation-induced differences of fri rigidity index differences eigencentrality differences subgraph centrality differences and betweenness respectively although these descriptors do not change much globally their local changes around the mutation site reveal the l37f mutation-induced stress around the mutation site figures 5 e and f show the dependence of relative changes over cutoff distances first of all every descriptor converges as the cutoff distance increase relative changes do not fluctuate for cutoff distance greater than 24 the relative change of fri rigidity index monotonically decreases in absolute value as the cutoff increases similarly the edge density has a monotonically decreasing pattern the two networks are close in the path length descriptor interestingly betweenness centrality descriptor has the largest difference at 10 cutoff distance while the eigencentrality descriptor has the largest difference at 22 cutoff distance for betweenness centrality it shows that the mutation has the largest impact in the network of c  within 10 to any atoms of the target residue in figure 5 f three descriptors show a similar pattern -they increase in absolute value first and then decrease eventually as the cutoff increases overall the relative change plots indicate that the mutation happening at l37 has the largest impact on the c  within 10 to any atoms of the target residue on january 5 2020 the complete genome sequence of sars-cov-2 was first released on genbank access number nc 0455122 by zhangs group at fudan university 42  since then there has been a rapid accumulation of sars-cov-2 genome sequences in this work 20656 complete genome sequences with high coverage of sars-cov-2 strains from the infected individuals in the world were downloaded from the gisaid database 35  httpswwwgisaidorg as of june 19 2020 all the records in gisaid without the exact submission date were not taken into considerations to rearrange the 20656 complete genome sequences according to the reference sars-cov-2 genome multiple sequence alignment msa is carried out by using clustal omega 36 with default parameters the amino acid sequence of nsp6 is downloaded from genbank 3  the three-dimensional 3d structure of nonstructure protein 6 nsp6 in this work is generated by i-tasser model 44  the 3d structure graph is created by using pymol 11  single nucleotide polymorphism snp genotyping measures the genetic variations between different members of a species establishing the snp genotyping method to the investigation of the genotype changes during the transmission and evolution of sars-cov-2 is of great importance 38 45  by analyzing the rearranged genome sequences snp profiles which record all of the snp positions in teams of the nucleotide changes and their corresponding positions can be constructed the snp profiles of a given sars-cov-2 genome isolated from a covid-19 patient capture all the differences from a complete reference genome sequence and can be considered as the genotype of the individual sars-cov-2 in this work the prediction of nsp6 folding energy changes upon mutation is computed by using the topology based mutation predictor tml-mp  httpsweilabmathmsuedutmltml-mp which is briefly reviewed as following and its detail can be found in the literature 6  tml-mp applies element specific persistent homology which reveals essential biological information 8 14  the method employs the element-specific persistent homology 7 and other biological and chemical properties as machine learning features to train gradient boosted regression tree gbrt models the dataset includes 2648 mutations instances in 131 proteins provided by dehouck et al 10  the error analysis based on the dataset is given as pearson correlations coefficient r p  of 079 and root mean square error rmse of 091 kcalmol from previous work 6  as the persistent homology widely applied in a variety of practical feature generation problems it is also successful in the implementation of predictions of protein folding energy changes upon mutation the key idea in tml-mp is to use the element-specific persistent homology esph which distinguishes different element types of biomolecules when building persistent homology barcodes for instance commonly occurring protein element types include c n o s and h however hydrogen atoms are often absent from pdb data and sulfur atoms are too few in most proteins to be statistically important thus c n and o elements are considered on the esph in protein characterization as for persistent homology barcodes generated based on esph provide a topological representation of molecular interactions features are extracted from the different dimensions of persistent homology barcodes by dividing barcodes into several equally spaced bins which is called binned barcode representation the auxiliary features such as geometry electrostatics amino acid types composition and amino acid sequence are also included for machine learning training the element specific persistent homology is built by adopting the distance function dia i  a j  describing the distance between two atoms a i and a j defined as where loc denotes the location of an atom which is either in a mutant site or in the rest of the protein and de  is the euclidean distance between the two atoms then the persistent homology uses simplicial complexes with a specific rule such as vietoris-rips complex cech complex or alpha complex vietoris-rips complex vc is used for characterizing first-order interaction where alpha complex ac is used for characterizing higher-order patterns using esph to characterize interactions of different kinds we construct persistent homology barcodes on the atom sets by selecting one certain type of atoms in mutation site and one other certain type of atoms in the rest of the protein the set of barcodes from one persistent homology computation as v pdb  where  p  vc ac is the complex rule  d  di de is the distance function    m w is the protein of mutant type or wild type    cno is the element type selected in proteins except in the mutation site    cno is the element type selected in the mutation residue these barcodes are capable of reflecting the molecular mechanism of protein stability features are extracted from the groups of persistent homology barcodes for 18 groups of betti-0 esph barcode such that 9 groups are from the mutant type and 9 groups are from the wild type one can specify a fixed length interval to divide the esph barcodes into a number of equally spaced bins for example a length set 0 05 05 1  55 6 would turn the 18 groups of betti-0 esph barcode into 1812 features with dimension of the number of atoms the death and birth of bars are counted in each bin resulting in features therefore this representation enables us to precisely characterize hydrogen bonds van der waals electrostatic hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions for the higher-order betti numbers the emphasis is given on patterns of both short and long-distance scales statistics feature are computed for each group of barcodes for betti-1 and betti-2 which are sum max and the average of bar length and max and min of birth and death values overall 1218 features are generated by betti-0 on vc and 7218 features are generated by betti-1 and betti-2 on ac in tml-mp gradient boosted regression trees gbrts 22 are employed to train the dataset according to the size of the training dataset absence of model overfitting non-normalization of features and ability of nonlinear properties the gbrt method produces a prediction model as an ensemble method which is a class of machine learning algorithms it builds a popular module for regression and classification problems from weak learners by the assumption that the individual learners are likely to make different mistakes the method uses a summation of the weak learners to eliminate the overall error furthermore a decision tree is added to the ensemble depending on the current prediction error on the training dataset therefore this method is relatively robust against hyperparameter tuning and overfitting especially for data with a moderate number of features the gbrt is shown for its robustness against overfitting good performance for moderately small data sizes and model interpretability the current work uses the package provided by scikit-learn v 0230 33  the graph network descriptors are briefly presented which are applied in this work graph networks can mimic interactions between pairs of units in molecules the quantify features of the networks can reveal the biological and chemical properties measured by comparing descriptors on different networks to detect the single residue impact following mutation the network consists of a set sr of c  atoms from every residue of protein structure except the target mutation residue where r is the cutoff distance such that a c  atom is included if it is within r to any atom of the target mutation the total atom set t r is defined as the atoms c n and o of the target residue and c  atoms of sr moreover two vertices are connected in the network if their distance is less than 8 thus the adjacency matrix a can be defined as well where a is a matrix containing 0 and 1 such that ai j  0 if i-th and j-th are disconnected and ai j  1 if i-th and j-th are connected fri rigidity index was introduced to reflect the flexibility between atoms for molecular interaction prediction 29 43  the single residue molecular rigidity index measures its influence on the set sr which is given as where n s is the number of c  atoms of the set sr and n is the number of atoms in total atom set t r edge density is defined based on the adjacency matrix of the total atom set t r such as where i t is the index set of the mutation residue average path length measures the separation between two vertices of the whole network which can be used to study infectious diseases spreading in the networks 39  the average path length for the single mutation system of biomolecular is defined as where di j is the shortest path length between vertices v i and v j  average betweenness centrality shows communications in a network 21  the average betweenness centrality is given as where g k ij is defined as the number of the shortest path between vertices v i and v j that passes v k  and g ij is the number of shortest paths between v i

research in context
evidence before this study
at present in wuhan the capital of hubei province in china an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is ongoing caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 previously called 2019-ncov evidence to date has suggested rapid spread of the virus at the time of writing imported cases have been reported in 143 countries and territories including singapore 243 confirmed cases have been reported in singapore however this number is expected to increase substantially in the following weeks in 2003 sars-cov which also originated from mainland china established locally causing 33 deaths after 238 cases were confirmed therefore there is considerable concern since 3204 deaths and 81 048 cases of covid-19 have already been confirmed in mainland china which surpasses the numbers observed in the sars-cov outbreak 2020 lunar new year celebrations have now ended marking a period of extensive travel between china and singapore and a corresponding high risk for case importation despite heightened surveillance and isolation of individuals suspected to have covid-19 and confirmed cases the risk is ongoing with the number of cases continuing to increase in singapore immediate deployment of interventions will be required to contain the outbreak in the event that significant secondary local transmission is observed within the community we searched pubmed from database inception to feb 26 2020 for articles using the search terms wuhan coronavirus covid-19 sars-cov-2 2019-ncov and coronavirus interventions our search yielded three relevant articles two articles investigated the effects of travel restrictions in wuhan during the early stages of the outbreak one of the articles additionally investigated the effects of quarantine in china and the other article estimated the effectiveness of airport screening for the detection of infected travellers we found no articles assessing the efficacy of immediate national control measures outside of china
added value of this study
this study is the first to investigate the use of isolation for individuals with covid-19 and quarantine of family members school closures and workplace distancing as interventions for the immediate control of covid-19 in the event of secondary local transmission using a simulation model we found that a combined approach incorporating quarantine school closures and workplace distancing could prevent a national outbreak at low levels of infectivity and reduce the number of total infections considerably at higher levels of infectivity such control measures should be deployed in countries outside of china with evidence of imported cases and evidence of local transmission
implications of all the available evidence
the results of this study provide policy makers in singapore and other countries with evidence to begin the implementation of relatively standard outbreak control measures that could mitigate or reduce local transmission rates if deployed effectively and in a timely manner
 internationally ongoing local transmission of sars-cov-2 has been confirmed in 81 countries and territories6 in singapore 243 individuals have tested positive for sars-cov-2 121 have been hospitalised and are stable 13 are in a critical condition and 109 have been discharged at the time of writing9 the first case in singapore was identified on jan 23 2020 and was imported from china10 a further 68 cases were imported with the remaining 175 cases most likely the result of transmission within singapore11 all imported cases were travellers who had returned from wuhan before feb 4 2020 with transmission to close contacts recorded within families at a church and shop in three small transmission clusters11
 as of march 16 2020 inpatients with covid-19 in singapore are isolated at the hospital they present to or at the national centre for infectious diseases a specialised facility designed to facilitate infectious disease outbreak response10 a government-wide taskforce has been established to increase surveillance at borders and prepare the public in terms of awareness and education10 the ministry of health singapore has implemented contact tracing efforts to identify potential cases among people travelling with or in close proximity to individuals with covid-1912 despite these efforts and nationwide precautionary measures including the dispensing of masks to households and public hospital emergency departments being on high alert for an outbreak response the number of suspected and imported cases in singapore is expected to increase due to the high volume of incoming travellers10 preliminary estimates indicate that the ascertainment rate in wuhan is 51 95 ci 485513 however high levels of under-reporting and misdiagnosis due to difficulties in identifying cases make it challenging for policy makers to prepare a large-scale response consequently following the recommendations made by wu and colleagues14 modelling studies are needed to estimate the potential impact of interventions in the early phase of the outbreak when uncertainty is highest which is crucial should local transmission begin to increase in this study we aimed to develop a national spatial model of covid-19 transmission in singapore to estimate the distribution of cases across time and space and to assess the potential impact of interventions on outbreak size should local containment efforts fail we used flute15 an agent-based influenza epidemic simulation model which accounts for demography host movement and social contact rates in workplaces schools and homes to estimate the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 should local containment fail the flute simulation model requires a synthetic population to build the contact and transmission network therefore we used the geographical demographic and epidemiological model of singapore hereafter referred to as geodemos-r where r represents respiratory illness16 a modelling framework that aims to recreate a synthetic but realistic representation of the singaporean population at the household and individual level we generated the synthetic population using national 2010 census data17 18 to fit multiple attributes of the population at the household and individual level the generated households contained demographic characteristics such as age marital status religion and ethnicity of household members individuals were then allocated to workplaces or educational facilities on the basis of local transportation data and home addresses according to 2010 census data19 the contact behaviour of individuals in the area of their home ie between family members and their local community defined as the home community workplace and school where applicable were recorded with potential transmission events as a function of infectivity we ran the models for 80 days to investigate the early stages of an epidemic and seeded 100 local cases randomly among the resident population at 0 days representing a few generations of local transmission at the time of scenario implementation ie when contact tracing has failed to identify cases within the community and unknown local transmission has started a full description of the model is available in the appendix pp 15 within the flute infection model we assumed that no individual had existing immunity to sars-cov-2 since data ie infectiousness the cumulative distribution function for the incubation period and the duration of hospital stay on sars-cov-2 were unavailable at the time of designing this study we used sars-cov parameters to estimate the infectivity profile of sars-cov-2 these parameters included how infectious an individual is over time20 the proportion of the population assumed to be asymptomatic 7521 the cumulative distribution function for the mean incubation period with sars-cov and sars-cov-2 having the same mean incubation period of 53 days3 22 and the duration of hospital stay after symptom onset 35 days20 asymptomatic individuals were able to infect at a 50 reduced rate compared with their symptomatic counterparts based on estimates from nishiura and colleagues23
 we also investigated four alternate asymptomatic proportions 227 as reported by furuya-kanamori and colleagues24 for influenza a h1n1 in a pooled prevalence study and 300 400 and 500 as potential but theoretical proportions to investigate intervention efficacy with a high fraction of infections that are cryptic and undetectable three values for the basic reproduction number r
0 were chosen for the infectiousness factor 15 20 and 25 on the basis of analyses of wuhan case data by wu and colleagues14
 for the baseline scenario ie no interventions we ran 1000 epidemic simulations to account for the stochasticity in infection contact networks and to calculate cis across time four intervention scenarios were proposed for implementation after failure of local containment following policy options currently being assessed by the singaporean ministry of health as standard interventions for respiratory virus control isolation of infected individuals and quarantine of their family members hereafter referred to as quarantine quarantine plus immediate school closure for 2 weeks quarantine plus immediate workplace distancing in which 50 of the workforce is encouraged to work from home for 2 weeks and a combination of quarantine immediate school closure and workplace distancing hereafter referred to as the combined intervention quarantine of infected individuals is expected to occur 1 day after symptom onset in a health-care facility that is assumed to have 3000 beds at maximum capacity during the early stage of the outbreak and is fully equipped to handle full quarantine measures ie negative pressure isolation rooms full personal protective equipment use by staff so that the individual is unable to transmit sars-cov-2 to other inpatients at full capacity the remaining individuals are isolated at home after receiving treatment family members of infected individuals are quarantined at home for 14 days and thus are unable to attend work or school or infect the wider community at their residential address however transmission within families is possible as a result of the presence of an isolated and infected individual each of these intervention scenarios had 1000 simulations in which we additionally recorded the location of infection as the home community workplace or school appendix pp 34 each of the 1000 epidemic simulations had a set of parameters and was run for baseline and the four control strategies the median simulation was determined as the median cumulative number of cases at day 80 the same set of parameters was used for each 1000 set of simulations for each r

0 is low 15 with a combination of the proposed intervention measures quarantine school closure and workplace distancing being most effective under this scenario r
015 workplace distancing reduced the median number of cases from 279 000 iqr 245 000 320 000 to 4000 20023 000 as a result of the high employment rates around 98 among individuals of working age in singapore25 this observation is consistent with the conclusions of a review of 15 studies that found a median reduction of 23 range 1282 in the cumulative influenza a h1n1 attack rate with workplace distancing alone26 the implementation of such a control measure however is likely to have an acute societal economic effect on individuals who must work from home or take leave especially if reimbursement is not possible thus decision making becomes a function of risk as to whether the imported cases have or will infect the local population and cause a local outbreak an r
0 value of 15 is not consistent with the evidence from china14 and thus prevention of community transmission might not be possible using interventions that would be widely supported by the population at the start of the outbreak the risk of repeated importation of sars-cov-2 into singapore was deemed to be considerable given that around 34 million people travel from wuhan to singapore annually27 furthermore the start of the epidemic coincided with the 2020 chinese lunar new year holiday with the expectation that the number of individuals arriving from china would be similar to that for the 2018 celebrations around 800 000 tourists from china27 the high influx of incoming travellers exacerbated the risk of local disease establishment bringing at least 18 initial confirmed imported cases into singapore before feb 4 2020 when the first four local transmission cases were confirmed11 these four cases had contact with at least two infected tourists at a shop who were identified through intensive contact tracing efforts although travel is now reduced at least 175 subsequent locally-acquired infections have been reported at the time of writing across a diverse range of residential and commercial sites despite efforts by the singaporean government to quarantine and isolate infected individuals on march 16 2020 11 of the 17 confirmed cases were imported with travel histories including the uk indonesia portugal spain the usa france germany switzerland and belgium11 on march 17 2020 a further 17 of 23 cases were reported to be imported11 with the risk of disease establishment remaining high from the continued importation of cases workplace distancing and school closure remain as critical interventions that can avert a significant number of cases we found that these two interventions when used in combination with quarantine would be highly effective at low infection rates ie r
0 of 15 with median of 10 000 cases iqr 20028 000 observed for school closures and 4000 cases 20023 000 for workplace distancing compared with 279 000 cases 245 000320 000 at the baseline at the highest level of infectivity r
025 substantial reductions were observed with a median of 466 000 cases iqr 175 000728 000 observed when school closure was used and 320 000 116 000558 000 for workplace distancing compared with 1 207 000 cases 1 164 0001 249 000 at baseline however if the preventive effect of these interventions reduces considerably due to higher asymptomatic proportions more pressure will be placed on the quarantining and treatment of infected individuals which could become unfeasible when the number of infected individuals exceeds the capacity of health-care facilities scale-up of ongoing surveillance programmes and rigorous contract tracing12 28 are thus required to assist in the maintenance of a low number of unidentified infections at this time with school closure and workplace distancing being potentially effective strategies for deployment nationwide should local transmission with multiple transmission events recorded between individuals in the resident population begin our simulation model which examined hypothetical infection spread with 100 unidentified singaporean cases as a seed population showed that for the baseline scenario ie no control interventions by day 80 when r
0 was 15 around 279 000 individuals would be infected when r
0 was 20 around 727 000 individuals would be infected and when r
0 was 25 around 1 207 000 individuals would be infected in the event that suppression of transmission through quarantine is unsuccessful and local transmission begins which has currently been observed in other countries on a small scale29 30 policy makers in singapore should deploy alternate measures such as school closure and workplace distancing in a timely manner school closure has been used in the past in singapore to limit the spread of hand foot and mouth disease and was associated with a decrease of up to 53 in secondary cases31 probably because children generally have high contact rates with their peers in the school environment given this historical experience a similar programme for covid-19 could be established reasonably quickly however at present data on the susceptibility of children to sars-cov-2 infection the number of infected children in singapore and the probability of children becoming symptomatic are limited making school closure less desirable than workplace distancing the continually high percentage contribution of work-related infections despite work distancing being effective suggests that the workplace is a key infection site in singapore whereby reductions in workplace transmission averts cases at all other sites the effects of school closure and quarantine were comparable since the displacement of students to the home community will then rely on quarantine as a measure of preventing infection however asymptomatic cases assumed to account for 75 of the infected population would continue to contribute to transmission and the identification of these individuals presents a challenge increasing the asymptomatic proportion in our model from 75 to 227 which is reflective of influenza a h1n124 resulted in limited infection control with considerable stochasticity whereby the failure of early quarantine led to outbreaks similar in size to those observed for the baseline scenario even when r
0 was 15 under this assumption the median number of cases averted compared with baseline ranged from 219 000 to 282 000 cases 644829 reduction depending on the intervention scenario for the quarantine school-closure work-distancing and combined intervention scenarios assuming an asymptomatic proportion of 75 and an r
0 of 15 a median of 264 000277 200 cases 946994 reduction would be averted compared with the baseline scenario thus considering the differences in number of cases averted by proportion of asymptomatic individuals in the population additional interventions such as vaccination where research is rapidly ongoing or the prescribing of existing antiviral drugs that are effective for the treatment of related viral infections should be considered contact inhibition remains important but the high proportion of asymptomatic and undocumented infections and missed opportunities to quarantine will make control challenging even at a low infectivity r
0 15 a high asymptomatic proportion is problematic with 58 000 infections iqr 5400123 000 occurring at an asymptomatic proportion of 227 compared with 1800 infections 20023 000 at a 75 asymptomatic proportion with the combined intervention these effects were exacerbated further at higher asymptomatic proportions of 300500 with fewer cases averted and larger outbreak sizes from undocumented spread due to asymptomatic individuals the dialogue partly shifts from containment to case management to reduce mortality from complications regardless of the proportion of individuals in the population with asymptomatic infection all the proposed interventions should be used in addition to other measures such as rapid diagnosis and appropriate case management if local containment fails current government-led outbreak control measures will only be successful with public cooperation through exercising good hygiene infection prevention in shared spaces and adequate education to understand when symptoms might be indicative of a potential sars-cov-2 infection public complicity is particularly crucial for older individuals 60 years individuals who are immunocompromised and people with comorbidities who are at high risk of severe complications5 during the 2003 sars outbreak 238 probable sars cases were reported and 33 individuals died in singapore with the highest proportion of deaths 45 reported among people aged 65 years and older32 the same observation is thus expected for covid-19 should local transmission occur since the median age of infection in our models was 37 years iqr 2649 with comparatively few children becoming infected because of school closure and awareness among parents to quarantine children with fever singapore has one of the highest employment rates among older individuals aged 65 years of all countries within the organisation for economic co-operation and development oecd33 and a culture of eating at so-called hawker centres ie food courts with around 75 of people visiting a hawker centre at least once a week34 consequently many older people are expected to be exposed to infection at work or within their home communities which could be mitigated in part by implementation of workplace distancing and if possible incentivisation to remain at home and practise workplace distancing specifically for older individuals at present the quarantining of family and close contacts of confirmed cases is crucial as shown by the substantial increase in infection rates among individuals who shared living spaces and bathrooms during the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic in china despite the regular disinfection of these areas35 the protocols in place at present including the use of specialist ambulances negative pressure isolation rooms and ultraviolet disinfection will assist in isolating the infection and preventing transmission events at health-care facilities as was seen during the 2003 sars outbreak21 since at least 15 medical staff in wuhan have contracted the virus3 singapore has provided full personal protective equipment for health-care workers however the results of our study suggest that community transmission will substantially contribute to transmission should local containment fail despite these measures the main control measures at this time are surveillance standard testing procedures36 and quarantine of individuals who are confirmed positive for the virus such measures have been used in the past for suspected cases of mers-cov which has a 344 case-fatality rate37 with no cases of mers-cov reported in singapore to date and for zika virus which established locally in 2016 with only ten cases reported in 201938 such successes in preventing local outbreaks are attributed to robust disease surveillance in singapore nevertheless dengue outbreaks are ongoing in singapore39 which highlights the difficulties in disease control that are in part due to undocumented spread and individuals who are asymptomatic these issues are likely to affect the control of the ongoing covid-19 epidemic since many imported cases worldwide have been asymptomatic on entry to countries9 the implementation of school closure and workplace distancing can therefore be considered as a potential secondary control response in the event of infection quarantine failure and the establishment of community transmission our study has several limitations first since geodemos-r is validated against census data errors exist in our estimations of population features that are based on data that have been sample enumerated second a large population of migrant workers who travel from malaysia to singapore each day visiting tourists and long-term visa owners were not accounted for in our infection dynamics third the epidemiological characteristics of covid-19 remain uncertain in terms of the transmission and infectivity profile of the virus therefore estimates of the time between symptom onset and admission to hospital how infectious an individual is over time and the asymptomatic rate were based on sars-cov once this information becomes available for covid-19 a full sensitivity analysis should be done fourth the contact patterns between individuals are highly dynamic and heterogeneous across the population therefore our simulated work school and home populations serve as a general estimation of infection spread fifth effectiveness of the interventions might vary depending on the ongoing seeding of imported cases which we did not account for and will also rely on intervention compliance sixth multiple indirect effects from the interventions and modifications to human behaviour are likely which are difficult to quantify and measure the optimum times to implement each intervention and how long they should be run for to achieve long-term epidemic control should be explored finally there are multiple unforeseen factors that remain challenging to assess at this time such as increased infection rates at mass gatherings delays in quarantining as a result of individuals not seeking health care at symptom onset alternate contact events in locations such as public transport potential transmission events in the health-care setting and the effects of community-wide behavioural shifts in response to knowledge of the outbreak pandemic planning is crucial at the

  characteristics of asymptomatic patients with sars-cov-2 infection in jinan china yan ma qing-nan xu feng-li wang xiao-man ma xiao-yan wang xiao-guo zhang zhong-fa zhang   since an outbreak of covid-19 in wuhan and related regions in hubei province1 2 3 4 5 an increasing number of exported cases have been confirmed in other provinces of china and multiple countries around the world6 7 8 as of march 10 2020 more than 110 000 confirmed cases of covid-19 have been reported in 110 countries9 the most common clinical manifestation of the disease is fever fatigue and dry cough and some patients may present with nasal congestion runny nose and diarrhea in some cases dyspnea usually occurs one week after the disease onset and some patients can rapidly progress to septic shock acute respiratory distress syndrome ards refractory metabolic acidosis and coagulation disorders10 11 as the situation progressed over time more and more asymptomatic individuals were identified due to increased surveillance and contact screening12 those asymptomatic cases may play a role in the transmission and thus pose a significant infection control challenge to best of our knowledge so far there is no special paper describing the features of these patients here we report the characteristics of asymptomatic patients with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection admitted to jinan infectious disease hospital shandong university the hospital is the only one designated medical institution for the hospitalization of confirmed patients with covid-19 in jinan capital of shandong province china furthermore we compared the features between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases to determine whether there exist factors accounting for the presence or absence of symptoms all the inpatients with covid-19 confirmed by pharyngeal swab covid-19 nucleic acid test from january 23 to march 10 in jinan infectious disease hospital shandong university were included in this study the patients were diagnosed and treated according to the diagnosis and treatment guideline for covid-19 distributed by chinese national health commission10 the medical records of patients were analyzed by the research team demographic information epidemiological history clinical characteristics laboratory findings chest computed tomographic ct scan and outcome of each patient were obtained from the electronic medical record system of jinan infectious disease hospital laboratory test results included a complete blood count serum biochemistry coagulation function c-reactive proteincrp erythrocyte sedimentation rateesr and myocardial enzyme spectrum the data for some patients were missing due to the absence of tests or delayed results clinical outcomes were followed up until 2400 march 10 2020 the study was approved by the ethics committee of jinan infectious disease hospital shandong university with a waiver of written informed consent because of the retrospective nature of the study the continuous variables were expressed as medians with ranges and were compared with the mann-whitney u test the categorical variables were presented as frequencies and percentages and were analyzed by the 2 test all statistical analyses were done with spss software version 190 and a p value less than 005 was considered statistically significant a total of 47 patients were diagnosed as covid-19 from january 23 to march 10 with 11234 patients categorized into asymptomatic group and 36766 patients categorized into symptomatic group among asymptomatic patients 6545 patients were men and 5 patients 455 were women the median age for the patients was 23 years ranging from 1 to 60 years old of them 5455 were children and 6 were adults 3273 patients came from wuhan hubei province of china 8 727 patients were residents of jinan 7 636 of which contacted with confirmed cases among 11 asymptomatic patients 9819 were cluster cases 8727 of which were family cluster cases and 1 91 were other cluster cases compared with symptomatic patients asymptomatic patients were relatively younger median age 23 years vs 355years and were more likely cluster cases 818 vs 722 but there was no statistical significance between the two groups the detailed baseline characteristics of the study population are summarized in table 1
 for 11 asymptomatic patients 5 were mild cases and 6 were common cases the median time from admission to negative conversion of viral rna was 10 days ranging from 3 days to 34 days and the median time of hospital stay was 14 days ranging from 10 days to 30 days compared with symptomatic patients the hospital stay of asymptomatic patients is significantly shorter 14 days vs 225days p0004 while the diagnostic classification and time of negative viral rna conversion did not differ between two groups for the 36 symptomatic patients the most common symptoms were fever 28 778 followed by dry cough 17 472 expectoration 4 111 fatigue 4 111 sore throat 4 111 myalgia 4 111 headache 2 56 and coryza 1 28 the detailed clinical characteristics were found in table 2 and 3
 the blood cell test results showed that 273 311 asymptomatic patients had decreased white blood cell and 364 411 had increased lymphocyte count increased or decreased platelet counts were also found in these patients levels of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase-mb increased in about half of the patients other laboratory findings in the asymptomatic patients included higher or lower levels of fibrinogen higher levels of d-dimmer c-reactive protein and esr although there were many laboratory abnormalities in asymptomatic patients compared with symptomatic patients most of the indicators were not statistically significant abnormalities on chest computed tomograms ct were detected in 7 asymptomatic patients 636 table 4
 of which 4 364 showed bilateral involvement and 3 273 showed unilateral involvement compared with symptomatic patients asymptomatic patients had fewer lung ct lesions 636 vs 833 and there was no statistical difference between the two groups the typical chest ct findings of these patients were unilateral or bilateral multiple ground-glass opacities or consolidation fig1
showed representative lung images of an asymptomatic patient in which lesions developed in multiple lobes most of which were subpleural ground-glass opacity co-existed with consolidation fig2
showed dynamic changes of the chest ct of an asymptomatic patient obtained on february 5a february 8b february 14c and february 19d all patients received antiviral treatment including lopinavirritonavir tablets arbidol and inhalation of recombinant human interferon the duration of antiviral treatment was 10-15 days as of 2400 march 10 2020 1003636 symptomatic patients and 818 911 asymptomatic patients have been discharged and the remained 2 patients still have positive nucleic acid test results the current coronavirus outbreak in china and other countries is the third epidemic caused by coronavirus in the 21st century already surpassing sars and mers in the number of individuals infected6 the covid-19 can present a variety of manifestations ranging from no symptoms or mild disease to severe pneumonia or multi-organ failure it is expected that early in the development of an outbreak severe cases are recognized first and then less severe mild or asymptomatic cases are detected with increasing surveillance the occurrence of asymptomatic individuals increased the difficulty of screening helped spread the disease therefore posed a significant public health issue in our study a total of 47 patients were diagnosed as covid-19 from january 23 to march 10 of which 11 234 patients had no symptom the asymptomatic proportion 234 is higher than the data 179 reported by kenji mizumoto13 among 11 asymptomatic patients 9819 were cluster cases 8727 of which were family cluster cases and 1 91 were other cluster cases the presence of cluster cases strongly suggested the need to isolate patients and quarantine for close contacts especially those family close contacts the median age of the asymptomatic patients was 23 years old which is younger than the symptomatic patients355 years while there was no statistical significance between the two groups for the 36 symptomatic patients fever 778 dry cough 472 expectoration 111 fatigue 111 sore throat 111 myalgia 111 were the most common symptoms which was consistent with previous studies3 4 5 14 laboratory findings of the asymptomatic patients showed that some patients might have abnormalities in indicators such as blood cell count fibrinogen d-dimmer c-reactive protein esr and myocardial enzymes compared with symptomatic patients most of the laboratory test results were not statistically significant it is worth noting that creatine kinase-mb was significantly higher in the asymptomatic group than in the symptomatic groupp0020 future research is needed to expand the sample to clarify that this indicator does indeed differ between the two groups although some asymptomatic patients laboratory indicators were abnormal the damage was minor and soon returned to normal 7 asymptomatic patients 636 were detected lung abnormalities on chest ct compared with symptomatic patients asymptomatic patients had fewer lung ct lesions 636 vs 833 and there was also no statistical difference between the two groups all of the laboratory test results and radiologic findings showed the patients experienced relatively mild illness which was further evidenced by the short hospital stay of asymptomatic patientsp0004 all the patients treatment regimen were produced according to the diagnostic and treatment guidelines for covid-19 issued by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china as of 2400 march 10 2020 1003636 symptomatic patients and 818 911 asymptomatic patients have been discharged 2 asymptomatic patients still hospitalized for nucleic acid positive asymptomatic patients have been proven to be contagious and thus pose a significant infection control challenge15 16 17 initially we hoped to find whether there existed factors accounting for the presence or absence of symptoms which could help us to screen the asymptomatic individuals and further help to control the disease in our study we compared the characteristics of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases and have not found effective indicators to meet our requirements therefore the symptomatic patients should be given timely isolation and treatment and relevant contacts should be tracked and quarantined as soon as possible the timely diagnosis isolation and treatment of these asymptomatic patients will help control the further spread of sars-cov-2 future studies should investigate viral loads and viral dynamics of asymptomatic patients and examine whether they are different from symptomatic patients such researches will enhance the understanding of the pathogenesis of the new emerging virus and would help to control the disease early our study has some limitations first our research samples are relatively small and it was difficult to get a full picture of the spectrum of the disease second our asymptomatic patients may truly have no symptoms or they may not feel it because the symptoms are not obvious third some indicators related to patients viral loads or immunity such as cd4 and cd8 cells are not involved in this study all of those can lead to a biased understanding of the disease in conclusion our study showed the clinical characteristics of asymptomatic patients with covid-19 in jinan china the patients were relatively young and were mainly clustered cases the laboratory indicators and lung lesion on chest ct were mild no special factors were found accounting for the presence or absence of symptoms the presence of asymptomatic patients increased the difficulty of screening it is necessary to strengthen the identification of such patients in the future none of the authors have any conflict of interest to declare  identification of rt-pcr-negative asymptomatic covid-19 patients via serological testing jinru wu xinyi liu dan zhou guangqian qiu miao dai qingting yang zhonghui pan ning zhou pa wu   the coronavirus disease covid-19 has spread globally mainly via person-to-person transmission and poses a major public health concern 1 the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of symptomatic covid-19 patients have been increasingly reported in recent research 2 whereas the asymptomatic proportion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2-infected individuals remains largely uncharacterized symptomatic patients are detected because they seek medical attention but asymptomatic individuals with sars-cov-2 infection are identified via the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr test for sars-cov-2 3 a previous study investigated a familial cluster of covid-19 cases that included an asymptomatic 10-year-old boy who had radiological ground-glass lung opacities and tested positive on the rt-pcr test for sars-cov-2 1 a case report identified a 61-year-old asymptomatic patient with abnormal ct images and positive rt-pcr test results for sars-cov-2 that persisted for 23 days in the absence of obvious clinical symptoms 4 while some asymptomatic infected individuals remain asymptomatic over a long period a proportion of asymptomatic covid-19 patients were identified at the presymptomatic stage through epidemiological investigation a study identified 24 sars-cov-2 positive cases on rt-pcr comprising five cases that subsequently developed covid-19 symptoms and 19 that remained asymptomatic 5 in addition a study screened pregnant women who presented at hospitals and identified 43 covid-19 patients via nucleic acid tests including four patients who remained afebrile and asymptomatic throughout their delivery hospitalization and postpartum course 6 the abovementioned studies identified asymptomatic covid-19 patients via rt-pcr tests but the viral shedding pattern and epidemiologic characteristics of covid-19 remain poorly understood asymptomatic patients can easily be overlooked in epidemic prevention 7 8 based on data extracted from chinas infectious disease information system 889 asymptomatic cases were identified among the 72314 patient records which accounted for only 12 of the total patients 9 recent rt-pcr tests in china that primarily provided for passengers arriving from abroad revealed that 78 of the cases of new infection were asymptomatic when the tests were conducted 10 the proportion of asymptomatic covid-19 patients on the diamond princess cruise ship was estimated to be 505 and the proportion among the evacuated japanese citizens was estimated to be 308 3 11 in addition a study suggested that at least 59 of the infected cases went undetected in wuhan which potentially includes asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases 8 12 in this study we enrolled 38 patients with close contact with covid-19 who exhibited persistently negative rt-pcr results for sars-cov-2 and aimed to evaluate their antibody for sars-cov-2 via serological tests to the best of our knowledge this report is among the first reports on tracing of the index patients via serology testing among the 38 study participants enrolled in this study the median age of the patients was 475 years interquartile range 2655925 and 11 289 were female of the 38 close contacts who were tested nine cases were found positive for anti-sars-cov-2 antibody the positive serologic test results were reported with consistent results from wondfo and bioscience biotechnology co ltd both of which have been approved by the chinese national drug administration colloidal gold immunochromatography reagent from wondfo biotechnology co ltd and chemiluminescence reagent for immunoglobulin g from bioscience biotechnology co ltd were used to detect sars-cov-2 specific antibodies according to the manufacturers instructions of the nine asymptomatic cases two cases were presumed to be index patients of local cases figure 1 three cases were local patients who spontaneously recovered before their presumed index patients were found positive on sars-cov-2 nucleic acid testing figure 2 and four cases were close contacts of covid-19 patients and had undefined roles in disease transmission figure 3 case 1 was a 39-year-old woman who lived in wuhan and drove to loudi on january 22 2020 to visit a relative who developed fever and cough on february 9 2020 and tested positive on rt-pcr for sars-cov-2 on february 12 2020 figure 1 case 1 showed negative rt-pcr test results for sars-cov-2 on nasopharyngeal swab samples collected on february 12 17 and 24 and exhibited no fever cough dyspnea headache fatigue gastrointestinal or other covid-19 symptoms and she did not receive any therapeutic intervention over this period a blood sample collected on february 28 2020 showed that she tested positive on a serological test for sars-cov-2 figure 1 case 1 was presumed to have viral shedding during january 22 and january 25 2020 she spontaneously recovered before february 12 2020 and had no covid-19-related symptoms during the following 2 months case 2 a 52-year-old man lived in wuhan and took the train to loudi on january 15 2020 four close contacts of case 2 were later diagnosed with covid-19 figure 1 specifically one close contact had never been in contact with the other three close contacts case 2 presented with occasional cough but denied any fever dyspnea headache fatigue or gastrointestinal symptoms over the period as case 2 had an occasional cough and four of his close contacts were confirmed to have covid-19 case 2 underwent medical examination from february 3 to 5 chest computed tomography ct scanning images recorded on february 4 and 7 showed exudative lesions in both lungs however the rt-pcr tests for sars-cov-2 that were repeated four times with nasopharyngeal swab samples were all negative figure 1 whereas the anti-mycoplasma pneumoniae immunoglobulin m igm and igg antibody tests on february 7 were positive during the 2-week home quarantine without specific therapeutic intervention case 2 reported that his cough had resolved no characteristic symptom of covid-19 was reported thereafter however a blood sample collected on february 28 2020 tested positive for anti-sars-cov-2 antibody figure 1 although case 2 had no covid-19-related symptoms or complications during the following 2 months cases 35 were local residents without travel histories in the past 3 months and were infected by the presumed index patients from the previous epidemiologic investigation these patients presumably recovered spontaneously before their index patients were confirmed positive for sars-cov-2 figure 2 cases 69 had been to wuhan or had traveled since the covid-19 outbreak and they thus had an undefined role in disease transmission figure 3 cases 39 had persistently negative rt-pcr test results for sars-cov-2 without covid-19 symptoms but tested positive on serological tests for sars-cov-2 the cases denied previous exposure to sars-cov-2 and received no therapeutic intervention or complained of covid-19-related symptoms or complications during the following 2 months nine additional asymptomatic patients of covid-19 were identified via serological tests in 38 close contacts of covid-19 patients who had persistently negative rt-pcr test results for sars-cov-2 local covid-19 cases are rare in loudi district which has a total of 76 symptomatic patients and 26 asymptomatic patients who were identified via rt-pcr test for sars-cov-2 underestimation of asymptomatic infections of covid-19 has been suggested as an increasing number of infected people have not traveled to epidemic hotspots or been linked to known covid-19 patients 8 applying serological tests singapore identified the source of a cluster of 23 covid-19 patients who tested negative on rt-pcr for sars-cov-2 13 in this study we report nine asymptomatic patients identified via serological test in addition to 26 asymptomatic patients who were previously identified by the rt-pcr test the nine asymptomatic patients had multiple negative rt-pcr test results with the first rt-pcr test of these asymptomatic patients conducted almost immediately after their close contacts were identified as covid-19 patients thus a proportion of asymptomatic patients might have short viral shedding duration or may have viral nucleic acid loads that are undetectable on rt-pcr according to a previous study the interval from the first day of positive rt-pcr tests to the first day of continuous negative tests for the asymptomatic patient ranged from 1 to 21 days with five asymptomatic patients having persistently negative rt-pcr test results 1 day after the date of diagnosis 5 the results indicated the potential for the underestimation of the proportion of asymptomatic patients based on rt-pcr tests which possibly identifies only those with longer viral shedding period these results suggested that serological tests could serve as a more reliable method to estimate the asymptomatic proportion of covid-19 patients studies have suggested that symptomatic patients of covid-19 have higher transmissibility within 5 days of symptom onset than later on and infectivity might peak on or before symptom onset 14 15 however the epidemiologic characteristics of asymptomatic patients remain unclear a previous study has identified covid-19 transmission caused by an asymptomatic carrier who had normal chest ct findings 16 in addition the viral load detected in the asymptomatic patient was similar to that in the symptomatic patients suggesting a similar transmission potential 17 herein we identified covid-19 transmission caused by two asymptomatic index patients who cleared the virus whereas their local relatives developed symptoms of covid-19 serological test results of the 9 asymptomatic patients who had repeated negative rt-pcr test results for sars-cov-2 suggest that a proportion of the individuals infected with sars-cov-2 can recover without treatment indicating that some individuals may have highly efficient neutralizing antibodies admittedly this research was limited to a small cohort with nasopharyngeal swab samples of the asymptomatic cases collected after their close contacts were confirmed to be sars-cov-2 positive on rt-pcr further studies with a large cohort are needed to elucidate the viral shedding pattern and transmission characteristics of asymptomatic cases with sars-cov-2 infection this study was approved by the hunan normal university

asymptomatic individuals infected with sars-cov-2 are an important source of transmission early identification of asymptomatic cases with subsequent isolation and treatment may contribute to decreased transmission and mortality abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 resulting in the coronavirus disease covid-19 is highly transmissible among people asymptomatic infections are also an important source of infection here we aimed to further clarify the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic sars-cov-2 infections methods chongqing who were rt-pcr yet remained asymptomatic throughout their infections we stratified this cohort by normal versus abnormal findings on chest ct and compared the strata regarding comorbidities demographics laboratory findings viral transmission and other factors between january and march 2020 we identified and hospitalized 279 rt-pcr contacts of covid-19 patients of these 63 23 remained asymptomatic until discharge 29 had abnormal and 34 had normal chest ct findings the mean cohort age was 393 years and 873 had no comorbidities mean time to diagnosis after close contact with a covid-19 index patient was 160 days range 1 to 29 and 134 days and 187 days for those with abnormal and normal ct findings respectively p  005 nine subjects 143 transmitted the virus to others 4 and 5 were in the abnormal and normal ct strata respectively the median length of nucleic acid turning negative in asymptomatic covid-19 patients was 13 days compared to 104 days in those with normal chest ct p  005 a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t conclusions a portion of these asymptomatic individuals with and without abnormal chest ct scans were capable of transmitting the virus to others given the frequency and potential infectiousness of asymptomatic infections testing of traced contacts is essential studies of the impact of treatment on asymptomatic rt-pcr individuals on disease progression and transmission should be undertaken  in december 2019 a novel coronavirus which was later named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 caused a large outbreak of infectious disease designated covid-19 it spread from wuhan hubei province to the whole of china and continues to pose a great threat to public health 1  compared to sars-cov or mers-cov it appears to be transmitted more easily 2 3 4  sars-cov-2 can be transmitted through a variety of modes including droplets close contact aerosol and potentially also fecal-oral transmission 5 6  people of all ages are generally susceptible to the virus symptomatic covid-19 patients and asymptomatic cases are both a source of infection and patients in the incubation period can transmit sars-cov-2 to other persons 7 8 9 10  patients with symptoms are more likely to be detected among patients with sars-cov-2 fever has been the most common symptom followed by dry cough dyspnoea myalgia headache and diarrhoea 11 12 13  in severe covid-19 cases symptoms can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome septic shock and metabolic acidosis 14  the clinical presentation of covid-19 therefore ranges from asymptomatic to severe respiratory illness 15  the presentation of symptoms provides an opportunity for case detection and isolation facilitating the interruption of transmission because most sars-cov patients had severe symptoms they were relatively simple to identify and isolate thus interrupting the chain of transmission unfortunately covid-19 has an incubation period from infection to onset of symptoms that lasts an average of 10 days with a reported range of 2-14 days11 16 17  the virus is also able to spread from one person to another before any symptom onset 14  it is reported that about 12 of the patients have no any actual clinical manifestations during the entire course of the disease 18  asymptomatic cases however particularly those with no history of contact with a known sars-cov-2 are hard to identify there are several case reports of sars-cov-2 transmission from asymptomatic individuals 8 9 13 19  a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t including a report of presumed transmission by asymptomatic carriers with normal chest computed tomography ct 20  together these traits make control of sars-cov-2 very difficult however the exact profile of these asymptomatic cases and their role within the wider epidemic are unclear it is important to understand the proportion of asymptomatic or mildly ill cases and their role in driving the epidemic 21  since many sars-cov-2 infections are asymptomatic subclinical or very mild the hallmarks and course of asymptomatic infection warrants for further investigation 22 23 24  our goal was to document the characteristics of asymptomatic infections and identify factors associated with asymptomatic infection enabling the formulation of corresponding strategies and control measures we conducted a retrospective study focusing on the characteristics and length of rt-pcr positivity and associated hospitalization of confirmed asymptomatic cases of sars-cov-2 in northeast region of chongqing almost in the chongqing three gorges center hospital and wanzhou district hospital since january 2020 active contact tracing in china includes nasopharyngeal swab diagnostic testing of all contacts regardless of symptoms in accord with chinese guidelines for the investigation and management of close contacts of covid-19 cases close contacts were defined as people who had not taken effective protection while in close contact with suspected or confirmed cases 2 days prior to symptom onset or if the case was asymptomatic 2 days before sampling 25  we screened close contacts from january through march 2020 in northeast chongqing by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr of nasopharyngeal swabs only a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t patients with an rt-pcr-confirmed infection and without any apparent symptoms including but not limited to cough fever short of breathless and muscle soreness were enrolled in this study these individuals were identified through close symptomatic contacts in both the clinic and the community in accord with chinas prevention and control policy all rt-pcr positive cases were hospitalized and treated whether they have symptoms or not we monitored asymptomatic individuals daily during hospitalization to document the development of any signs and symptoms we recategorized patients who were asymptomatic at baseline to symptomatic if they reported any symptoms case definitions of confirmed human infection with sars-cov-2 are in accordance with the interim guidance from the world health organization following a positive sars-cov-2 nucleic acid test a chest ct scan was done 26  individuals were then divided to two groups by chest ct scan a group with changes visible on the radiographic imaging called asymptomatic covid-19 patients and a group without any detectable imaging changes called asymptomatic with normal chest ct during hospitalization all participants regardless of group had follow-up chest ct scans every 4 to 5 days until discharge individuals initially allocated to the asymptomatic with normal chest ct group were immediately reallocated to the asymptomatic covid-19 patient group if a new abnormal finding was detected on any chest ct during hospitalization with the approval of the ethics committee we collected both epidemiological data and medical reports for these two groups epidemiological data collection was achieved by interviewing each patient and their family members including the dates and times of close contact with working together living or gathering or to exposure individuals from the affected area not only wuhan with confirmed or suspected sars-cov-2 infection all the data were checked by two researchers if there existed anything ambiguous we consulted the attending physician as soon as possible a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t diagnosis was made by nasopharyngeal swab and rt-pcr to confirm sars-cov-2 infection the virus detection protocol was repeated on subsequent days until a negative nucleic acid was obtained on two consecutive occasions other laboratory tests were conducted at admission table 1  all of these comorbidities were reported to be very mild by the patients clinicians regarding potential sources of infection less than a third n17 27 of cases had made short trips to hubei province and none had been to huanan seafood market a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t on admission only 4 of the 63 63 cases showed leucopenia white blood cell count 410 9 l and 4 63 showed leukocytosis white blood cell count 1010 9 l all the cases had a neutrophil count within the normal range eight 127 cases had low level lymphocyte count 1010 9 l including six 207 asymptomatic covid-19 patients and two 59 asymptomatic with normal chest ct thirty-five of the 63 cases were given procalcitonin tests with a mean of 0029 ngml range from 002 to 0039 indicating a level within the normal range almost half of the 63 cases were tested for cytokines such as il-6 il-10 and il-17 liver and kidney function with all showing normal results in all of these laboratory tests the two imaging groups showed no significant difference  table   2  fitness for discharge was based on two consecutive negative rt-pcr tests of oropharyngeal swabs and a normal chest ct scan all patients were discharged and no one died the median time between the initial positive rt-pcr test and discharge was significantly longer in asymptomatic covid-19 patients than in asymptomatic patients with normal chest ct 130 and 104 days respectively p005 figure 2  the number of sars-cov-2 infections is still rising rapidly in many parts of the world and asymptomatic infections likely play a large role in transmission 22  to our surprise 23 of those identified with sars-cov-2 infection including those with abnormal chest ct scans on admission were completely asymptomatic throughout their infections-a much higher proportion than previously reported 18  the high proportion may be related to the extensive and strict close a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t contact screening policy adopted locally resulting in early detection and treatment of cases this finding suggests that there are actually more asymptomatic covid-19 cases than previously thought highlighting asymptomatic cases as a noteworthy source of infection a recent study reported that the viral load in asymptomatic patients is similar to that in symptomatic patients further underscoring the transmission potential of these asymptomatic patients 27  together these results suggest that strict isolation and screening should be carried out in all asymptomatic close contacts ct scans can assist in the detection of asymptomatic pneumonia but cannot identify asymptomatic cases with normal chest ct if nucleic acid testing were reserved only for suspected patients with obvious symptoms many contacts with mild symptoms or asymptomatic would be missed-as would their contacts since there are no obvious symptoms asymptomatic cases typically remain undiagnosed for a relatively long time in our study the mean latency between close contact and diagnosis was 160 days with a maximum of 29 days this suggests that rt-pcr screening should be undertaken even if an individual shows no symptoms more than 14 days after close contact with an infected person in asymptomatic patients patients whose ct scans show signs of pneumonia are typically diagnosed earlier than those without such signs because the pathogenesis of covid-19 is not well understood all nucleic acid positive cases received antiviral treatment to prevent progression of the disease although the efficacy of antiviral therapy is still unknown it is possible that treatment prevented the progression of disease in this cohort asymptomatic covid-19 patients with abnormal chest cts showed improvement over time suggesting that these patients may have benefitted from the antiviral therapy even with antiviral therapy the average time for viral nucleic acid testing assays to return to negative in the asymptomatic covid-19 patients after treatment was 13 days which is not shorter than time reported for mild symptomatic patients 12  however cases with abnormal chest ct took significantly longer to become rt-a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t pcr negative than those without chest ct abnormalities these characteristics indicate that asymptomatic covid-19 cases are important recessive sources of infection thus diagnosing all sars-cov-2 infections cases including the very mild subclinical or asymptomatic as soon as possible and immediately isolating them is likely to be critical to cutting off the source of infection although they have no symptoms or even no abnormal chest image they spread the virus causing infection and morbidity 20  we found that 18 of the 63 asymptomatic cases 286 had infection associated with familial clustering indicating that asymptomatic infections can be identified through screening family members of index case the high proportion may be related to the extent and length of close contact as well as the relative ease of tracking and screening family members 8 9  however it is sometimes difficult to tell who transmitted the virus the asymptomatic case or the infected family member 8  it also suggests that occult transmission of sars-cov-2 may exist only 14 of the asymptomatic cohort infected others occurring equally between those with and without chest ct abnormalities but it is certain that there are still a few asymptomatic cases that can cause transmission 28  serum antibody tests may provide a low cost and rapid method for screening and could come to play an important role in the auxiliary diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection29 as a group the asymptomatic cases in our study were younger and had fewer comorbidities compared to severe cases 11 12  research shows that the adaptive immune response against the virus in people with asymptomatic infection is stronger than in those with symptomatic infection 30 31  asymptomatic individuals without imaging abnormalities are younger than those with pneumonia from our results it seems that young individuals with normal immune function and without comorbidities are more likely to become asymptomatically infected all patients in the study with and without abnormal chest cts steadily improved and were discharged smoothly after testing negative by rt-pcr however we do not know whether these asymptomatic cases particularly those who had developed this study has several limitations first only 63 asymptomatic cases were included as such it may be that we found no other associated epidemiologic factors due to sample size second we used a qualitative rt pcr test and could not quantitate viral load thus asymptomatic cases with low viral load may have been missed third a precise incubation period and transmissibility are difficult to document due to the concealed nature of asymptomatic infection finally our study does not provide a mechanistic explanation for asymptomatic status a study linking asymptomatic status with differences in individual immu1nity virus serotypes viral load or other factors would contribute useful insights in conclusion here we provide an initial assessment of epidemiologic characteristics of asymptomatic infections of sars-cov-2 early identification of sars-cov-2 cases with subsequent isolation and treatment may contribute to decreased transmission and mortality  the authors declare no conflict of interest m a n u s c r i p t table 1 personal and clinical characteristics of 63

asymptomatic covid-19 infection patients ling wang xiaopeng xu junshan ruan saijin lin jinhua jiang hong ye   since december 2019 the novel coronavirus covid-19 has been an epidemic it is highly infectious and spreads rapidly according to covid-19 global cases by the center for systems science and engineering csse at johns hopkins university jhu more than 2 million cases have been diagnosed worldwide and over 190 thousand patients have died the world health organization who listed the outbreak caused by covid-19 as public health emergencies of international concern pheic this virus belongs to the same coronavirus as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus but has higher replication ability stronger interpersonal transmission ability and higher pathogenicity the population is generally susceptible and there are numerous severe patients however after large-scale interpersonal infection it is surprising that asymptomatic persons appeared with no clinical symptoms but pathogen detection is positive the emergence of asymptomatic persons poses challenges to the prevention and treatment of the epidemic whether asymptomatic patients are contagious and whether they need treatment are controversial issues for clinical experts on the one hand in terms of the law of infectious diseases asymptomatic persons are also capable of spreading the virus but the viral load and transmission harm need to be investigated on the other hand the progress of asymptomatic patients and the effect of drug therapy are still unclear not long ago a german asymptomatic patient was reported the patient had chills fever and cough but recovered the next day and infected two colleagues in close contact with him in the latent period 1 here we report two special asymptomatic patients a couple without definite contact history moreover the male patient is an intercity bus driver however within 14 days after contact with him no case of covid-19 infection was confirmed in the 188 passengers he had carried only one passenger developed cough 6 days after taking the bus whose covid-19 nucleic acid tests have been negative for many times so far and influenza b was once weakly positive waiting to be excluded covid-19 infection this paper discussed the clinical characteristics of these two asymptomatic patients and summarized the pharmacological effects clinical studies and other precautions of the antiviral therapy on them so as to provide a reference for the identification diagnosis and medication of asymptomatic patients in the epidemic prevention and control the patient is a 54-year-old male who is an intercity bus driver in songxi county fujian province china and has no definite contact history with wuhan people on 28 january 2020 the patient went to a hospital in songxi county fujian province china with soreness of loins as the main complaint the patient was in good health without previous medical history medication history and smoking or drinking habits the physical examination showed the body temperature of 38c blood pressure of 13880 mmhg pulse rate of 92 beats per minute respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 98 while the patient was breathing ambient air lung auscultation did not reveal rough breathing sounds rhonchi or pleural friction rub blood test results demonstrated his c-reactive protein crp of 2244 mgl procalcitonin of 012 ngml glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase of 65 ul glutamic-pyruvic transaminase of 107 ul and glutamyl transpeptidase of 58 ul and other indicators were normal chest ct examination showed multiple ground-glass appearance figure 1 since the patient works as a bus driver covid-19 pneumonia cannot be ruled out although he claimed no known contact with anyone from hubei the hospital notified the local center for disease control and prevention cdc immediately and designated him as a suspected person the patient was isolated in the hospital his throat swab specimen was obtained for covid-19 nucleic acid detection on the same day the local cdc confirmed that the patients covid-19 test was negative
 on 29 january 2020 the patient did not have fever or any other discomforts and the covid-19 nucleic acid throat swab test was still negative on 30 january the patient had no discomfort in order to exclude covid-19 infection double throat swab specimens of the patient were collected and sent to both local and provincial cdc for reexamination on 31 january the results showed positive with the coordination of the local health commission the patient was sent to the isolation ward of nanping first hospital for treatment on 31 january 2020 on the first day of admission the patient was suffered from soreness of waist without cough fever shortness of breath vomiting or other discomforts his vital signs appeared normal the physical examination showed rough breathing sounds and other monitored parameters were generally normal from 31 january 2020 to 10 february 2020 the patient was given quadruple therapy including lopinavirritonavir tablets 400100 mg every 12 h arbidol tablets 02 g every 8 h lianhuaqingwen granules a chinese patent medicine 6 g every 8 h orally and recombinant human interferon-2b injection via aerosol 60  106 iu with 2 ml of sterilized water for injection every 12 h the patient had stable vital signs and normal oxygen saturation without any discomfort his clinical laboratory indicators are shown in table 1 the patients white-cell count absolute neutrophil count absolute lymphocyte count platelet count and crp were all in normal quantity fasting blood glucose and triglyceride continued going up to 1545 and 669 mmoll respectively significantly higher than normal values cholesterol rose to 547 mmoll eventually alanine aminotransferase 5476 iul and glutamyl transpeptidase 4650 iul persisted a bit higher total bilirubin fibrinogen lactate dehydrogenase and blood urate normalized after slightly exceeding the normal on 10 february compared with the previous chest ct result the scattered patchy fuzzy shadows of both lungs slightly decreased the patient was taken covid-19 nucleic acid throat swab tests on 7 february 2020 and 10 february 2020 respectively and the results were both negative on 11 february 2020 the patient discharged without any discomfort and in good condition

 the patient is a 55-year-old housewife and has close contact with her husband the patient of case 1 on 28 january 2020 the patient had no discomfort and accompanied her husband to a hospital in songxi county fujian province china as her husband was suspected to be infected with covid-19 she was also hospitalized and isolated the patient was in good health without previous medical history medication history and smoking or drinking habits the physical examination showed her body temperature of 368c blood pressure of 11872 mmhg pulse rate of 78 beats per minute respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 98 while the patient was breathing ambient air auscultation of both lungs was normal her clinical laboratory results were within normal range except crp of 2244 mgl table 2 on the same day the local cdc confirmed that the patients covid-19 nucleic acid throat swab test was negative

 on 29 january 2020 the patient had no discomfort but her covid-19 nucleic acid throat swab test was positive on 30 january 2020 her throat swab was collected again and the result was also positive chest ct showed that her two lungs had diffuse patchy shadows and ground-glass appearance figure 2 she and her husband were sent to the isolation ward of nanping first hospital for treatment on 31 january 2020 on the first day of admission the patient had no discomfort and the vital signs were normal the physical examination revealed rough breathing sounds and other monitored parameters were generally normal
 from 31 january 2020 to 10 february 2020 the patient was treated with four drugs which are oral administration of lopinavirritonavir tablets 400100 mg every 12 h arbidol tablets 02 g every 8 h and lianhuaqingwen granules a chinese patent medicine 6 g every 8 h and atomization inhalation of recombinant human interferon-2b injection 60  106 iu with 2 ml of sterilized water for injection every 12 h the patients vital signs were stable and oxygen saturation was normal there were no discomfort and any abnormal quantity of white-cell count absolute neutrophil count or absolute lymphocyte count fasting blood glucose 64884 mmoll and triglyceride 24252 mmoll remained relatively high crp and fibrinogen dropped back to normal from 2915 mgl and 472 gl respectively platelet count increased slightly to 313  109l finally on 7 february from chest ct it can be seen that the ground-glass shadow in her lungs has narrowed the patients covid-19 nucleic acid throat swab tests became negative on 15 february 2020 and thus discharged from the hospital without any discomfort covid-19 infection presents a cluster attack most patients were male with an average age of 555 years 2 fifty-one percent of patients were suffered from chronic diseases including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases endocrine system diseases digestive system diseases respiratory system diseases malignant tumors and nervous system diseases elderly men with complications are more likely to be infected and may lead to serious or even fatal respiratory diseases 2 although the two patients in this paper were about 55 years old they had good health and no basic medical history which may be one reason why they had no obvious clinical symptoms of covid-19 pneumonia however whether there are other possibilities need to be discussed and confirmed for example the male patient of the first case saying no contact with wuhan people might be infected unconsciously by other people who got in touch with wuhan people after repeated reproduction and transmission the virus is getting weak or the viral load entering the body is relatively low thus under the condition of a good immune system it will not emerge that large and rapid virus proliferation and migration in vivo lead to serious damage to lungs and even other organs all these conjectures need further investigation asymptomatic cases are easy to miss diagnosis or misdiagnose due to the lack of specific covid-19 pneumonia manifestations and normal inflammatory indexes such as white blood cells lymphocytes and crp at present there have been some asymptomatic cases in china which should be paid attention to it is worth noting that the first male patient in this paper complaining of soreness of loins is similar to the atypical covid-19 pneumonia german patient with myalgias as a complaint 1 the male patient of case 1 also showed transient elevation of serum lactate dehydrogenase with respect to muscle pain there are similarities between asymptomatic infection of covid-19 and influenza to some extent and sometimes the rise of serum creatine kinase lactate dehydrogenase and myoglobin can be seen at present the guidelines of covid-19 pneumonia in various countries do not list muscle pain as one of the clinical manifestations which may lead to the omission of some patients especially the mild patients what should be taken seriously is not only that asymptomatic patients did not have typical covid-19 infection symptoms but also that the covid-19 nucleic acid throat swab tests showed false negative in these patients delaying the diagnosis of covid-19 infection this may be caused by two reasons one is that asymptomatic patients may have a low viral load and the other is that the detection rate of nucleic acid throat swab may be not high enough for mild cases of covid-19 infection the use of lung imaging as a supplement or even an alternative to throat swab detection may also be an effective means to reduce the omission diagnostic rate under certain circumstances lower respiratory tract specimens such as tracheal aspirates bronchoalveolar lavage and sputum with higher viral load can be tested to raise the detection rate on the other hand interpretation of positive results is equally important at present in china two consecutive negative results of covid-19 nucleic acid throat swab test are the necessary standard for patients to leave the hospital in this paper the female patient has no symptoms all the time but the duration of positive nucleic acid test results is longer than that of the male patient so she cannot be discharged from the hospital for a longer time that provokes questions that how long the course of antiviral treatment should be and whether the sign of stopping antiviral treatment should be the clinical manifestation or nucleic acid turning negative what is worth thinking about is whether it is a better choice for asymptomatic patients to rest at home instead of medication at hospital in order to prevent adverse drug reactions such as the increase of triglyceride in cases 1 and 2 as described below in this paper two patients were treated with quadruple therapy combining chinese and western medicines covid-19 sars and mers belong to the same coronavirus and their protein structures have many similarities the antivirus drugs used in this paper have been proved to have an inhibitory effect on sarsmers in vitro or in vivo but their adverse reactions and efficacysafety in special populations such as liver and renal insufficiency still need to be paid attention to by clinicians lopinavirritonavir is recommended by the national health commission of china for the treatment of covid-19 at present 3 lopinavir is used to prevent the hiv gag-pol polyprotein from splitting the action site of ritonavir is aspartyl protease of the virus blocking the precursor of hiv gag-pol polyprotein the two components work together resulting in immature virus particles without regeneration capability moreover ritonavir is also an enhancer of lopinavir which can inhibit the cyp3a-mediated degradation of lopinavir in the liver 4 two sars-based clinical studies 56 and a mers-based clinical case report 7 suggested that lopinavirritonavir has an anti-coronavirus effect in addition lopinavirritonavir was listed as a candidate therapeutic drug in an anti-mers guideline written by clinical experts in south korea 8 these studies are of great significance for the treatment of covid-19 with lopinavirritonavir however the clinical studies on sars published by chan and chu both pointed out that lopinavirritonavir as the initial treatment can remarkably improve the total mortality rate oxygen saturation reduction rate intubation rate or glucocorticoid usage but for treating the terminal stages there was no obvious curative effect 56 this may be because lopinavirritonavir mainly acts by inhibiting the formation of new virus and cannot prevent the virus from entering cells but numerous viruses have entered cells in the end-stage patients causing organ damage and poor outcome in terms of adverse reactions lopinavirritonavir induces diarrhea hyperglycemia hyperlipidemia arrhythmia liver dysfunction etc its serious adverse reactions also include fatal diseases such as pancreatitis 4 in this paper the triglyceride and fasting blood glucose levels of the two patients exhibited a huge rise far above normal after treatment according to naranjos adverse drug reaction probability scale score 5 points were obtained indicating that lopinavirritonavir probably caused adverse reactions of hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia in both the patients the adverse drug reactions may be common in patients because these two patients as good representatives had normal basic monitoring indexes and good liverkidney function and physical condition and took lopinavirritonavir in a short time thus metabolized and excreted lopinavirritonavir efficiently for severe patients with liver function injury risk of the adverse drug reactions may become higher possibly leading to serious consequences including fat overload syndrome pancreatitis other pathogen infection and even prolonged hospitalization or death for reasons other than covid-19 infection besides lopinavir and ritonavir both inhibitors of cyp3a may increase the plasma concentration of drugs metabolized mainly by cyp3a such as amiodarone fentanyl and midazolam commonly used in severe patients the drug action time will prolong and the occurrence of adverse drug reactions may increase lopinavir and ritonavir also have certain inhibition effects on atp-binding cassette subfamily b member 1 abcb1 but the effects of abcb1 were only detectable in the presence of cyp3a suggesting that the simultaneous use of abcb1 substrates should also be cautious 9 the severe pneumonia incidence of covid-19 infection is relatively high especially in the elderly for severe patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency it should be noted that blood drug concentration of lopinavir showed a rapid increase in the patients with liver dysfunction 10 suggesting the necessity of therapeutic drug monitoring of lopinavir therapeutic concentration of lopinavir was 38 mgl and toxic concentration was above 8 mgl 11 however patients with renal insufficiency can continue to take lopinavirritonavir at the conventional dosage because the renal clearance rate of lopinavir and ritonavir is extremely low moreover both lopinavir and ritonavir have strong protein-binding capacity so hemodialysis will not affect their clearance greatly 12 but lopinavirritonavir was reported to be strongly related to kidney impairment so its potential nephrotoxicity should be concerned 1314 there are few reports of old people treated with lopinavirritonavir yet the lopinavir plasma level in the elderly seems to be higher than the recommended value 15 atomization inhalation of interferon- ifn- is also recommended by the national health commission of china as medication for covid-19 ifn- is bound to receptors on the cell surface to induce the production of various antiviral proteins thereby inhibiting the replication of viruses in cells ifn- has a broad antivirus spectrum in addition it can enhance the specific cytotoxic effect of macrophages and lymphocytes by regulating immune function and thereby stop the invasion and infection of the virus effectively at present there are three types of ifn- subtypes approved for clinical use namely ifn-2b ifn-2a and ifn-1b it is found that ifn-2b used in this paper tends to have a relatively higher activity 16 ifn- is mainly administered subcutaneously and intramuscularly which is easy to cause influenza-like symptoms myelosuppression mental abnormalities and other adverse reactions inhalation will not inactivate ifn- and can raise the lung concentration 17 30  106 iuday is the minimum inhalation dose of ifn- that can induce biological effects without side effects 18 below the dose of 18  106 iuday ifn- hardly enters the systemic circulation through inhalation 19 as for the treatment of ifn- on coronavirus early therapy of ifn- inhalation combined with antiviral drugs has been shown to be associated with better outcomes 2021 while the clinical research of omrani et al demonstrated that the combination therapy of ribavirin and ifn-2a inhalation can improve the early and intermediate survival rate of severe mers patients significantly it was useless for the late survival rate 22 however the sample sizes of the above investigations were small and the effectiveness of ifn- inhalation on coronavirus still lacks sufficient evidence-based medical evidence inhalation of ifn- may induce bronchospasm reaction and decrease the peak expiratory flow rate 1923 but few systemic adverse reactions such as influenza-like symptoms 19 there are no data about the application of ifn- inhalation on the elderly and patients with liver or renal insufficiency however the usage of ifn- injection for inhalation is off-label so the patient-informed consents are required besides attention should be paid to the possibility of allergy caused by ifn- and auxiliary materials the two patients in this paper also used hemagglutinin inhibitor arbidol which is not recommended by the national health commission of china for covid-19 arbidol can specifically inhibit the contact adhesion and fusion of virus lipid membrane and host cell membrane and block virus gene from penetrating into nucleus by activating 25-oligoadenylate synthetase antiviral protein 2425 at present there is no clinical report of arbidol on coronavirus pneumonia but it has a good inhibition effect on sars even ebola virus ebov and lassa virus lasv in vitro 2628 an arbidol concentration of 20 gml was required to achieve a 50 reduction in virus proliferation and hemagglutinin levels 29 according to china news cell experiments in vitro showed that arbidol can effectively inhibit covid-19 up to 60 times at the concentration of 1030 m and significantly suppress the pathological effect of the virus on cells 30 however the concentration of 1030 m is equivalent to 53160 gml of arbidol which is far above the peak concentration 041 gml that can be achieved in vivo by oral administration of single- and multiple-dose arbidol 3132 therefore whether to apply a higher dose of arbidol for covid-19 pneumonia needs to be concerned and studied liver and intestine are the main metabolic organs of arbidol in the human body and cyp3a4 is the major isoform enyzme indicating possible drug interactions between arbidol and cyp3a4 substrates 33 additionally the adverse event rate of arbidol is approximately 62 mainly manifested as nausea diarrhea dizziness and increased serum transaminase 34 which is similar to the adverse reactions of the digestive system in covid-19-infected patients probably increasing difficulties in differential diagnosis in the bioequivalence experiment of arbidol preparation conducted in china 3 h after taking the medicine some healthy subjects had bradycardia heart rate less than 60 beatsmin and reduced 224 beats per minute but the subjects had no adverse symptoms and the correlation with arbidol was unclear arbidol can be used for the elderly patients and improve their cellular immunity 35 for patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency the safety of arbidol is not clear in view of the fact that arbidol is mainly removed by feces accounting for 324 of the dose and its glucuronide and sulfuric acid metabolites are excreted in urine accounting for 63 of the dose therefore patients with severe liver dysfunction need to use arbidol with caution or reduction while patients with renal insufficiency may consider the original dose 33 in the guideline for covid-19 pneumonia of china traditional chinese medicine has equal status with western medicine lianhuaqingwen preparation has broad antiviral spectrum antipyretic effect and anti-inflammatory effect and is even superior to oseltamivir in improving the symptoms of influenza infection 3637 lianhuaqingwen preparation has been recommended by the national health commission of china repeatedly in a series of infectious public health events such as sars mers h1n1 avian influenza and handfootmouth disease for more than 10 years and plays an important role in prevention and treatment lianhuaqingwen preparation can obviously inhibit the replication of sars virus with ic50 of 011 mgml and therapeutic index of 403 38 lianhuaqingwen preparation has 61 compounds or more in which 12 high-content compounds are salidroside chlorogenic acid forsythoside e cryptochlorogenic acid amygdalin sweroside hyperin rutin forsythoside a phillyrin rhein and glycyrrhizic acid 39 the common adverse reactions of lianhuaqingwen preparation were mostly related to digestive system mainly manifested as nausea diarrhea vomiting and abdominal pain skin allergy reaction and clinical laboratory results are rare and can be relieved after drug withdrawal the treatment of lianhuaqingwen preparation on covid-19 pneumonia has yet to be proved by clinical trials the best medication for covid-19 infection has not yet been confirmed in this paper two patients were treated with quadruple therapy combined with chinese and western medicines the symptoms and chest x-rays of both patients have been greatly improved it can be said that quadruple therapy has a certain curative effect but the possibility of spontaneous improvement cannot be ruled out and it is impossible to tell whether one or more drugs work the reason why the two patients were selected is that they were the only asymptomatic patients in northern fujian province of china and their medication was analyzed by the authors who often discuss difficult cases in the form of multidisciplinary team the treatment of two patients met the guideline for covid-19 pneumonia of china and got the ethical approval of relevant hospitals this paper has limitations it is a report of individual cases and we have not quantified the viral load leaving the virus dynamics unclear more clinical data are needed for asymptomatic patients as well as this combination medication asymptomatic patients have no fever or respiratory tract symptoms but pneumonia can still be seen on imaging for asymptomatic patients pharmaceutical care should be strengthened while virus detection and antiviral treatment are carried out including the discovery solution and prevention of potential or actual drug problems so as to ameliorate the safety effectiveness and economy of medication and achieve the ideal goal of improving the quality of life for patients with covid-19 the lack of effective drugs directly targeting covid-19 is the major challenge to doctors and the treatment of patients whether the western medicine lopinavirritonavir remdesivir arbidol and chloroquine or traditional chinese medicine with antiviral activity has caused the public to expect the control of covid-19 but lacks effectiveness and safety from multicenter randomized double-blind controlled studies in fact it takes quite a long way from in vitro experiments to actual clinical use in the design of clinical trials for covid-19 the trial efficiency is of great importance thus phase i trials with extended cohorts trials based on pattern recognition machine learning and other technologies should be utilized further study of covid-19 is not limited to antiviral drugs anti-inflammatory anti-il-6 anti-tnf- etc treatment should be actively carried out to quickly neutralize the cytokine storm in vivo and reduce the mortality of critical patients adoptive reinfusion of cured patients serum and the immune regulation of mesenchymal stem cells may also show a certain effect with the help of multidisciplinary cross-analysis to control symptoms quickly and reduce mortality effectively is the main task at present a reasonable analysis of existing clinical data to make treatment decisions is the only choice in the absence of effective covid-19 antiviral drugs the efficient utilization of clinical data needs the establishment of big data and the promotion of scientific networked and shared data collection and management modes specifically many complicated clinical data are cleaned and integrated and the terminology is unified the outliers or small-sample data are eliminated repeated researches are conducted in clinical manifestations laboratory test results lung imaging combined basic diseases drug therapy and clinical outcomes etc via statistical analysis to find out characteristic data helping physicians to realize accurate differential diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 in the future the following aspects should be emphasized for the control of covid-19 1 strengthen epidemiological research especially the prevention and control of asymptomatic and mild cases as infection sources 2 carry out in-depth research on structures and functions of various virus proteins and then conduct drug prediction and high-throughput screening and 3 enhance international cooperation for example traditional chinese medicine has played a positive role in preventing and treating covid-19 but further discussion is needed on how to standardize the use how to reasonably evaluate the curative effect and how to integrate with western medicine  modeling covid-19 epidemic in heilongjiang province china tingzhe sun yan wang   in december 2019 the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 occurred in wuhan hubei province and then unfolded in china and all over the world 1 the novel coronavirus has been a serious threat to public health 2 china has taken strict measures such as quarantine social-distancing suspicious isolation community surveillance to restrain covid-19 outbreak by late february however heilongjiang has now become the province with most diagnosed patients in china ie even worse than hubei province massive imported cases emerge and continue to increase specifically a recent super spreader or imported escaper in heilongjiang province has led to tens of diagnosed or asymptomatic cases 3 therefore evaluating the epidemic of covid-19 in heilongjiang province may help provide effective strategies to restrict covid-19 transmission recently many mathematical models have been constructed to investigate the epidemic of covid-19 some models have made modifications based on the conventional seir model 4 and concluded that strictly controlled interventions are critically important to impede covid-19 outbreak 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 several other model instead established a stochastic transition model to evaluate the transmission of covid-19 and also emphasized the necessity of interventions such as social-distancing isolation and quarantine 1213 meanwhile asymptomatic patients are covert cases which represent a serious threat to public health 14 a few models have been developed to evaluate the role of coronavirus transmission based on asymptomatic cases 111516 however all these models have ignored the covid-19 transmission from bats and unknown hosts a recently proposed novel model has characterized these interactions among bats unknown hosts and people in details 17 they estimated the basic reproduction number r0 to be 24829 and indicated that model is locally asymptotically stable if r0  1 17 these important models have greatly improved our understanding about the epidemic of covid-19 in current work we developed a mathematical model to characterize imported escaper and asymptomatic patients we trained our model based on covid-19 epidemic in heilongjiang province from january 23 to march 25 by which the last confirmed patient was cured in heilongjiang province using this model we performed stochastic simulations and found that partial relief in strictly controlled interventions may contribute to the occurrence of diagnosed patients recently from april 9 to april 19 provided that there is only one imported patient without surveillance 3 meanwhile we predicted that there is still an unidentified pool of asymptomatic patients we suggested that strict or mild interventions should still be implemented to restrain a potential covid-19 outbreak the number of experimentally confirmed patients and curedrecovered cases january 23 to april 19 was obtained from health commission of heilongjiang province httpwsjkwhljgovcn table s1 note that only domestic cases epidemiologically associated with the super spreader between april 9 and april 19 were recorded and simulated the total susceptible population was set to be the total population in heilongjiang province from national bureau of statistics 3771 million httpwwwstatsgovcn owing to closure of wuhan on january 23 there are no wuhan returnees to heilongjiang province since then the total population was divided into susceptible population s closely

 describes the discharge rate from quarantine i i1 2 3 describes the averaged contact rate between s and c a or i respectively specifically 1 is the average contact rate between susceptible population and close contacts 2 describes the average contact rate between susceptible population and asymptomatic patients 3 denotes the averaged contact between susceptible population and infected patients  denotes self-recovery rate for asymptomatic cases since specific asymptotic patients can recover without treatments 18 19 20 1 and 2 represent the transition rate from close contacts to asymptomatic and diagnosed ones respectively 3 is the transition from asymptomatic to diagnosed cases 18 19 20  is the maximum average recovery rate since the health-care capacity in different provinces differ significantly owing to economic development we further incorporated a threshold behavior for the recovery we assumed that higher numbers of inpatients and quarantined cases will lower the average recovery rate the health-care capacity will be improved if there are fewer diagnosedquarantined patients a hill function was used to characterize the threshold behavior the threshold was represented as a parameter k and the cooperativity effect was described by the parameter n see model 1 initial values for i and r were obtained from the official site httpwsjkwhljgovcn the total susceptible population was set to be the total population in heilongjiang province as described above other parameters and initial conditions c and a were estimated based on epidemic data from heilongjiang province for parameter estimation 400 stochastic runs using potterswheel toolbox 21 were implemented and the best fit parameter set was shown in table 1
 since the best fit for initial asymptotic population is 1 0042736 we set initial value for a to be 0 since a should be an integer we note that the parameter n in the best fit set was 102545 suggesting that the threshold behavior in recovery rate has relatively low cooperativity parameters were estimated by potterswheel using a trust-region method 21 a 2 criteria was used for model identification 2n1 n is the number of data points 21 we did not incorporate death similar to recent assumptions 1322 the -leap method was used for stochastic simulation 23 ordinary differential equations odes were numerically solved using ode23s in matlab r2018b the ksdensity function in matlab was used for kernel estimation the model was first trained with epidemic data from heilongjiang province using a reasonable initial guess we performed unbiased parameter fitting by sampling parameters in logarithmic scale totally 400 sets the top 200 fits were harvested we noted that fitted initial values from 200 top fits for asymptomatic patient number a approximated zero with mean value 01 and therefore the initial value a for is set to be 0 the best fit was shown for infected and recovered patients by march 25 figure 1
a notably the fitted i i1 2 3 values were to the order of 1010 to 109 suggesting that strong interventions were implemented to restrain mutual contacts table 1 meanwhile n is around 1 102545 suggesting that the cooperativity was neglectable the best fit parameter set was shown in table 1 we further estimated a dynamic reproduction number based on ordinary differential equations 24 the results showed that the reproduction number initially reached 50692 and then quickly dropped below 1 by feb 14 and finally reached 08702 figure s1 therefore our model could faithfully match the epidemic data in heilongjiang province and found that continuously strict measures indeed impeded the covid-19 transmission we then performed stochastic simulations using -leap method 23 since mutual contacts among different populations act as potential risk factors to covid-19 outbreak 25 all i i1 2 3 values were multiplied by a contact factor f i fi i1 2 3 therefore f1 indicated strongly controlled interventions as implemented between late january and mid-march while f1 represented mild or relieved interventions f1 was associated with strongly weakened or no interventions the imported escaper or super spreader the super spreader here means that all recently confirmed patients can be associated with this super spreader in an ongoing epidemiological study arrived in heilongjiang province at march 19 and was then subject to home quarantine 3 therefore the number of infected patients was increased by 1 at march 19 in the stochastic model however the home quarantine was failed as reported possibly owing to accidental egress by escalator or stairs 3 we modeled this by increasing f from 3 to 8 and then performed stochastic simulations results suggested that even a moderate relief would not lead to the reported local outbreak f34 and 5 figure 2
a increasing f to 6-8 however will result in possible matches between stochastic simulations and reported epidemic data black dots epidemic data colored curves stochastic simulations figure 2a the median values from 500 stochastic runs were shown for increasing f values blue curves figure 2b the shaded areas denote 25 and 75 quartiles therefore we predicted that the mutual contacts for the super spreader was significantly elevated to around 7 we further matched our simulations to the reported asymptomatic patients setting f7 stochastic simulation could match the epidemic data figure 2 however we noted a large gap between the simulated number of asymptomatic patients to the reported cases f7 figure 3
a since asymptomatic patients usually do not seek medical tests owing to lack of symptoms the reported number of asymptomatic cases may be lower than the actual number figure 3a 18 19 20 the underestimation was significant for f6 or f7 on april 19 dashed line the mean value figure 3b the discrepancy seemed to grow if intervention strength was not altered figure 3b these simulations implied that the unidentified asymptomatic patients might be another serious concern since the asymptomatic cases can also be contagious 18 19 20 since the confirmed patients have undergone an ongoing increase we then evaluated the effect of establishment of strict interventions since april 20 black dot figure 4
a strict interventions were implemented f1 or 2 since april 20 we measured the time to peak and the recovery time since april 9 at which the first reported domestic patient occurs in heilongjiang province 26 we found that roughly 33 days were used to reach the peak for f1 whereas for f2 the duration was increased to 53 days figure 4b and 4c left 80 days were required for total recovery if f1 whereas about 139 days were needed for f2 figure 4b and 4c right therefore these simulations suggested implementation of strict interventions is strongly required to impede a potential outbreak in this study we constructed a modified model which incorporated threshold behavior in recovery rate and asymptomatic patients with significant difference to seir model 4 however ongoing importation into china especially in heilongjiang province has been a serious threat recently furthermore the asymptomatic patients are not easily identified owing to lack of obvious symptoms 20 we estimated the influence of asymptomatic patients based on a data-driven model from heilongjiang province we anticipated that an area- or province-specific model may help unravel the underlying features of covid-19 epidemic from simulation we found that even one imported patient or super spreader reported recently can lead to up to  40 infected patients and unpredictable pool of asymptomatic patients till april 19 3 we anticipated that the relaxed home quarantine for this imported patient 3 is unsuccessful and has initiated a local outbreak potentially simulation suggested that the mutual contacts from the relaxed home quarantine might possibly increase to f7 compared with f1 for strictly controlled interventions the occurrence of the imported escaper might be ascribed to the significantly longer latent period 2 the weakened surveillance for covid-19 inpatient transfer in specific hospitals and the murky mismanagement for covid-19 tests 3 all these deficiencies may possibly lead to a secondary blockage of some hospitals and communities for haerbin city in heilongjiang province more seriously the associated pool of asymptomatic patients was underestimated from official report since asymptomatic patients are also contagious the potential impact of these covert cases should attract extensive attention as least about one month is still required if strict measures are immediately implemented therefore the imported escaper argues for further epidemiological investigations as well as strongly controlled interventions as more data are available our model could be used for analyzing these novel epidemic data liu et al recently constructed a model with asymptomatic patients 11 however asymptomatic populations in their model will eventually become diagnosedconfirmed patients with clear symptoms and are more likely to be pre-symptomatic 14 which is in stark contrast to recent definition ie asymptomatic patients were those who never develop symptoms 18 19 20 we modeled the covid-19 epidemic induced by one imported patient without strict quarantine lessons from the emerging diagnosed patients recently in heilongjiang province since april 9 should catch attention as they are epidemiologically associated with this imported escaper furthermore we recommended that the strict measures such as isolation home or centralized quarantine should be re-established especially in haerbin city of heilongjiang province to lower the risk of a potentially secondary outbreak finally our model could also be applied elsewhere with adjusted parameters to monitor covid-19 epidemic not required

 therefore unexpectedly the prevalence of positive-covid-19 among asymptomatic hcws who take care of patients infected with the novel coronavirus was 0 since december 2019 the world has been in the grip of the severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 and the disease it causes coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 6 since then the spread of covid-19 has increased exponentially with the world health organization who declaring a pandemic on 11 march 7 they are at high risk of morbidity and mortality due to health care-associated infections 8 it has been estimated that 10 or more of all those infected with covid-19 in some european countries are hcws 4 in italy hcws experienced high rates of infection and death 9 little is known about the effectiveness of personal protective equipment ppe for hcws who take care of patients infected with covid-19 10 on the other hand other studies showed that the prevalence of covid-19 amongst hcws will depend upon a range of factors including the availability of ppe the healthcare setting and access to testing how well the country handles the covid-19 crisis depends largely on how effectively health workforce is used 11 but it is also necessary to protect the health and safety of this essential national workforce 4 therefore our local infection control committee started before the beginning of this pandemic in jordan to educate hcws about caring for covid-19 patients regarding hand hygiene donning and doffing ppe types of ppe used in kauh were gloves n95 masks with tight seal around mouth and nose face and eye protection including face shields and goggles clothing which includes gowns aprons head covering and shoe covers moreover we started to establish policies and modify regulations to protect hcws during these challenging times as a result our hospital started to operate at less than half capacity in order to decrease workload and to prioritize resources in order to minimize the risk to the hcws only necessary procedures were allowed aerosol generation procedures were limited to negative pressure rooms they were undertaken by most expert doctors or nurses available and only necessary hcws were present in the room hcws with comorbidities dm htn respiratory diseases and other chronic medial illness and pregnant ladies were exempted from work during this period we also adopted a policy which allows every hcw to take two weeks of home self-isolation after finishing working shift we divided the 385 hcws into 14 groups each group contains about 27 personnel who work 24 h this would provide about 2 weeks of home isolation for each hcw moreover we separated wards that could be contaminated with the virus from other low risk facilities and we minimized the time of contact between hcws and infected patients by limiting unnecessary procedures decreasing the communication times between infected patients and hcws provided that the patient care is not affected and by trying as much as possible to do many tasks in the same round as taking vital signs giving medications distributing meals and doing beddings early in the pandemic crisis in jordan first 5 weeks there were shortage of pcr-kit due to supply chain problems the priority was to test only suspected patients and symptomatic hcws taking into account that not all cases are symptomatic and some people may be infectious before they develop symptoms many hcws were worried about their risk of exposing family members to the virus 4 as a result there was a need for hcws screening protocol that provides data base about the prevalence of covid-19 infection among our staff therefore a screening regimen has been proposed for all hcws who work in direct contact with covid-19 patients including physicians nurses and other personnel given the high prevalence of mild clinical presentations that may go undetected 5 and after the availability of pcr-kit we decided to changed our strategy to be sure that our hcws are free of infection by both the pcr test and home-isolation period so we started to screen all asymptomatic hcws with any history of contact with covid-19 patients we think that the advantage of having an objective regimen by lab test will help in decreasing the stress and worries of the hcws about their risk of having the virus 4 to reduce the risk of transmitting covid-19 from hcws to their colleagues or to other non-covid-19 patients and to be able to formulate policies regarding workflow especially in the absence of standard best practices moreover this may help health care providers in other institutions to develop policies regarding hcws during similar pandemics as mentioned above some studies showed that about 10 of all those infected with covid-19 in some european countries are hcws 4 however in this study we found that the prevalence of positive-covid-19 among asymptomatic hcws who take care of patients infected with the novel coronavirus was 0 although this result could be in part due to our policies and protective measures it was unexpected and against our assumption as hcws are high risk group potential explanations for this difference in the result are firstly the majority of admitted patients to our hospital were asymptomatic 88 and detected by epidemiological investigation teams as patients are most infectious when they are symptomatic secondly rrt-pcr test has risk of eliciting false-negative results especially in asymptomatic cases due torelatively lowviral loads additionally we used nasopharyngeal swab sampling however the optimum sample types during infections caused by covid-19 remain to be fully determined and require expertise 12 the findings of this study have to be seen in light of some limitations the first is the limited number of covid-19 patients admitted to our hospital the second limitation concerns the timing of screening which was 4 weeks after the admission of the first covid-19 patient during this period hcws may have been infected with the virus at some point and recovered by the time of screening additionally this is an empiric way of screening due to lack of previous research studies that address this subject it is worth mentioning that among the 385 hcws assigned to deal with covid-19 patients only two nurses were infected first case was male aged 27 years who was diagnosed after he developed symptoms at the beginning of his fist shift most probably that he had infected outside the hospital he was excluded from the study because he was symptomatic and the inclusion criterion was only asymptomatic hcws the second case was 28-year-old asymptomatic female she diagnosed by rrt-pcr due to history of contact with her infected colleague and she was excluded from the study as the source of infection was outside the hospital this represents only 05 of total hcws importantly this is a rapidly moving topic of research therefore our result must be cautiously interpreted and should not give us a false sense of security regarding the prevalence of positive covid-19 among hcws our perspective is to improve surveillance of hcws and to identify the best approach to protect hcws in order to assure source control to insure a safe working environment unexpectedly the prevalence of positive covid-19 among asymptomatic hcws who take care of patients infected with the novel coronavirus was 0 this result must be cautiously interpreted further studies are needed in order to find effective strategy of screening hcws to insure a safe working environment institutional approval was obtained

ongoing outbreak has been characterised as a pandemic by who because no definitive treatment for covid-19 is available yet identification of patients at high risk for severe illness is crucial to prepare and provide sufficient supportive therapy additionally a massive increase in case numbers has led to the collapse of health-care systems in several countries therefore triage of patients and their transportation to medical facilities with dedicated intensive-care capabilities are necessary the clinical characteristics of covid-19 and the pathogenicity of sars-cov-2 are still being investigated most studies published at the beginning of the outbreak focused on patients with severe disease2 3 4 5 although more recent studies have considered patients with mild or moderate covid-196 7 in japan many infections occurred among the passengers and crew members on board the diamond princess cruise ship in february 2020 by march 1 2020 there were approximately 700 individuals with laboratory-detected sars-cov-2 infection8 9 the 3711 passengers and crew members on the cruise ship were tested for sars-cov-2 by rt-pcr and all symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals were referred to medical institutions designated for infectious diseases in accordance with the infectious diseases control law of japan8 9 approximately 15 of all patients with laboratory-detected infection from the diamond princess were admitted to the self-defense forces central hospital in tokyo japan 
research in context
evidence before this study
we searched pubmed from its inception until march 1 2020 for articles published in english using the keywords novel coronavirus 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 covid-19 mass infection herd infection cruise ship diamond princess asymptomatic and subclinical there were no published clinical studies featuring covid-19 as a result of mass infection on board a cruise ship we found two articles that compared people with asymptomatic infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 or mild or severe covid-19 however neither described potential predictors of symptomatic illness among people infected with sars-cov-2 and markers for disease progression in patients with covid-19
added value of this study
to our knowledge this is the first study showing the predictors of symptomatic illness in people infected with sars-cov-2 we present a summary of the clinical characteristics of 104 participants with laboratory-detected sars-cov-2 infection as a result of mass infection on the diamond princess cruise ship who were treated at self-defense forces central hospital japan from feb 11 to feb 25 2020 serum lactate dehydrogenase concentrations were significantly higher in patients who were initially asymptomatic on admission to the hospital and developed symptomatic covid-19 during the observation period than in those who remained asymptomatic throughout older age consolidation on chest ct images and lymphopenia on admission were more frequent in patients with severe covid-19 than those with mild covid-19 at the end of observation and thus could be potential risk factors for disease progression
implications of all the available evidence
more than 70 of our patients with sars-cov-2 infection had asymptomatic or mild disease however massive increase in case numbers has led to the collapse of health-care systems combining clinical and laboratory findings with chest ct imaging could help to identify people who are at risk of symptom onset and clinical deterioration
 in clinical settings identifying people who are at risk of symptom onset and clinical deterioration is essential therefore understanding the clinical characteristics of patients with covid-19 of different severity is necessary to that end we retrospectively analysed the detailed clinical characteristics of hospitalised people with sars-cov-2 infection as a result of the diamond princess outbreak including those with asymptomatic infection and mild or severe covid-19 who were treated in the self-defense forces central hospital we did a retrospective review of the medical records of passengers and crew members with laboratory-detected sars-cov-2 infection who were aboard the diamond princess and were admitted to the self-defense forces central hospital in tokyo japan between feb 11 and feb 25 2020 the 3711 passengers and crew members on the diamond princess were examined by quantitative rt-pcr or nested rt-pcr for sars-cov-2 at the national institute of infectious diseases and regional institutes of public health using pharyngeal swabs or sputum specimens according to the recommended protocol by the japanese national institute of infectious disease8 9 10 11 12 this study was reviewed and approved by the japan self-defense forces central hospital approval number 01011 informed consent both written and oral was obtained from all enrolled participants participant information was retrospectively obtained from the hospital medical records and included nationality clinical records laboratory findings and chest ct images participants clinical history physical examination and chest ct scans were done on the day of admission and any blood tests were completed within the first 2 days following admission geographical regions for nationalities were classified according to the standard country or area codes for statistical use by the un statistics division all data were obtained and reviewed by two study investigators st and ki the observation period was defined as the time interval between the date of admission and the date of discharge or feb 26 2020 whichever was earliest asymptomatic cases were defined as people with sars-cov-2 infection presenting with no clinical signs and symptoms from medical interviews and physical examinations from the start of quarantine feb 3 to end of hospitalisation severe symptomatic cases were defined as participants showing clinical symptoms of pneumonia dyspnoea tachypnoea peripheral capillary oxygen saturation 93 and need for oxygen therapy9 participants with other symptoms were classified as mild cases radiographical findings were not used to classify cases meaning asymptomatic cases could still present with radiographical abnormalities continuous variables with a normal distribution were expressed as mean sd and with a non-normal distribution as median iqr and compared using students t test for parametric data and wilcoxon rank-sum test for non-parametric data odds ratios ors and a two-sided 95 cis for ors were calculated categorical variables were compared using the 2 test or if the cells had expected frequencies of less than ten using fishers exact test a two-sided p value of less than 005 was considered significant all statistical analyses were done using stata 13 there was no funding source for this study the corresponding author had full access to all study-related data and had final responsibility for the decision to submit the study for publication between feb 11 and feb 25 2020 107 people with laboratory-detected sars-cov-2 infection on board the diamond princess were hospitalised at the self-defense forces central hospital in japan three people were excluded from the study because they withdrew consent and 104 participants were included in the final analysis participants were aged 2593 years with a median age of 68 years iqr 4775 and 54 52 were male table 1

 univariable analysis showed no significant differences in the distribution of age sex and comorbidities or the prevalence of abnormal lung findings and ct patterns between symptomatic and asymptomatic participants the prevalence of increased lactate dehydrogenase ldh concentrations was significantly higher in participants who were initially asymptomatic but developed symptomatic covid-19 during the observation period or 725 95 ci 1433670 p0020 appendix p 4 the eight participants who developed severe covid-19 during the observation period were aged 4287 years median 75 years iqr 7277 and five 63 were male appendix pp 23 the period from symptom onset to the reclassification of disease presentation as severe covid-19 ranged from 1 to 5 days median 4 days iqr 35 additionally all eight participants developed radiographical abnormalities on ct before the emergence of symptoms of typical pneumonia such as tachypnoea dyspnoea and hypoxaemia median 4 days iqr 25 before symptoms range 18 days figure 2
 four 50 of these participants had no symptoms of cough and three 38 had no symptoms of fever at study end when comparing these eight participants who developed severe covid-19 with the 76 participants who remained asymptomatic or had mild covid-19 at the end of the observation period we found no significant differences in the distribution of sex and comorbidities between the two groups appendix pp 23 compared with the 76 participants who were asymptomatic or had mild disease at the end of the observation period the eight participants who developed severe covid-19 were significantly

p0039 on the day of admission appendix pp 23 finally when comparing clinical characteristics between participants with mild and severe covid-19 at the end of the observation period we found that patients in the severe covid-19 group were significantly older than those in the mild covid-19 group table 3 there were no significant differences in the distribution of sex comorbidities clinical signs and symptoms between the two groups however there was a greater prevalence of consolidation as a ct pattern in participants with severe disease than in those with mild disease or 327 95 ci 115930 table 3 additionally the prevalence of lymphopenia was higher in participants who had severe covid-19 at the end of the observation period than in those with mild covid-19 440 1571232 table 3 this retrospective single-centre study provides a summary of the clinical features of people with sars-cov-2 infection and covid-19 of varying severity as a result of mass infection on board a cruise ship ldh concentrations were significantly higher in the ten participants who were initially asymptomatic on admission to the hospital and developed symptomatic covid-19 during the observation period than in the 33 participants who remained asymptomatic throughout older age consolidation on chest ct images and lymphopenia on admission were significantly more frequent among the 28 participants with severe covid-19 at the end of the observation period than among the 43 participants with mild covid-19 older age consolidation and lymphopenia on admission were also more frequent among the eight patients who developed severe covid-19 during observation compared with those who were asymptomatic or had mild covid-19 at the end of the observation period overall these findings suggest that serum ldh concentration might be a predictor of symptomatic illness among people infected with sars-cov-2 and that older age consolidation on chest ct images and lymphopenia are potential risk factors for disease progression in patients with covid-19 the predictors of symptomatic illness among people infected with sars-cov-2 and risk factors for disease progression in covid-19 are still partially unclear because people who are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms do not necessarily visit a hospital and in many instances are even actively discouraged from doing this during the covid-19 outbreak on the diamond princess 3711 individuals on board were tested for sars-cov-2 by rt-pcr and all individuals found positive for sars-cov-2 infection were referred to hospital this unique situation allowed us to retrospectively observe the clinical course of asymptomatic people with sars-cov-2 infection as well as those with mild and severe covid-19 symptoms previously published findings of covid-19 in china suggest that old age male sex and presence of comorbidities are potential risk factors for disease progression and poor prognosis1 12 zhou and colleagues13 indicated that older age high sequential organ failure assessment score and increased d-dimer concentrations were potential risk factors for death in patients with covid-19 whereas qin and colleagues14 reported that lymphopenia and an increased neutrophillymphocyte ratio were frequently observed in patients with severe covid-19 compared with those with mild disease our findings support those of previous reports suggesting older age and lymphopenia as potential risk factors for severe covid-19 lymphopenia which is a common feature of symptomatic covid-1915 16 could be a direct consequence of sars-cov-2 or might be mediated by inflammatory cytokines and chemokines qin and colleagues14 also suggested that sars-cov-2 infection might affect t lymphocytes and dysregulate the immune system consequently leading to secondary bacterial infections they also suggested that in severe cases lymphopenia could be induced by inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including tumor necrosis factor- interleukin il-2 receptor il-6 il-8 and il-10 and could lead to lymphocyte deficiency and migration14 however in the present study we observed lymphopenia in 27 of participants who were asymptomatic at the end of the observation period further studies are warranted to determine the mechanism of lymphopenia for the prevention of covid-19 exacerbation comparing the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines between patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic covid-19 might help to understand the mechanism of lymphopenia in this study the prevalence of consolidation detected by chest ct was significantly higher in severe cases than in mild cases in patients who were symptomatic at the end of observation consolidation was also frequently detected in participants who developed severe covid-19 during the observation period pan and colleagues17 and shi and colleagues18 reported that abnormal lung findings varied from ground-glass opacities to consolidation during the course of covid-19 and that the appearance of consolidation was more frequent within 13 weeks after symptom onset previous studies have found that 55 of patients with covid-19 developed dyspnoea in a median of 8 days iqr 513 after symptom onset1 thus the development of consolidation on ct is associated with disease deterioration generally consolidation is easily detectable by chest x-ray which therefore might be useful for the evaluation of risk for disease progression in patients with covid-19 in settings with few resources additionally ct imaging showed a high prevalence of lung abnormalities in patients with covid-19 the various patterns of abnormal lung findings were observed in asymptomatic 52 as well as in symptomatic 73 participants at the end of the observation period previous reports focusing on ct imaging findings of covid-19 also noted the presence of abnormal lung findings in asymptomatic individuals18 19 bai and colleagues20 investigated the common radiological characteristics of covid-19 pneumonia and reported that chest ct had a diagnostic sensitivity of 7393 and a specificity of 93100 in distinguishing covid-19 from viral pneumonia therefore chest ct might also be a useful diagnostic tool for asymptomatic and symptomatic people with sars-cov-2 infection in the present study all eight patients who developed severe covid-19 during the observation period presented with ct abnormalities before the appearance of typical pneumonia symptoms such as dyspnoea tachypnoea and hypoxaemia of these eight patients four had no cough and three had no fever at the end of observation these findings highlight that covid-19 pneumonia can develop without any notable symptoms conversely most asymptomatic participants with radiological abnormalities on ct imaging did not develop severe pneumonia the differences observed in clinical outcomes might be associated with patient background characteristics as well as the genetic and pathogenic diversity of sars-cov-2 understanding the relevance of ct abnormalities to the duration of virus shedding and the incidence of secondary bacterial pneumonia is important to improve the clinical management of covid-19 further investigation is needed to clarify the clinical impact of ct findings in people with asymptomatic sars-cov-2 infection or mild covid-19 notably we found a significant difference in the prevalence of increased ldh concentrations between patients who developed symptomatic covid-19 during the observation period and those who remained asymptomatic throughout although there was no significant difference in the prevalence of lymphopenia between the two groups increased serum ldh concentrations are associated with lung tissue damage21 and serum ldh is considered a marker for disease activity and progression in pneumonia from various causes22 23 given that abnormal lung findings are frequently observed in people with asymptomatic sars-cov-2 infection our results indicate that increased ldh concentrations might also reflect lung tissue damage by covid-19 and might be considered a predictor of symptomatic illness among people infected with sars-cov-2 patient assessment with determination of serum ldh and chest ct imaging might facilitate the successful dedication of medical resources to patients who are at increased risk for disease progression in the setting of mass infections as well as in normal clinical settings the major limitations of this study were selection bias and the small population size we enrolled a homogeneous cluster of relatively healthy individuals who remained on board a cruise ship for an extended period of time therefore the patient population was not an exact representation of normal clinical settings triage on the diamond princess before emergency transportation also introduced a sampling bias with an atypically large number of participants the self-defense forces central hospital in tokyo where symptomatic individuals were referred to is close to the yokohama port where the cruise ship was docked however critical cases were preferentially referred to neighbouring designated hospitals in yokohama that were equipped to handle infectious diseases likewise some clinical signs and symptoms could have occurred and resolved before people were referred to our hospital and thus might have been missed by our study additionally laboratory tests and ct images were obtained only once for most patients and thus we were unable to determine changes in lymphocyte count and radiological findings over the course of observation in conclusion our study highlights clinical features of people infected with sars-cov-2 with various degrees of severity and shows that serum ldh age consolidation on ct scan and lymphopenia might be predictors of disease severity multicentre multinational cohort studies with large population sizes that use multivariable analysis should be done to more accurately determine predictive markers for symptomatic illness among people infected with sars-cov-2 and risk factors for disease progression the raw data used in this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request

cases under 18 years old with covid-19 infections leukopenia mostly occurred in asymptomatic infections  since december 2019 a type of novel coronavirus which was designated novel coronavirus 2019 2019-ncov by world health organization who occurred in wuhan hubei china 1 and then it spread to the whole country and even the whole world 23  on february 11 2020 the who announced a new name for the epidemic disease caused by 2019-ncov 2019 coronavirus disease covid-19 as for the virus itself the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv has renamed the previously provisionally named 2019-ncov as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruse-2 sars-cov-2 4 the origin of sars-cov-2 has not yet been explored and early studies have found that wild animals such as pangolin were potential intermediate hosts of virus 5 6  which means that the virus was carried by wild animals at the beginning and now it was the first time to invade human beings meanwhile it also means that humans cognition of covid-19 was not complete and it was still in the process of exploration china was the first country to experience covid-19 and most of the early reported cases indicated middle-aged and elderly people or who existed diabetes hypertension and cardiovascular diseases were common children were few 7 8 9 10  however because of the immature immune system of children and with the spread of the epidemic and the number of children cases increases gradually which should be paid more attention to childrens group 11 12 13 we aim to compare and analyze the epidemiological characteristics and physiological test data of asymptomatic patients and symptomatic group explored whether there were significant differences between the two groups so as to provide a theoretical

the maximum probability to infection with covid-19 incubation period theoretically the incubation period is between onset infection and onset symptom however because the specific time of morbidity is affected by a variety of factors and cannot be accurately measured we think the potential exposure time to the time that be allowed to get into hospital as the incubation period the number of days of treatment cycle were actually counted in this study which refers to the time from the first diagnosis to the definite detection show the patient was cured excluding the observation time transferred to

process the missing values of the data considering the sample size was less than 40 fishers exact method was used to analyze the difference of class variable between the two groups independent sample t test was used for quantitative variables which conform to normal distribution among two groups and non-parametric test of independent samples was used for variable data that not conform to normal

in this research the whole cohort encompassed 137 cases with covid-19 infections including adults and children as well as asymptomatic and confirmed covid-19 infections twenty-five cases of age under 18 years old were divided into asymptomatic covid-19 infections cohort and confirmed covid-19 infection cohort we respectively compared the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the two groups studies have shown that from the current cases who were sent to hospital to receive treatment covid-19 was less severe in patients under 18 years old and most of were mild or moderate 14 however there have been reports of critical illness in children at present 15  among the 25 cases in this study 16 64 1625 had appeared infection symptoms and 9 36 925 had no symptoms it should be pointed out that asymptomatic patients had no clinical performance but it does not mean that they belong to patients with a mild degree of infection the severity of infection should be determined according to the duration of virus activity in the body 16  moreover asymptomatic patients are infectious and can still cause a certain range of transmission 17 among asymptomatic patients in the study 5 556 cases of the patients were male in terms of age the youngest patient was only more than 5 months old the oldest patient was 16 years old the average age was 827 years old and the median age was 7 years old inter-quartile range 6 to 10 while 16 symptomatic patients made up of 10 625 male from age structure to see the youngest patient was an infant who only more than 2 months

difference in gender and age between the two groups p053 and p034 respectively in pneumonia cases infected by sars-cov-2 in patients under 18 years old the incubation is as short as one day and as long as 14 days in this study the mean sequence method was used to process the data about 8 patients incubation absence the median incubation period for symptomatic patients was 10 days inter-quartile range 7 to 10  and 15 patients 9375 1516 had an incubation period of less than two weeks previous studies have shown that the average treatment period of light and normal types was not more than two weeks collectible statistics show that the shortest period of asymptomatic patients was 6 days the longest treatment period was 26 days and the average treatment period was 14 days for people who have symptoms the shortest treatment cycle was 4 days the longest treatment cycle was 20 days and the average treatment cycle was 12 days the data showed that the average treatment circle of 9 asymptomatic patients was longer than two weeks and which was longer than symptomatic patients however there was no significant difference between the two groups in the treatment cycle according to the existing epidemiological data people who had visited wuhan or had a living story in the city or other areas of hubei province were those with high incidence of covid-19 and close family contact was the key

significant differences in leukopenia between the two groups p004 but no significant differences in other laboratory test items all the 25 patients underwent chest ct scan after getting into the hospital only 1 1111 case of the asymptomatic patients had the characteristics of pulmonary infection figure 2  the occurrence of the 2019-ncov in hubei province aroused the attention of the provincial committee and government in guizhou province and then leading organization quickly formulates appropriate prevention and control measures guizhou province had the least covid-19 patients in

this version posted may 26 2020 the reason that patients incubation period exist missing data is that 12 48 1225 childrens age at 10 years old or younger due to the young did not have the ability to accurately describe onset time of their symptoms or even no memory about onset symptom another reasonable explanation is that asymptomatic patients have no obvious symptoms in the early stage of infection so they are not aware of the fact of infection in addition the average treatment period among 9 asymptomatic patients was more than two weeks and longer than 2 days for symptomatic patients and 3 3333 patients treatment period was more than 3 weeks the reason is that the long incubation period of asymptomatic patients made the virus survive in the body for a long time and the degree of virus invasion was severe so it needs to undergo a longer treatment cycle the literature has proved that in the routine blood test of covid-19 patients the occurrence of white blood cells or lymphocyte count decreased were common phenomenon 9 18  and the number of white blood cells in both mild and moderate types is mostly decreased in this study 5 asymptomatic patients white blood cells had decreased while only 1 symptomatic patients 62 white blood cells had decreased and 2 125 cases had increased there was a significant difference in white blood cells between the two groups p004 the reasonable explanation was that although the 5 asymptomatic patients had no clinical performance they were infected with sars-cov-2 was a pre-exist fact the erosion of the virus caused excessive destruction of white blood cells so the number of white blood cells in peripheral blood had decreased however the presence of white blood cell count increased in patients with symptomatic was indicative that the aggravation of the patients condition as  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the

this is the first study to use clinical inspection results and epidemiological survey data about covid-19 in patients under 18 years old during the recovery stage secondly the nature of our study was a retrospectively analysis that compared symptomatic with asymptomatic patients to draw conclusions thirdly it is the first time that leukopenia is found mostly in asymptomatic patients under 18 years old with covid-19 certainly there are some disadvantages and shortages in the research for example the sample size of this study was a total of 25 patients which was small and lacked credibility additionally in view of the small number of covid-19 patients in guizhou province the sample size of patients under 18 years old with covid-19 in this study was small so our conclusion will be verified by more studies in the future in this study most of patients under 18 years old infected by sars-cov-2 were mild or moderate type leukopenia mostly occurred in asymptomatic patients under 18 years old with covid-19 than in those with confirmed infections all authors declared that there are no conflicts interests involved in the article  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made

ambulatory population across seasons ruthie birger haruka morita devon comito ioan filip marta galanti benjamin lane chanel ligon daniel rosenbloom atinuke shittu minhaz ud-dean rob desalle paul planet jeffrey shaman michael imperiale j   respiratory virus infections are among the most common diseases in humans and cause significant morbidity and mortality across seasons and populations 1 while respiratory virus infections can often be mild these infections are typically undocumented as individuals may not seek medical care because either the infection is asymptomatic or it elicits symptoms not severe enough to warrant seeking care as a consequence standard medical surveillance provides an incomplete picture of the epidemiology of respiratory infections in this study which was an extension of a previously published study focusing on infection in this population during only the summer months 2 we focused on ascertaining the rates of asymptomatic infection for the following suite of respiratory viruses adenovirus coronavirus cov human metapneumovirus hmpv human rhinovirus hrv influenza virus respiratory syncytial virus rsv and parainfluenza virus piv the population in this study was not only largely asymptomatic but also specifically ambulatory we recruited participants from among visitors to a new york city tourist attraction we therefore might have missed sampling severely symptomatic patients who were not well enough to visit the attraction but we nonetheless can estimate the levels of prevalence in a setting where transmission is likely some previous studies have measured or inferred asymptomatic respiratory virus shedding prevalence levels however such estimates range widely across demographics pathogens and sampling approaches a study carried out in nashville tn and salt lake city ut recruited 238 completely asymptomatic adults no symptoms within 14 days of recruitment who were controls for patients with pneumonia from among visitors to outpatient primary care clinics for routine health checks of these individuals only 5 2 tested positive for human rhinovirus hrv coronavirus cov or human metapneumovirus hmpv 3 a different study also based in salt lake city ut which prospectively recorded infection and symptoms over time within families recruited from the university of utah campus community found that 47 of respiratory infections among adults were asymptomatic influenza a virus hmpv cov hku1 and cov oc43 were more frequently associated with symptoms 4 among elderly adults enrolled in prospective surveillance in rochester ny two studies have shown that very high proportions 80 to 90 were symptomatic when infected with respiratory syncytial virus rsv influenza virus and hmpv 5 6 asymptomatic infection rates may vary as a function of host age and virus in one study 52 of asymptomatic children recruited from an alaskan community tested positive for shedding respiratory virus in a one-time sampling scheme with the majority having hrv and adenovirus 7 in another prospective surveillance investigation comparing positivity levels of symptomatic and asymptomatic infants in perth australia respiratory viruses were detected in 70 of samples from symptomatic infants and in 246 of samples from asymptomatic infants 8 in general among children studies have found that 246 to 64 of human rhinovirus hrv infections are asymptomatic 710 a number of studies have also documented the fraction of asymptomatic children who are shedding virus rather than the fraction of infected children who are asymptomatic calvo et al documented an hrv shedding rate of 123 among healthy children 9 van benten et al found that 20 of asymptomatic infants 2 years old tested positive for hrv 11 similarly nokso-koivisto et al found that 20 of children without any past or recent respiratory infection symptoms tested positive for hrv or coronavirus cov 12 other studies examining multiple respiratory agents documented respiratory virus infection in 40 and 42 of children without symptoms 13 14 the definition of symptomatic infection is not standardized but most of these studies defined asymptomatic patients as those free from symptoms at the time of study participation or within a window around the time of enrollment this wide variation in symptomatic versus asymptomatic presentations underscores the need for further studies to understand the distribution of symptoms across infection statuses here we document the shedding prevalence of a number of common respiratory viruses in an ambulatory adult population as well as the distributions of symptomatology and symptom severity sampling was conducted in two seasonal arms one carried out in the late springearly summer summer arm which has been previously reported 2 and one carried out in the late winterearly spring winter arm in the summer arm we found that over 5 of individuals tested positive for respiratory virus with the majority testing positive for hrv but with over half also reporting being asymptomatic we hypothesized that these numbers might vary by season as many respiratory infections as well as ambulatory population contact dynamics display seasonal patterns since we published our previous study genmark diagnostics the manufacturer of the respiratory viral panel rvp assay used to analyze these samples determined that a higher cutoff value for positivity was warranted for some of the assayed viruses this paper thus rereports the summer study with a cutoff value of 25 namm2 rather than 3 namm2 so the numbers differ from those reported in shaman et al 2 we received consent from surveyed and swabbed a total of 2685 individuals 18 years of age or older from among visitors passing through a room in the tourist attraction some directly approached the study recruiters while others were present while a recruiter was explaining the study and elected to join afterward a total of 1477 participants were enrolled between 29 april and 31 july 2016 summer and a total of 1208 between 28 january and 30 april 2017 winter table 1 among all participants 577 were reported as female 417 as male and 06 as transgender gender

as other or of two or more races and 49 gave no response 217 identified as hispanic while 778 did not a total of 398 of participants were in the 18-to-29-year-old age range 209 were 30 to 39 years of age 220 were 40 to 49 years of age 12 were 50 to 64 years of age and 42 were 65 or older a total of 426 reported having had a flu shot while 520 had not had one and 54 did not know whether they had had one in response to the statement i get sick more easily or more often than most people i know 34 reported that they strongly agreed 113 somewhat agreed 135 neither agreed nor disagreed 230 somewhat disagreed and 488 strongly disagreed the breakdowns across all of the categorical variables described above were similar between the summer and winter arms of the study see table 1 among all 2685 participants across both seasons there were a total of 168 62 individuals who tested positive for respiratory virus of these 85 506 were positive for hrv 65 387 for cov and 18 102 for adenovirus hmpv rsv influenza virus or piv there were no coinfections in the summer arm only 56 of participants tested positive 2 whereas in the winter arm 70 did these positivity results did show differences across seasons in terms of virus distribution fishers exact test p  0001 though not in terms of overall positivity prevalence p  013 the majority of infections in the summer arm were hrv infections 710 with 193 testing positive for cov and the other 97 testing positive for influenza virus hmpv rsv or piv however the majority of infections in the winter arm were cov infections 576 with 306 testing positive for hrv and the remaining 118 testing positive for adenovirus hmpv influenza virus or piv fig 1a there was evidence of differing viral positivity rates across the months with the highest proportion of positive tests 111 occurring in february p  0001 figure 1b shows the percentage of positive tests per month broken down by virus testing positive for respiratory virus was positively associated with consumption of cold and flu medicine among all participants and this association was consistent across the seasonal arms fishers exact test p  0001 the proportion of participants testing positive who were symptomatic ranged from 36 to 394 overall depending on symptomatic definition there were slight differences between the seasonal arms with 25 to 481 of positives being symptomatic during the summer arm and 48 to 301 being symptomatic for the winter arm again depending on definition there was some evidence of differences in the proportions of infections that were symptomatic between seasons by symptomatic definitions 1 and 2 chi-square p  005 and 003 respectively see materials and methods for an explanation of the scoring method used for quantification of symptomatic definitions but there was no evidence of differences for any other definition rates of being symptomatic differed significantly among virus-positive and virus-negative participants with positive-testing participants more likely to meet symptomatic criteria though there were up to 176 of individuals who tested negative who were nonetheless symptomatic depending on definition table 2 this association was consistent across the seasonal arms no other univariate associations between testing positive for respiratory virus and other collected characteristics eg race gender age etc were found the best-fit logistic regression models according to minimum akaike information criterion aic values are shown in table 3 for all participants combined across seasons the best-fit model supported an association of an increased likelihood of testing positive for respiratory virus infection all viruses with a higher total symptom score but with no other variables there was some difference between the arms with the association for the summer arm holding for the symptom score and being hispanic and that for the winter arm holding only for the symptom score performing the analysis on all participants both arms for hrv positivity the best-fit model showed an association of positivity with symptom score being hispanic and age category for the summer arm and winter arm considered individually the association held only for symptom score and being hispanic for cov positivity the best-fit model indicated an association between positivity and symptom score for both seasonal arms among the positive-testing participants signal intensity measured continuously in nanoamps per square millimeter was positively associated with reporting allergies p  005 there were differences between the seasonal arms for this finding however for the winter arm allergies were similarly associated with quantitated score of signal intensity for all positives whereas there was an association of signal intensity with age but not with allergies for the summer arm there was a negative association between signal intensity and the 40-to-49-year-old and 50-to-64-year-old age categories compared to the 18-to-29-year-old age category among hrv positive-testing participants both arms combined there was strong evidence of a negative association between signal intensity and the 50-to-64-year-old age category compared to the 18-to-29-year-old age category weak evidence of a positive association between signal intensity and having allergies and weak evidence of a positive association between signal intensity and being hispanic again there were seasonal differences with the symptom score being negatively associated with signal intensity in the winter arm and with being hispanic being positively associated in the summer arm for those positive for cov signal intensity was weakly positively associated with having allergies p  01 this association held across seasons with stronger association in the winter arm p  002 in the summer arm there were also associations with symptom score race and gender with signal intensity being positively associated with symptom score a negative association between signal intensity and all other races compared to whites and a negative association with women compared to men among all participants there was strong evidence of a higher reported total symptom score among women than men analysis of variance anova p  0001 participants aged 30 to 39 years 40 to 49 years and 50 to 64 years had lower total reported symptom scores than participants aged 18 to 29 years anova p  0001 these results were consistent and significant across the seasonal arms reporting consumption of cold and flu medicines was positively associated with higher total symptom scores across all participants and also only among positives anova p  00001 this finding was also consistent across seasons there was evidence of differences in symptom scores by month across all participants anova p  0001 but there were no differences seen in assessing only the participants testing positive aov p  0725 fig 2 there were however differences in mean individual symptom scores by virus as shown in table 4 there was a positive association between reporting a greater tendency to get sick and total self-reported symptom scores among all participants aov p  00001 however there was no significant association between viral positivity and reporting a greater tendency to get sick these results were consistent across the seasonal arms interestingly the proportions of symptomatic individuals by the various definitions who tested negative were quite high 667 to 869 and this finding held across the seasonal arms examining this result further we found that for symptom definitions 1 and 2 the definitions that encompassed all symptoms there was a strong association among the participants who tested negative between being symptomatic and having allergies p  0001 the association between having allergies and being symptomatic among participants who tested negative was less strong for definition 2 p  005 and nonexistent for definitions 3 to 7 in this two-part study we found that 62 of adult visitors to a new york city tourist destination tested positive for the shedding of respiratory virus with 56 testing positive in the late spring and summer months and 70 testing positive during the winter and early spring months regardless of symptom definition over half of the participants who tested positive could be categorized asymptomatic across seasons whereas 819 to 996 of participants who tested negative were categorized asymptomatic prior estimates of symptomatic rates for persons positive for respiratory virus ranged from 9 to 80 9 10 15 16 the results from this study determined on the basis of less-strict definitions 1 and 2 were consistent with those estimates however the results based on symptom definitions 3 to 7 which incorporated stricter definitions indicated a lower percentage of symptomatic individuals than had been seen in some previous studies the winter results presented in this paper largely confirm the findings reported in the previously published summer study with some slight differences in seasonal prevalence and breakdown of infection composition for the summer arm the winter arm and the entire study respectively 259 328 and 296 of individuals testing positive reported no symptoms at all symptom score of zero these numbers indicate that though there may be a spectrum of symptom severity a substantial number of infected individuals are completely asymptomatic regardless the participants in this study even if symptomatic by the definitions used see materials and methods felt well enough to visit a tourist attraction there were few individuals who reported severe symptom scores or fever indicating that those with severe symptomatology might have stayed home and thus were not captured in this study conversely a substantial percentage of individuals who were symptomatic across the definitions did not test positive only some of the variation appears to have been due to allergies and only for symptom definitions 1 and 2 this result may indicate that symptoms persist after an infection has cleared that symptoms may appear before an infection is detectable or that symptoms may be due to infections not tested for in this study in multivariate analysis of viral positivity we found an expected association between having worse symptoms and testing positive for respiratory virus we also found some evidence of an association of hispanic ethnicity with being positive in particular for hrv this association has been found previously in other studies of respiratory virus 17 18 especially in children some of the best-fit models also included the age category although the only statistically significant result was that individuals aged 30 to 39 years were more likely to be positive than individuals aged 18 to 29 years this association might be due to the fact that 30-to-39-year-old adults may be more likely to have or to be in contact with young children who classically have a high prevalence of respiratory virus infection and frequently transmit infection to their parents m galanti r birger s m m ud-dean i filip h morita d comito s anthony g a freyer s ibrahim b lane c ligon p planet r rabadan a shittu e tagne j shaman submitted for publication however this association could also have manifested from selection bias represented by the individuals who chose to participate in the study manufacturer specifications as well as data from previous studies indicate that there is no association between esensor signal intensity and the amount of virus present in a sample however in this study we found evidence of an association between signal intensity and having allergies among all positives combined from both study arms and also among those in the winter arm alone although not among those in the summer arm alone there was however some association between signal intensity and age in the summer arm these findings build on our previously reported summer arm study and provide an estimate of baseline prevalence of respiratory virus shedding in an ambulatory population across seasons the results indicate that nearly 1 in 17 adults is shedding respiratory virus across seasons and that nearly 1 in 14 do so during the peak winter month there is evidence of a difference in virus species prevalence among seasons with hrv being the most prevalent virus species during the summer arm more than half of all reported summer infections were hrv infections and coronavirus being dominant during the winter arm more than half of all winter infections reported were coronavirus infections the impact of shedding prevalence on contagiousness or transmission is not yet well defined however there are several limitations to this study while the sampling scheme was designed to capture individuals from a population different from those represented in studies of persons seeking medical attention it would not capture individuals who stay home with severe symptoms however given that the site used in the study is frequented by tourists who usually only have a limited amount of time in new york city we hypothesize that many people might still visit the site despite having symptoms that would otherwise keep them home consequently our sample may be less skewed in symptom distribution than a random sample from the street conversely among tourist attraction visitors those with symptoms might have been more inclined to participate in this study symptoms were self-reported which can introduce error and were reported only for the previous 48 h for some viruses rna can be detected for several weeks following infection so some seemingly asymptomatic individuals who tested positive may have been previously infected and symptomatic further shedding prior to symptom development also occurs 19 these dynamics preclude calculation of the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic but not estimation of asymptomatic prevalence in the ambulatory population as the participants were asymptomatic at the time and were still shedding also the study was run over two seasons but there were no samples taken during the late summer or fall or early winter season when prevalence levels may be different for the diagnostic analysis we performed a molecular test but did not try to isolate viruses or determine titers and therefore cannot confirm whether the virus collected in samples was viable lastly this study excluded children who have a high burden of respiratory virus infection the findings presented here indicate a significant level of respiratory virus shedding in an ambulatory adult population across seasons as well as a substantial proportion of infections that are asymptomatic these results could help improve estimates of virus incidence and inform disease transmission modeling and forecasting which could then be used to support control efforts indeed determination of respiratory virus prevalence in nonclinical settings can help with the design of control measures in the real-world settings where most transmission occurs future potential work in this area could include replicating this study in other highly frequented areas in the city eg subway stations and parks and enrolling children in order to obtain estimates across a broader age range participants were surveyed with respect to demographic attributes including age gender and race as well for as other information including reports of recent travel preexisting medical conditions allergies self-reported propensity to get sick and flu shot status data were also collected per the common cold questionnaire 20 on whether participants were experiencing symptoms over the previous 48-h period commonly related to respiratory infection fever chills muscle pain watery eye runny nose sneezing sore throat cough and chest pain the severity level for each symptom was recorded on a likert scale none mild moderate and severe scored at 0 1 2 and

through blanket testing can be used as a possible measure for control of the sars-cov-2 transmission in lusaka zambia  2 abstract introduction the novel coronavirus disease  caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus -2 sars-cov-2 in africa is characterised by a more substantial proportion of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals thought to be playing a role in the spread of the infection the exact proportion and degree of infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals remains unclear studies however indicate that their management is crucial for control of sars-cov-2 transmission we developed a simplified deterministic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed seir mathematical model to assess the effect of active isolation of sars-cov-2 infected but asymptomatic individuals through blanket testing for control of the outbreak in lusaka province of zambia here we modelled two scenarios 1 assuming asymptomatic individuals comprised 70 of all covid-19 cases and 2 asymptomatic individuals comprised only 50 of the cases for contrast the model was assessed first under the assumption that asymptomatic individuals are equally as infectious as symptomatic individuals and then secondly and more likely assuming asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious as symptomatic individuals results for the model assuming 70 asymptomatic cases a minimum sustained blanket testing rate of  7911 tests100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak if asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious while if equal infectiousness was assumed then a testing rate of  10028 tests 100000 population would be required for 50 asymptomatic minimum blanket testing rates of  4540 tests 100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak at both assumed levels of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals relative to symptomatic individuals  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted

rock s andrea parisi d nokes james matt keeling j edwine barasa w  the first covid-19 case in kenya was confirmed on march 13 th  2020 here we provide forecasts for the potential incidence rate and magnitude of a covid-19 epidemic in kenya based on the observed growth rate and age distribution of confirmed covid-19 cases observed in china whilst accounting for the demographic and geographic dissimilarities between china and kenya we developed a modelling framework to simulate sars-cov-2 transmission in kenya kenyacov kenyacov was used to simulate sars-cov-2 transmission both within and between different kenyan regions and age groups kenyacov was parameterized using a combination of human mobility data between the defined regions the recent 2019 kenyan census and estimates of age group social interaction rates specific to kenya key epidemiological characteristics such as the basic reproductive number and the agespecific rate of developing covid-19 symptoms after infection with sars-cov-2 were adapted for the kenyan setting from a combination of published estimates and analysis of the age distribution of cases observed in the chinese outbreak we find that if person-to-person transmission becomes established within kenya identifying the role of subclinical and therefore largely undetected infected individuals is critical to predicting and containing a very significant epidemic depending on the transmission scenario our reproductive number estimates for kenya range from 178 95 ci 144 -214 to 346 95 ci 281-417 in scenarios where asymptomatic infected individuals are transmitting significantly we expect a rapidly growing epidemic which cannot be contained only by case isolation in these scenarios there is potential for a very high percentage of the population becoming infected median estimates 80 over six months and a significant epidemic of symptomatic covid-19 cases exceptional social distancing measures can slow transmission flattening the epidemic curve but the risk of epidemic rebound after lifting restrictions is predicted to be high  first identified in hubei province china capital wuhan there has been since december 2019 an ongoing epidemic of atypical pneumonia caused by the zoonotic novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 li q et al 2020  as of 8th april 2020 there have been over 14 million clinically andor laboratory confirmed cases of covid-19 with over 70000 deaths worldwide this is the first coronavirus pandemic a number of sub-saharan african countries including kenya were at moderate to high risk of novel coronavirus importation measured by volume of air travel arriving from infected chinese provinces gilbert et al 2020  as of 9th march8th april 2020 no east african country has had more than 200 confirmed cases of covid-19 and there are few confirmed instances of local transmission in the region world health organization 2020 however the likelihood of a significant outbreak remains high with potentially severe consequences for fragile regional health systems makoni 2020  the potentially high negative impact of a novel coronavirus outbreak in kenya provides a strong motivation for forecasting studies of covid-19 epidemic magnitude ahead of a serious outbreak under a number of plausible scenarios this modeling study provides a baseline for continuous updating as improved data become available eg time course of covid-19 cases updated mobility estimates and the proportion and infectivity of asymptomatic infections and new intervention strategies are proposed or implemented it also provides the basis for studies of health service capacity see accompanying article barasa et al 2020  sars-cov-2 is the third novel betacoronavirus to pose a global health threat since 2002 the other two being i severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 2002  and ii middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012  both previous novel coronaviruses ncovs were zoonotic and clinically similar in their disease presentation however they differed in their subclinical manifestation there was virtually no evidence of asymptomatic infections of sars-cov or of hidden person-to-person transmission caused by asymptomaticsubclinical or preclinical cases anderson et al 2004  in contrast mers-cov behaved more like other commonly circulating human covs with a substantial proportion of asymptomatic or preclinical infections cauchemez et al 2013  the role of asymptomatic infected individuals in this study we abbreviate to asymptomatics in the transmission of sars-cov-2 remains unclear a significant majority of detections of sars-cov-2 infection have occurred after infected individuals have presented clinically with covid-19 clinical cases of covid-19 have presented mostly among older age groups cpere 2020  this could be due to a stronger resistance among younger age groups to contracting sars-cov-2 zhang et al 2020 hilton  keeling 2020  or due to younger people developing covid-19 symptoms at a lower rate after contracting sars-cov-2 leading to under-ascertainment amongst those age groups one epidemiological study of 391 confirmed cases and their 1286 close contacts in shenzen found that children were as likely to be infected as adults bi et al 2020  despite presenting with symptoms less frequently another modelling study emphasizes the role of undetected subclinical transmission in explaining the observed epidemic dynamics in china li r et al 2020  these findings informed a central assumption of our modelling that all age-groups are equally susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection but that the symptomatic rate is different across age groups in a recent novel coronavirus transmission modelling study by wu et al wu et al 2020  a clinical sars-cov-2 case was defined essentially tautologically a clinical case is one that has sufficiently severe symptoms that the individual is detected by the health authorities however this presents a difficulty in translating symptomatic rates derived from chinese confirmed covid-19 clinical case data into a prediction of incidence in the kenyan setting mildly symptomatic cases defined as non-pneumonia and mild pneumonia cases by china cdc cpere 2020  that presented to the health system in china might not present to the health system in kenya in this study we provide forecasts of the possible epidemic course of covid-19 infections focussing on symptomatic infection following initial invasion of sars-cov-2 into kenya we recognize the limitations of using clinically detected cases from another setting china to infer a symptomatic rate in this setting kenya this reflects the difficulty in ascertaining covid-19 disease with an unclear available testing capacity and coverage this limitation highlights the importance of the sensitivity analysis in this modelling study we treated all sub-clinical undetected infected individuals in china as asymptomatic however the threshold for being a sub-clinical infected individual will be different in kenya and might miss significantly infectious or even diseased individuals this observation led us to consider a range of infectiousness scenarios for asymptomatic cases each scenario being capable of explaining the agedistribution of cases observed in china characteristics as china the reproductive number for kenya will not be the same as that estimated for the early stages of the pandemic in china for two main reasons 1 the age-profile of the kenyan population is significantly different to that of china kenya having a far younger populace therefore the symptomatic rate of a typical infected individual will be different in kenya compared to china 2 the typical mixing patterns between different age groups differ between the two countries therefore the transmission rate will differ even if the per-contact transmission probability is the same our central assumption is that all age groups are equally susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection and that differing rates of becoming symptomatic are responsible for the age distribution of confirmed covid-19 cases the age-dependent symptomatic rate could not be identified independently from an assumption about the infectiousness of undetected asymptomatics relative to detected symptomatic cases therefore we inferred agedependent symptomatic rates using the age distribution of confirmed covid-19 symptomatic cases in china for a range of values of the relative infectiousness of asymptomatics to symptomatic infected individuals the range of relative infectiousness scenarios considered in this study was 0 10 25 50 and 100 each of these scenarios is capable of explaining the age-distribution of cases observed in china but with a different set of fitted symptomatic rates in each scenario  figure 1  it is also possible to explain the age distribution of cases observed in china by assuming a biological mechanism exists which reduces the susceptibility of contracting sars-cov-2 for some age groups compared to others in the early stages of an epidemic it is not possible to distinguish between age-differing susceptibility and age-differing symptomatic rate if asymptomatics are not infectious 0 relative infectiousness we find that our estimates of the kenyan reproductive number r0 without interventions depend strongly on the relative infectiousness of the asymptomatic cases as a baseline if the symptomatic rate was age-independent so that age-structured mixing was the only driver of age heterogeneity then we would expect the reproductive number in kenya to be 383 higher than in china because of the typically higher mixing rates estimated within the kenyan population compared to the chinese population prem et al 2017  in a scenario where younger age groups are developing covid-19 symptoms at a lower rate after infection compared to older age groups and their infectiousness is negligible 0 then the r0 we predict for kenya is substantially lower than the r0 for china 288 lower this is also true if younger age groups are more resistant to contracting sars-cov-2 table 1  however in scenarios where asymptomatic infected are transmitting sars-cov-2 within the community the predicted r0 for kenya is higher than the estimates for china and this prediction holds even if the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic cases in kenya is 10 that of symptomatic cases table 1  in this modelling study we are investigating the course of a potential epidemic of covid-19 cases in kenya we are focused on medium-to-long term predictions assuming that detection at port-of-entry and within-kenya contact tracing fails to suppress transmission immediately after introduction the experience of countries which have experienced a substantial epidemic of covid-19 cases has been that the onset of rapid growth in clinical cases without any obvious transmission pathway between cases grasselli et al 2020 was preceded by a period of largely undetected transmission in the community identified subsequently via genetic analysis of sequenced strains bedford et al 2020  we recreate this invisible period of spread by assuming that there have been five generations of undetected transmission in nairobi before the first set of kenyan symptomatic cases are determined in each of the scenarios presented below we present results starting from the exponential growth phase of the epidemic the underlying transmission scenario cannot be disentangled from the symptomatic rate estimate we estimate that if the relative infectiousness rate of asymptomatics is higher then their symptomatic rate must be lower to account for the observed case distribution in china  figure 1  consequently the level of asymptomatic infectiousness in our model influences our expectation of the epidemics progress after five generations of unobserved transmission in all scenarios there were a small 1-6 number of initially symptomatic cases in scenarios where the relative infectiousness of asymptomatics is higher we are therefore also initializing with more asymptomatics to match the expected growth of the outbreak before detection in line with our reproductive ratio analysis if asymptomatics were contributing a negligible amount of transmission 0 relative infectiousness then in the absence of interventions we predict a comparatively long epidemic median estimate being 8 months until new symptomatic incidence ceases but with a high degree of uncertainty figure 2  with a slow growth rate of daily incidence and the median estimate of daily symptomatic cases goes above 100 per day about three months after the detection of the first cases  figure 2  left unchecked we would expect an epidemic with 0 asymptomatic infectiousness to result in 106 million symptomatic cases of covid-19 in kenya among a 563 overall population infection rate but with an exceptionally high level of prediction uncertainty 95 pi 0 -144m symptomatic cases 0-75 2 population symptomatic infection rate table 2  if asymptomatics are contributing to the epidemic then we predict a substantially faster spread than in the 0 relative infectiousness scenario transmission amongst the younger age groups who are expected to be largely asymptomatic substantially boosts the early transmission rate within the kenyan population leading to a rapidly arriving peak median estimates  3 months to peak and 6 months until end of epidemic after beginning of exponential growth in symptomatic infections and a high probability of more than 10000 daily symptomatic infections around the peak  figure 2  in these scenarios where asymptomatic infected individuals are contributing to transmission and in the absence of effective intervention we made a median estimate that novel coronavirus would spread first from nairobi into the lake victoria regions and central regions this spread is then closely followed by spread to mombasa and throughout the coastal region however the uncertainty intervals on this prediction are substantial  figure 2  our median prediction is that if unchecked by 50 days after the establishment of sars-cov-2 circulating in the kenyan population there will be more than 10 symptomatic cases of covid-19 daily in every region of kenya but that this depends on essentially

course of the epidemic range from 102 million symptomatic infections 884 population infection rate 95 pis 087m -113m 815-926 in the 10 relative infectiousness scenario to 086 million symptomatic infections 890 total population infection rate 95 pis 074m -097m 827-927 in the 100 relative infectiousness scenario table 2  public compliance with government advice on self-isolation following the development of covid-19 symptoms 50 reduction in the infectiousness of symptomatic cases and rapid isolation of the first 1000 symptomatic cases isolation achieved on average by 35 days post incubation would be sufficient to contain a major outbreak in the scenario where undetected cases do not transmit 0 infectiousness reducing the median predicted symptomatic infections from over 1 million to effectively zero if implemented immediately after first detection table 2  however case isolation and reduction in infectiousness of the detectedclinical cases alone was insufficient to stop a major outbreak in any forecast simulation with asymptomatic transmission or even achieve substantial delay in arrival of the peak or reduction in total cases  table 2  the essential difference in our predictions for the scenario with 0 relative infectiousness of asymptomatics and scenarios where asymptomatics are at least 10 as infectious as symptomatic infecteds could be seen in the different predicted age distributions of symptomatic cases in the scenario with no transmission from asymptomatics the observed epidemic was dominated by cases among the working-age population figure 3  who we estimated as having high rates of assortative ie within same age-group mixing  figure 4  and a small but not negligible risk of developing symptoms of covid-19 after infection in scenarios with at least 10 relative infectiousness of asymptomatics then the high rates of disassortative mixing between the elderly 75 year olds and children  figure  4  who we expected to have a high rate of asymptomatic infection led to the majority of observed cases occurring in the elderly population despite their relatively small proportion of the kenyan population  figure 3  in scenarios where asymptomatics are transmitting within the population without being detected and person-to-person transmission has become established in kenya it is unlikely that case isolation alone will be sufficient to contain a kenyan outbreak therefore we also estimated the impact of wide-ranging social distancing sd measures and movement restrictions mr on the epidemic progression in conjunction with case isolation ci in reality an implementation of these measures would include school closures a ban on mass gatherings a sharp reduction in non-essential social contacts and a sharp decrease in the amount of time individuals spend away from home the estimated effect of social distancing was to reduce assortative social mixing among both children and working-age adults figure 4  thereby reducing transmission overall however we expected social contacts to be increased within the household as individuals spend more time at home this had the effect of increasing the contact rate for 75 year old individuals compared to before sd measures were implemented because there is believed to be frequent within-household mixing between the elderly and childrenyoung adults in kenya figure 4

holder for this preprint  this combination of interventions sdmrci was predicted to be sufficient to slow down transmission and flatten the epidemic curve of covid-19 in the scenarios where asymptomatics transmit sars-cov-2 that is to eventually push the kenyan reproductive number below 1 however maintaining sd measures for the entire course of the epidemic is extremely challenging socially and economically therefore we investigated the effect of implementing the full set of interventions for 90 days after the detection of established transmission within the country followed by a relaxation we found that despite reducing transmission over the 90 days of implementation median estimate 0 symptomatic cases after 90 days in all scenarios there was a high probability of a rebound epidemic rapidly after relaxation of intervention measures in the absence of a return to strict interventions if incidence rates are observed to increase or novel effective vaccinesantivirals becoming available the rebound epidemic was predicted to be similar in magnitude to the avoided epidemic  figure 5  in this modelling study we have integrated existing data on the social structure and mobility of the kenyan population with rapidly evolving estimates of the fundamental epidemiology of sars-cov-2 so as to make the best possible prediction of the scale of the epidemic risk that kenya faces from the first coronavirus pandemic we predict that the impact of an epidemic of covid-19 cases in kenya could be severe with a high probability of observing more than 750 thousand infections with sufficient symptoms that they would have become clinical cases in the chinese setting if the epidemic was left unchecked we predict that in the more pessimistic scenarios and in the absence of an effective vaccine andor anti-viral treatments substantial restrictions on the social mixing and movement of the kenyan people either lasting for longer than three months or reimplemented if incidence rebounds would be required to control a covid-19 epidemic in kenya in this study we do not attempt to estimate the proportion requiring hospitalization ie those having most impact on the health services and most at risk of dying -nor estimate deaths estimating the true impact of the covid-19 epidemic in kenya requires an estimate of the clinical fraction of infecteds the likelihood of clinical cases being severely ill and a detailed and spatially explicit understanding of the capacity of the kenyan health service early work to assess kenyas health system capacity to absorb likely covid-19 cases using the predictions from this model on the likely scale of the pandemic reveal that kenyas health system is likely to be overwhelmed because of limited availability oxygen and other essential devices to facilitate oxygen therapy such as pulse oximeters and critical shortages of intensive care beds icu and ventilators barasa 2020  the analysis reports variation in kenyas surge capacity for hospital beds with the county with the least surge capacity likely to need 145 of its available hospital beds to accommodate covid-19 cases if the pandemic lasts for 6 months barasa 2020

additional 1511 icu beds and 1609 ventilators if the epidemic will last for 6 months the authors indicate the need to strengthen lower cost essential services such as oxygen availability before focusing on these higher cost investments the extrapolation of the symptomatic rate from chinese clinical observations to the kenyan setting is likely to be imprecise and should be replaced by symptomatic rates estimated from kenyan case data as this becomes available the chinese epidemiological reports include a substantial proportion 809 of mildly diseased cases cpere 2020 it is possible that a proportion of mildly diseased individuals in the kenyan setting would not seek medical attention and therefore would remain invisible to kenyan surveillance this observation suggests that the symptomatic rate estimated here could be an overestimate of the clinical incidence that will be seen in kenya on the other hand it should be noted that our estimate for the symptomatic rate is somewhat lower in some age groups than other estimates in the literature for example davies et al davies et al 2020  make a consensus estimate of the clinical fraction of 0-9 year old infecteds as 20 whereas we find the symptomatic rate for that age group is likely to be less than 1 as with all modelling studies there are limitations in our modelling structure that go beyond uncertainty in parameterization in particular it is possible that controlling a covid-19 epidemic in kenya will require measures which can break transmission from household to household however an explicit household structure is not part of the kenyacov modelling framework we replicate the effect of household structure in our modelling of social distancing using a combination of social context dependent agestructured mixing matrices and an effective decline in contact rate as individuals reduce contacts among the general population in favour of repeated contacts with a relatively small group of people within their own household whilst this is less realistic than a full individual-based stochastic model see for example ferguson et al ferguson et al 2005  the benefit of using kenyacov is that in the event of a substantial covid-19 epidemic in kenya the model is sufficiently performant that incorporating new information into forecasting could occur in near real-time as mentioned above it is critical that estimates of the symptomatic rate clinical fraction and rate of severe disease are derived from kenyan case data rather than simply extrapolated from other settings such kenyanspecific estimates of covid-19 augmented by more recent data on kenyan mobility will allow us to better understand the link between transmission predictions as given by kenyacov and the observed clinical burden of covid-19 in kenya without understanding the link between transmission and clinical burden the design of public health interventions is done blind and it is impossible to evaluate intervention success there remains a very high degree of uncertainty surrounding the underlying epidemiology of sars-cov-2 infection which inevitably degrades our certainty in the predictive modelling of transmission in kenya we have attempted to partially account for these underlying uncertainties by drawing some parameters from a plausible range rather than simply using point estimates however some of the epidemiological uncertainties are fundamental to the structure of the kenyacov model first we treat the rate of developing symptoms as the detection rate in the model following that the substantial majority of confirmed cases in the china were initially syndromic detections before test confirmation cpere 2020 however since the symptomatic rates used in kenyacov were inferred  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  from the age distribution of chinese confirmed cases this means that our model is predicting the incidence rate of cases that would have been clinical in the chinese epidemic it could be that the syndromic threshold for detection is different in kenya which would alter the effective transmission rate of the undetected cases by changing the definition of detected and undetected cases so that infectious and diseased individuals might be missed in the kenyan context who would have been identified in the chinese context second and following from the previous comment the rate of subclinical undetected transmission is critical to the expected outcome of an epidemic in kenya this reflects the fact that covid-19 disease has been predominantly observed amongst older age groups and therefore two major possibilities for a country with a younger demography arise in the first possibility the relatively large proportion of younger people effectively protect the elderly at-risk groups from transmission in the second possibility high rates of unobserved transmission within the young population cause significant numbers of clinical cases among the elderly we dont know which outcome will occur until a substantial number of cases are observed and so far no major covid-19 epidemic has occurred in sub-saharan africa if there exists climatic incompatibility for this strain of coronavirus andor inherent resistance in the population then all modelling estimates derived from the chinese experience should be revised downwards finally our model presents a partial picture of the likely effects of government interventions to slow the transmission of covid-19 government interventions such as social distancing and movement restrictions have secondary health social and economic effects that should be considered when making decisions about how to intervene dahab et al 2020 barasa 2020  for instance these interventions could disrupt routine health service delivery and access such as vaccinations and maternal and child health services cause income and job losses in ways that could push households into poverty and lead to a shrinking of country economies incorporating these dimensions in models and ascertaining net health and non-health benefits of interventions would provide a fuller picture and improve the quality of decision making we parameterized our sars-cov-2 transmission model from a range of data sources epidemiological parameters for sars-cov-2 were collected from estimates that have been reported in the literature table 1  we followed wesolowski et al wesolowski et al 2012 in dividing kenya into 20 regions corresponding to population density concentrations these regions overlap the 47 counties of kenya and results for the 47 counties were created from simulations on 20 regions by apportioning infections pro-rata according to the proportion of the region population from each county we subdivided the population by their home region and their age category in this study we consider 17 age categories 0-4 years old 5-9 years old   75-79 years old 80 years old the modelled population size in each regionage category

group  knbs 2020 we estimated the human mobility flux using mobile phone data on number and duration of trips from home regions to alternate regions wesolowski et al 2012  rescaled to number of journeys per person per day this allowed us to estimate both i the proportion of time typical individuals in each region spent away from their home region denoted   01 for each region  and ii a probability distribution for where typical individuals travel to when they leave their home region denoted  for probability of a person living in region travelling to region  the central mobility estimates depended on a reported median 5 nights duration per journey which is likely to be an overestimate for short-distance journeys and an underestimate for long journeys if the short-distance journeys are typically shorter than 5 nights and the long-distance journeys are typically longer then the serial interval of sars-cov-2 then this central mobility estimate will overestimate the rate at which sars-cov-2 spreads spatially in kenya the rate of contact between individuals currently in the same region including visitors to the region was determined by their age group using an estimated age-mixing contact matrix for kenya from the study by prem et al prem et al 2017  prem et al give estimated contact rates between age groups for 152 countries broken down by contact setting at home at work at school and other contacts amongst the population the epidemiological characteristics of sars-cov-2 were drawn from the literature and summarized into a belief distribution for key uncertain parameters table 3  the age-profile of cases used to infer the age-dependent symptomatic rates were from the first 44672 confirmed cases as published by china cdc on 11 th february 2020 cpere 2020 we used a variant of the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered seir metapopulation model keeling  rohani 2008  dubbed kenyacov to simulate transmission of sars-cov-2 in kenya the code and open source data for kenyacov can be found at httpsgithubcomsamuelbrand1kenyacov individuals divided their time between their home region and other regions according to their age and the region-specific travelling patterns described above for simplicity we assumed that age groups of individuals younger than 16 and older than 49 didnt move around the country therefore we defined the

develop sufficient symptoms to eventually become a clinical case with age-dependent probability   or they are sufficiently asymptomatic to remain subclinical and remains undetected with probability 1

peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  https doiorg101101 doiorg10 2020 by susceptible individuals who contract sars-cov-2 elsewhere and return to their home region we inferred age-dependent symptomatic rates for each age group by matching the age distribution of clinical cases expected from combining the next-generation matrix for sars-cov-2 with symptomatic rates to the observed age distribution of clinical cases in china on 11 th february we denote the mixing rate at which individuals in age group contact individuals in age group  estimated for china      as estimated by prem et al prem et al 2017  we use two versions of the age mixing matrix for china in this analysis   which denotes the age mixing matrix including contacts in all social settings and -  which denotes the age mixing matrix including contacts only at home for fitting age specific symptomatic rates we used 0  our reasoning was that the majority of cases reported in china occurred during severe lockdown restrictions on social contact outside of the household the next-generation matrix across age groups expected number of infections generated amongst age group b per infected in age group a for china during lockdown was we denote the leading eigenvector of  -    as   normalized so that     1  is the expected proportion of infections amongst age group a during the early stages of an outbreak but after a few generations of transmission diekmann  heesterbeek 2000  the probability that amongst a collection of confirmed cases any given case is in age group a  this allowed us to infer a posterior distribution we assumed flat priors for the values of  using hamiltonian mcmc with a standard multinomial likelihood of recreating the observed case data in china this was implementing using the dynamichmc package for the julia programming language note that  depends on  and   but not the per-contact transmission probability or the recovery rate similarly  does not change is is scaled by a constant therefore we fixed 12  09 that is we assumed a true symptomatic rate amongst 80 year olds of 90 for inferring the per-contact transmission probability  we matched to r0 estimates in china using the full chinese contact matrix  by considering the leading eigenvalue of the pre-lockdown next generation matrix this was chosen to reflect that we are using early estimates of r0 before lockdowns were fully achieved our estimated r0 for kenya without interventions was the leading eigenvalue of kenyan next-generation matrix using the kenyan age-mixing matrix   we consider three types of interventions aimed at restricting sars-cov-2 transmission in kenya  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a

ci clinical individuals are isolated from the rest of the population at an isolationtreatment rate   which represented the active intervention of the kenyan health system and has an initial rate 0  0  we assumed that if the cumulative number of detected cases reaches 1000 individuals 0002 of the kenya population then the health system has reached its capacity threshold and active isolation ceases     0 after capacity is reached both before and after capacity is reached the infectiousness of the clinical cases was reduced by a factor   1 which reflected passive intervention eg public campaigns to raise awareness of sars-cov-2 risk encourage self-isolation and social distancing of symptomatic individuals and increased hygiene  wide-spread social distancing sd the whole kenya population is required to minimize unnecessary social contacts along with closing schools and colleges we modelled this as decreasing work contacts by 25 decreasing other contacts by 75 offset by an increase in home contacts by 25 we modelled the action of sd on the contact structure of the population by replacing the agemixing matrix by a sd-mixing matrix 2     125 -  075 3-4  025 -54  where the three matrices -  456  75 are the estimated age-structured contact rates in respectively the home work and other settings prem et al 2017  we followed tang et al tang et al 2020 in including a decreasing rate of contacts over time the decreasing rate of contacts was combined with the change in age structured mixing and attempted to account for increasing population compliance a staggered step of extra interventions eg closing nonessential shops and instigating a curfew and the effective decrease in contacts across the population due to redirecting social contacts towards repeated contacts within the home specifically we use the down-ramp function to represent a decrease in contacts by 50 over 30 days after the social distancing intervention    1  05  8 30 for times between the intervention time 8 and 30 days after sd intervention  movement restrictions mr the whole kenyan population is required to reduce movement around the country with waivers only for specific reasons eg movement of vital supplies movement of medical professionals we model this by replacing the transport matrix with a post-movement restriction transport matrix 9  constructed by assuming that during movement restrictions 999 of the time of typical individuals was spent in their home region we consider a range of possible levels of infectiousness of asymptomatics relative to individuals with severe symptoms who become clinical cases   0 01 025 05 1 for each relative infectiousness scenario detection rate we ran 1000 simulations we aimed to estimate the distribution of sars-cov-2 epidemic outcomes in kenya over uncertainty in the fundamental epidemiological parameters we achieved this by prior to each simulation drawing mean incubation period and reproductive ratio for china from a belief distribution of the parameter value that encompassed published literature estimates table  3  the chinese     100  25100 which corresponded to a median belief that the sars-cov-2  for china is equally likely to be above 25 as below 25-975 percentiles of belief   203  301 the mean incubation period 1    5  025 median belief 1  5 days 31-82 days we fixed the mean infectious duration as 1  25 days corresponding to the difference in the median serial interval less our median belief of the mean incubation period table 3  a key point is that our belief distribution  is based on estimates derived from data of chinese cases therefore the transmission rate used in each simulation and which corresponds to some  drawn from our belief distribution is derived using chinese agemixing data

wang shun-chung hsueh muh-yen yen wen-chien ko po-ren hsueh   in december 2019 an outbreak of pneumonia due to unknown cause occurred in wuhan china and rapidly spread throughout the country within 1 month the pathogen of this disease was confirmed as a novel coronavirus by molecular methods and was initially named as 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov however the world health organization who announced a new name on february 11 2020 for the epidemic disease corona virus disease covid-19 to date covid-19 has affected people in more than 28 countriesregions including taiwan and has become a global threat1 2 3 4 in addition the coronavirus study group of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses has renamed the virus which was provisionally named 2019-ncov as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 based on phylogeny taxonomy and established practice5 prior to this on january 30 2020 the who declared the covid-19 outbreak as the sixth public health emergency of international concern therefore this outbreak constitutes a public health risk through the international spread of disease and requires a coordinated international response increased dissemination of information through use of the internet is associated with increased transmission of information from all geographical regions and across disciplines regarding recognition of sars-cov-2 and covid-196 nevertheless important factors associated with covid-19 specifically age and sex distribution incubation period clinical features and optimal treatment remain uncertain therefore herein we performed a literature review focusing on the epidemiological characteristics and clinical manifestations of covid-19 including asymptomatic carrier state acute respiratory disease ard and pneumonia as of february 21 2020 data from the who revealed altogether 76769 cases of covid-191 thirty-two countries or regions have reported confirmed cases including mainland china japan singapore hong kong special administrative region sar thailand south korea taiwan australia malaysia germany vietnam the united states macao sar the united arab emirates canada france the philippines the united kingdom italy india russia finland sweden sri lanka cambodia nepal spain belgium iran egypt israel and lebanon in addition 643 cases were found in international conveyance  diamond princess china has the largest number of patients with covid-19 n  75543 followed by south korea n  204 japan n  93 and singapore n  85 to date the reported number of deaths is 2247 and only 11 occurred outside of mainland china including two each in hong kong special administrative regions sar iran and diamond princess and one each in taiwan south korea japan philippines and france however asymptomatic patients or patients with mild covid-19 symptoms may not seek health care nor receive diagnosis which leads to underestimation of the burden of covid-19 initially most reported covid-19 cases in wuhan were adult patients however all of these cases had pneumonia12 13 14 their median or mean ages were 555 490 and 56 years in three separate studies12 13 14 a similar finding was observed in two recent non-peer-reviewed studies one study with 1099 patients from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces in china in which the median age was 470 years and 551 of the patients were between the ages of 1549 years and a second study that included 4021 confirmed cases in 30 provinces of china in which the mean age was 49 years and 507 of patients were between the ages of 2050 years11

15 both these studies included ard and pneumonia cases11

15 similarly the novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team in china reported that 667 n  29798 of 44672 cases of covid-19 of varying degrees of severity were between 20 and 60 years of age8 in korea ryu et al found that the initial 15 cases were aged between 25 and 62 years16 regarding elderly patients infected with sars-cov-2 one study showed that 146 6 in 41 of patients were aged 65 years13 while another study showed that 152 15 in 99 patients were aged 70 years among pneumonia cases12 in addition two non-peer-reviewed studies showed only 153 151 patients were elderly patients aged 65 years11 and 407 101 patients were aged 70 years15 according to the recent china cdc report8 120 n  5326 of patients were aged 70 years regarding children with covid-19 nine 09 patients aged 014 years were found in only one study11 while 14 035 patients were aged 10 years in another study15 the largest study in china showed that 09 n  416 of patients were aged 10 years8 further wei et al reported that nine infants under 1 year of age were infected with sars-cov-2 in china8 regarding patient sex ratio male sex comprised more than half of the cases in most covid-19 studies11 12 13 14 and the proportion of males ranged from 514 to 7328

11 12 13 14

16
 initially approximately half of the cases had huanan seafood market exposure and animal-to-human transmission was suspected12

13 however fewer cases had exposure to this seafood market and an increasing number of cases demonstrated human-to-human transmission11

17 fortunately no evidence was found for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who contracted covid-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy18 in addition to family cluster infections due to human-to-human transmission19 nosocomial spread of sars-cov-2 is a serious concern indeed one study in a zhongnan hospital of the wuhan university showed 290 n  40 were medical staff and 123 n  17 contracted covid-19 during hospitalization14 two other studies showed that 21 n  23 and 38 n  1716 of patients were health workers8

11
 although the risk factors of covid-19 remain unclear many studies reported that a significant proportion of patients had underlying conditions8

11 12 13 14 for patients with sars-cov pneumonia chen et al showed that 505 n  51 of patients had chronic medical illness namely cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases 40412 among 1099 patients with sars-cov-2 ard guan et al showed that 232 n  255 of patients had at least one coexisting disorder and hypertension was the most common underlying disease 149 followed by diabetes mellitus 7411 another large study on covid-19 cases of varying degrees of severity also showed that hypertension was the most common underlying disease n  2683 128 followed by diabetes mellitus n  1102 53 and cardiovascular disease n  873 428 moreover patients with severe covid-19 were more likely to have comorbidities than those with non-severe diseases 376 vs 205 p  000111 a similar trend was observed in another study of 138 hospitalized patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia in which 464 n  64 of patients had comorbidities and the intensive care unit icu patients were more likely to have underlying diseases compared to non-icu patients 722 vs 373 p  000114
 in summary these studies disclosed several significant findings first although most patients with covid-19 were middle-aged adults elderly patients and children also contracted covid-19 second there is a higher prevalence of men with covid-19 than that of women however further studies are warranted to confirm this finding third health care workers and hospitalized patients could be infected by sars-cov-2 in the hospital setting finally at least 20 of covid-19 cases had underlying diseases and more severe cases were more likely to have comorbidities than non-severe cases it is essential to know the incubation period the time elapsing between the moment of exposure to an infectious agent and the appearance of signs and symptoms of the disease for infection control and guidance for the duration of isolation initially li et al used the data on exposure among 10 confirmed cases in wuhan to estimate the mean incubation period which was 52 days 95 confidence interval ci 4170 the 95th percentile of the distribution was 125 days 95 ci 921820 one estimation based on 125 patients with clearly defined exposure periods in china indicated that the median incubation period was 475 interquartile range 3072 days15 using the travel history and symptom onset of 88 confirmed cases that were detected outside of wuhan in the early outbreak phase backer et al estimated that the mean incubation period was 64 days 95 credible interval 5677 ranging from 21 to 111 days 25th to 975th percentile21 however guan et al using a large sample for estimation suggested that the median incubation period was only 30 days but could be as long as 24 days11 overall these estimates will be refined as more data become available detailed epidemiological information based on a larger sample of patients infected with covid-19 is needed to determine the infectious period of sars-cov-2 as well as to determine whether transmission can occur from asymptomatic individuals during the incubation period previous reports revealed that there are asymptomatic patients infected with sars-cov-27

22 these patients can spread the virus and may represent a population that can be easily neglected in epidemic prevention therefore it is important to identify asymptomatic patients with covid-19 since these patients are asymptomatic careful monitoring of the natural course of the disease and contact history may only identify them based on the current data we do not know whether these patients are only asymptomatic initially after contracting the disease or if they are asymptomatic throughout the course of the disease among a pooled analysis of 970 patients with ard table 1
 based on two studies with detail clinical characteristics11

23 males comprised more than half of the patients and the mean age was 45 years hypertension was the most common underlying disease followed by diabetes mellitus approximately two-thirds of patients had cough but only 447 patients had fever in addition sputum production was observed in one-third of patients and sore throat was found in 140 of patients only fewer than 5 of patients had gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea nausea and vomiting meanwhile 324 of patients required oxygen therapy but none required mechanical ventilation only one patient with ard died and the mortality rate was 01 among a pooled analysis of 468 patients with pneumonia table 2

 several reports suggest the following as potential drug candidates although the clinical effectiveness of these drugs have not yet been evidenced for covid-19 lopinavirritonavir kaletra nucleoside analogs neuraminidase inhibitors remdesivir umifenovir arbidol dna synthesis inhibitors such as tenofovir disoproxil and lamivudine chloroquine ace2-based peptides 3c-like protease 3clpro inhibitors novel vinylsulfone protease inhibitor teicoplanin and chinese traditional medicine such as shufengjiedu or lianhuaqingwen capsules30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 the effectiveness of remdesivir is more evident in the literature to date indeed it appears to be the most promising drug for covid-19 in fact an in vitro study demonstrated that the 50 effective concentration ec50 of remdesivir against ncov-2019betacovwuhanwiv042019 in vero e6 cells was 077 m and the 90 effective concentration ec90 was 176 m31 however only one case in the us showed a clinical response to remdesivir although the viral load appeared to decline at the time of initiating remdesivir cycle threshold from 1820 to 232433 subsequently two large clinical trials nct04252664 httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2shownct04252664 for mildmoderate covid-19 and nct04257656 httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2shownct04257656 for severe covid-18 were initiated in china with an estimated end date in early april 2020 in these two trials the 10-day regimen of remdesivir was 100 mg once daily for 9 days after the loading of 200 mg on day 134 chloroquine is another promising drug35

36 an in vitro study on the time-of-addition assay in vero e6 cells demonstrated that chloroquine functioned at both entry and at post-entry stages of covid-19 and the ec90 value of chloroquine against the 2019-ncov was 690 m31 in addition passive immunization therapy and the use of interferon could theoretically be helpful but to date there is no evidence to validate this hypothesis systemic corticosteroid was administered in 186449 patients in order to control the inflammatory response caused by sars-cov-2 in 4 initial large studies11 12 13 14 however corticosteroid therapy could be associated with delayed mers-cov rna clearance adjusted hazard ratio 035 95 ci 017072 p  0005 for critically ill patients with mers40 and early corticosteroid treatment could be associated with higher subsequent plasma rna load of sars-cov for adults with sars41 moreover corticosteroid-associated psychosis and diabetes were observed in the treatment of sars42

43 thus clinical use of corticosteroids in the treatment of covid-19 was not recommended in the interim unless indicated for another reason44

 according to who reports the overall mortality rate for covid-19 was 29 2247 in 767691 however the mortality rate varied among studies initial studies reported that the mortality rate associated with sars-cov-2 pneumonia ranged from 1112 to 1513 but later studies revealed that the mortality rate was between 1411 and 4314 the differences in the results among different studies could be due to the study population as well as the differences among the studies in terms of disease severity in addition these results need further clarification since a majority of the reported mortality was all-cause mortality not covid-attributed mortality also the outcome measurement was incomplete because many patients remained hospitalized before publication of the results several prognostic factors of covid-19 were also reported in these studies in one study using the mulbsta score system46 which includes six indices namely multilocular infiltration lymphopenia bacterial co-infection smoking history hypertension and age revealed that these indices were poor prognostic factors12 another study showed similar findings and specifically the indicators of disease severity including oxygenation respiratory rate leukocytelymphocyte count and the chest imaging findings were associated with a poor clinical outcome11 moreover a substantially elevated case-fatality rate included the following patient characteristics male sex 60 years of age baseline diagnosis of severe pneumonia and delay in diagnosis15 similarly the china cdc reported that patients aged 80 years had the highest case fatality rate 148 among different age groups and the case fatality rate of patients in which disease severity was critical was 4908 together these findings suggest that old age and increased disease severity could predict a poor outcome in this stage of lack of effective drugs the implementation of infection control interventions and traffic control bundle to effectively limit droplet contact and fomite transmission is the only way to slow the spread of the sars-cov-2 these infection control interventions include early identification of cases and their contacts avoiding close contact with people with airway symptoms appropriate hand washing and enhanced standard infection prevention and control practices in the healthcare setting47

 although information on covid-19 has increased rapidly since the emergence of sars-cov-2 many issues remain unresolved first the clinical manifestation of covid-19 ranges from the asymptomatic carrier state to severe pneumonia however most early reports only showed the findings of sars-cov-2 pneumonia in which the ratio of male patients was much larger than that of female patients there were no pediatric cases and the mortality rate was high12 13 14 subsequent to the publication of the studies of patients with only ard or mild pneumonia we found the ratio of male-to-female patients decreased children or neonates could contract covid-19 and the mortality rate declined compared to that of previous reports8

11 however whether children were less susceptible to sars-cov-2 or their presentation was mostly asymptomatic or difficult to detect remains unclear49 in addition most studies especially those with a large patient population were conducted in china and the study of asymptomatic carriers was limited more studies are needed to clarify the epidemiologic characteristics of covid-19 and to identify the risk and prognostic factors of patients infected with sars-cov-2 second zou et al reported that the viral load detected in asymptomatic patients was similar to that found in symptomatic patients however the viral loads from patients with severe diseases were higher than those in patients with mild-to-moderate presentations moreover higher viral loads were detected in the nose than in the throat50 as there is a concern of virus spread due to severe cough induced by performing a throat swab nasal swab may be a relatively safe and sensitive alternative to collect the respiratory specimen of patients with covid-19 however this study involved a population of only 18 patients including one asymptomatic patient49 in addition every test has its own limitation and sensitivityspecificity however the studies investigating the performance of current diagnostic methods of sars-cov-2 among different covid-19 populations including asymptomatic carriers ard and pneumonia are lacking the false positive and negative rates of each diagnostic tool among patients with covid-19 presenting varying degrees of severity of the disease remain unknown this type of information is important for screening patients with covid-19 and to aid isolation and infection control strategies finally since sars-cov-2 can be detected in the asymptomatic individual the prophylactic or pre-emptive use of effective anti-viral agents to reduce the viral load and decrease the risk of virus spread from asymptomatic carriers may help to control the spread of covid-19 this review provides updated information about covid-19 sars-cov-2 can affect patients of all ages covid-19 can present as asymptomatic carriage ard and pneumonia severe cases are more likely to be older and to have increased underlying comorbidities compared to mild cases age and disease severity can be correlated with the outcomes of covid-19 to date effective treatment for sars-cov-2 is lacking however two trials investigating the clinical efficacy of remdesivir are underway in china currently effective infection control intervention is the only way to prevent the spread of sars-cov-2 the author declares no conflict of interests  a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the covid19 pandemic model sarbaz khoshnaw ha muhammad shahzad mehboob ali faisal sultan   the history of the coronaviruses started from the 1930s when the infectious bronchitis virus ibv infection was caused by the domesticated chickens in humans it was firstly reported in the 1960s 1 to avoid stigmatizing the viruss origins in terms of populations geography or animal associations the who termed as covid-19 in december 2019 this virus involves serious respiratory tract infections 2 3 detected in wuhan city hubei province of china this virus might be transferred to the seafood market 4 5 and then internationally via domesticcommercial air traveler carriers 6 after that an emergency has been declared in infected areas of the world and a serious public health concern has been paid at a global level while to stop the impact of this infection and to avoid further spreading some mathematical estimations are also being performed at each level 7 spreading the novel coronavirus covid-19 has become a very difficult global issue for may 15th 2020 there were 4609787 confirmed cases 307 528 deaths and 1742813 recovered cases around the world 8 this virus has been spread more quickly around the world it is very important to know its dynamics and predications although there were several proposed studies based on mathematical tools computational simulations clinical and examination tests for controlling the disease there are still different dimensions about this issue that can be further improved recently mathematical modeling of the covid-19 disease has been investigated by several mathematical and computational researchers for the prediction of the disease dynamics one of the well-known concepts in epidemiology is the basic reproduction number or it sometimes is called the basic reproductive ratio this ratio is a quantity and it is denoted by r0 this is the average number of secondary infections produced by a single primary infection in a population where everyone is susceptible based on the developed approaches of mathematical epidemiology models this quantity becomes an essential tool to understand epidemiological concepts and identify key critical parameters for such models the value of this quantity has been changed for the confirmed cases of coronavirus according to a study published recently the median value of r0 was about 228 during the early stage experienced 9 based on another study this quantity is about 2489 they suggested a discrete-time stochastic epidemic model with binomial distributions to study the transmission of the disease 10 there is also a developed compartmental model based on the clinical progression of the disease the epidemiological status of the individuals and intervention measures 11 according to this study the estimation of the basic reproduction number is very high and it was about 647 the idea of the next-generation matrix approach was used to calculate the basic reproduction number for the covid-19 models this is presented in 12 according to their study this ratio is bout 358 furthermore an updated model was proposed to estimate the transmission risk of the novel coronavirus their calculations relate to a time-dependent dynamic model of contact and diagnosis rate this helps us to re-estimated the daily reproduction number 13 one of the key parameters that can be accumulated from the confirmed cases is the serial interval the serial interval is a time interval between primary patients infecters and the second patient infectees this parameter helps investigators to find epidemic transmission links between confirmed cases and uses for design healthcare program strategies 14 the serial interval is widely used for describing models dynamics of infectious disease this may help us to understand the effect of contact among individuals and how transmits the virus more quickly recently the serial interval has been calculated for the covid-19 this estimates by 46 days 15 a reported study mentioned that the mean serial interval for covid-19 was calculated as 396 days this considerably shorter than the mean serial interval calculated for sars 84 days and mers 146 days 16 although there is a variety of modeling approaches that have been proposed so far for prediction and evaluation of the covid-19 disease there are more questions that can still be answered there are some related works that sensitivity analysis used in their studies 1317 they used this technique only for special variables and parameters more recently mathematical modeling has been used to describe this disease in different views transmission and mitigation strategies for covid-19 presented in 18 response strategies for covid-19 epidemics in african settings shown in 19 the effect of control strategies to reduce social mixing on outcomes of the covid-19 epidemic explained in 20 mathematical recommendations to fight against covid-19 investigated in 21 the feasibility of controlling covid-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts presented in 22 a mathematical modeling approach in the spread of the covid-19 described in 23 the reproductive number of covid-19 is higher compared to sars coronavirus presented in 24 defining such proposed models based on the mass action law with transmission parameters and identify some critical model elements could improve the outcomes further an issue that has not been explained very well for this new virus is identifying the local sensitivities for non-normalizations half normalizations and full normalization techniques in commotional simulations here we are proposing a mathematical model to estimate the transmissibility with the dynamical view of the virus transmission for the complex model of covid-19 given in this paper it is vital to pay more attention to identify critical model elements based on sensitivity analysis and computational results more widely and accurately another contribution of this paper is analyzing the suggested model based on different values of the model parameters in commotional simulations this is also an important step forward to understand how changing the model dynamics and predicting the spread of this virus in the future the main contribution here is to understand the impact of each model parameter on the model states this is given in our computational simulations and calculating the local sensitivities this will help to quantify possible disease control strategies with further improvements and recommendations results in this study provide effective roles in further suggestions and preventions theoretically and practically on possible theoretical suggestion is that these results could help biologists to understand the model dynamics and parameter transmissions this may give further improvements and analyze the complex models in computational simulations while the results here could also give practical suggestions one practical improvement for controlling this disease could be reducing the contact between asymptomatic infected reported and unreported infected classes because their transmission parameters are very sensitive based on our computational simulations the idea of chemical kinetic theory is an important approach for understanding and representing the biological process in terms of model equations the important assumptions to build such models are model states parameters and equations this is because it helps the investigation of mathematical modeling effectively and easily 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 therefore we present here the basics of our calculations we consider n irreversible chemical reactions and m chemical components with a stoichiometric equation given below1j1maijxjij1mbijxji12nwhere xjforj12m are chemical species aij and bij are stoichiometric coefficients non-negative integers i0i12nare chemical interaction parameters the model reaction

 the chemical reactions can be expressed as a system of differential equations with initial components3dxdtijrivixi0xi0where ibijaijfor i12nand j12m therefore equation 3 takes the form4dxjdthjx
wherexrmandrnthe functions hjj12mare often non-linear therefore model differential equations may not solve analytically the more details and descriptions about chemical reactions and their differential equations with some applications in system biology can be found in 25 36 37 an important technique to analyze system 4 is the idea of sensitivity analysis according to this approach the sensitivity of each variable concerning parameters can be calculated the main equation of sensitivity is given below5sipxjplimp0xjppxjpp
 the first order derivatives given in equation 5 represent the time-dependent sensitivities of all variables xjj12m concerning each parameter value pp12n
 furthermore the differential equations can be solved for sensitivity coefficients as below6sjpttxjppxjtphjxt
 using the chain rule of differentiation equation 6 can be further driven and the sensitivity equations take the jacobian matrix as follows7shpjsp12nwhere the matrices shpandjare defined bysx1px2pxmphph1ph2phmpjh1x1h1xmhmx1hmxm
 for more details and applications of sensitivity analysis in the field systems biology the reader can see in 25 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 the local sensitivity values are given in equation 7 can be computed using simbiology toolbox in matlab with three different techniques non-normalizations half normalizations and full normalizations accordingly in a complicated modeling case like new coronavirus dynamics it is necessary to pay attention to sensitivity analysis more accurately and widely this provides one to identify the key critical model parameters and to improve model dynamics the classical models of epidemic diseases normally include components individuals and interaction changes among components in the population in other words for an epidemic network model nodes are individuals and edges are contacted among individuals this representation helps us to understand infectious disease models in terms of a graphical network there are some recently proposed models for presenting the dynamical equations of covid-19 26 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 the model initial populations and interaction parameters are mainly obtained for the confirmed cases in china the main idea of the models is based on clinical progression epidemiological individuals and intervention measures in this paper we develop the previous model presented in 55 we then extend the suggested model structure by including the recovered individuals r the unreported symptomatic death rate

 the covid-19 model digraph can be expressed as a graph gnl where gis the model graph nsiuwr is the set of nodes states lv1v2v3v4v5v6v7 is the set of links reactions thus let us consider the human groups separated into 5 different groups1susceptible group s this group presents a healthy individual2asymptomatic group i this group presents an infected individual in the early stage of infection they do not show any symptoms but capable to infect through droplets or direct contact with the susceptible individual3symptomatic unreported group u this group presents an individual who gets infected had symptoms of covid-19 but did not detect by the government as a covid-19 suspect4symptomatic reported group w this group presents an individual who gets infected shows symptoms of covid-19 and detected by the government either from a rapid test or from voluntary action to report to the hospital we assume that all individuals in this class will get a specific treatment and supervision whether its through monitored isolation or treatment in the hospital5recovered group r this group present individual who get recovered from covid-19 and had a temporal immunity
 the transmission diagram which illustrates the interaction between each group described in figure 1 the developed model here has six parameters that can be analyzed in computational simulations they are defined as interactions rate constants between individual groups the contacts between different states individuals are as follows susceptible people s move into the infected people i when they are asymptomatic infected at the transition rate siu after that the asymptomatic infected individuals i either move into the reported symptomatic infected individuals w with the transition rate i or turn into the unreported symptomatic infected individuals u with transition rate i both groups w and u move into the recovered individuals r with the transition rates w and u respectively in addition to that some unreported and reported infected individuals may die with transition rates

 furthermore the models constant parameters and initial states with their definitions are described in table 1
 using equations 24 the model dynamics are described by the following system of non-linear ordinary differential equations9dsdtsiudidtsiuidudti1udwdti2wdrdtwu
 the model initial populations are expressed in the following equation10s0s00i0i00u0u00w0w00r0r00
 analyzing epidemic disease models with a high number of elements sometimes cannot be well understood only by biological tools this is why mathematical models are used such models help and provide a good environment to analyze infectious diseases more widely and easily theoretical studies may help biologists to predict future model dynamics and identify critical model parameters in the case of covid-19 the suggested mathematical models are effective tools that give estimations and suggestions about controlling the virus and further preventions more effectively the values of parameters and initial populations in this study are obtained from the who situation report the national health commission of the republic of china presented in 55 we calculate the numerical approximate solutions of the model equations 9 for different parameters and initial populations using system biology toolbox sbedit for matlab see figure 2 figure 3 figure 4 figure 5 figure 6
 accordingly there are different model dynamics for initial population model states and estimated parameters computational numerical simulations are calculated in two-dimensional planes for model parameters and initial populations results in this study provide a good step forward in predicting the model dynamics in the future for development programs interventions and health care strategies 
figure 2 shows the model dynamics of susceptible asymptomatic infected reported symptomatic and unreported symptomatic individuals the number of susceptible populations decreases gradually and becomes stable after 60 days while the dynamics of recovered people increase and get flat again after 60 days interestingly the number of infected individuals in both asymptomatic and symptomatic groups is dramatically changed between 40 days to 80 days furthermore figure 3
explains the relationship between infected people with the other groups in the covid-19 it can be seen that there are the same dynamical relations for reported and unreported symptomatic states whereas there are slightly different model dynamics for susceptible and recovered groups 
figure 4
shows that the impact of transition rate  on asymptomatic infected reported symptomatic infected and unreported symptomatic infected individuals the effect of this parameter can easily occur on the variables i u and w for example if the value of  is increased from 00285 to 06 then the number of unreported symptomatic infected people is dramatically increased see figure 4b on the other hand there will be more asymptomatic infected and reported symptomatic infected cases when the values of transition rate  become smaller and smaller see figures 4a and 4c 
figure 5
shows that the impact of transition rate  on asymptomatic infected people reported symptomatic infected people and unreported symptomatic infected people the effect of this parameter can easily occur on the variables i u and w it can be seen that the model dynamics for such states become more flat when the value of  is increased this is an important key element for controlling this disease 
figure 6
shows that the impact of parameter  average time that infected people have symptoms on the dynamics of unreported symptomatic reported symptomatic and recovered individuals the number of both unreported and reported infected people are significantly increased when the value of  becomes smaller see figures 6a and 6b conversely the dynamics of recovered people dramatically grow and become stable very quickly when the value of  gets bigger and bigger see figure 6c another important step of parameter analysis is using the idea of local sensitivity analysis presented in equation 7 we use simbiology toolbox for matlab to calculate the local sensitivity of each model state concerning model parameters for the model equations 9 we compute the model sensitivities using three different techniques non-normalizations half normalizations and full normalizations see figures 7
 interestingly results provide us further understanding of the model and give one to identify the key critical model parameters for example it generally seems that the communication rate between asymptomatic infected and unreported symptomatic infected transition rate between asymptomatic infected and reported symptomatic infected the average time that infected people have symptoms are very sensitive parameters concerning model variables in spreading this disease among people on the other hand the other parameters are less sensitive to the model dynamics they are unreported symptomatic death rate reported symptomatic death rate and transition rate between susceptible and asymptomatic infected people as a result identifying critical model parameters in this study based on computational simulations is an effective way to further study the model practically and theoretically and give some suggestions for future improvements of the novel coronavirus vaccination programs interventions and controlling the spread of disease accordingly some findings and computational results are given based on the suggested approaches for the updated model of the covid-19 we can mainly summarize them as the points given below1the model dynamics of susceptible asymptomatic infected both reported and unreported symptomatic individuals recovered individuals are computed using system biology toolbox sbedit in matlab it can be seen that the relationship between infected people with the other groups in the covid-19 model there are the same dynamical relations for reported and unreported symptomatic states whereas there are slightly different model dynamics for susceptible and recovered groups2the impact of transition rate  on asymptomatic infected reported symptomatic infected and unreported symptomatic infected individuals is investigated this parameter has an effective role in the dynamics of i u and w3the transition rate  has also affected asymptomatic infected people reported symptomatic infected people and unreported symptomatic infected people it can be seen that the model dynamics for such states become more flat when the value of  is increased this is an important key element for controlling this disease4the number of both unreported and reported infected people are significantly increased when the value of  becomes smaller whereas the dynamics of recovered people dramatically grow and become stable very quickly when the value of  becomes large5the local sensitivity of each model state concerning the model parameters computed using three different techniques non-normalizations half normalizations and full normalizations interestingly results provide us further understanding and identifying the key critical model parameters it can be concluded that the transmission parameters between asymptomatic infected and both reported and unreported symptomatic infected the average time that infected people have symptoms are very sensitive parameters concerning model variables in computational simulations
 several healthcare strategies and preventions have been discussed and suggested as global efforts to reduce the impact of the new covid-19 around the world although this virus still spreads quickly and millions of people have been infected so far but all scientific attempts give a great step forward to control this disease and minimizing the impact of such threats on the community currently there are a variety of studies both theoretically and practically discussed and investigated in this area one of the effective tools that could be used to describe such diseases is mathematical modeling mathematical modeling with computational simulations provides estimations and predictions about the dynamics of model states and parameters however having many suggested models in different countries makes the parameter estimations predictions and understandings of the disease remain unclear an issue that has not been well discussed and explained for this new virus is identifying the model critical elements in this study we computed the model dynamics for the different model parameter values this provides us how the number of each model class changes concerning to the model parameters based on the results obtained here we can simply understand the model critical parameters for instance the transmission parameter between asymptomatic class and the unreported symptomatic class becomes a key critical element and it has a great role in speeding this disease however the key critical model parameters may slightly change if we use different data reported for another country therefore it can be argued that computational results and simulations based on the suggested models may give good approximations and predictions another issue that can be discussed for the covid-19 is the identification of the model sensitive parameters this has also not well explained recently in this work we have used the idea of local sensitivities for non-normalizations half normalizations and full normalizations techniques in commotional simulations for the complex model of covid-19 given in this paper it is vital to pay more attention to identify critical model elements based on sensitivity analysis and computational results more widely and accurately results in this paper become an important step forward to understand the model dynamics more widely this provides to identify critical model parameters and how each model individual can be affected by the other model individuals for example results here show that almost all model states are sensitive to the critical model parameters      on the other hand such critical model parameters can be changed to the other model parameters when we use another set of initial states and parameters interestingly the suggested approach here can be further developed and applied to a wide range of complex models of the covid-19 it can work more effectively for identifying the model key elements this provides us the suggested approaches here work very well for the covid-19 models compared to the recently suggested techniques global efforts and preventions of the speeding covid-19 cannot be well understood only by biological and healthcare tools some mathematical models have been investigated for further improvements and give estimations for such model parameters an issue that can be further studied is identifying key critical model parameters this helps international efforts to pay more attention to the sensitive elements the suggested coronavirus disease covid19 model here is a complicated one and it requires some mathematical tools to have improvements in interventions and healthcare programs the used model in this paper has further improved based on the computational results using matlab for different initial populations and parameters some main results can help in understanding the suggested model more widely and effectively by using computational simulation we identify some key critical parameters that have a great role in spreading this virus among the model classes one of the identified key parameters is the transmission rate between asymptomatic infected and reported symptomatic individuals this is an important finding in the understanding of the covid-19 and how this virus spreads more quickly some other critical model parameters have investigated in this paper for example the transmission parameter between asymptomatic infected and unreported symptomatic individuals has a great impact on the dynamics of the model states besides these findings provide additional information about estimations and predictions for the number of infected individuals accordingly our results in identifying key parameters are broadly consistent with clinical and biological findings remaining issues are subject to sensitivity analysis this is also an important issue that can be further studied we have applied the idea of local sensitivity to calculate the sensitivity of each model state concerning model parameters for the updated model of the covid-19 three different techniques are investigated which are non-normalizations half normalizations and full normalizations these provide us an important step forward to identify critical model elements by using local sensitivity approaches we concluded that almost all model states are sensitive to the critical model parameters        this becomes a great step forward and helps international attempts regarding the covid-19 pandemic outbreak this may help to reduce the number of infected individuals from the disease and to prevent the coronavirus more widely in the community it can be concluded that the identified factors can be controlled to reduce the number of infected individuals overall our results demonstrate a strong effect of the key critical parameters on the spreading covid-19 therefore based on the effect of each involved parameters over the model states more suggestions and interventions can be proposed for controlling the covid-19 disease that will be useful for any interventions and vaccination programs accordingly the healthcare communities should pay more attention to the quarantine places for controlling this disease more effectively it can be strongly suggested that anyone in the quarantine places should be separated from the others and should use only their separate equipment bedroom and toilet to prevent the transmission of the virus through the touching of shared surfaces another suggestion is that reducing the contact between asymptomatic-symptomatic groups and susceptible groups this is effectively minimizing the number of infected people it seems necessary to plan a certain strategy to put the asymptomatic infected individuals on quarantine places sooner rather than later future research on identifying key critical elements might extend the explanations of the new covid-19 more widely it will be important that future research investigates more suggested transmissions between the model groups for example the model will further improve by adding two transmission paths one of them is between unreported symptomatic infected and reported symptomatic infected the other one is between asymptomatic infected and recovered individuals the authors declare that there are no competing interests  the incidence of the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 among asymptomatic patients a systematic review duaa al-sadeq w gheyath nasrallah k   infectious diseases impose a major health threat globally leading to 15 million deaths annually fauci et al 2005 although the percentage of mortality due to infectious diseases has declined numerous new infectious diseases have been identified and reported recently the novel coronavirus disease covid-19 caused by the sars-cov-2 virus was firstly identified in wuhan china in late december 2019 as an outbreak of unusual viral pneumonia mousavizadeh and ghasemi 2020 later the world health organization who declared a public health emergency worldwide and the total number of infected cases reached 44 million by may 2020 who 2020 consequently educational institutions business centers public transport and other social interaction were locked down points to prevent the spread of covid-19 and ease the burden on health facilities sars-cov-2 is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna virus with six open reading frames orfs that codes for structural proteins including surface s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n proteins khailany et al 2020 based on the genomic structures and phylogenetic analysis of sars-cov-2 the virus belongs to genera betacoronavirus which includes sars-cov and mers-cov yet sars-cov-2 has differences in its genomic that can influence its pathogenesis the most effective approach to prevent and mitigate the adverse consequences of this viral pandemic requires the development of effective surveillance programs incorporated with laboratory preparedness diagnostic laboratory tests play a significant role in the rapid and accurate detection of new viruses song et al 2019 parreira 2018 currently real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr testing is the main technique used for the diagnosis of covid-19 however false-negative rt-pcr results occur in up to 30 of covid-19 patients wikramaratna et al 2020 breslin et al 2020 qin et al 2020 this could be due to the collection of inappropriate or insufficient sample inaccurate conditions of sample transportation and storage as well as collecting the sample too late in the disease process on the other hand serology testing could cover this gap since detecting sars-cov-2 igg antibodies could indicate recovery or immunity from covid-19 infection besides igm could be detected in the acute phase of infections although manual enzyme-linked immunoassay elisa kits could be subjected to non-specific binding and cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses such as mers-cov and sars-cov-1 most commercially available antibodies utilize lateral flow assays lfa al kahlout et al 2019 however recently elisa and automated-based assays were also introduced the diagnostic performance including sensitivity and specificity of these assays were better than the lfa amanat et al 2020 it worth mentioning that there is a high percent of covid-19 asymptomatic patients who could transmit the infection to all communities for instance the asymptomatic ratio of covid-19 was estimated to be 416 of japanese individuals who were evacuated from china he et al 2020 similarly 72 of people infected with covid-19 on board the diamond princess cruise ship were asymptomatic london school of hygiene and tropical medicine 2020 however the extent of viral transmission from the asymptomatic cases is not clear yet the positive rt-pcr results only imply the potential infectivity a prospective study was published on march 28 in which the viral load and clinical manifestations of 2147 close contacts of symptomatic and asymptomatic covid-19 cases were followed up chen et al 2020 the study concluded that the virus infection rate of close contacts with asymptomatic patients was 411 since the transmission ability of asymptomatic individuals should not be ignored it was of interest to conduct a systemic review to paint a picture of the current status and incidence of sars-cov-2 in asymptomatic patients therefore this study would give significant insights into covid-19 infection and help health authorities to determine the need for social distancing close contact restrictions in specific areas or populations we conducted a systematic review of all literature published on covid-19 in the asymptomatic patients using four databases pubmed web of science scopus and sciencedirect the search covered all literature within the databases up to april 2020 the databases were queried with the keywords covid-19 sars-cov-2 seroprevalence and asymptomatic to ensure complete coverage of all literature the four databases were searched without filters therefore results that were letters and commentaries were also included all retrieved citations were imported into endnote x8 and duplicates were removed using the endnote x8 built-in find duplicates feature finally the titles and abstracts of the remaining citations were screened to remove any irrelevant articles the following inclusion criteria were used in study selection i published in a peer-reviewed journal letters case reports and commentaries ii articles studying the covid-19 infection in asymptomatic patients and iii articles published in english or at least with an abstract in english a schematic of the search strategy and study selection process is shown in fig 1
 besides studies that reported the coinfection of covid-19 with other viruses as well as comorbidities such as cancer and cystic fibrosis were also included in this study no exclusion criteria were followed unless the studies did not report the incidence of sars-cov-2 in asymptomatic patients published in a non-english language or do not have full-text access the studies included in this systematic review were analyzed two times by the same individual to ensure accurate capture of the information the analyzed data included the incidence of sars-cov-2 in the asymptomatic covid-19 patients incidence of covid-19 infection routes of transmission laboratory diagnostic tests laboratory results as well as ct scan findings the search yielded 505 studies of which 370 citations remained after removing duplicates fig 1 after screening the titles abstracts and keywords 312 citations were excluded the removed citations included irrelevant studies the remaining 67 citations were screened against the eligibility criteria of these one study was removed due to the unavailability of full-text access furthermore three studies were removed two for being published in languages other than english with no english abstract the remaining 63 studies were included in this study for further analysis and they consisted of letters to the editor commentaries case reports as well as research studies the reviewed studies covered sars-cov-2 incidence worldwide country-wise the majority of the studies were from china n  44 and included different provinces such as wuhan shenzhen guangzhou beijing shanghai hunan nanjing guangdong anhui hubei zhejiang jinan and hefei table 1
 the remaining studies were published in japan n  2 italy n  3 germany n  1 iran n  2 and usa n  6 which included studies from texas washington and new york however there was a lack of sars-cov-2 epidemiological studies from several countries worldwide tracing the actual incidence of covid-19 especially in asymptomatic patients looking at all the included studies with a large sample size n1000 cases these studies table 1 highlighted with bold text estimated that percentage of people contracting sars-cov-2 and are likely to be asymptomatic range from 12-129 however the other studies with a smaller sample size n1000 reported a much higher incidence and indicated that up to 879 of covid-19 infected individuals could be asymptomatic table 1 most of these estimates were based on rt-pcr results on the other hand the estimated seroprevalence of antibodies to sars-cov-2 was reported to be higher for instance a study that was performed on 2857 blood donors from rio de janeiro showed 237 of igm positive cases 114 of igg positive cases while both igm and igg was detected in 649 amorim filho et al 2020 this is could due to the limitation of the nasal swab since the pcr diagnostic could be negative though antibody detection is positive in fact this finding was reported in a study where four subjects out of 317 asymptomatic participants had negative pcr diagnostic while antibody testing was positive korth et al 2020 therefore relying only on molecular testing could significantly underestimate the seroprevalence sars-cov-2 especially in asymptomatic individuals the spread of covid-19 is an emerging condition with pandemic potential that threatens all countries over the last four months more than three million cases of covid-19 have been confirmed worldwide numerous epidemiologic investigations identified an association with respiratory droplet transmission yet understanding of the transmission risk is incomplete it worth mention that covid-19 asymptomatic individuals may pose a significant public health threat the majority of these patients might be unaware of their disease and therefore not isolate themselves or seek treatment consequently unknowingly transmit the virus to others to the best of our knowledge this is the first systematic review study that investigated the incidence of sars-cov-2 in asymptomatic patients a total of 63 out of 505 screened studies reporting covid-19 asymptomatic patients were included in this review epidemiological data clinical laboratory results ct image findings as well as the medical and contact history of the patient are critical knowledge that should be carefully studied when a new infectious disease emerged rodriguez-morales et al 2020 although asymptomatic patients with sars-cov-2 were uncommon studies showed that the prevalence of sars-cov-2 in asymptomatic patients is underestimated and might increase for instance a review paper showed the rate of asymptomatic individuals with the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov ranged from 0 to 286 al-tawfiq and gautret 2019 besides it was reported that 75 of covid-19 infected individuals could be asymptomatic day 2020b covid-19 infection ranges from asymptomatic to severe respiratory distress yet clinically is shows a milder infection in children and many studies reported children patients with asymptomatic covid-19 infection for instance a study in china guangzhou reported an asymptomatic 3-years old male who tested positive for sars-cov-2 yet had normal lymphocyte counts and chest ct images pan et al 2020a similarly a study reported in china wuhan showed a 3-years old male asymptomatic patient with positive rt-pcr for sars-cov-2 and normal lymphocyte counts and chest ct images li et al 2020 it is unknown yet the reason of having a benign clinical course and low incidence of covid-19 in children compared to adults a proposed hypothesis suggested that it might be due to the low expression of ace2 receptors high plasticity of their immune system or to the exposure of other coronaviruses which are generally common in kids cruz and zeichner 2020 jia et al 2005 besides children may play a major role in community-based viral transmission for instance it was reported that viral shedding in the stool sample could persist for several weeks after diagnosis cai et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 consequently it poses a threat of viral transmission through the fecal-oral route particularly for infants and children who are not toilet trained most of the reported covid-19 cases in children were due to close contact with family members with sars-cov-2 infection table 1 many experts believe that undetermined asymptomatic cases of covid-19 infection could be an important source of contagion day 2020a therefore the early identification of the asymptomatic cases as well as monitoring and tracing close contact could help in mitigating the spread of covid-19 infection another factor that increases the asymptomatic rate of covid-19 is the inaccuracy of diagnostic testing for instance a recent article highlighted key important steps to be considered when designing seroprevalence studies as well as experts opinion on the recent studies a major concern raised about the recently published results was the type of antibody test used since most of them inaccurate to support the conclusions offord 2020 it was reported that the manual elisa kits are subject to cross-reaction with other coronaviruses such as sars-cov-1 and mers-cov al kahlout et al 2019 this depends on the type of antibody or antigen used to coat the plates for instance a recent study used previously developed elisa method based on bat sars-cov rp3 n protein since it does not cross-react with other human coronaviruses except sars-cov zhou et al 2020b the method successfully detected igm and igg antibodies against sars-cov-2 in early cases of covid-19 yet various studies such as the studies included in this review used chinese manufactured tests kit that are not approved by chinese authorities or the us food and drug administration fda besides until to date a seroprevalence population-based study was carried in santa clara county usa and suggested that over 30 of positive cases are missed by the pcr test and results in an underestimation of the incidence the most significant implication of their findings is that the true infection rate is much higher than the reported number of cases for instance the study showed that the infection was 50 to 85-fold higher than confirmed positive cases by pcr bendavid et al 2020 besides although most of the included articles in this study used rt-pcr to confirm asymptomatic cases no serological or other tests were performed to accurately estimate the incidence of sars-cov-2 in asymptomatic patients in other words pcr is considered the gold standard for diagnosis yet if the sample was collected after 14 weeks or more after infection the viral genomeantigen might not be detected therefore it could underestimate the prevalence of the infection besides some of the included studies reported that the patients were positive for sars-cov-2 igg which suggested that the patient was an asymptomatic sars-cov-2 carrier the differential use of serology for confirming acute infection is not appropriate without the additional collaboration of results therefore combining both molecular and serological testing would be the best approach to accurately estimate the prevalence of covid-19 infection especially if the patient is at later stages of the infection and does not show symptoms younes et al 2020 although governments in many countries are planning to conduct largescale seroprevalence surveys many laboratories try to rely on well-established and validated lab tests rather than rapid tests the latter is based on blood collected from finger pricks to detect sars-cov-2 antibodies yet the test performance and efficacy are not up to the required level and many false results were detected both specificity and sensitivity are essential in detecting sars-cov-2 to prevent false positive and negative results it is not reliable to examine the test performance and efficacy of rapid tests based on finger-prick blood compared to the elisa test which utilizes collect venous blood consequently preventing the underestimation of asymptomatic covid-19 infection rate such positive cases may contribute to the silent spread of the virus yet one of the significant limitations of many studies reporting asymptomatic cases is the difficulty of differentiating between asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic who are asymptomatic at the time of testing and later on they developed symptoms citing data from china who officials said on april 1 some cases of asymptomatic carriers have been confirmed by finding and testing people who were in close contact with covid-19 patients for those who tested positive without symptoms follow-up exams confirmed that about 25 continued to show no signs for instance a clinical study with a small sample size from china done in march 2020 followed up 24 asymptomatic positive pcr patients 60 of them were pre-symptomatic and showed covid-19 symptoms after 1-3 weeks hu et al 2020 more follow-up studies should be done to determine whether these cases continue to be asymptomatic or eventually develop symptoms whether these asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals can spread the infection a question remained to be answered with further follow-up studies covid-19 is a new infectious disease that infected more than three million people in many countries all over the world the severity and clinical manifestation of covid-19 varies and some individuals were reported as asymptomatic based on the results of this study many of the covid-19 infected cases show no symptoms and that the infection could be transmitted during the incubation period consequently asymptomatic patients are considered carriers and a potential source of infection to the community therefore additional research studies on the epidemiological significance of covid-19 asymptomatic cases are required conceptualization

confirmed sars-cov-2 with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr who 2020 covid-19 can present as an asymptomatic carrier state acute respiratory disease or pneumonia some studies found that people infected with sars-cov-2 in the asymptomatic or presymptomatic period can be infectious bai et al 2020  mao et al 2020  current evidence on how long to quarantine asymptomatic carriers is limited in recent paper mao was suspicious about the 14-day isolation period for asymptomatic carriers because it was based only on observations of two cases mao et al 2020  the shortage of isolation capacity in some countries is expected to lead to an explosive increase in covid-19 here we report the viral kinetics according to absence or presence of symptoms our study included laboratory-confirmed covid-19 patients admitted to affiliated hospitals of chonnam national university between february 04 and april 07 2020 rt-pcr was positive if the cycle threshold ct value of both the envelope e and rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp genes of sars-cov-2 were less than 35 specimens were collected from all patients at least 2 days after hospitalization and physicians checked their symptoms and signs daily epidemiological and clinical information were obtained seventy-one patients were hospitalized for treatment or isolation we analyzed patients who had any of the following features at quarantine release 1 asymptomatic carrier n10 who had no symptoms in the 14 days preceding diagnosis until quarantine release 2 incubation period patients n3 who were asymptomatic during the 14 days preceding diagnosis but became symptomatic during quarantine table 1 shows the clinical j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f characteristics of the patients analyzed the median age of the asymptomatic carriers was 31 interquartile range 178-558 years three patients who were asymptomatic on admission developed myalgia fever and cough 1 or 2 days afterwards without pneumonia in two of the three patients the viral load in the incubation period was very high ct value 20 but all patients first reached ct35 by day 14 fig 1a  in the asymptomatic covid-19 carriers the viral load on admission was not relatively high fig 1b  the median time to first ct 35 rt-pcr result after diagnosis in asymptomatic carriers was 45 20-85 days and all asymptomatic cases first reached a ct 35 result within 14 days after diagnosis fig 1b  we found that rt-pcr was indeterminate or negative 14 days after diagnosis in entirely asymptomatic individuals who were not given any antiviral agents although the presence of viral rna in specimens doesnot distinguish between infective and non-infective pcr was positive on the 19th day of isolation in patients receiving antiviral agents which might have prolonged virus detection in the two asymptomatic carriers a modelling study estimated that 18 would be true asymptomatic cases including the incubation period mizumoto et al 2020  if the percentage of asymptomatic carriers is large the cost of isolation for public health management may be enormous our data suggest that 14-days quarantine at home after diagnosis may be adequate in entirely asymptomatic carriers we found that incubation-period patients had high viral loads before the onset of symptoms and that some asymptomatic carriers had an initial viral load that might be a living virus interestingly this differs from the transmission of sars-cov which occurred mainly j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f   asymptomatic carriage and transmission of sars-cov-2 what do we know susan lee paula meyler michelle mozel tonia tauh richard merchant   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is not the first pathogenic coronavirus to jump from its animal host to humans of the seven known human coronaviruses four cause mild symptoms similar to the common cold and three others can cause severe illness in humans2 severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome caused by mers cov and covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 all result from highly transmissible viruses whose natural reservoir is in bats several factors are associated with pathogen spillover from animal hosts to humans and establishment of sustained spread in humans such as changes in human behaviour new technologies and industry changes in land use increased international travel microbial adaptation inadequate public health measures and sharing our environment with domestic or wild animals34 given that these factors are unlikely to change we can expect to see more outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases in the future5 respiratory viruses like sars-cov-2 are known to spread by direct contact such as touching an infected person or a surface infected with virus-containing droplets expelled by an infected person6 current recommendations to prevent the spread of sars-cov-2 such as frequent hand washing and keeping at least a 2-m distance would be effective with droplet-borne transmission recommendations to practice good hand hygiene physical distancing and isolation of infected patients to prevent transmission are common across respiratory viruses and organizational guidelines there has been controversy even before the emergence of sars-cov-2 over whether respiratory viruses including coronaviruses eg mers can effectively spread via the airborne route and whether contact and droplet precautions are sufficient to prevent transmission7 the world health organization who recommends droplet and contact precautions for avian influenza and mers while the centers for disease control and prevention takes a more conservative approach recommending airborne precuations7 the who does recommend additional airborne precautions for novel acute respiratory viruses until transmission patterns can be observed there is some evidence that sars-cov-2 can spread via aerosols with virus particles found at distances  2 m from the source for up to three hours8-10 the infectivity of these viral particles however remains to be determined the median incubation period for sars-cov-2 has been estimated to be 51 days with 975 of patients developing symptoms within 115 days which is similar to sars-cov11 the upper end of this incubation period forms the rationale for public health recommendations to self-isolate for 14-days after exposure several studies have shown that viral loads are highest shortly after symptom onset gradually decreasing over the ensuing 21 days12-14 longer periods of viral shedding up to 30 days have also been reported15 the prevalence of asymptomatic never develops symptoms or pre-symptomatic tests positive prior to symptom development illness has been documented in several populations among 565 japanese nationals evacuated from wuhan china and tested for sars-cov-2 by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr 13 tested positive with four 308 95 confidence interval ci 77 to 538 asymptomatic at the time of testing16 of the 3063 passengers on board the quarantined diamond princess cruise ship who were tested for sars-cov-2 179 of those who tested positive were asymptomatic 95 ci 155 to 20217 residents of a long-term skilled nursing facility with an early outbreak of covid-19 were all screened for symptoms of illness and viral rna of the 7682 93 residents tested 23 tested positive of which 13 57 were categorized as asymptomatic at the time of testing18 seven days later ten out 13 previously asymptomatic residents developed symptoms and were reclassified as pre-symptomatic during testing twenty-four asymptomatic patients in nanjing china were characterized after testing positive through screening of close contacts during hospitalized follow-up five 208 developed symptoms 17 708 showed abnormal computed tomography ct scans and seven 292 had normal ct scans and did not develop symptoms19 both targeted testing for sars-cov-2 in high-risk icelandic residents and general icelandic population screening for sars-cov-2 showed asymptomatic patients that tested positive for sars-cov-2 in the 1924 targeted-testing group 7 had no symptoms while in the population screening group 43 of 10797 icelandic residents testing positive for the virus reported having no symptoms at the time of testing20 the available evidence across a range of populations indicates that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients can test positive for sars-cov-2 at rates ranging from 179 to 57 of those who test positive showing no symptoms nevertheless the overall prevalence of asymptomatic carriers will depend on the distribution and how widespread the disease is in a given population for example in the icelandic population where less than 1 of the population was positive for sars-cov-2 and 43 of them reporting no symptoms at the time of screening the point prevalence of asymptomatic cases was 03420 in contrast in a highly infected environment like the diamond princess cruise ship where 20 of passengers eventually tested positive 10 of all passengers and crew were asymptomatic at the time of testing17 in a study of sars-cov-2 upper respiratory viral loads in 18 patients one asymptomatic patient was included because of close contact with an infected patient the viral load that was detected in the asymptomatic patient was similar to that in the symptomatic patients which suggests the transmission potential of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients21 while symptomatic disease is frequently associated with infectivity there is speculation that for sars-cov-2 the latent period time from exposure to onset of infectiousness may be shorter than the incubation period time from exposure to onset of symptoms leaving a window of time when the patient is infectious but not yet exhibiting symptoms this is supported by a study of viral loads in chinese patients which indicated that pre-symptomatic viral transmission likely occurred13 using data from infector-infectee pairs the authors estimated that viral transmission may have occurred two to three days prior to symptom onset in up to 44 of patients indicating a transmission pattern more similar to seasonal influenza than sars-cov of the 157 locally acquired infections identified in singapore ten secondary cases 64 were likely acquired prior to the development of symptoms in the index cases infections happened on average one to three days before symptom onset in the index cases22 a familial cluster was identified in anyang china where one asymptomatic carrier never developed symptoms but tested positive for the virus and likely infected five family members23 in a point-prevalence survey of a skilled nursing facility in king county washington 27 out of 48 56 with positive tests were asymptomatic at the time of testing given an estimated doubling time of 34 days 95 ci 25 to 53 in that facility viral shedding from asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic residents likely contributed to early transmission to other residents and staff members24 healthcare workers are at increased risk for infection through occupational exposure to pathogens such as bacteria fungi viruses and parasites25 healthcare providers have been affected by sars-cov-2 with high reported rates of infection26 and death27 in the uk although it is unclear how much nosocomial transmission occurred since frontline staff tested positive at similar rates to non-clinical staff and deaths were not reported in icu hcws possibly indicating that current infection control practices in the uk have been effective in limiting occupationally acquired hcw infection nevertheless hcws have been found to be at higher risk for infection with respiratory pathogens in other settings particularly those who perform agps2829 a systematic review showed that compared with healthcare workers who did not perform aerosol-generating procedures those who performed tracheal intubation had an increased risk of contracting sars-cov in the 2003 epidemic odds ratio 66 than those who performed non-invasive ventilation odds ratio 31 tracheotomy odds ratio 42 and manual ventilation before intubation odds ratio 2829 nevertheless the authors note very low quality in all included studies study designs subject to recall bias and few clear reports of personal protective equipment ppe compliance low numbers of exposed hcws also limit the generalizability of the studyin the meta-analysis for risk of hcw infection after tracheal intubation two of the four included studies had five or fewer hcws in the exposed group a separate study found that the protection guidelines failed to thoroughly prevent the transmission of sars-cov to hcws in 2003 and that 9 of the interviewed healthcare workers who had intubated patients contracted sars nevertheless the cause-effect relationship between infection and intubation in these healthcare workers who contracted sars was unknown30 since asymptomatic transmission is possible with sars-cov-2 and hcws are at risk of infection techniques to minimize risk in the operating room are needed current tests for sars-cov-2 are not sensitive enough to eliminate the possibility of asymptomatic carriers entering the operating room therefore other strategies such as risk reduction through the hierarchy of controls model31 can be employed see figure 1 strategies include delaying elective surgery in patients at high risk for infection substituting regional anesthesia for agps when appropriate reducing aerosolization clearing aerosols and providing appropriate ppe for hcws the american society of anesthesiologists asa and anesthesia patient safety foundation jointly recommend preoperative testing of all elective surgery patients where there is sars-cov-2 in the region32 patients testing positive should be delayed for non-urgent surgery they caution however that the low sensitivity of viral pcr tests means that up to 30 of patients may falsely test negative therefore regardless of a negative test additional risk-reduction strategies are indicated including airborne ppe when an agp is planned aerosol-generating procedures such as intubation and mask ventilation are thought to create small airborne particles that can be suspended in air and travel long distances33 under the assumption that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients carrying sars-cov-2 have the ability to generate aerosolized virus particles capable of transmission to hcws during agps there may be ways to reduce the risk of aerosolization these techniques include avoiding mask ventilation if possible reducing oxygen flows having a good seal with the face mask through use of a thenar eminence ve grip and ensuring profound paralysis prior to airway instrumentation34 aerosolization risk from coughing during extubation can be minimized with lidocaine dexmedetomidine remifentanil and fentanyl35 innovative barrier techniques such as plastic cube boxes screens and tents to reduce aerosolization during airway management of patients with covid-19 have been described but further research is required to prove efficacy or recommend routine use for asymptomatic patients particularly if they hinder timely airway management as has recently been shown in a simulation study36-38 severe acute respiratory syndrome and mers investigations found airborne disease transmission through inefficient hospital ward ventilation systems39 fortunately most operating rooms owing to their design in protection of the surgical site have air exchange rates that adequately minimize deposition and floating time of respiratory virus particles at least 9 per hour40 operating room workers should know their local air exchange rates to determine when aerosolized particles are likely to have been cleared thus reducing the risk of viral transmission to new members of the operating room team entering the room after an agp has been performed41 while ppe is important it is only one of the protective measures used to protect hcws managing airways42 early in an epidemic before viral transmission routes have been well characterized ppe recommendations for hcws can be chaotic and evolving43 during the 2003 sars epidemic most virus transmission to hcws occurred before ppe was routine or was associated with ppe breaches once the epidemic subsided the dangers of excessive ppe recommendations eg increased contamination during doffing were recognized as well as several instances where droplet precautions were effective in preventing transmission even in settings where intubations occurred43 since transmission of sars-cov-2 from asymptomatic patients to hcws has not been reported there is no clear evidence-based recommendation for appropriate ppe in this setting evidence that agps actually increase airborne hcw transmission is limited44 and it is uncertain whether n95 masks offer better protection over surgical masks4546 regardless of choice of ppe adequate training in donning and doffing is essential for ensuring both effectiveness and reducing the risk of self-contamination47 the asa recommends the use of airborne ppe for all airway-related agps because asymptomatic patients may be harbouring sars-cov-248 in contrast the united kingdom association of anaesthetists does not specifically recommend n95 masks for asymptomatic patients although they acknowledge that as population disease burden increases it might become necessary to treat all patients as high-risk because of the threat of asymptomatic viral transmission4950 there is evidence of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic carriers of the sars-cov-2 while transmission from asymptomatic patients to close contacts has been reported there have been no reports of asymptomatic patients infecting hcws during agps the risk that an asymptomatic patient poses to operating room hcws during agp will depend on local disease burden as health systems begin to consider resuming elective surgery safely navigating agps in those who are asymptomatic will be imperative identifying asymptomatic patients who may be infectious using imperfect tests and maintaining operating room safety for patients and providers all while avoiding ppe shortages are some of the challenges faced by health systems around the world there is still much we do not understand about asymptomatic viral transmission and until more is known a precautionary approach may expose clinicians to lower risk of infection further research on the risk of asymptomatic spread of sars-cov-2 and appropriate measures to mitigate this risk particularly during agps is urgently needed
  hazardous postoperative outcomes of unexpected covid-19 infected patients a call for global consideration of sampling all asymptomatic patients before surgical treatment chen nahshon arie bitterman riad haddad david hazzan ofer lavie   in december 2019 a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of many pneumonia cases in wuhan china 1 the new virus now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 led to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 first in china and then worldwide causing an international emergency despite isolation efforts due to high transmission rates eventually a pandemic was declared 2 3 covid-19 usually presents with fever cough dyspnea myalgia andor fatigue and may infect any person at any age 4 5 however many carriers do not present any symptoms 5 6 thus differentiating the new virus from other known infections based on the clinical presentation is practically impossible a severe disease usually presenting in the elderly and in those with an underlying disease may result in progressive respiratory failure requiring intensive care unit icu hospitalization 5 hypertension cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus smoking chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd chronic kidney disease and malignancy were shown to be prevalent underlying diseases among hospitalized covid-19 patients 7 8 the mortality rate was estimated to be between two and five percent 9 during the current pandemic in addition to guidance on staffing infection control and prevention guidelines recommended postponing all elective surgeries and procedures 1012 even with electivenon-urgent procedures postponed urgent and emergent surgeries are still being performed operating on covid-19 patients raises few critical medical issues including the optimal anesthesiology surgical approach and the patients postoperative outcomes as well as the exposure of medical staff to the in-hospital covid-19 patients as suggested by different medical unions all surgical candidate patients must complete preoperative universal health screening for known symptoms of covid-19 in addition special consideration is necessary for evaluating the appropriateness of procedural interventions recognizing the significant resources they require ie equipment space and staff according to american guidelines including the society of gynecologic oncology sgo and the society of american gastrointestinal and endoscopic surgeons sages preoperative patients should be tested for covid-19 regardless of their symptoms or exposure 11 13 the question of whether to test all asymptomatic surgical candidate patients of unknown covid-19 status bothers many surgical staff members and medical authorities the value of testing asymptomatic surgical candidates of unknown covid-19 differs between countries and continents and depends on underlying prevalence rates false negative rates of tests operation types timing of the test relative to surgery and various epidemiology principles the purpose of this document is to highlight the published outcomes of asymptomatic patients who were operated during the covid-19 outbreak and were finally found to be infected with the covid-19 during the postoperative period this report is a review proposed to find all relevant data on the perioperative period in covid-19 patients who were preoperatively asymptomatic and not tested for covid-19 searches were conducted in pubmed april 4th 2020 and reconducted on april 10th 2020 to identify studies reporting the perioperative course of preoperatively unknown asymptomatic covid-19 patients the following search terms were used covid-19 or novel coronavirus or sars-cov-2 or 2019 ncov and surgery or surgical or operation or perioperative or postoperative or anesthesia all publications of all designs including original studies observational studies case reports case series and randomized controlled studies were considered for inclusion there were no date or language restrictions on the search references of relevant papers were searched manually for relevant studies due to time constraints a study protocol was not registered and one reviewer cn conducted the search reviewed full texts and extracted data overall 430 titles and abstracts were identified through database searching after screening 32 potentially relevant reports were evaluated as full text for inclusion finally only four reports were found to be published on perioperative risks during the covid-19 outbreak these publications comprise 64 covid-19 carriers of them 51 were diagnosed only in the postoperative period 1417 table 1 summarizes the characteristics and outcomes of the undiagnosed covid-19 surgical patients the earliest report describes the perioperative period of three surgical patients cholecystectomy hernia repair and hysterectomy in tehran iran in february 2020 14 the covid-19 status was unknown for all patients before surgery all

test of these two covid-19 postoperatively confirmed patients one died due to acute respiratory failure and multiple organ failure mof the remaining patient was clinically diagnosed and died due to the postoperative progressive course of covid-19 infection an additional patient suffered from acute respiratory distress syndrome ards one day before his scheduled bariatric surgery and rapidly progressed to cardiopulmonary arrest pcr was not performed due to rapid deterioration and insufficient testing capacity the second publication is a case report detailing the perioperative presentation of covid-19 in a liver transplant recipient 15 this 37-year old showed no respiratory abnormalities upon admission on the following day of hepatic arterial chemoembolization his fever spiked up to 39 c as chemoembolization-associated sterile inflammation was suspected cephalosporin antibiotic was initiated in the following days liver transplant surgery was performed and immunosuppressive drugs were prescribed due to persistent fever and a suspected chest computed tomography ct rt-pcr was obtained and confirmed positive for covid-19 covid-19 was finally negative on postoperative day pod 49 and the patient was discharged from the hospital two months after his surgery the third publication entails 25 cases of covid-19 infection from a single thoracic surgery department 16 of these cases 13 were of hospitalized patients and 12 were of health care staff of these 13 patients seven had a severe disease 12 patients had a positive nucleic test for covid-19 while the remaining patient was clinically diagnosed reviewing their data a potential covid-19 perioperative carrier was identified this patient had localized ground glass on ct imaging was misdiagnosed before surgery and his fever elevated only on pod1 on pod 3 his ct scan already revealed severe covid-19 infection on pod 5 the patient died during his hospital stay six health care staff members and five postoperational patients were exposed and found to have a positive nucleic test for covid-19 as mortality rate was significantly high in postoperative patients 513 the authors show that chest surgery was significantly associated with death due to covid-19 moreover they demonstrate that age and copd were significantly associated with a severe presentation and finally death from covid-19 the fourth report details the postoperative outcomes of 34 asymptomatic patients who had underwent elective surgery during the covid-19 outbreak in wuhan china 17 of the 34 patients 20 had one or more comorbidities most commonly hypertension malignancy diabetes and cardiovascular disease the surgeries were classified by technical difficulty general complexity and the level of risk most surgeries were defined to be of mild level-2 or moderate level-3 risks all patients suffered postoperatively from covid-19 pneumonia commonly complicated by ards shock secondary infection cardiological complications and acute kidney injury 15 patients 441 required icu admission due to mof or mechanical ventilation most of these patients underwent level-3 surgeries while non-icu patients were mostly after surgeries of milder risk and shorter duration in addition icu patients were significantly older 55 years vs 47 years and more probable to have an underlying comorbidity seven patients 206 eventually died due to progressive respiratory failure all during the postoperative period of level-3 surgeries all with at least one underlying comorbidity as patients developed covid-19 symptoms after an average of 26 days the authors deduce that the elective surgery was performed during the asymptomatic incubation period of covid-19 and that surgery may accelerate and exacerbate covid-19 disease small case series are reporting on the outcome of surgical procedures in patients diagnosed with covid-19 moreover there are limited case series reporting on the impact of covid-19 in undiagnosed preoperative patients our review brings to light part of the surgical practice challenges during the covid-19 outbreak and specifically aims to describe the hazardous postoperative outcomes of undiagnosed covid-19 patients emphasizing the importance of considering preoperative covid-19 screening the rationale behind knowing the covid-19 status of any surgical candidate is ensuring patient safety reduction of postoperative complications 18 and potential transmission of the novel coronavirus from an unknown carrier to medical staff or to other patients 19 while spreading the virus in the operation room and during hospital stay is potentially managed by personal protective equipment 20 the complications that may present during patients recovery are not under our control the recent accumulation of published data concerning the postoperative outcome of patients diagnosed with covid-19 during the perioperative period suggested a 1451 275 postoperative mortality rate and severe mostly pulmonic complications the latest report by lei s et al 17 suggested 20 postoperative death 44 icu admission rate and 100 postoperative pneumonia among 34 asymptomatic covid-19 patients who underwent elective surgery noticeable are the age differences between studies and their association with fatality rate in line with previously published studies and as seen in table 1 the studies with an older average age resulted in higher fatality rates though the data were retrieved from a small available number of publications this morbidity and mortality risk is unacceptable and could be minimized or even avoided primarily by the preoperative diagnosis of patients covid-19 status as suggested by the american guidelines with that said like all screening tests a true benefit from preoperative screening depends on covid-19 local prevalence rates and the availability of an accurate objective test screening is of extra importance in situations that may lead to different clinical management approaches for the patients and staff to elaborate on these key issues rt-pcr covid-19 testing was shown to have high specificity with moderate sensitivity resulting in cases of false negative results 21 usually these false results are a consequence of incorrect sampling 22 and could be addressed by education of health care staff adequate sampling good laboratory standards and high-quality rt-pcr kits all reduce inaccurate results 22 today and especially in the near future when isolation and quarantine measures ease up and expecting the comeback of elective surgeries knowing the preoperative covid-19 status will be of great clinical importance the preoperative diagnosis will lead health care providers to use the right protocols aiming to reduce postoperative complications and fatal morbidity most importantly a known covid-19 status will improve the medical staff decision making concerning the use of protective equipment aiming to prevent the hazardous staff infection a preoperative screening test may also assist in the decision whether to delay a scheduled operation and eventually ease answering the riskbenefit question of surgery versus covid-19 exposure and complications the covid-19 pandemic has presented unique challenges and learning opportunities for surgical centers the future trajectory of the covid-19 pandemic is uncertain and during this worldwide pandemic the situation is dynamic policies and recommendations may change at any time but since our global overarching goal is to continue providing compassionate safe care for surgical patients and for medical staff we believe that preoperative screening for covid-19 baseline status and detection of asymptomatic surgical candidates during the covid-19 incubation period is an acceptable requirement consideration of preoperative covid-19 testing may facilitate the preoperative risk and benefit assessment whether to perform or postpone the individuals surgical procedure during the current pandemic in conclusion covid-19 may have potential serious implications on the perioperative course and may result in substantial fatality rates the presented rates were accumulated from a small number of studies and patients therefore future well-designed studies are warranted nevertheless knowing the preoperative covid-19 status before any surgical treatment should be considered especially in high prevalence areas we believe that in light of the observed outcomes and in order to protect patients and health care staff a consideration of sampling asymptomatic patients before surgical treatment is needed

fever differed between sars-cov-2-positive and -negative individuals two of the eleven were negative on the first pcr test and positive on the second abstract background severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was found to be the causative microorganism of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 which started to spread in wuhan china this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of questionnaire symptoms-based screening and pcr screening of returnees from covid-19 endemic areas on a chartered flight to examine the proportion of infected persons and the proportion of asymptomatic persons among infected persons who returned from wuhan methods a retrospective cohort study was done in seven tertiary medical institutions in japan a total of 566 japanese who returned from wuhan participated in the study results overall 11 of the 566 passengers had a positive sars-cov-2 pcr result for pharyngeal swabs and six were asymptomatic only fever differed between sars-cov-2-positive and -negative individuals p  0043 six of the eleven pcr-positive individuals were asymptomatic and four remained positive on day 10 and one asymptomatic person tested positive up to day 27 two of the eleven were negative on the first pcr test and positive on the second a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t conclusions our results will be important insights on screening returnees from locked down cities as well as important data on the proportion of asymptomatic individuals infected with sars-cov-2 a 13-day observation period and a second round of pcr may be effective to screen patients including asymptomatic infections  a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t background since the end of december 2019 pneumonia of an unknown cause started to spread in wuhan china 1 and on january 8 2020 severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was found to be the causative microorganism 2  initially 49-66 of affected individuals were reported to be associated with the seafood market 3 4  and it was believed that the majority of cases since january have been transmitted from person to person 5 6  on january 30 2020 the world health organization who declared it a public health emergency of international concern pheic 7  as of february 15 2020 the epidemic has spread worldwide and there have been cases of human-to-human transmission outside china 8  the wuhan city government announced in january 21 that access to wuhan will be partially restricted and in january 23 the government reported that wuhan outbound railway stations and airports as well as all public transport in the city would stop this decision made it difficult for foreigners living in wuhan to return to their home countries in january 28 after negotiations with the chinese government the japanese government announced that it would send charter flights to wuhan to repatriate japanese residents who wished to leave the city the government of japan decided to conduct a sars-cov-2 polymerase chain reaction pcr test on all returnees even if they were asymptomatic a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t this study was based on the results of a sars-cov-2 pcr test performed on returnees from wuhan and a follow-up study after returning to japan the purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of covid-19 among returnees from wuhan and the clinical course of asymptomatic individuals this retrospective cohort study included japanese wuhan residents who returned to tokyo international airport hnd from the wuhan tianhe international airport wuh at wuh people with symptoms clearly indicative of coronavirus disease 2019 covid- 19 were not allowed to leave wuhan at the hnd quarantine station returnees who were suspected of having covid-19 with fever and respiratory symptoms such as cough or sore throat were transported to several medical institutions in tokyo figure 1  returnees who were judged to have no symptoms were transported to the national center for global health and medicine ncgm shinjuku tokyo where they underwent thermometry and completed a medical questionnaire about contact history and symptoms while on their bus nurses checked the returnee questionnaires and took body temperatures during transport those with respiratory symptoms nasal discharge sore throat cough etc or fever 375c were taken to an a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t examination room where a physician performed a pharyngeal swab and rapid tests for influenza except for cases where clinical symptoms were clearly judged unlikely to have covid-19 they were admitted to the ncgm or to other hospitals in tokyo for isolation those who had no problems according to the questionnaire or a normal temperature on the bus were examined in a large hall and pharyngeal swabs were collected anyone with any respiratory tract symptoms or fever 375c at the time of the physicians consultation in the large hall were further examined in the consultation room and admitted to the ncgm or other hospitals in tokyo except for cases where clinical symptoms were clearly judged not to be covid-19 those who did not need hospitalization after the consultation at ncgm were moved to another accommodation facility and were instructed by the government not to leave the room for 12 days individuals who developed a fever or respiratory symptoms during the 12 days of quarantine at the accommodation were hospitalized for pcr and were admitted to an isolation room if sars-cov-2 was positive on the 13th day after returning to japan a second pcr of the pharyngeal swab was performed and those who tested negative were released from isolation at the accommodation facility and returned home those who tested positive were hospitalized and isolated asymptomatic persons with a positive pcr result were admitted to a medical institution for follow-up and isolation for asymptomatic pcr-negative persons who stayed at the accommodation facility the pcr test was repeated on the 13th day those with negative results were allowed to return home and those with positive results were a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t transported to a medical institution for follow-up and isolation as with symptomatic patients clinical data was collected starting on the date of return because under japans infectious disease law covid-19 patients could not be discharged from the hospital until two negative pcr tests were confirmed pcr tests were performed 24 hours after symptom improvement for symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients as appropriate after hospitalization this study was approved by the ethics committee of the ncgm and all hospital institutions involved approval no ncgm-g-003475-00 and informed written consent was obtained from all returnees except for two who refused medical consultation the basic characteristics of pcr-positive and -negative cases were examined using fishers exact test for categorical variables and mann-whitney u test for quantitative variables a total of 566 japanese wuhan residents returned to hnd from wuh in january 29 n206 30 n210 and 31 n150 2020 two were excluded from this study because they refused the pcr test after going through quarantine for about two hours each twenty-eight people at a quarantine station had symptoms of sars-cov-2 and a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t were transported to a medical facility in tokyo a total of 536 people judged to have no symptoms suspicious of sars-cov-2 at the quarantine station were transported to the ncgm while 36 patients with a fever 375c or any respiratory symptoms were hospitalized at the ncgm or other tokyo medical facilities moreover 500 were judged to be asymptomatic and moved to an accommodation facility after sample collection  figure 1  table 1 shows the characteristics of the persons evacuated from wuhan to japan the proportion of pcr-positive individuals that used any drug was higher than that of those who tested negative with the pcr when the basic characteristics of the patients age sex contact histories symptoms were compared between the two groups no significant differences were observed except for the number of patients who had a fever p 0043 three out of the 206 passengers on the first flight had a positive sars-cov-2 pcr result for pharyngeal swabs collected on january 29 one of them was already isolated in a patient private room of a medical institution as a symptomatic patient patient s1 but two were asymptomatic and stayed at the accommodation facility the two asymptomatic individuals were transported to a medical institution where they were isolated and carefully monitored patients a1 and a2 among those patients transported directly from the quarantine station to a medical institution all had negative a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t results on the first test among them one person who had pneumonia and was strongly suspected of covid-19 was retested and found to be positive patient s2 in january 31 one of the patients staying at the accommodation who was reported to be ill with a fever and sore throat was transported to hospital and isolated in february 6 patient s3 subsequently pharyngeal swabs collected in february 7 tested positive for pcr in addition 201 people who tested negative on the first pcr were all negative on pcr tests performed in february 11 only two asymptomatic patients of the 210 passengers on the second flight had positive pcr in 30 january and were transported from the accommodation facility to a medical facility patients a3 and a4 in january 31 another person who initially had negative pharyngeal swab results was retested because of the development of pneumonia and was found to be positive patient s4 in february 3 fortunately 207 people who tested negative on the first pcr all tested negative in february 12 two of the 150 passengers on the third flight were positive with the first pcr test one was already isolated in a medical institution patient s5 and the other was asymptomatic and stayed in an accommodation facility patient a5 one asymptomatic person of the 148 people who tested negative on the first pcr tested positive on a second pcr on february 13 a6 the details of the eleven pcr-positive patientss1-s5 a1-a6 are summarized in table 2  a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t notably among the eleven pcr-positive individuals five had symptoms due to covid-19 at the time of sample collection patients s1-s5 at the time of admission three had a fever 375c three had cough and two had sore throat four of the five symptomatic individuals had pneumonia on admission and the other ones1 developed pneumonia on the 9th day all five symptomatic patients were mild and discharged without any sequela they did not receive mechanical ventilation and were not admitted to the intensive care unit patient a1 who was initially asymptomatic had a fever of 389c with headache and sore throat 3 days after the 1st pcr screening test the result of the rapid influenza test was negative fever and other symptoms lasted for only 1 day after which they disappeared patient a2 had diarrhea 5 times per day without fever or any other respiratory symptoms at day 6 which lasted about 1 day patient a4 had a fever of 38c when transported from the accommodation facility to the hospital day 2 but the temperature immediately dropped to 372c and no fever or respiratory symptoms were seen thereafter the remaining three of the six were consistently asymptomatic from the date of admission to the date of discharge these six asymptomatic individuals were carefully monitored at the hospital pharyngeal swabs were collected and pcr tested as appropriate and where possible the viral load was measured not necessarily measured  we reported the results of two pcr tests on 564 returnees from wuhan and the course of positives of the 564 returnees eleven were pcr-positive 20 which far exceeded our expectations according to who situation report the number of confirmed sars-cov-2 patients in mainland china on january 29 was 5997 9  which accounts for only 0054 of the population of wuhan and is significantly different from the positive rate of japanese returnees however an analysis indicated that there were already 75815 infected people in wuhan as of january 25 2020 10  from our reported number of positive pcr results it is estimated that wuhan has more infections than reported as of march 21 2020 several cities around the world have locked down in addition to wuhan our results will provide important insights on responding to returnees from these locked down cities a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t returnees were first sent to a quarantine station where patients suspected to have covid-19 were transported to a hospital in tokyo additionally of the 28 people transported from the quarantine to the hospital only one was positive for covid-19 ten of the eleven persons with positive result were sent to the ncgm with a low likelihood of infection and the quarantine station detected 91 of those positive for covid-19 although quilty et al 11 estimated that 46 of patients will be missed in quarantine screening the cohort study may have reduced the rate of detection because of the higher proportion of asymptomatic individuals to find and isolate covid-19 patients among the returnees they were asked to fill out a simple questionnaire after they were transported from the quarantine station to the ncgm however there was no difference between the positive and negative cases regarding the history of contact with patients and the history of contact with patients with influenza-like illness symptoms the presence of upper respiratory symptoms was not effective for screening but fever might be effective because among the pcr-positive symptomatic cases all had fever but the respiratory tract symptoms varied and one patient initially had diarrhea only aside from fever these suggest the difficulty of detecting covid-19 by symptoms alone naturally it is not possible to detect asymptomatic patients among pcr-positive cases using a questionnaire in the early stages of the covid-19 epidemic many cases a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t were associated with the seafood market and it was speculated that some wildlife in the seafood market was the source of infection at this time the host of sars-cov-2 had not been determined but it was known that bat coronavirus had high homology with sars-cov-2 12 13  and that bats were sold in the seafood market however since the seafood market was closed on january 1 2020 5  and more than 14 days had passed since the closure this questionnaire did not include a history of visit to the seafood market nevertheless we found 11 sars-cov-2 pcr-positive cases this suggests that the outbreak has already been driven by human-to-human infection regardless of the origin of index cases among the 11 positives the first screening pcr found 7 positives but 4 were negative in other words one screening pcr test missed 36 of true positives who were still in the incubation period at the time of the first screening pcr or just because of false negative based on reports that 95 of cases developed within 125 days of exposure 5 we performed a second pcr test on the 13th day of return hoehl et al reported 126 evacuated germany passengers from wuhan to frankfurt 14 in this report 18 of returnees had passed the symptoms-based screening and was later found to have evidence of sars-cov-2 in a pharyngeal swab in our study of the 11 positives among 564 passengers 10 passed quarantine screening seven passed symptoms-based screening at ncgm and two had negative initial pcr our a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t report is consistent with their report that symptom-based screening was ineffective and that about 2 of returnees from wuhan were positive however to screen patients with high infection rates such as those returning from wuhan a single pcr test may miss cases that develop after the incubation period and a second pcr might be effective furthermore of the eleven cases in this study only one was exposed with a confirmed case of covid-19 in addition we found sars-cov-2 from 20 of the entire subjects these results might suggest three hypotheses first contact history is not a significant risk factor for infection previous reports suggested that few contacts with covid-19 patients developed covid-19 15 and suggesting that certain clusters were prone to outbreaks 16 transmission might depend on the environment at the time of contact with the confirmed patient second sars-cov-2 can be transmitted from cases other than those with symptoms rothe et al 17 reported that asymptomatic individuals were infectious in addition patients 3 and 4 had no exposure to the index case and only patient 2 had contact with patient 1 who was then asymptomatic this suggests that covid-19 is infectious during the asymptomatic period or that it is infectious even during the incubation period in addition several reports suggesting infection from asymptomatic infected people have been published 18 19 other respiratory viruses such as seasonal influenza can also be transmitted by asymptomatic cases 20 therefore it is a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t possible that asymptomatic individuals with the same respiratory sars-cov-2 infection are infectious third returnees might have underestimated or forgotten their contact history since the evacuation process in these circumstances is stressful for healthy and asymptomatic people their self-reported contact history could be biased additionally it is possible that they simply forgot their contact history there were six cases of asymptomatic covid-19 these six asymptomatic individuals had two consultations at the quarantine station and at the ncgm before being reported that sars-cov-2 was detected in nasopharyngeal and pharyngeal swabs of asymptomatic patients for 4 days from 7 to 11 days after contact with covid-19 patients 5  it is reasonable to conclude that the two individuals who have developed sars-cov-2 symptoms were still pcr-positive but it is surprising that the two cases that did not develop sars-cov-2 symptoms were also positive ten days later the our study has some limitations first pcr screening was performed using pharyngeal swab samples in this study the use of lower respiratory tract specimens is optimal for diagnosing covid-19 2  pharyngeal swabs are less sensitive than nasal swabs 24 and lower respiratory tract specimens thus this method may not be able to detect all infected individuals among returnees second as mentioned above our contact history tracing was based on self-reported answers and thus could be biased although contact a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t history does not seem to be as useful as we expected for identification of infected cases further investigation would be desirable for this issue third after the second positive pcr the observation was concluded and no one in the population has subsequently been diagnosed with covid-19 however if any of them had asymptomatic infection after the second pcr this study did not detect it in conclusion we screened 564 returnees from wuhan of whom 11 were positive for sars-cov-2 our report provides important evidence on the existence of asymptomatic individuals infected with sars-cov-2 and insights into the epidemic situation where infected people are spreading the infection in wuhan at lease among the japanese resident community a 13-day observation period and a second round of pcr may be effective to screen all patients including asymptomatic infections m a n u s c r i p t m a n u s c r i p t m a n u s c r i p t m a n u s c r i p t   asymptomatic transmission during the covid-19 pandemic and implications for public health strategies hanalise huff v avantika singh  this narrative review summarizes evidence demonstrating transmission potential of sars-cov-2 from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals and their contribution to pandemic this implicates consideration of widespread testing with emphasis on health care workers and urgent revision of global health strategies a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 2 abstract sars-cov-2 spread rapidly within months despite global public health strategies to curb transmission by testing symptomatic patients and encouraging social distancing here we summarize rapidly emerging evidence highlighting transmission by asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals viral load of asymptomatic carriers is comparable to symptomatic patients viral shedding is highest before symptom onset suggesting high transmissibility before symptoms within universally tested subgroups surprisingly high percentages of covid-19 positive asymptomatic individuals were found asymptomatic transmission was reported in several clusters a wuhan study showed an alarming rate of intrahospital transmission and several countries reported higher prevalence among healthcare workers than the general population this raises concern that health workers could act as silent disease vectors therefore current public health strategies relying solely on symptom onset for infection identification need urgent reassessment extensive universal testing irrespective of symptoms may be considered with priority placed on groups with high frequency exposure to positive patients  the coronavirus disease 2019 covid- 19 pandemic has rapidly spread across the globe infecting more than 47 million people causing more than 316000 deaths and overwhelming health care systems 1  despite these staggering numbers the best strategies to save lives continue to be investigated at the time of publication no effective standard of treatment has been established and an effective vaccine is yet to be developed in the absence of an effective treatment the current focus remains on human-to-human transmission prevention including among close contacts and health care workers 1  this is a huge challenge as evidence is rapidly emerging suggesting transmission by asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carriers of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the virus causing covid-19 exposure prevention strategies across the globe have included use of personal protective equipment ppe social distancing of community members quarantining known covid-19 positive patients and contact tracing in order to identify exposed individuals 2  current strategies of relying on presence of symptoms to identify sars-cov-2-infected individuals for transmission control have proven to be a challenge given emerging evidence that transmissibility can occur prior to symptom onset the median incubation period is estimated to be about 5 days 95 ci 45 to 58 days with a majority of those who develop symptoms doing so within 14 days after exposure 3  however majority of patients develop mild to moderate disease and some remain asymptomatic 4  transmissibility has been shown to begin 2 to 3 days before the appearance of the first symptoms 5  peaks at 07 days before symptom onset 5 and may last for as long as 21 days in asymptomatic individuals 6  a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 4 in most countries viral pcr testing to determine sars-cov-2 infection status has focused on symptomatic patients while testing capabilities are being improved upon 7  the emerging evidence presented below makes a compelling case that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals are the major drivers of the covid-19 pandemic and argues for reassessment of public health strategies certain groups serving vulnerable populations eg health care workers hcws long-term care facility ltcf staff first responders etc have a higher probability of exposure to sars-cov-2 and thus are at high risk of unknowingly contributing to disease transmission during asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic phases it is proposed here that the early identification of infected asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals should be an area of focus with priority on universal testing of those who interact with vulnerable populations the importance of asymptomatic carriers in transmission of infectious diseases has been established in similar respiratory viral outbreaks prior to the sars-cov-2 pandemic in middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 12 of patients who tested positive for mers-cov were asymptomatic 8 9  during the sars-cov outbreak in singapore in 2003 75 of serology positive hcws and 13 of cases in the general population were asymptomatic 10  data suggest that sars-cov-2 can be highly contagious in individuals before symptom onset and in individuals who never develop symptoms researchers have hypothesized that salivary glands may function as potential reservoirs of sars-cov-2 in asymptomatic infected individuals 11  a study on quantitative viral load found that an asymptomatic individual had similar viral load as symptomatic patients suggesting a similar a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 5 transmission potential 12  an asymptomatic 6-month old infant with covid-19 had a high viral load on nasopharyngeal np swab with similar viral load as his symptomatic mother daily np swabs for this infant remained positive for sars-cov-2 and eventually became negative on day 17 of his admission his symptomatic mothers np swabs became negative on day 18 of her illness 13  a mathematical model incorporating asymptomatic carriers indicated that basic reproduction number ro is likely to be from 55 to 254 with a point estimate of 154 this suggests that asymptomatic individuals are major drivers for the growth of covid-19 pandemic 14  in a study reviewing the temporal dynamics of sars-cov-2 viral shedding clinical and epidemiologic data was analyzed between cases in transmission chains the study suggests that viral shedding may begin 2 to 3 days before the appearance of the first symptoms and 44 95 ci 25-69 of secondary cases acquired their infection during the index cases presymptomatic period 5  additionally it was found that viral loads decreased each day following symptom onset in a monotonical manner the infectiousness was determined to peak at 07 days 95 ci -02 -20 days before symptom onset suggesting highest viral loads were present immediately prior to or on the day of symptom onset 5  similarly a study using 28 pairs of index cases and their respective secondary cases estimated the serial interval for sars-cov-2 serial interval was defined as the time from symptom onset in the index case infector to symptom onset in the secondary case infectee this interval was found to be 40 days 95 cri 31-49 and is shorter than the estimated mean incubation period of 5 days suggesting pre-symptomatic transmission occurs more frequently than symptomatic transmission 15  not only does the period of transmissibility begin soon after exposure it can also last longer than a week among 24 asymptomatic cases exposed to covid-19-confirmed patients in a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 6 nanjing china the median period of transmissibility was 95 days with maximum of 21 days period of transmissibility or communicable period was defined in the study as the period during which the case had positive pcr test results 12 50 of these asymptomatic cases had typical changes of ground-glass opacities in their lungs despite this only 5 20 went on to develop mild symptoms and none developed severe pneumonia or critical illness leading to death several patients who acquired disease from this group of 24 however developed severe illness 6  this suggests that individuals with sars-cov-2 infection who are asymptomatic or have mild disease can unknowingly transmit disease to others who may go on to develop severe disease and this transmission can happen for up to 21 days after the first covid-19 related death in italy the entire italian town of vo euganeo with a population of 3000 was put into quarantine every inhabitant of this isolated village was tested for sars-cov-2 this revealed that at the time of the first symptomatic case 3 89 of the population was positive 16  it was suggested that 50-75 of positive individuals were asymptomatic 17  the rapid identification and isolation of asymptomatic infected individuals led to eradication of sars-cov-2 from the town of vo euganeo 16  universal pcr testing of japanese nationals evacuated from wuhan china on chartered flights suggested that 308 of positive patients were asymptomatic 95 confidence interval ci 77 538 18  data from the diamond princess cruise line in which all passengers were tested for sars-cov-2 found an estimated asymptomatic proportion of 179 95ci 155-202 19  sailors on the united states navy aircraft carrier theodore roosevelt were potentially exposed on march 5 to covid-19 despite isolating the exposed almost 94 of the 4500 crew members tested positive by april 16 th  about 60 of the people who tested positive a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 7 have remained asymptomatic 20  the above data came from unique populations in which all cases were geographically confined without significant turnover through the boston healthcare for the homeless program all individuals in a single large shelter were tested over the course of a two-day period regardless of symptom status this testing was undertaken after expeditiously removing 15 symptomatic covid-19 confirmed patients from the shelter of 408 guests tested 36 147 were pcr-positive for sars-cov-2 and vast majority of the pcr positive guests had no symptoms prevalence of fever 07 cough 75 shortness of breath 14 was very low and not different among the sars-cov-2 positive guests when compared to those who tested negative the rapid transmission of sars-cov-2 infection and high prevalence of asymptomatic carriers suggests a universal testing approach instead of symptom-based approach is needed to prevent spread of infection to vulnerable populations from asymptomatic carriers 21  according to a large pediatric national case series from china among 2143 pediatric covid-19 cases 44  were asymptomatic among the age groups of 6-10 year-old and 11-15 year-old patients the asymptomatic percentage was as high as 57 30 out of 521 and 65 27 out of 413 respectively overall around 94 of patients were asymptomatic mild or moderate cases 22  a study mentioned earlier suggested that the viral load in a 6 month old infant was similar to the viral load in his symptomatic mother his np swabs remained positive for 2 weeks 13  several familial clusters with asymptomatic pediatric patients have been described in literature leading to concern that asymptomatic children may act as facilitators of viral transmission 23 24  a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 8 early during the new york city sars-cov-2 outbreak pregnant women were screened based on symptoms and exposures however when asymptomatic pregnant women later developed symptoms during admission several health care workers were exposed with inadequate ppe risking further transmission of infection 25  this led to initiation of universal sars-cov-2 pcr testing for all patients admitted to labor units irrespective of symptoms exposure and travel history 26  among 214 women who had pcr testing 15 33 were positive for sars-cov-2 infection and 879 n29 of these women were asymptomatic at the time of testing this universal approach led to changes in patient isolation and ppe practices with goal of limiting asymptomatic transmission to newborns as well as hospital staff 27  as more wide-spread viral pcr is being obtained the presence of asymptomatic covid-19 positive individuals in the population is becoming increasingly obvious in a family cluster of 6 covid-19 pcr positive patients from china 5 symptomatic family members contracted the virus from an asymptomatic family member with absence of ct chest findings 28  another study in singapore identified seven clusters of covid-19 positive individuals among whom presymptomatic transmission likely occurred 29  in a case report asymptomatic transmission occurred from a chinese business woman index patient to two german businessmen patient 1 and 2 at a meeting in germany 30  the index patient later became symptomatic 1-2 days after contact with patients 1 and 2 and tested positive for covid-19 patient 1 developed symptoms 3-4 days after his exposure to the index patient two patients patient 3 and 4 contracted the virus from patient 1 within the first 2 days of patient 1s exposure to the index patient while he was still asymptomatic this cluster a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 9 suggests that transmission occurs before symptom onset and can often occur very soon after exposure the transmission of sars-cov-2 in the hospital settings whether it is from patient to patient or patient to hcw has been shown in a single center case series of 138 patients with covid-19 from wuhan china 57 413 of these patients were presumed to have been infected in the hospital this population was made up of 17 123 patients who were already hospitalized for other reasons and 40 29 who were heath care workers 31  in washington state 76 residents of a ltcf were tested for sars-cov-2 with pcr after a staff member tested positive of the 76 tested 48 63 had positive results of these 48 residents 27 56 were asymptomatic on the day of testing 24 of these asymptomatic individuals subsequently developed symptoms 32  staff from one uk hospital reported that 50 of the emergency room workforce tested positive for coronavirus 33  it italy 10 12252 of covid-19 positive cases were hcws by april 5 2020 34  a pediatric hospital in iran reported that rate of covid-19 infection was higher among pediatric faculty members 83 n5 than the pediatric patients 01 admitted patients n3 or general population 002 35  according to data from 315531 covid-19 positive cases reported to cdc using a standardized form between february 12 -april 9 49370 cases included information on whether the patient was a hcw among these 19 9282 were identified as hcws among the hcws who reported exposures 55 780 had contact with a covid-19 patient only in health care settings 36  as only symptomatic cases were included hcws with mild or asymptomatic infections might have been less likely to be tested or reported these numbers suggesting that 1 in every a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 10 5 covid-19 patients who reported work status was a hcw highlight the possibility of frequent health care worker disease transmission it also raises concern for an underrepresentation of infected health care workers with potential for transmission if they remain asymptomatic and continue to work continued prioritization of sars-cov-2 transmission prevention is essential to reduce global disease burden until an effective vaccine and treatments are developed current who guidelines for interrupting transmission include reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers by focusing on rapid identification diagnosis and management of cases and identification and follow up of contacts 1 the us cdc recommends source control to control for possibility of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission this involves use of universal face covers whenever leaving ones house all individuals entering health care facilities should be screened for symptoms and have face coverings regardless of symptoms 2  evidence discussed earlier suggests that viral loads for sars-cov-2 are similar in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients and that asymptomatic patients may continue to test positive for up to 21 days 5 13  current cdc guidelines prioritize symptomatic individuals for testing and asymptomatic individuals are given least priority 2  viral shedding in symptomatic patients can begin 2 to 3 days before appearance of symptoms and peaks 07 days before symptom onset after which it decreases 5  this suggests that testing symptomatic individuals only will miss those infected individuals who have highest transmissibility and thus universal testing irrespective of symptoms may be needed a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 11 several population clusters where patients acquired sars-cov-2 from infected sources without symptoms have been described 28 29 30  in several geographically limited sub-populations where almost all inhabitants were universally tested asymptomatic carrier prevalence was 50 among those who tested positive  50-75 in voeuganeo 16  60 in uss theodore roosevelt 20  90 in the boston homeless shelter study 21  thus testing of only symptomatic cases may miss more than half of the infected individuals contributing to viral transmission in the community lastly studies from around the globe show that hcws make up a significant proportion of covid-19 cases as shown in the us where hcw were 19 of cases who reported hcw status to cdc 36 and in china where hcw made up 29 of all cases in single-center case series 31  since asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic hcws may have been underreported the prevalence is likely even higher due to recurring encounters with infected individuals hcws also frequently interact with vulnerable at-risk populations and could transmit the disease unknowingly thus when resources are limited testing should prioritize hcws and other subpopulations ltcf staff first responders etc who have frequent contact with infected individuals much is still unknown regarding sars-cov-2 its virulence transmissibility and the immune system response it elicits above evidence is based on highly heterogeneous studies some of which have been reported in the news media or in pre-print journals awaiting peer-review there are still gaps in the understanding of effective screening methods during the asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic phase 37  limitations still exist in the effectiveness of current pcr testing as an infection identification tool 38  antibody testing for sars-cov-2 is now being used in population-based studies to estimate prevalence of infection and studies report many seropositive patients had no history of symptoms 39  antibody testing however is not a a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 12 reliable method to screen for asymptomatic carriers due to the temporal lag between viral exposure and development of antibodies persistence of antibodies beyond infection clearance and false negative rates with low titers 40  therefore in this review we focus on pcr testing as a means to identify asymptomatic carriers while they are infectious in order to limit transmission through early identification transmission prevention remains at the forefront of current public health strategies for the covid-19 pandemic with focus on community social distancing use of ppe and testing symptomatic individuals to isolate positive patients this review summarizes evidence that sars-cov-2 transmission is not only possible but likely highest during pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic phases it also highlights the high prevalence of asymptomatic carriers in several universally tested sub-populations with some studies showing that more than 50 of positive individuals were asymptomatic at the time of testing therefore strategies to curb viral spread can no longer solely rely on symptom onset to identify all infected individuals an approach that focuses on universal source control and early identification of infected individuals regardless of symptoms is of utmost importance universal testing of asymptomatic exposed individuals using pcr testing must be considered further investigation is needed into transmission by asymptomatic carriers and rapid methods of identification of such carriers additional epidemiologic research is also needed for the optimal approach in resource limited settings where universal testing cannot be undertaken surveillance with interval testing of vulnerable populations can be considered and targeted testing of those with high frequency contact with infected individuals hcws ltcf staff first responders etc may be prioritized m a n u s c r i p t 13   the descriptive epidemiology of coronavirus disease 2019 during the epidemic period in luan china achieving limited community transmission using proactive response strategies wei qin jie sun pengpeng xu tianqi gong xiude li lei liu jieying hu yao wang shaoyu xie kaichun li hongwei chang yong lyu   since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 was reported in wuhan china the disease has spread from wuhan to throughout china as well as to other countries and has become a worldwide pandemic 1 2 the number of confirmed cases of covid-19 is updated daily and is expected to increase further in countries outside of china 3 4 some of which have seen continued community transmission 5 luan city is in central china next to hubei province where the most confirmed covid-19 cases and sustained transmission have been reported however we were able to block transmission in luan thus preventing further spread caused by the case imported from hubei and limiting the scale of the epidemic we summarised the overall characteristics of the course of the entire epidemic in luan with a hope that this valuable information will help cities with few imported cases to effectively contain the covid-19 epidemic as shown in figure 1 luan city is located in the central region of china adjacent to hubei province it is the largest city in anhui province with an area of 15 451 square kilometers and about 588 million permanent residents the distance between luan and wuhan the capital of hubei province is about 300 kilometers transportation between the two cities is very convenient taking about 15 h by high-speed train there are at least 30 000 luanese working in hubei and 20 000 people typically return to luan during the spring festival
 we defined cases based on the diagnosis and treatment protocol of covid-19 issued by the chinese national health commission a suspected case was defined as any person with any relevant epidemiological history plus any two clinical manifestations fever andor respiratory symptoms imaging evidence of pneumonia and normaldecreased white-cell count or decreased lymphocyte count or all three aforementioned clinical manifestations if there was no clear epidemiological history a confirmed case was defined as a suspected case with respiratory or blood specimens that tested positive for new coronavirus nucleic acid by real-time fluorescent polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr we defined an asymptomatic carrier as any person with a positive result for new coronavirus nucleic acid by fluorescent rt-pcr without any clinical symptoms a cluster of covid-19 was defined as two or more confirmed cases or asymptomatic carriers that were found within 14 days in a small area eg a family work unit or building site with a clear epidemiological link among those cases community transmission was identified if one of the following situations was met 1 the source of infection for two or more confirmed cases or asymptomatic carriers living in the same community or village was unclear 2 the number of clusters 3 in the same community or village was large showing a continuous trend of transmission or 3 the scale of a cluster was large and the cluster-associated cases were distributed in at least two households communities or villages we defined a sporadic case as having no epidemiological link to any known confirmed case or asymptomatic carrier that did not result in a cluster later a first-generation case was defined as the index case for each cluster all suspected cases confirmed cases and asymptomatic carriers were documented by clinical doctors in the chinese information system for disease control and prevention cisdcp an internet-based passive infectious disease surveillance system in china since the beginning of the covid-19 outbreak the cisdcp has directed local center for disease control and prevention cdc offices to launch comprehensive field investigations conducted by cdcs field epidemiology investigation team feit the feits completed an epidemiological investigative report on each case that was discussed among team members if some details of the report were unclear or more information was needed an additional investigation was launched all the data for this study were generated and collected from those field reports including demographic and clinical information cluster and community information source of infection epidemiological history distribution through the community and characteristics of the cluster between 12 january and 21 february 2020 a total of 69 863 confirmed covid-19 cases and 11 137 asymptomatic carriers were identified in luan the source of infection for 75 cases 938 was identified by field investigation and traceback as shown in figure 2 the epidemic lasted almost 40 days and the onset of illness peaked from 27 january to 6 february all hospitalised cases were discharged before 4 march with no deaths reported of the 80 cases 52 650 were male and 28 350 were female the median age was 40 years range 10 months to 77 years with most cases 813 aged between 20 and 60 years of the 69 confirmed cases 39 565 had a fever as the initial symptom and pneumonia was present in 899 of the patients on admission other symptoms such as cough 373 weakness 145 chills 87 and headache 72 are summarised in table 1

 for all confirmed cases we estimated the mean time to recovery was 218 days 95 ci 203233 and the mean duration of hospitalisation was 182 days 95 ci 168195 we conducted rt-pcr screening in close contacts from 8 february to 22 february in total 3596 respiratory or blood specimens were collected and tested 15 04 of which were positive we observed that four out of 15 initially asymptomatic cases developed fever andor respiratory symptoms within 15 days after the screening as shown in figure 2 and table 1 of the 80 covid-19 cases reported in luan 60 750 were cluster-associated cases and 20 250 were sporadic cases in total we identified 16 clusters that were composed of 60 cases during the epidemic from 12 january to 21 february 2020 each cluster involved a minimum of two cases and a maximum of 13 cases we regarded the index case for each cluster as a first-generation case we found 17 first-generation cases and 43 secondary cases among the 43 secondary cases 10 asymptomatic carriers screened from close contacts were included and all were luan residents we found the time interval between two cases husband and wife in one cluster was only one day so we considered both to be first-generation cases in that cluster based on 32 pairs of cases with a clear infector and infectee relationship in 16 clusters we estimated that the serial interval distribution had a mean of 65 days 95 ci 4882 the generations and exposure of the cases are shown in figure 2 field investigation results showed that 20 cases returned to luan from wuhan before onset indicating that they might have been infected in wuhan or related to wuhan as shown in figure 2 17 cases were due to exposures outside of wuhan during the epidemic all patients worked in wuhan but had returned to luan during the spring festival we found that 13 cases had contact with patients from wuhan in the city where they had been working before symptom onset suggesting they may have been infected by this exposure the other four cases were secondary cases of infection originating in luan among 20 wuhan-related cases only 250 520 of cases generated secondary cases and 750 1520 of wuhan-related cases did not among 43 secondary cases 38 884 were residents with no travel or residence history outside luan we found that secondary cases mainly occurred in household members accounting for 698 3043 the largest cluster involving 13 cases was caused by an asymptomatic carrier who came back from wuhan on 19 january 2020 we found up to at least fifth-generation cases in this cluster and the exposure mode of the secondary cases included those who lived together attended parties or ate together and those who shared entertainment activities in this study we regarded communities where the sporadic cases 20 cases and the index cases of each cluster 17 cases were found as potential community transmission settings we found 37 cases were distributed across 36 communities inevitably these so-called initial cases may infect more and more people in other communities without effective control measures however we observed that only 189 737 of these cases seeded the subsequent community transmission in addition the number of communities with confirmed cases or asymptomatic carriers increased from 36 to 47 during the epidemic period in luan the median for cluster-associated cases in each community was two cases range 17 of the seven initial cases that caused community transmission only one was reported having resided in or having visited wuhan he was an asymptomatic carrier so he did not take intense quarantine and social distancing measures before he was identified the other six initial cases that caused community transmission were characterised as exposure to cities outside of wuhan five cases or as a local resident with an unknown source of infection one case the results showed that community transmission was more prone to occur if the epidemiological history of the initial case was unclear although covid-19 is highly contagious and has spread rapidly from wuhan throughout china 6 we demonstrated the ability to block transmission and prevented further spread in luan limiting the impact and the scale of the epidemic as a city with 588 million permanent residents 7 the crude covid-19 incidence of only 14 per 100 000 population during the epidemic period was seemingly acceptable here we summarised the characteristics of the course of the entire epidemic in luan to inform the response for regions with imported cases at the early stage of spread mathematical models have estimated that the reproductive number of covid-19 was about 23 8 9 which means 20 wuhan-related cases may have caused at least 46 secondary cases during one maximum incubation period in luan however we found only five 250 wuhan-related confirmed secondary cases at the beginning of the covid-19 epidemic in luan suggesting the implementation of containment measures had worked effectively before the first confirmed covid-19 case was reported in luan the city had been facing the most urgent threat from covid-19 due to its proximity to hubei province and the mass movement of 20 000 people from hubei to luan during the spring festival however the infection status of those people was unpredictable therefore five specific measures were taken by the local government for people who came back from wuhan which included distributing a letter of sympathy a card for reporting ones condition a card with covid-19 prevention information a thermometer for temperature measurement and a bottle of cleaning product for daily disinfection additionally before and at the early stage of the epidemic knowledge about disease prevention such as self-isolation and social distancing had been popularised to improve public health literacy and skills our results showed that most community transmissions were not caused by wuhan-related cases which indicated that a series of public health interventions were associated with improved control of the covid-19 outbreak in luan most importantly the non-pharmaceutical outbreak containment strategies in china including public health interventions appear to have been effective 1012 recent studies showed that the transmission window in the community was shortened when infectious individuals were isolated more quickly 13 fortunately at the early stages of the epidemic and even as it progressed strict containment measures such as movement and traffic restrictions self-isolation centralised medical observation social distancing and closure of public places were taken which might have contributed to interrupting local covid-19 transmission in luan we observed that only seven 189 index cases resulted in community transmission during the epidemic in luan interestingly community transmission was not caused by those wuhan-related cases in contrast it was caused by cases of infections in cities outside of wuhan in residents with unknown sources of infection or by those who were asymptomatic carriers since the epidemiological history of those cases was not obvious the diagnosis of covid-19 and implementation of related control measures such as isolation were delayed therefore parties and other social activities continued as usual before the cases had been diagnosed which may have increased the risk of community transmission we also found that the largest cluster outbreak was caused by an asymptomatic carrier who came back from wuhan which further supports the human-to-human transmission of covid-19 from asymptomatic carriers 14 15 at first the patient had noted the risk of infection at wuhan so he had a physical examination on 23 january this third day back from wuhan with normal findings frustratingly this favourable outcome might have promoted reduced patient vigilance in implementing infection control measures had his infection been immediately identified and had he subsequently isolated the number of covid-19 cases in luan might have been decreased by 15 furthermore we found that the proportion of asymptomatic infection was as high as 137 assuming these events involving asymptomatic carriers are not isolated perhaps more people will be infected in luan therefore we should be concerned about asymptomatic carriers who represent an enormous challenge to containment in other countries responding to the covid-19 epidemic several limitations should be considered in interpreting our findings first since cisdcp is a passive surveillance system mild cases or asymptomatic carriers who did not seek medical help may not have been identified as a result the number of covid-19 cases may have been underestimated in our study second the source of infection in at least five cases was not investigated clearly and whether these cases were caused by an asymptomatic carrier or community transmission should be seriously considered our study showed that covid-19 community transmission in luan city was blocked effectively at the early stage thus limiting the scale of the epidemic our results highlight the fact that asymptomatic spread may represent a substantial challenge in response to covid-19 we believe it is beneficial to enhance the sensitivity of covid-19 diagnostic tests and to increase the public health authoritys capacity for surveillance  asymptomatic patients with novel coronavirus disease covid-19 peng an ping song yong wang bo liu   to the editor since the outbreak of the new coronavirus in wuhan in december 2019 it has now spread to more than 100 countries around the world the cumulative number of confirmed cases is as high as 11 million with 58000 deaths bringing huge challenges to the people world-wide the chinese government has curbed the rising epidemic situation in china through strict prevention and disease control mechanisms 123 at present there are only 1021 confirmed cases and only 300 critical cases 4 hubei province the epicenter of the epidemic has been deregulated whereas wuhan will be deregulated on april 8 however while celebrating the victory over pneumonia we should not ignore a very serious challenge there may be many asymptomatic patients in china as yet there are 1400 known asymptomatic patients in china 4 since many asymptomatic patients are unknown and therefore not isolated it is very difficult to control the outbreak therefore in this study we present 25 asymptomatic patients that we hope will give significant insights into covid-19 this work was approved by the ethics committee of xiangyang first peoples hospital affiliated to hubei university of medicine 2019 lsz s109 and informed consent was obtained from the patients for clinical research of these 25 patients 22 were family members who took care of confirmed patients with covid-19 the other three patients were staff involved in cleaning of medical waste and in transportation in the hospital two out of the three cases were men most of these cases were young patients with an average age of 42 years an interesting finding was that most of the asymptomatic patients had blood type o table 1 provides a detailed description of the patients characteristics 
table 2 shows the characteristics of chest computed tomography ct scans of asymptomatic patients in total 24 of these 25 patients had abnormal ct findings in the lung approximately two-thirds of the patients had an involvement of a single lobe and two-thirds had only a ground-glass density shadow the least common ct finding was interlobular septal thickening figure 1 all the patients were isolated after diagnosis in total 16 of them recovered without any symptoms however nine patients developed mild cough andor other symptoms these nine patients received medication chloroquine phosphate 500 mg twice daily for seven days and abidol 200 mg three times a day for no more than ten days and their symptoms improved over time control chest ct was performed in all patients 7-30 days after isolation it was observed that there was improvement in lesions and their involvement had decreased in 24 patients none of them had further radiological progress in the patient who did not have any radiological findings at the time of diagnosis no radiological findings were observed on the follow-up ct according to the pneumonia diagnosis and treatment program for new coronavirus infection trial seventh edition issued by the national health commission the diagnosis of covid-19 pneumonia is mainly based on the comprehensive judgment of epidemiological history clinical manifestations imaging examination and detection of new coronavirus nucleic acid although nucleic acid detection is the gold standard for the diagnosis of covid-19 false negative test results are not too low because of many factors such as test kit sampling tube specimen sampling drugs administered to patients etc 5 chest ct is of great value in the diagnosis of covid-19 because of its simplicity and ease especially in patients with or without clinical symptoms 367 chest ct examination is particularly important because it is conducive to the early detection of asymptomatic infections hence resulting in early isolation of the positive cases and reduction of infections in people in contact 8 in this study we observed that one-third of the asymptomatic patients with covid-19 developed symptoms at follow-up these asymptomatic patients are usually young and have an excellent prognosis more than 90 of these asymptomatic patients have radiological abnormal findings in diagnosis these pulmonary lesions are mostly below the peripheral pleura of the lower lobes and are characterized by ground-glass density shadow as a result chest ct plays an important role in the early diagnosis of covid-19 and leads to the early isolation and treatment of asymptomatic patients we believe that this process is vital in controlling the outbreak  clinical and epidemiological features of 36 children with coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 in zhejiang china an observational cohort study haiyan qiu junhua wu liang hong yunling luo qifa song dong chen   coronaviruses are non-segmented positive-stranded rna viruses with a roughly 30 kb genome surrounded by a protein envelope most coronaviruses cause diseases in their particular host species1 those that can infect humans through cross-species transmission have become an important threat to public health two serious coronavirus disease outbreaks have happened in the past two decades severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 20032 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers in 20123
 since december 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has been recognised as the causal factor in a series of severe cases of pneumonia originating in wuhan in hubei province china4 this disease has been named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by who sars-cov-2 has been shown to cause disease via a mechanism analogous to the sars coronavirus with potential damage to vital organs such as lung heart liver and kidney and infection poses a considerable risk to patients by the high prevalence of pneumonia5 by march 1 2020 sars-cov-2 had led to 80 981 confirmed cases of covid-19 in china and 44 067 cases in 117 countries6 a cohort study of 44 672 chinese cases reported that 21 of patients were younger than 20 years and 12 were asymptomatic7
 pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality in children8 distinct immunological responses to viral infections can exist in children and result in severe damage to vital organs9 although short-to-medium-term outcomes for children who recovered from sars seemed good the disease caused exercise impairment after more than 6 months10 a comprehensive literature search indicated that mers was rare in children 31 cases identified between 2012 and 201611 because transmission depends heavily on animal exposure and direct contact in the household or health-care facilities collectively these two coronavirus diseases did not widely affect children because of the short-term epidemic of sars and the strict transmission route of mers in a study of 15 children with covid-19 aged 414 years six patients had small nodular ground-glass opacities in the lungs12 at the time of the covid-19 outbreak all schools were on the spring festival holiday which might have prevented children from exposure to transmission sources however the school community is a place that can enhance rapid spread of the highly infectious sars-cov-2 
research in context
evidence before this study
we searched pubmed from nov 1 2019 to march 1 2020 for studies published in any language using the terms covid-19 coronavirus disease 2019 novel coronavirus pediatric patients children transmission clinical feature and epidemiological features we found 13 studies about coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 in children these studies were related to treatment recommendations ct features in 15 children case reports and covid-19 in infants to our knowledge no study has been done to comprehensively investigate a cohort of paediatric patients with covid-19 and their distinctive clinical features published work about adult patients has shown that manifestations vary strikingly by individual since children are different from adults in many aspects such as immunological development we aimed to investigate the clinical and epidemiological features of paediatric patients with covid-19
added value of this study
between jan 17 and march 1 2020 661 cases of covid-19 were reported in ningbo and wenzhou zhejiang province china of these cases 36 were in children all children with covid-19 had been infected either by close contact with adults infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 or by exposure to the epidemic area although fever cough and pneumonia were the most common signs about half the children had mild disease with no presenting symptoms fewer children with covid-19 had obvious symptoms compared with adult patients with covid-19 and paediatric patients with h1n1 influenza described in previous studies
implications of all the available evidence
by contrast with findings in adults children with covid-19 had milder clinical manifestations nearly half of paediatric patients were asymptomatic ie no fever and no cough this asymptomatic condition is relevant if community-acquired transmission becomes the primary mode identification of paediatric patients without presenting symptoms will become a great challenge fortunately the number of children infected with sars-cov-2 accounted for a small proportion of total people infected and paediatric patients also had clear epidemiological information devising measures to protect children from infection with sars-cov-2 is very important
 ningbo and wenzhou are two cities in zhejiang province located 900 km east of wuhan on jan 17 2020 the first covid-19 case was reported in wenzhou up to march 1 2020 661 cases of covid-19 had been reported in ningbo and wenzhou of which 36 were in children we aimed to describe the epidemiological and clinical features of these paediatric patients information that is urgently needed for prevention and treatment of covid-19 in children we did an observational cohort study at three hospitals in zhejiang province china ningbo women and childrens hospital the third affiliated hospital of wenzhou medical university and wenzhou central hospital of wenzhou we included all paediatric patients aged 016 years with laboratory confirmed covid-19 the diagnosis of covid-19 was based on guidelines issued by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china13 we screened all patients who had cough fever and radiographic presentation at the initial assessment or who underwent epidemiological investigation because of a history of exposure to epidemic areas or close contact with an infected individual we confirmed sars-cov-2 infection by rt-pcr of samples taken from upper nasopharyngeal swabs epidemiological investigation was focused on the route of transmission and we assessed travel history residence in epidemic areas and close contact with patients with confirmed covid-19 within 14 days this study was approved by the ethics committee of ningbo women and childrens hospital and followed the declaration of helsinki written consent was obtained from the guardians of the patients sample collection rt-pcr and interpretation of results was done as previously described14 two sets of primers were used for two target genes ie open reading frame 1ab orf1ab and nucleocapsid protein n according to the protocol issued by the national institute for viral disease control and prevention in china panel 1

 showed that paediatric patients had a significantly lower prevalence of abnormal values of several variables indicating disease severity such as fever 36 for children and 86 for adults cough 19 and 62 pneumonia 53 and 95 elevated c-reactive protein 3 and 49 and severe disease type 0 and 23 p00001 for all features nevertheless no differences were noted between children and adults in prevalence of leucopenia lymphopenia and elevated myocardial enzymes when compared with children with sars paediatric patients with covid-19 had much milder disease in terms of the prevalence of fever cough pneumonia and severe case type compared with children with h1n1 influenza paediatric patients with covid-19 had fewer upper respiratory symptoms eg cough and pharyngeal congestion but pneumonia was more frequent notably when the three groups of patients with coronavirus infections were compared with the paediatric patients with h1n1 influenza the most striking difference was that patients with h1n1 influenza had a much higher prevalence of pharyngeal congestion and a lower prevalence of pneumonia sars-cov-2 is an emerging contagious pathogen causing a high prevalence of pneumonia in infected individuals understanding the clinical features in paediatric patients is important for diagnosis and effective treatment of this illness the findings of our study show that the main clinical features of covid-19 in children were fever dry cough and pneumonia paediatric patients acquired covid-19 by clear transmission routes including close contact with family members a history of exposure to epidemic areas or both of these no other sources such as a hospital stay or unclear routes of transmission were identified this transmission feature means that identification of these paediatric patients was straightforward however previous work has shown that potential transmission routes of sars-cov-2 can be highly variable20 compared with mers coronavirus which is less transmissible11 this situation could be altered if covid-19 persists for a long time in an area with increased risk for community-acquired infections among the paediatric patients in our study just under a third were asymptomatic moreover a fifth had pneumonia only and needed radiographic examination to be identified symptoms seen on admission were variable including cough and fever all asymptomatic patients and children who did not present with pneumonia needed laboratory and radiographic examinations for diagnosis the large proportion of children with asymptomatic sars-cov-2 infection contrasts with paediatric patients with h1n1 influenza19 and sars10 and adult patients with covid-1917 in terms of presenting symptoms such as cough and pharyngeal congestion table 3 indicating sars-cov-2 has little effect on the upper respiratory tract of children covid-19 is highly transmissible similar to sars and h1n1 influenza but can have a covert presentation in children pneumonia is the leading infectious cause of death in children younger than 5 years21 although covid-19 in children seemed to be mild in term of presenting symptoms the prevalence of pneumonia with covid-19 53 was higher than with h1n1 influenza 11 but very similar to the prevalence with sars 6518 a striking characteristic of covid-19 is that it affects several vital organs eg lungs and heart as shown by increased amounts of myocardial enzymes even though all children with covid-19 had the mild or moderate clinical type table 3 with high mortality in adult patients with covid-19 in epidemic areas6 eg 4 mortality in wuhan paediatric patients should continue to be monitored after discharge from hospital compared with adults children rarely have comorbidities such as hypertension cardiovascular disease and diabetes paediatric patients in our study had a lower prevalence of pneumonia and symptoms such as fever cough and dyspnoea compared with adult patients with covid-19 table 3 however in our study the prevalence of leucopenia lymphopenia and increased myocardial enzymes in children with covid-19 was similar to that in adults notably adults have a much higher prevalence of increased c-reactive protein than do children suggesting a much milder immunological response in children and less immune damage22 except for antiviral drugs no special treatments eg glucocorticoid therapy and invasive mechanical ventilation were administered and few children needed inhaled oxygen taking all these findings into consideration the presentation of covid-19 in paediatric patients is much milder than in adults it is noteworthy that few patients with coronavirus disease ie covid-19 and sars have pharyngeal congestion or sore throat which contrasts with patients with h1n1 influenza despite the high prevalence of cough and fever in all patients pharyngeal congestion is more like an upper respiratory symptom than is fever which is a systemic symptom and cough which can also be induced by a lower respiratory infection the findings of our study also showed that although all paediatric cases were mild or moderate the number of days spent in hospital and time needed for these patients to have negative pcr results was still considerable table 1 figure 2 the time to achieve a negative pcr result seemed to be unaffected by severity of disease in terms of symptoms and the presence of pneumonia and treatment choices nevertheless fever resolved faster in mild cases than in moderate cases figure 2 considering that delayed clearance of viral rna in patients stools is a potential risk for transmission23 particularly in patients in rehabilitation the reliability of viral rna-negative criteria in asymptomatic patients in the long run needs further investigation the major limitation of our study was the small sample size however most results were consistent within the study and with several case reports on children with covid-19 we believe our conclusions are valid since covid-19 is spreading in more countries and has become an urgent public health event we present an early report on paediatric patients and expect additional data to improve our findings in conclusion our study shows that paediatric patients with covid-19 have a simple transmission mode either by close contact with infected adults or by exposure to epidemic areas although fever dry cough and mild pneumonia are common manifestations nearly half of patients have neither obvious symptoms nor abnormal radiological findings the proportion of asymptomatic cases indicates the difficulty in identifying paediatric patients without clear epidemiological information this finding suggests a dangerous situation if community-acquired infections occur  chest ct findings in cases from the cruise ship diamond princess with coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 shohei inui akira fujikawa motoyuki jitsu naoaki kunishima sadahiro watanabe yuhi suzuki satoshi umeda yasuhide uwabe   the respiratory infection caused by a new strain of coronavirus not previously identified in humans sars-cov-2 has received the name of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 1 originally reported in december 2019 as pneumonia of unknown cause in wuhan city hubei province china covid-19 has spread rapidly and progressively to other regions of china as well as adjacent asian countries 2 the international health regulations emergency committee of the world health organization officially declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on january 30 2020 and the disease was declared pandemic on march 11 2020 recently the international cruise ship diamond princess carrying about 3700 passengers temporarily became the largest cluster of covid-19 cases outside china 3 the cruise ship docked at yokohama bay japan on february 3 2020 and after quarantine passengers started to disembark on february 14 2020 the ministry of health labor and welfare from japan reported that of the 1723 national passengers a cumulative number of 454 cases were recognized as pathogen carriers on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr including 189 asymptomatic cases who initially tested negative on february 17 2020 during and after the quarantine period passengers and crew members were referred to the japan self-defense forces central hospital by the government the clinical course and spectrum of radiological patterns seen in covid-19 have gradually become apparent with recent publications however most publications have been focused on symptomatic cases occurring in china 9 13 15-19 this prompted us to undertake the present study to retrospectively evaluate the computed tomographic ct findings in laboratory-confirmed cases of covid-19 conveniently sampled from the passengers and crew members of the diamond princess cruise ship in japan we specifically compared the radiological findings of covid-19 infection between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases this study was approved by the institutional ethics review board and written informed consent was obtained from all cases in this retrospective study the medical records were reviewed for clinical and imaging findings of cases diagnosed with covid-19 from february 7th to 28th 2020 passengers and crew members of the diamond princess cruise ship underwent rt-pcr during the quarantine period and those who showed positive results were transferred to hospitals in japan among all rt-pcr positive cases from the cruise ship asymptomatic mildly symptomatic or familial clusters with infection among relatives were admitted to the japan self-defense forces central hospital tokyo japan for further investigation consecutive cases from this single-center cohort who had confirmed covid-19 infection and underwent chest ct were included those who showed negative results on rt-pcr underwent repeat rt-pcr examination on admission all cases underwent chest ct irrespective of the rt-pcr results based on the following grounds 1 a previous report describing positive ct findings in cases with rt-pcr positive status without symptoms 4 5 2 previous reports of person-to-person transmission from asymptomatic cases 6-8 and 3 the need to judge the precaution level necessary on admission to prevent nosocomial infection in the hospital based on our previous experience ct parameters were optimized to minimize patient exposure to radiation as detailed below the following data were extracted from the medical records demographic data medical history presence or absence of underlying comorbidities symptoms and signs cases were classified as symptomatic if they had any signs or symptoms of pneumonia including fever 375 cough dyspnea and fatigue on admission otherwise cases were classified as asymptomatic non-enhanced chest ct was performed using a 6-row multi-detector ct unit somatom emotion 6 scanner siemens tokyo japan on admission with the following parameters tube voltage 130 kvp effective current 95 ma collimation 62 mm helical pitch 14 acquisition parameters were modified to minimize patient radiation exposure while maintaining sufficient resolution for chest ct evaluation based on measurements of the dosimetry phantom diameter 32 cm length 35 cm under automatic exposure control care dose4d siemens tokyo japan the radiation exposure of each subject was estimated to be less than 28 msv ct images were acquired during a single inspiratory breath-hold to minimize motion artifacts a 20-mm gapless section was reconstructed before being reviewed on the picture archiving and communication system pacs monitor image analysis was performed independently by three chest radiologists a f m j and si with 31 19 and 6 years of experience respectively who were blinded to the clinical data followed by joint consensus the chest ct findings were recorded based on the fleischner society glossary of terms 9-12 parameters evaluated included the presence or absence of ground-glass opacity ggo consolidation intra- or interlobular septal thickening linear opacities including subpleural curvilinear opacities and reversed halo sign according to the proportion of each pattern in comparison with the totality of the lung opacification cases were classified as ggo dominant or consolidation dominant if the proportion of each one of the patterns was respectively greater than 50 of the total 13 zonal distribution patterns of the lesion were visually classified as peripheral predominant involving mainly the peripheral one-third of the lung central or peribronchovascular predominant or mixed without predilection for subpleural or central region 14 the number of lobes involved and laterality of lung abnormalities were determined a semi-quantitative scoring system was used to quantitatively estimate the pulmonary involvement of all these abnormalities on the basis of the percentage of the total lung involved per lobe 9 15 the extension of the lung opacification was visually scored from 0 to 5 as follows score 1 1-5 involvement score 2 6-25 involvement score 3 26-50 involvement score 4 51-75 involvement score 5 76-100 involvement total lung scores were calculated as the sum of individual lobe scores the presence or absence of pleural effusion thoracic lymphadenopathy as defined by lymph node size of  10mm in short-axis dimension airway abnormalities ie airway wall thickening bronchiectasis and endoluminal secretions and any underlying lung disease including emphysema or fibrosis was also recorded statistical analysis was done using the spss 110 statistical software program dr spss ii for windows standard version 110 spss inc chicago il usa quantitative variables were expressed as meanstandard deviation range and the categorical variables were presented as the percentage of the total the comparisons of categorical data were evaluated using pearson 2 test and non-paired quantitative data using the mann-whitney u test according to the normal distribution assessed by the shapiro-wilk test statistical significance level was set at p 005 demographics and clinical characteristics of the study population are summarized in table 1 the study population comprised 104 cases 54 men mean age 60 years  17 range 31-87 50 women 63 years  15 range 25-93 of these cases 76 73 were asymptomatic and 28 27 cases were symptomatic the most frequent symptoms on admission were cough 20 19 cases fever 11 11 cases and fatigue 10 10 cases the frequencies of the major chest ct findings of all cases are summarized in table 2 abnormal lung opacities ggo andor consolidation and airway abnormalities bronchiectasis andor bronchial wall thickening were present in 63 61 and 29 28 of the whole cohort respectively lung opacities on ct were found in 41 54 of 76 asymptomatic twenty-two 79 of 28 symptomatic cases had abnormal ct findings consistent with viral pneumonia comparing the two groups symptomatic cases showed lung parenchymal and airway abnormalities on ct more frequently than did asymptomatic cases symptomatic vs asymptomatic lung opacity 22 79 vs 41 54 p0023 airway lesion 14 50 vs 15 20 p0002 no significant differences in age sex distribution or comorbidities were identified between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases representative ct patterns of asymptomatic cases are shown in figures 1-3 ct patterns were compared between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases who had positive lung parenchymal ct findings the results are summarized in table 3 of 41 asymptomatic cases with lung opacities on ct 17 41 cases had pure ggo 7 17 ggo with intra- and interlobular septal thickening without consolidation and 17 41 ggo with consolidation of 22 symptomatic cases who had lung opacities on ct 5 23 cases had pure ggo 4 18 ggo with intra- and interlobular septal thickening and without consolidation and 13 59 ggo with consolidation in terms of the predominance of the lung parenchymal findings asymptomatic cases showed ggo predominance over consolidation while symptomatic cases were more likely to show consolidation predominance over ggo asymptomatic vs symptomatic cases ggo predominance 34 83 vs 13 59 consolidation predominance 7 17 vs 9 41 p0038 in terms of the number of lesions asymptomatic cases had a single lesion in 9 22 and more than 2 in 32 78 cases compared to symptomatic cases who had a single lesion in 4 18 and more than 2 in 18 82 cases in terms of the axial distribution more than half of the cases in each group showed a peripheral dominant distribution 24 59 asymptomatic vs 11 50 symptomatic cases on the other hand only asymptomatic cases 4 10 cases showed a central dominant distribution with single or multiple rounded ggo in one or multiple lobes symptomatic cases were more likely to show a mixed distribution coexisting peripheral and central distribution than asymptomatic cases 11 50 symptomatic vs 13 32 asymptomatic cases in both groups the lower lobes were the most frequently affected left and right lower lobe involvement were present in 17 77 and 17 77 of symptomatic cases and in 29 71 and 29 71 of asymptomatic cases in addition more than 2 lung lobes were affected in more than 75 of cases and bilateral lungs in more than 80 in both clinical groups the ct severity score was significantly higher in symptomatic cases than asymptomatic cases in the right and left lower lobes and overall lung symptomatic vs asymptomatic cases right lower lobe 2  1 0-4 vs 1  1 0-4 p0048 left lower lobe 2  1 0-4 vs 1  1 0-3 p0019 total lung score 7  5 1-17 vs 4  2 1-11 p0025  airway abnormalities included dilated bronchi in association with ggo or consolidation ie as air bronchograms without airway secretions cavitation thoracic lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion were not observed in this study we investigated the chest ct findings in laboratory-confirmed covid-19 cases in an environmentally homogenous cohort of cruise ship passengers and crew members comparing the ct characteristics of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases although lung parenchymal and airway abnormalities were more frequent in symptomatically than asymptomatic cases noticeably we found lung parenchymal changes on ct in up to 54 of the asymptomatic cases in those who showed ct abnormalities asymptomatic cases showed significantly predominance of ggo while consolidation was predominant in symptomatic cases similarly the ct severity score was significantly higher in symptomatic cases than asymptomatic cases in both lower lobes and on total lung assessment although various ct findings were observed in cases with covid-19 we found several common characteristic ct patterns such as 1 single or multiple half-round or rectangular-shaped ggo in subpleural area with or without intra- or interlobular septal thickening figure 1 2 single or multiple rounded ggo in both peribronchial and subpleural areas figure 2 3 bilateral diffuse or multiple patchy ggo with or without intra- or interlobular septal thickening or consolidation in both peribronchial and subpleural areas with a lower lobe predilection figure3 dilated bronchi were frequently associated with all of these ct patterns these observations are mostly consistent with those of previous studies from china 9 13 15-19 all of the above-described characteristic ct patterns were found in both groups however differences were observed in the extension of the lung involvement as calculated by the mean ct severity score the maximum total lung ct score was 11 in asymptomatic cases and 17 in symptomatic cases in addition the predominance of opacities also differed between the two groups ggo was predominant in asymptomatic cases whereas consolidation was predominant in symptomatic cases some studies have reported clinical-radiological dissociation in covid-19 20 for instance several previous reports described asymptomatic cases who had evidence of lung opacities on chest ct 4 5 13 these observations have been confirmed by the results of the present study highlighting the relative high prevalence of ct abnormalities even in asymptomatic cases the presence of the subclinical ct findings in covid-19 is an enigma to the best of our knowledge such cases with subclinical ct abnormalities have not been reported in either middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov or severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov infection several hypotheses could explain this discrepancy one possibility is that these cases have developed immunity against sars-cov-2 due to re-infection leading to subclinical presentation such a case of relapse was reported from china and a suspected case of re-infection from japan 21 22 other possibilities are that such cases are still in the healing phase of covid-19 and the symptoms may have already subsided by the time of admission and ct scan however the lack of typical characteristic of the healing stage of covid-19 pneumonia have not been frequently observed eg perilobular pattern weakening this hypothesis 9 19 other possibilities include a discrepancy between the timing of ct positivity and clinical symptoms like in other types of pneumonia the clinical-radiological dissociation noted in many of covid-19 cases in this cohort is a conundrum that still needs further investigation rt-pcr is currently considered as the gold standard diagnostic method for covid-19 however the sensitivity of this method in throat swabs in covid-19 is around 59 23 to date in several studies the sensitivity of chest ct has exceeded that of rt-pcr and the authors emphasized the potential of chest ct as the primary screening tool for covid-19 24 25 the sensitivity of chest ct is unquestionable and encouraged for cases where there is need to determine the extension of disease and alternative diagnoses the results of this study however do not directly allow the conclusion that all persons with positive rt-pcr findings should undergo chest ct for screening purposes before arriving at any such conclusion the bioactivity and clinical impact of asymptomatic ct findings in covid-19 infection will have to be investigated one important issue is the need to distinguish the natural history of symptomatic and asymptomatic covid-19 cases presenting with ct abnormalities including the potential for infectivity and progression to acute severe respiratory distress more appropriate use of ct will be possible when this information becomes available this study has various limitations first it included only adult cases second because it included only passengers and crew members of a cruise ship we acknowledge a selection bias however this environmentally homogeneous cohort enabled an investigation that eliminates other potential geographic confounders in conclusion this study documented a high incidence of subclinical ct changes in covid-19 asymptomatic cases showed more ggo over consolidation and milder extension of lung parenchymal opacities further studies still are warranted to uncover the underlying mechanism responsible for the clinical-radiological dissociation seen in some of asymptomatic covid-19 cases as well as to determine the impact of these findings on clinical decision-making  clinical characteristics of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with mild covid-19 g-u kim m-j kim sh ra j lee s bae j jung s-h kim   in south korea the largest cluster of cases related to the religious group shincheonji was recognized in daegu city from 12 february 2020 1 korean epidemiological teams meticulously sought out the close contacts of this religious group and performed extensive laboratory tests for sars-cov-2 in all the identified close contacts as a result 3081 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 were confirmed in daegu city alone as of 2 march 2020 approximately 70 of whom were related to this religious group 1 as a result of the sharp increase in the number of patients with covid-19 in daegu the korean government decided to admit those without moderate-to-severe illness or risk factors for poor prognosis to a non-hospital facility for isolation and monitoring this policy provided a unique chance to assess the prevalence of asymptomatic individuals in this outbreak and to characterize the symptoms of people with mild covid-19 as of 2 march 2020 a total of 19 636 diagnostic tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 had been performed in the daegu area 2 of these tests 12 947 66 were performed in the general population in daegu city and 6689 34 were performed in those related to the shincheonji church of the latter about 60 had positive results 2 as such a total of 3081 individuals were diagnosed in the daegu area almost 70 21363081 of whom were related to the religious group 2 these 3081 individuals with confirmed covid-19 were isolated in hospitals and community isolation facilities depending on their risk assessment among 17 community isolation facilities our facility housed 260 individuals the korean government and daegu local government allocated individuals with mild covid-19 to dedicated isolation facilities and the remaining individuals with moderate-to-severe covid-19 early warning score for sars-cov-2 infection patients 4 or those with high risk to hospitals 3 the high-risk factors for covid-19 were as follows a 65 years b chronic underlying diseases eg diabetes mellitus chronic renal failure chronic liver disease chronic lung disease chronic cardiovascular disease c haematological malignancy and d those receiving chemotherapy or immunosuppressive agents regardless of their symptoms all confirmed patients were isolated in hospitals or isolation facilities according to their risk assessment we conducted a questionnaire survey from 12 to 16 march 2020 in a community facility designated for the isolation of individuals with covid-19 this facility is located approximately 50 miles from daegu city diagnosis of covid-19 was based on the results of real-time rt-pcr allplex 2019-ncov assay kit seegene seoul south korea for sars-cov-2 e gene rdrp gene and n gene using nasopharyngeal swab samples as authorized by the korean government written informed consent was obtained from each participant who agreed to participate in this questionnaire study missing data were acquired with telephone interviews by trained doctors the study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of asan medical centre seoul korea of the 260 pcr-confirmed individuals with covid-19 213 819 participated in this study of them 41 192 95 ci 145251 had remained asymptomatic until admission in the remaining 172 individuals the median duration from the first symptom to laboratory confirmation was 14 days interquartile range 817 and the median duration from laboratory confirmation to admission was 3 days interquartile range 36 cough 401 69172 was the most common symptom followed by sputum 395 68172 hyposmia 395 68172 and nasal congestion 343 59172 of the 68 individuals with hyposmia 61 90 had accompanying symptoms such as hypogeusia nasal congestion or rhinorrhea fever 375c was noted in only 20 116 individuals the detailed clinical characteristics of the symptomatic patients are shown in table 1
and see supplementary material fig s1 and table s1 see supplementary material shows the distribution of the symptoms according to different time-points ie symptom onset at diagnosis at admission the presence of asymptomatic cases of covid-19 was noted in early reports on the outbreak 45 and a large study on 72 314 chinese patients reported that 1 were asymptomatic 6 however the majority of those cases were included from hubei province where the sudden shortage of health-care resources may have resulted in selection bias towards the exclusion of those with mild symptoms therefore the actual prevalence of asymptomatic cases of covid-19 could not be determined we found that as much as one-fifth of individuals with covid-19 had remained asymptomatic from potential exposure to laboratory confirmation and facility admission hence our data fill an important gap concerning the prevalence of asymptomatic individuals who constitute the base of the disease pyramid 7 previous studies reported that viable sars-cov-2 was isolated from asymptomatic individuals and that certain groups of infections had been transmitted from asymptomatic patients 8 9 10 therefore the notably high proportion of asymptomatic individuals in our data further supports the value of social distancing for the control of the current pandemic until a vaccine becomes available separating individuals with suspected covid-19 from other patients in outpatient clinics is critical for preventing a potential outbreak in the health-care setting therefore it is important to delineate the epidemiological risk factors and clinical features of covid-19 furthermore the pandemic spread of sars-cov-2 may weaken the role of epidemiological risk factors and clinical features of covid-19 will become more important for screening however there are limited data on the symptoms of individuals with mild covid-19 a recent chinese study on 13 individuals with mild covid-19 reported that nasal congestion 62 was the most common symptom 11 in our 172 individuals the most common symptom was cough followed by hyposmia and sputum while fever 375c was only observed in 116 interestingly hyposmia was quite frequent among individuals with mild covid-19 although hyposmia is caused by postviral olfactory dysfunction 12 further studies are needed for the specificity of this symptom in covid-19 in addition pathophysiological studies are needed to determine whether this unique symptom is associated with nasal congestion dysfunction of the olfactory nerve due to sars-cov-2 or other co-morbidities this study has several limitations first the study population shows a dominance of young age and female sex which is largely due to the fact that most individuals were associated with a single religious group therefore the results of this study may not be directly applicable to older populations or to males nevertheless this is the largest study to date on the prevalence of asymptomatic patients and the detailed clinical symptoms in individuals with mild covid-19 second the study design has inherent recall bias however the study participants were well educated and cooperative so this bias may not have substantially affected our main findings third we did not compare the symptoms of individuals with covid-19 from those of patients with other respiratory viral infections so further studies are needed on whether some dominant symptoms such as hyposmia are helpful to differentiate individuals with covid-19 from those with other respiratory viral illnesses fourth we did not perform other diagnostic tests to rule out the presence of co-infections as a result some of the symptoms presented in the study population might be associated with co-infections a recent study reported that 20 of individuals with covid-19 in northern california had one or more respiratory pathogens including rhinovirus respiratory syncytial virus human coronavirus and influenza virus 13 therefore our findings on the symptoms of individuals with mild covid-19 should be considered with caution finally some selection bias may have been introduced in this survey-based study considering that approximately 18 of patients at the isolation facility did not participate in the study in conclusion approximately one-fifth of individuals with mild covid-19 were asymptomatic at admission and the most common symptoms of mild covid-19 were cough with or without hyposmia and sputum further research on the contribution of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals to the community spread of covid-19 is essential

simulation of control strategies harishankar prabhakaran  the coronavirus disease 2019 is spreading throughout the world and all healthcare systems are loaded beyond its capacity the virus is named as sars-cov-2 in this situation rational decisions need to be made on how the care is provided for patients with covid-19 the incidence report general symptoms and readily available testing kits different control strategies the basic compartmental model and some of the current research on the epidemiology of the disease are discussed and previously published models are reviewed modeling this disease helps in understanding the spread and predict its future to evaluate different control strategies social distancing contact tracing and hospitalization compartmental modeling framework is used in this work the non-linear equations are formulated and fitted to the cumulative case and mortality data analytical analysis along with uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis is performed and the conditions to achieve disease free equilibrium is evaluated finally different control strategies are simulated to show their importance this paper aims to shows the advantage of mathematical modeling and their simulations in times like now during which the covid-19 spreading like wildfire it also includes pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in the modeling the simulations are performed for the model fit to cumulative case and mortality data in the united states of america the reproduction number is found to be 271914  medrxiv preprint hands should be cleaned with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water our hands mostly touch different surfaces when we go out virus sticks to ones hands and can infect us therefore it is important to wash our hands regularly to prevent the infection elderly people are affected the most compared to the young population mortality rate for people in 75 to 84 years is in the range of 4-10 and the rate goes up to an average 20 for people who are more than 85 years old 22 4  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity which was not certified by peer review  this paper is an effort to model the epidemiology and stop the spread of the novel coronavirus which is causing huge detrimental effects all around the world the ultimate goal is to slow the spread of the virus using evidence based public health interventions which includes early case recognition isolation and contact tracing this disease has grown from being a small cluster of pneumonia in china to a global pandemic causing huge loss of life therefore there is a huge need for modeling the disease and simulation of various control strategy implementation is necessary to make well informed decisions incidence is the number of new cases of coronavirus in a particular population in a period of time in general incidence is reported for each countrys population the table below gives the incidence of all the country that has been affected majorly 27 april 2020 1 the incidence per 1million calculated in the table gives a better picture than the number of cases on how the country is affected for example by comparing india and singapore india has twice the number of cases than in singapore and it does not mean that india more is affected the incidence per 1 million for singapore is more than 100 time to that of indias it is because the population of singapore is far less than india the death per 1million data also gives the information on how each country is handling the infected cases among all the countries spain is in a very bad state with a mortality rate of 1116 the united states of america has the most number of cases 12 million as of may 8th 2020 and has more than 75000 deaths the coronavirus spreads mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets from an infected person via coughs or sneezes these droplets can go into people who are nearby it spreads when people are near to each other the droplets do not hang around in the air and can not go more than six feet from the source about two meters covid-19 spreads sustainably in a community in many affected regions people are getting infected with the virus mostly without knowing where they are infected people also get infected when they come in contact with an infected surface and then touches their eyes or face symptoms for covid-19 is not constant and ranges from mild disease to severe illness symptoms usually appears 14 days after being exposed to the virus major indications of covid-19 are cough shortness of breath or difficulty breathing fever chills muscle pain sore throat new loss of taste or smell 2  medical attention should be sought immediately if the following symptoms are noticed trouble breathing persistent pain or pressure in the chest new confusion or inability to arouse bluish lips or face 2  with the restricted availability of testing kits not everyone is eligible for being tested if it only causes mild illness people are asked to recover at their home itself decisions on who to be tested are made by health departments and healthcare providers by the end of april a viral test has been authorized by the us food and drug administration fda that lets people to collect a respiratory sample a swab inside of the nose at home and send it to a laboratory for analysis in most areas the collection kits were made available via healthcare workers 3   things to do to implement social distancing avoid contact with people who could be at risk avoid public places gathering and crowds avoid clinics and hospitals and avoid restaurants it is every individuals responsibility to prevent this virus from spreading and social distancing is a way collective effort in stopping the spread of this disease in case of 3 emergencies in which we can not avoid going to different places one should maintain at least a distance of 6 feet from one another contact tracing is carried out by a public health staff they get data from the patients with coronavirus to help everyone they have had contacted during the previous weeks while they were infectious the identity of the patient is not revealed for their privacy traced individuals are given information on the risk of being infected and are asked to separate themselves from other susceptible people and check for symptoms and illness they are asked to monitor their body temperature twice a day and if they have symptoms they should isolate themselves and report to a health care worker hospitalization or isolation is the process of separating the sick people from the non sick ones with a steady rise in new cases of coronavirus hospitals are working at maximum capacity and infected individuals are admitted only when they show severe symptoms or have extreme illness temporary medical clinics can be setup in areas where most infections occur can reduce the spread of the disease quarantines are used by governments to prevent the spread of the virus it is especially for individuals have no symptoms but were exposed to the sickness it is important to keep them separated from susceptible people so that they dont infect others without their knowledge quarantines are used during an outbreak or an epidemic or during a pandemic it has been debated whether masks are effective or not the truth is that it works the effect of face masks is illustrated very clearly in the paper to mask or not to mask 14  both hands should be cleaned before wearing the mask there should be no gaps between ones face and the mask never touch the mask and discard them in a closed bin quickly once they are damp masks are effective only if the hands are washed properly and the used masks are disposed properly individuals with medical conditions like heartlung disease or diabetes are at a greater risk for developing serious illness due to the disease 4  people who are most affected are ones with the following conditions asthma immunocompromised conditions severe obesity chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis and liver diseases the kermack-mckendrick model 5 is a sir epidemiological model it explains the rapid rise and fall in the number of infected cases reported in an epidemic the model assumes that there is no change in the total population size ie no vital dynamics and deaths due to disease and that there is no incubation period the model has three nonlinear odes where s is the number of susceptible people i is the number of infected people r is the number of recovered people who gained immunity  is the infection rate and  is the recovery rate the reproduction number of this model is was called as epidemiological threshold to control the disease outbreak r 0 should be less than 1 this basic model structure first published in 1927 have been developed into many complex epidemiological models over a century and currently there are thousands of published models this paper also uses the same type of modeling methodology as there are many uncertainties in hoe the corona-virus is spreading there is is a huge need for modeling the spread of the disease many papers are being published once the pandemic began the most predominant modeling papers are discussed here a mathematical model for simulating the transmission of wuhan novel coronavirus 6 is a different paper than other modeling papers being published they have developed a bats-hosts-reservoir-people transmission network model they have simplified their model as reservoir-people transmission network it is a brief paper with the modeling framework the nonlinear equations and the first generation method derivation for the reproduction number  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity a mathematical model for the novel coronavirus epidemic in wuhan china 7  the model is a basic seir compartments with a v compartmentconcentration of the coronavirus in the environmental reservoir at the end the model also includes the vital dynamics of the population they got a high reproduction number estimate of 425 the inclusion of the vital dynamics in the model seems to have increased the ability of the disease to spread more it is also noticeable that they have modeled three different transmission rate for every class that can be infectious the paper is concentrated towards wuhan and therefore the dynamics vary a little from other modeling papers report 9 impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions npis to reduce covid19 mortality and healthcare demand 16 this report is a very important because many policies in the uk and other countries are made based on it it discusses about various non-pharmaceutical interventions that are aimed at reducing contact rates in the population and the conclusion was that no intervention can impact the contact rate if they are implemented separately all interventions should be implemented to achieve a synergistic effect forecasting the impact of the first wave of the covid-19 1 pandemic on hospital demand and deaths for the usa and 2 european economic area countries 8  this paper used data identification tools and statistical modeling to model the disease they have predicted a huge demand for hospital and icu bed-days and their estimation of the number of deaths of around 1584737 in usa from the first wave of seems unlikely this gives us an idea on how compartmental modeling is better than statistical data analysis for epidemiological models flattening the curve before it flattens us hospital critical care capacity limits and mortality from novel coronavirus sars-cov2 cases in us counties 9  this paper concentrates on the relation between available critical care and deaths that occurs when critical care bed limits are exceeded they have devised for 4 critical care surge response scenarios their concern is that the mortality data does not include normal patients with injury who could not get treated due to suddenly overloaded healthcare system to mask or not to mask modeling the potential for face maskuse by the general public to curtail the covid-19 pandemic 14  this paper considers the importance of face mask in the prevention of the disease two models one with no mask use and the other with mask use and control strategies are created simulations are done in both these models and the results are compared it talks about inward efficiency prevention from catching the disease and outward efficiency preventing the transmission of the disease the model for the exponentially decaying infectious contact rate in this work is inspired from this paper the model is parameterized for the data for new york and washington they found that the usage of masks have a huge impact than what we already believed it to have a case study of the covid-19 coronavirus mathematical modeling of epidemic diseases 10  this paper deals with simple models but demonstrated the effects of various control strategies it begins with an

gets lifetime immunity and the other has re-susceptible factor in the model other simulations such as short lock down and healthcare system saturation is also presented refined compartmental models asymptomatic carriers and covid-19 11  this paper talks about the various possible compartmental models which can be used as the base model for the novel coronavirus a discussion on these models modified seir splitting the exposed group into different compartments and including asymptomatic population explains them well this paper is highly illustrative with many simulations construction of compartmental models for covid-19 with quarantine lockdown and vaccine interventions 12  many epidemiological models are formed and the dynamics are analysed they also explore the transmissibility of the viral infection during different control strategies like quarantine lock-downs and vaccinations the dynamics of coronavirus is simulated for the data in ghana it is interesting to see that the basic reproduction number is less than 1 and they expect that the disease will be gone in two to four months the graphical representation of the model framework used in this work is inspired from this paper modeling the spread of covid-19 with comsol multiphysics 13  comsol multiphysics is a virtual dynamical simulation software they have used the software to simulate the compartmental models with an aim to flatten the curve they have presented a basic seir model an a seir model with many sub-compartments of exposed and infectious class it is amazing how a physics simulation software can be used to simulate dynamics of epidemiology  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity

pre-symptomatic infectious symptomatic infectious asymptomatic infectious hospitalized-non icu hospitalized icuand recovered with the classes respectively denoted st et pt it at ht ct and rt in addition a cumulative death class is also included and is denoted as dt after the incubation period in exposed class they become infectious but they are pre-symptomatic for a period a part of them eventually become symptomatic and the others asymptomatic a fraction of detected infectious individuals by symptoms for it class by contact tracing for at class are moved to the hospitalized class non-icu ht where they are isolated from general public some fraction of hospitalized patients ultimately require critical care and they are moved to hospitalized icu class some fraction recover and some die in the classes it at ht and ct based on these assumptions the deterministic model for the transmission dynamics of covid-19 is given by the framework in figure 1  and the corresponding deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations is given below where n is the total population n  s  e  p  i  a  h  c  r all the parameters in the model is defined and a default value is estimated they are found by searching research literature official reports or by fitting the model to the available data t is the time dependent infectious contact rate which has a exponentially decreasing structure 14  the decrease is due to the prevention measures put into action by the 9  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted

from the beginning without delay because our initial condition  0 for the model is set to be on 01-march-2020 during when they started to implement preventive measures it decreases to  min as the time passes at the rate of r  min required to get to disease free equilibrium is calculated from conditions for the basic reproduction number the  min and r are fixed during the model fitting process  the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic carriers compared to symptomatic carriers and it is assumed that symptomatic individuals are 50 more infectious than the asymptomatic people 16  the value is set to 044  is the transition from exposed to pre-symptomatic class where 1  is the incubation period average 5 days 17 for coronavirus so the value of  is 1 5   p is the transition from pre-symptomatic to infectious class i or a calculated similar to  the period of stay in this class is an average 3 days this virus continues to spread across the country because we have asymptomatic transmitters and we have individuals who are transmitting 48 hours before they become symptomatic -cdc director 19  f is the fraction of pre-symptomatic individuals who eventually becomes asymptomatic there is a lot of uncertainty in this fraction 20  the average value is set to be 05  i h is the rate of hospitalization of symptomatic people the median interval from symptom onset to admission was 7 days interquartile range iqr  3-9 days 21  the percentage of hospitalization is 20 22  so  i h  1702  0028  a is the rate at which asymptotic individuals are detected using contact tracing and hospitalized it is the product of the percentage of contact-tracing execution and the rate of asymptomatic hospitalization contact tracing reduced the time taken to identify and isolate patients after onset of symptoms to 27 days 23  ct ia control variable varied in the simulations default ct is taken to be 01 therefore default  a is 12701  0037  h c is the rate of icu admission from hospitalization in a study by chen wang et al 25  of the patients hospitalised 32 required admission to an intensive care unit in another report from imperial college 24  they calculate bed demand numbers assuming a total duration of stay in hospital of 8 days if critical care is not required and 16 days with 10 days in icu if critical care is required with 30 of hospitalised cases requiring criticalcare they obtained an overall mean duration of hospitalisation of 104days slightly shorter than the duration from hospital admission to discharge observed for covid-19 cases internationally therefore if someone needs critical care on an average they stay in the hospital for 6 days before moving to icu so  h c  16032  00533 also  h  the recovery rate of hospitalized people for whom critical care is not required is 18 and  c  the recovery rate of hospitalized in need of icu is 19 26  both  i  the recovery rate of symptomatic individuals and  a  the recovery rate of asymptomatic individuals is on an average found to be 17 it is because on an average the people in these classes recover in 7 days  i  the death rate of symptomatic individuals it is found that the average duration between the onset of symptoms and death is 22 days 26  the mortality rate among the cases found is 34 28  so  i  1220034  000154  a is the death rate of the asymptomatic population is assumed to be half of  i 29 so  a   i  2  000077  h death rate hospitalized -non icu it is found that the average duration between hospitalization and death is 8 days 26  with the mortality rate of 34  h  180034  000425  c death rate hospitalized -icu it is found that the average duration between icu admission and death is 7 days 26  with the mortality rate of 34  h  170034  000485  cc-by-nc-nd 40

the model r 0  therefore in order to get the corona-virus to disease free equilibrium the r 0 given above should be less than 1 currently the  value is found to be approximately 05 therefore by using all the default values given in table 2  r 0 is found to be 271914 in the r 0 equation after taking  out as a common factor it has three parts summed up together which needs to be decreased in order to bring r 0 to be less than one the first part    p  is a constant term since both  and  p is fixed and can not be controlled using the default values this fraction is calculated to be 132  i h  i  i  with default values for the uncontrollable variables f  i and  i  the only controllable variable is  i h the rate of hospitalization of the symptomatic people to reduce the value of this whole fraction  i h needs to be increased by reducing the number of days it takes to admit individuals after symptom onset this can be implemented by increasing the number of temporary hospitalization facilities in places where the cases are increasing steadily and by increasing testing speed and availability if the maximum possible  i h 0033 is considered the second part is calculated to be 27846 the third part f cta h  a  a  with default values for the uncontrollable variables  f  a   a  and  a h  the only controllable variable is ct the percentage of contact tracing execution if ct is

implemented at full potential as presented in the report from the center of evidence based medicine 20  the percentage of people remaining asymptomatic varies drastically in many different case studies therefore analyzing uncertainty in f is important as seen in the figure 4  even 10 deviation of f from the default value causes a huge difference in the model simulation it is always better to expect the worst case scenario in situations like this and make decisions so that many lives can be saved it can also be observed that the actual data till 427 lies well within the range and the future data is expected to be within the limits till 0828 as shown in the simulations the infectiousness vary from person to person this factor is very sensitive and affects the predictions hugely

correlated all the parameters in the equation is positive therefore r 0 and  has a positive correlation when  is increased r 0 is also increased therefore to keep the reproduction number as low as

the correlation between r 0 and  i h all the parameters in the equation is positive therefore r 0 and  i h also has a negative correlation when  i h is increased r 0 decreases therefore to keep the reproduction number as low as possible the hospitalization rate should be be maintained as high as possible one key difference between isolation by contact tracing and hospitalization is that when people are traced they dont even know that they could be sick but for hospitalization a patient need to have a severe illness simulations of the epidemiological model is performed in matlab the differential equations are solved using the function called ode45 which solves non-stiff differential equations using medium order method the sample code is given in the appendix for reference three control strategies social distancing contact tracing asymptotic population and increasing hospitalization rate are simulated and the parameters responsible for implementing these strategies are varied and plotted together to analyze and compare these kind of simulations helps in making decisions during a pandemic strict rules on social distancing should be implemented and followed to prevent the spread of the disease the simulation in figure 6 shows that if strategies to increase social distancing are implemented that is reducing  the number of new cases can be reduced and the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is quicker the number of estimated deaths also decreases by a significant amount in the order of 10 5  two new conditions with   1 and   05 are simulated along with previously simulated model and the plots are shown in figure 6 for comparison the time taken to reach reasonably low number of cases is reduced by at least two weeks considering that the control measures are implemented continuously the best possible time to remove social distancing without getting the disease back again would be by early august of 2020  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made

many groups of people who are affected financially and with the government stuggling to handle the economy the social distancing control measure is expected to be stopped in may2020 bringing a lot of concern on how to stop the spread the plot of simulations in 7 shows what will be the situation if that happens say from 0520 the number of cases will start to rise again this eventually will force us to maintain social distancing again therefore there will be a bigger peak in the number of reported cases and it will take 5 more months to get out of this situation the number of deaths will also increase as it takes longer to stop the spread of the disease  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the

number of cases will start to rise again this eventually will force us to maintain social distancing again even though the peak in the number of reported cases is not increased more than what was already reached it will take more than 8-9 months to get out of this situation this shows us how important social distancing is  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 18 2020  distancing at all after 0609 the simulation is frightening as the number of cases goes upto 40 million the majority of new infections are created by infected people who is showing no symptoms they can either be totally asymptomatic or presymptomatic to reduce the spread through them contact tracing should be implemented it is done by finding about all the people who were contacted by symptomatic individuals in the last two weeks if they are tested to be positive of the disease then they are hospitalised it is also possible that the person traced was the one actually who got infected when they got in contact with this symptomatic person either way contact tracing is a way to find and isolate people who could potentially carry the virus around and causing new infections this process of isolating those who could potentially carry the disease around is not executed at full potential because not everyone who are exposed or asymptomatic can be found out by tracing previous contacts the simulations in figure 10 shows the predictions for two new values for the percentage of contact tracing implementation  ct  03 and ct  07 along with the default value of 01 there is significant reduction in the number of cases over the month of may and after it can also be seen that the number of recorded death estimate increases this is because the people who will die from this disease without knowing they had the disease are now found and tested using contact tracing and their deaths are recorded hospitals are struggling to handle the load of new cases therefore it is reasonable to increase the number of temporary facilities and in many areas as possible this will reduce the time taken from symptom onset to hospital admission and thus the hospitalization increases  i h is increased in the simulations as shown in figure 11  two new rates - i h  004 in which takes 5 days to hospitalize someone and  i h  005 in which takes 4 days to hospitalize someone are simulated it can be seen that there is a decrease in the number of reported case estimate increasing  i h did not impact the number of cumulative deaths very much as seen in the simulations below from the simulations of the three control strategies social distancing seems to have a bigger reduction in the number of diagnosed cases no single control meothod will give the best result it is only when all the control strategies are implemented the considerable change is seen a good compartmental framework of the model is designed by including all major classes of people the most unnoticed classes during the modeling process of the coronavirus are the pre-symptomatic people and those that are in need of critical care they are included in the model and the model parameters are defined using the data from various research papers official reports and interviews once the parameters are fixed model is fitted to the cumulative case and mortality data given by john hopkins university the fit gave the values for  0 to be 133877 and i0 to be 5849 which actual infected cases in the us on march 1 2020  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 18 2020  different aspects of the model have been analyzed and the effect of various control strategies have been simulated the disease free equilibrium is discussed and using the threshold analysis basic contact rate to achieve dfe is calculated to be 0215 the basic reproduction number is also calculated using the default values and is found to be 271914 which is in the range similar to what most modeling papers produce uncertainty in the fraction of the infectious people being asymptomatic and in the infectiousness of people with no symptoms are simulated and the worst case scenarios are found in the worst case the number of cases can go up to 19 million by second week of march 2020 the death toll can go up to 05 million by the end of august 2020 basic sensitivity analysis is performed and the correlation between different control parameters and the basic reproduction number are found  0 is the positively correlated and therefore should be reduced the contact tracing implementation and hospitalization rate of symptomatic people are inversely correlated and therefore they must be increased as much as possible the control strategies are simulated and the results are analyzed the social distancing strategy seem to be best possible one right now with the absence of vaccines it is better to prevent the disease if the social distancing strategy was highly implemented as shown in the simulations the number of cases during the peak can be reduced up to 11 million the duration of the implementation is also reduced by at least two weeks other simulations have also been added to discuss what will happen if the social distancing is stopped in mid of may 2020 or june 2020 and then the control measure is followed again if the distancing is stopped in may and implemented again it will take till the end of the year to recover from the disease if the distancing is stopped in june and implemented again it will take us to first few months of next year which is not a welcomed situation another simulation in which the social distancing is stopped totally on 0609 is plotted and the results are alarming the peak will drastically rise up to 40 million and the death toll will go upto 45 million fortunately this will not happen because the control measure can not be stopped abruptly as done in the simulations and the government will take actions before something like that happens another control strategy is contact tracing of asymptomatic individuals the simulations shows that the number of cases can be decreases though the change is not as predominant as it was in the case of social distancing anyhow implementing contact tracing along with social distancing will produce a good improvement of the control of the disease the last control measure simulated was the hospitalization rate increasing this rate is difficult  but even minor changes can bring a huge change the current time it takes to hospitalize someone showing symptoms is 7 days the simulation shows the effect of reducing this time to 5 and 4 days as the rate increases to 005 that is 4 days for  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity which was not

literature demonstrates geographical variation with regards to estimates of infection incidence suggesting that covid-19 has been underdiagnosed in certain regions 2 3  the rate of asymptomatic infection has been estimated to be as high as 308 which may help explain variation in incidence particularly in regions with differing screening practices 3  transmission of covid-19 by asymptomatic carriers has been reported in multiple family units indicating that this mode of infection is important in understanding disease epidemiology and population risk 4 5 in one study in individuals who were asymptomatic at the time of confirmed covid-19 infection the median communicable period defined as time from positive test to negative test was 95 days range 1-21 days and approximately 21 of these patients went on to develop symptoms suggesting that individuals may be infectious prior to the development of symptoms 5  as such identifying asymptomatic individuals is likely important in containing the spread of the virus with the temporary closure of many ambulatory care settings the emergency department ed has become a focal point in covid-19 related healthcare delivery in many communities however due to various factors including limited testing capacity data regarding the yield of routine screening of asymptomatic individuals is limited furthermore while the utility of screening asymptomatic individuals has been explored in high-prevalence regions studies have not been published for low-prevalence regions 6 7 in the present study we aimed to describe screening for covid-19 in asymptomatic ed patients in a low-prevalence region this was a retrospective cohort study of data from the study sites electronic health record ehr the study was approved by the study sites institutional review board the study site is an urban level 1 trauma center and tertiary referral center with an annual ed volume of 82000 patients it resides in a county with a population of 1527718 people we included all ed patients who had a covid-19 test ordered under the sites asymptomatic screening protocol either in the ed or within 24 hours of admission from the ed the study site was also performing asymptomatic covid-19 testing at one of its clinics for patients scheduled for surgical procedures patients were excluded if they incorrectly presented to the ed for this asymptomatic screening on april 4 2020 the study site began testing for covid-19 in asymptomatic ed patients who were this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved placed on involuntary psychiatric holds this testing process began due to concerns that covid-19 infections would be difficult to control in the close living environments of psychiatric hospitals and the study site wanted to ensure patients did not have covid-19 prior to transfer to these facilities on april 14 th  the asymptomatic screening protocol expanded to include testing for all patients admitted to the hospital from the ed and all patients awaiting placement in other close living environments ie skilled nursing facility jail or other congregate living facility when ordering asymptomatic covid-19 testing the provider was required to enter the indication for testing including other if the reason for testing was not listed all patients undergoing asymptomatic testing were required to wear surgical masks and all ed providers were also required to wear surgical masks no further isolation contact or airborne was implemented as part of the asymptomatic screening protocol detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was performed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using samples obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs two assays were used during the study period both of which were sanctioned by the food and drug administrations emergency use authorization and validated for use with nasopharyngeal swab samples one assay was run on a high-throughput platform cobas 6800

regarding the reason for cancellation was not captured for individual patients however tests were usually cancelled because of an inadequate sample or because the patient refused testing the primary outcome measure was the result of the covid-19 this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved testing the infectious disease service was consulted to assist with management of patients with positive test results data are described with simple descriptive statistics continuous data are presented as mean  one standard deviation ninety-five percent confidence intervals 95 ci one of these cases underwent repeat testing the next day while admitted and tested negative and remained asymptomatic during hospitalization this case was considered by the infectious diseases consult team to either be a false positive test or an asymptomatic infection the other positive patient when evaluated by the infectious diseases consult team was determined to have both a cough and close contact with covid-19 infected individuals and thus was deemed a symptomatic infection during the 40-day study period the study site tested 886 symptomatic patients for covid-19 and 37 42 95 ci 30 57 tested positive as covid-19 testing capacity increases with time more institutions will likely seek to adopt an asymptomatic screening protocol for admitted patients or for patients who will be transferred to other inpatient settings to control nosocomial spread of the virus in this study we describe the testing of asymptomatic ed patients for covid-19 in a low-prevalence region of the united states prior studies on asymptomatic screening are from high prevalence regions during the study period 526 cases of covid-19 were diagnosed in the study sites county 40-day incidence 34 cases per 100000 population 9  the centers for disease control and prevention reported a national incidence that varied significantly by region ranging from 206 to 9153 cases per 100000 population during a time period just prior to the present study february 12 th to april 7 th  2020 10  thus the study site this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved represents a low prevalence region in our study population we found a very low true positive rate among asymptomatic patients undergoing testing while the rate of asymptomatic infection was low testing led to the diagnosis of covid-19 in one inpatient who then was placed in appropriate isolation had this patient not been tested via the asymptomatic screening protocol this covid-19 infection would not have been identified potentially exposing healthcare workers and other patients when performing disease surveillance in low-prevalence regions the presence of false-positive test results is inevitable in our study one of the two patients with positive test results was likely a false positive this asymptomatic individual was retested the next day and found to be negative the present study must be interpreted in the setting of its limitations this was a single-center study so our results may not be generalizable to other settings as the prevalence and impact of covid-19 is very regional local covid-19 infection trends must be considered this study was retrospective thus it is limited by the data available in the ehr and subject to the limitations of a retrospective study as the data were downloaded from the ehr errors in manual data abstraction were minimized finally a small percentage of patients 7 had their test cancelled it is possible that some of these patients may have tested positive screening asymptomatic ed patients for covid-19 in a low prevalence region is of very low yield the decision to test asymptomatic ed patients should be made on an institution-by-institution basis dependent on regional prevalence and test availability   asymptomatic middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection using a serologic survey in korea yeong-jun song jeong-sun yang hee yoon jung hae-sung nam soon lee young hae-kwan cheong woo-jung park sung park han bo choi youl sung kim soon moran ki   middle east respiratory syndrome mers is a severe respiratory infection caused by a novel beta coronavirus mers-cov 1-3 the symptoms of mers include fever chills cough shortness of breath gastrointestinal symptoms expectoration wheezing chest pain hemoptysis sore throat headache myalgia abdominal pain vomiting and diarrhea it can also cause death in severe cases 3-6 the causative pathogen of mers is transmitted via 4 modes animal-to-human intra-familial healthcare-associated and travel-related 78 the 186 cases that occurred in south korea hereafter korea were predominantly caused by healthcare-associated transmission 79-11 followed by intra-familial transmission according to data reported to the world health organization the rates of asymptomatic or mild infection were 44 of 398 2860 in saudi arabia the united arab emirates and the islamic republic of iran between april and june 2014 and 32 of 113 2831 in saudi arabia in june 2014 1213 however oboho et al 14 reported that 7879 26 of 33 of initially reported asymptomatic patients had at least 1 symptom in korea among the 186 confirmed cases 3 asymptomatic cases were detected among healthcare workers via screening tests 161 15 in serologic studies using indirect immunofluorescence tests for healthcare workers who were at mers-affected hospitals 2 of 457 044 had positive results 16 however no report has been published regarding the asymptomatic infection rate among non-healthcare workers in korea there is a considerable chance of human-to-human transmission as well as direct infection via the dromedary camel 17-19 therefore it is necessary to identify the rate of asymptomatic mers infections in healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers this survey was conducted between august 2015 and february 2016 after the last mers case diagnosed in july 5 2015 based on a database of quarantined individuals provided by the department of epidemiologic investigation of the korea centers for disease control and prevention kcdc individuals from 4 regions with major outbreaksseoul gyeonggi chungcheong and jeonbuk were selected individuals whose mers status was diagnosed as positive using a polymerase chain reaction test were excluded from the analysis of this study from the 14831 quarantined individuals 7233 residents 488 living in the 4 major mers outbreak regions were selected of these individuals calls requesting participation in this study were made to 3291 individuals 455 according to prioritization groupings a total of 1610 individuals 489 ultimately participated in the study figure 1 those who refused to participate have been described in another study 20 the study individuals were prioritized in groups according to the transmission intensity of the mers case they were exposed to as follows contact with super-spreading events 5 or more individuals infected 21 contact with spreaders who infected 1 to 4 individuals and contact with non-spreaders we selected study subjects according to this prioritization of groups and the selection rates were 488 164 and 158 respectively we also categorized the subjects according to their exposure intensity ie status when they were exposed to the mers case as follows inpatients or outpatients at a mers-affected hospital cohabiting family members or paid caregivers of the mers case visitors of the hospitalized mers case healthcare workers employed at a mers-affected hospital and colleague of the mers case we selected more subjects from the categories of family patients and visitors table 1 only individuals who consented to participate in the study through a telephone call and gave written consent at the time of study initiation underwent surveys at local public health centers each participant responded to a questionnaire on exposure and provided a blood sample following the first serologic test by an enzymelinked immunospecific assay elisa positive or borderline cases were tested using an immunofluorescence assay ifa and a plaque reduction neutralization antibody test prnt mers-cov antibody levels in all sera collected from contacts were measured using a recombinant s1 protein-coated human anti-mers-cov immunoglobulin g igg elisa kit euroimmun luebeck germany which was used according to the manufacturers protocol the results of the tested samples were determined by calculating the ratio of the optical density od value of the sample to the od value of the calibrator ratios  11 were considered positive ratios  08 to  11 were considered borderline and ratios  08 were considered negative ifa slides were coated with mers-cov non-infected or infected vero cells serum samples were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline pbs to 110 1100 1250 and 11000 transferred to ifa slides and incubated for 30 minutes at 37c in a humidified chamber the ifa slides were washed 3 times in pbs-t for 5 minutes each and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-human igg abcam cambridge ma usa diluted at 1800 for 30 minutes at 37c in a humidified chamber after washing 3 times in pbs-t for 5 minutes the slides were embedded with a mounting fluid topped with a cover glass and observed under a fluorescent microscope the neutralizing antibodies in the serum samples were measured by prnt the prnt procedures were performed as follows in brief 110 diluted sera were heat-inactivated at 56c for 30 minutes heat-inactivated sera were diluted serially 4-fold after an equal volume of virus mers-covkorknih002052015 was added to the volume of serum dilutions these mixtures were incubated at 37c for 2 hours the mixtures were added to each well of the 24-well plate cultured with vero cells the plate was incubated at 37c for 60 minutes and 1 ml of 15 carboxymethylcellulose overlay medium was then added after incubation for 3-4 days cell staining was performed by crystal violet the titer of neutralizing antibody by prnt50 was calculated using the krber formula as described previously 22 a titer above 120 was interpreted as positive all sera with a positive or borderline reaction in elisa were tested by the ifa and prnt assays for confirmation and cases with positive results from any 2 assays were considered to be anti-mers positive this study received approval from the bioethics committee of the kcdc 2015-08-exp-03-p-a and the institutional review board of the national cancer center ncc 2016-0058 informed consent was obtained from study participants or their parent or legal guardian for children under 14 among the 3291 selected individuals the response rates of contacts with super-spreading events 5 or more individuals infected contacts with spreaders who infected 1-4 individuals and contacts with non-spreaders were 398 552 of 1388 403 139 of 345 and 590 919 of 1558 respectively according to their status when they were exposed to the mers case the highest response rates were found for healthcare workers 994 and family members 971 followed by visitors 758 colleagues 490 and patients 368 table 1 the seropositive rate using elisa was 105 6 of 574 in patients 033 1 of 307 in healthcare workers and 043 7 of 1610 overall among the 7 elisa-positive individuals 3 had contact with a super-spreading event patient zero case 1 whoinfected 28 individuals 23 1 had contact with a spreader case 118 who infected 2 individuals and 3 had contact with a non-spreader case 89 among the elisa-positive individuals only 1 was both ifa-positive and prnt-positive therefore the confirmed rates of asymptomatic mers infection were 017 in patients and 0060 95 confidence interval 0002 to 0346 overall table 1 the confirmed asymptomatic case patient zero and 11 secondary mers patients were hospitalized on the same floor of the hospital at the same time 2324 the asymptomatic case was quarantined at home for 2 weeks after discharge the case had underlying diseases that included hypertension angina and degenerative arthritis the case reported no fever cough myalgia or gastrointestinal symptoms during hospitalization or quarantine table 2 limited information exists regarding mers-cov seroprevalence among populations other than confirmed mers cases saudi arabian data showed that the seroprevalence of mers-cov igg among the general population was 015 25 suggesting that a number of cases of asymptomatic or mild infections may be present in the general population despite a high prevalence of 186 confirmed mers cases during the outbreak of mers in korea the rate of asymptomatic infection 160 15 was lower than expected the rates of asymptomatic infection confirmed using ifa and prnt in the present study were 006 1 of 1610 for all contacts and 017 1 of 574 for patients these results are markedly lower than the rates of 027 2 of 737 among healthcare workers and 044 2 of 457 among healthcare workers at mers-affected hospitals in korea 16 moreover the rate of asymptomatic or mild infection in saudi arabia the united arab emirates and the islamic republic of iran was approximately 2800 121318 the confirmed asymptomatic case presented in this study was a patient at the same hospital as confirmed mers cases and unlike in previous studies was neither an intra-familial infection nor a pediatric infection 2627 the low rate of asymptomatic infection in korea is attributable to the different transmission pathway of mers infections compared to the middle east in korea most of the mers cases were healthcare-associated infections and none were from an animal the low asymptomatic infection rate is also attributable to the extensive epidemiological investigation conducted in korea including close monitoring of contacts with mers patients this helped identify almost all mers patients this may also have been attributable to the promotion of proactive identification of patients via mass media and the establishment of communication networks by the government leading to voluntary reports by people active quarantine and countermeasures to this public health crisis 102829 elisa is appropriate as a screening tool as it is 10-fold more sensitive than ifa however it may cross-react with seasonal human coronavirus antibodies so a spike protein-specific ifa is required for confirmation prnt is a definitive test when elisa and ifa have inconclusive results 25 only 10 of elisa-positive results are positive on a neutralization assay 25 in our study 1 of 7 patients with borderline or positive elisa results also had positive results in prnt therefore the results obtained in our study are accurate because elisa ifa and prnt were used a previous study predicted the pandemic potential of mers-cov to be  5 however this does not indicate that the risk has abated 30 prerequisites for reducing the risk include improved surveillance active contact tracing and the initiation of animal host searching 3031 during the outbreak in korea mers was classified as a notifiable infectious disease and was subjected to surveillance 32 since mers is an imported disease in korea it is recommended that precautions be taken before travel and that the time of returning from travel and incubation period be considered this study showed a low seropositivity in the population of individuals quarantined due to contact with mers cases however there is a possibility that the seropositivity rate was underestimated for the following reasons firstly the participants of the present study were mostly non-healthcare workers and were relatively healthy thus the risk of infection was low secondly the overall participation rate was 489 whereas it was 368 in the patient group at a higher risk of infection moreover we only surveyed 109 of the quarantined individuals therefore the actual rate of asymptomatic infections may be higher than reported in the present study lastly the present study may have been conducted too late in a previous study mers-cov elisa results indicated that the antibody response was highest after 3 weeks from symptom onset 33 although no reports have analyzed the duration of antibody presence in mers patients regardless of symptoms a recent study of severe acute respiratory syndrome and mers reported that antibodies in some patients persisted for up to 2-3 years after infection 3435 blood sampling for serologic test in this study was performed on contacts between october and december 2015 while exposure to the confirmed case occurred between may and june 2015 a gap of 5 months thus a loss of the mers-cov antibody titer could have taken place despite actual asymptomatic infections therefore the actual rate of asymptomatic infection may be higher than the rate presented in this report in conclusion among 1610 contacts only 1 non-healthcare worker who was a patient in a mers-affected hospital had an asymptomatic mers-cov infection to understand new emerging infectious diseases such as mers more intensive epidemiologic research is needed including an analysis of asymptomatic infections  epidemiological and clinical features of asymptomatic

 however these asymptomatic cases were followed for a very short period specific information that characterizes asymptomatic patients remains unknown as reported by the previous study fever as one of the dominant symptoms of covid19 was identified in only 438 of the patients on presentation while 887 of patients developed a fever after hospitalization indicating that some asymptomatic covid19 cases before admission may develop symptoms during the hospitalization
5
 however few studies have reported sarscov2 infected patients with completely asymptomatic throughout the disease course in this study we investigated the epidemiological and clinical features of patients infected by sarscov2 with completely asymptomatic throughout the disease course patients with confirmed sarscov2 infection were retrospectively recruited from 10 designated hospitals in 10 cities of jiangsu province china xuzhou lianyungang suqian huaian yancheng nantong taizhou yangzhou changzhou and suzhou from 18 january 2020 to 26 february 2020 all confirmed patients were diagnosed according to the criterion of the world health organization who interim guidance

13
 however our study provides evidence that young patients infected by sarscov2 without any symptoms should also be monitored fourteen of patients in our study had known contact history of confirmed cased and one patient visited wuhan suggesting that patients with exposure history to sarscov2 should be screening sarscov2 even though they did not present any symptoms such as fever and cough although the patients were asymptomatic 10 patients presented laboratory abnormalities the most common laboratory abnormalities on admission were increased crp alt and ldh levels thus although patients with covid19 do not present any symptom laboratory abnormalities were common chest ct plays an important role in the initial diagnosis of covid19
14
 eight 534 patients had abnormal chest ct images on admission in our study indicating that chest ct examination is suggested as an important tool for sars cov2 infection diagnosis for patients without any symptom thus the patients epidemiological history imaging characteristics and laboratory tests are all important for the diagnosis of sarscov2 infection no specific treatment is available for covid19 thirteen of the patients received antiviral therapy thirteen 867 patients received antiviral therapy interferon 2b 600 arbidol 533 lopinavirritonavir 200 however the necessity and benefit of the antiviral agents for asymptomatic covid19 patients is not yet clear as of 8 march all the patients were discharged with the median duration of hospitalization of 110 days no patients developed serious complications thus the clinical outcomes of asymptomatic patients are favorable however the median time of sarscov2 tested negative from admission was 70 days iqr 4090 days in our study one patient was tested positive for sarscov2 only in anal swab samples given transmission of sarscov2 from asymptomatic carriers have been reported

7
 asymptomatic patients infected sarscov2 should be isolated to prevent the transmission of this highly contagious disease this study was limited by the small sample size with only 15 patients with confirmed covid19 were included moreover although the sarscov2 nucleic acid rtpcr test is recognized as the standard method for diagnosis of sarscov2 infection high falsenegative rates reported thus asymptomatic patients might be underdiagnosed
15

 we described the epidemiological and clinical features of patients infected by sarscov2 with completely asymptomatic throughout the disease course our study indicated that asymptomatic patients infected by sarscov2 might have favorable clinical outcomes patients who have a contact history of covid19 should be monitored and tested for sarscov2 in anal and throat swabs to rule out infection

the first one to be caused by a coronavirus 7  as of now 27 may 2020 the virus had spread 44 to 213 countries and territories around the world infecting more than 5700000 people 8  and this 45 rapid surge of patients had quickly overwhelmed hospitals in many countries although the case-46 fatality ratio of sars-cov-2 3-6 8 9  is lower than those of sars-cov 11 10 11 and cov 34-37 12  due to the great number of infected cases the number of deaths caused by 48 sars-cov-2 is much greater than those by sars-cov and mers-cov to date at least 350000 49 deaths had been reported to be associated with sars-cov-2 infection 8  50 51 the incubation period for covid-19 is 4-5 days with most cases 975 develop symptoms within 52 11-12 days of infection 13  however studies have reported that 5-80 of infected cases might be 53 asymptomatic 14  several asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmissions have been reported 54 15  suggesting roles of asymptomatic infections in the transmission and spread of the disease 55 indeed it has been proposed that asymptomatic carriers is a challenge to containment 16 and 56 that asymptomatic transmission of sars-cov-2 is the achilles heel of  to effectively combat with the spread of the disease this is therefore important to understand 58 the covid-19 pathogenesis and its underlying factors 59 60 several host factors that are positively correlated with the covid-19 severity have been identified 61 including patient age 9 18  low level of cd4  and cd8  t cell counts and the high levels of il-6 and 62  on the other hand viral factors associated with the covid-19 severity are still yet to be 63 determined there are currently more than 30000 genomes of sars-cov-2 sampled from around 64  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available

host micrornas mirnas and viral transcripts has been implicated in 148 pathogenesis of viral diseases 27  in this study we examined whether the two virus variants have 149 different modes of binding

generated during their replication presenting a possibility that 152 it might also interact with human mirnas we therefore examined both positive-and negative-153 strands of sars-cov-2 genome

publicly available in near real-time like never before to date there are more than 30000 sequences 211 of sars-cov-2 genomes made publicly available on the gisaid database 20  and many of these 212 sequences have patient information available this allowed us to investigate viral genetic factors 213 that might be associated with the covid-19 severity 214 in this study we performed a gwas on 152 sars-cov-2 genomes and identified nucleotide 216 variations at the genomic position 11083 to be associated with the disease severity most of 217 symptomatic cases were found to be infected with the 11083g variant while the 11083t variant 218 appeared to be associated more often with asymptomatic infections relative risk ratio  451 285-219 714 odd ratio  3714 1417-9733  the two nucleotide variants 11083g and 11083t are non-220 synonymous corresponding to l and f at the amino acid position 37 in the nsp6 protein 221 respectively our results have potential applications for the development of better and more 222 informative test kits potentially allowing for asymptomatic cases to be distinguished from 223 symptomatic cases continual surveillance of covid-19 should monitor this genomic region as well 224 as its surrounding neighbourhood as they might affect the pathogenesis of 226 bioinformatic analyses suggested that the two variants might interact with the human host mirnas 227 differently in particular the 11083g variant was identified as a potential target of mir-485-3p mir-228 539-3p and mir-3149 while the 11083t variant was not these differences might contribute to the 229 observed differential association between the two variants and the disease severity our results 230 warrant further experimental confirmations to validate biological significance

longitudinal patterns of nucleic acid and serology testing results based on disease severity of covid-19 patients zhang yongchen han shen xinning wang xudong shi yang li jiawei yan yuxin chen bing gu   the ongoing outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus covid-19 known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was first reported in wuhan china in dec 2019 1 as the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 surges worldwide this emerging pandemic has affected more than 1200000 patients globally the dynamic profile of viral replication and shedding along with viral antigen specific antibody responses among covid-19 patients started to be reported 2 but there is no consensus on their patterns the longitudinal profiles of viral rna and antibody response are urgently needed to guide clinical diagnosis treatment infection control and vaccine design 3 in this respective study we serially analysed the virus rna test results in swab samples along with anti-sars-cov-2 igm and igg responses among 21 covid-19 patients at the second hospital of nanjing and the affiliated hospital of xuzhou medical university in jiangsu province china patients with suspected sars-cov-2 were confirmed after two sequential positive respiratory tract sample results throat swab samples were collected every 12 days anal swab samples were also obtained for rna testing since 27 february 2020 as anal swab samples with prolonged viral shedding were observed during clinical practice 4 viral rna was tested using real-time reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction rtpcr kit bgi genomics beijing china as recommended by chinese center for disease control and prevention cdc following who guidelines 5 the serum samples retrieved from routine biochemical or immunological testing were inactivated at 56c for 30 min these samples were later stored at 80c for later serological detection the igg and igm antibody responses against sars-cov-2 spike protein and nucleocapsid protein were tested by gold immunochromatography assay supplied by innovita co ltd china cfda approved the demographic information and disease severity of covid-19 patients were obtained from their electronic medical records patients who had any of the following features during covid-19 disease progression were classified as severe cases a respiratory distress b hypoxia spo2 93 c abnormal blood gas analysis pao2fio2  300 mm hg or d severe disease complications including respiratory failure which requires mechanical ventilation septic shock or non-respiratory organ failure the illness severity was defined according to the chinese management guideline for covid-19 version 60 6 asymptomatic carriers were defined as individuals who were positive for covid-19 nucleic acid but without any symptoms during screening of close contacts this study was approved by ethics committee of each medical centre and information consent was waived as part of a public health outbreak investigation between jan 25 and march 18 2020 21 patients were enrolled including 11 524 non-severe covid-19 patients 5 208 severe patients and 5 208 asymptomatic cases with sars-cov-2 infection as of march 24 all patients have been clinical recovered and discharged the characteristics of each group were summarized in table 1 the dynamic viral shedding from throat swab and anal swabs were analysed figure 1 for non-severe patients the respiratory swab remained positive for a median of 10 range 221 days since symptom onset whereas a median of 14 range 933 days for severe patients for asymptomatic cases the period of positive respiratory swab lasted for a median of 18 range 528 days despite of no statistical difference between groups non-severe covid-19 group was prone to become respiratory swab rna negative in shorter period compared to the group of severe patients and asymptomatic cases among 15 patients who tested for anal swab samples 3 1875 anal swabs remained positive for sars-cov-2 since their respiratory swab samples turned negative for sars-cov-2 our serial sars-cov-2 rna testing identified a prolonged viral shedding for asymptomatic cases compared to covid-19 patients suggesting the importance of early identification and timely quarantine for these asymptomatic carriers consistent with previous studies 7 we also found that the anal swab was able to maintain positive for weeks even after respiratory samples turned negative validating the efficient replication in gastrointestinal tract during later stage of covid-19 and a possible faecal-oral transmission route

 the longitudinal antibody responses were also determined in our cohort figure 1 all of 17 symptomatic patients 100 were seropositive at the time point of discharge or during follow-up period specifically among 11 non-severe patients 3 272 patients seroconverted within week 1 7 636 patients were anti-sars-cov-2 positive during week 2 while 9 818 patients showed positive antibody responses within week 3 and 11 100 patients were seropositive within week 6 for 8 727 of 11 patients the first detection of antibody responses occurred during the period when their swab samples converted to rna negative suggesting that antibody responses might facilitate the viral clearance especially for non-severe covid-19 patients furthermore for all 5 severe covid-19 patients antibody responses were detected within 2 weeks of note 3 out of 5 severe patients generated viral specific igg responses prior to viral clearance it is possible that significantly high level of sars-cov-2 viral load observed in severe cases 89 drives an early antibody response produced by immediate activation of extrafollicular b cells during acute infection 1011 moreover we also observed well-maintained antibody responses for all seroconverted individuals during our observation period at least lasting for 6 weeks only 1 20 out of 5 asymptomatic cases generated sars-cov-2 specific antibody responses table 1 and figure 1 and this patient patient 17 was not seroconverted until week 3 since her diagnosis consistent with her delayed antibody responses the throat swab sample converted to rna negative as late as week 3 for the remaining 4 asymptomatic patients 2 patients were not seroconverted within week 2 and week 3 respectively while 2 patients remained anti-sars-cov-2 negative during week 4 it is not known whether they become seropositive later it is possible that such seronegative asymptomatic carriers were resulted from low level of viral load but the false positive nucleic acid test results cannot be ruled out our current study has revealed important implications to understand the dynamic interplay between sars-cov-2 and humoral responses first seroconversion was observed in 100 1717 of symptomatic patients during the observation period suggesting that the serological test could serve as a complementary testing assay to nucleic acid test for those symptomatic covid-19 patients especially given the potential false negative viral rna results using throat swab samples nevertheless we also noted only one person with humoral responses among asymptomatic carriers additional viral and immunological analyses are warranted to understand this observation better understanding on the biological significance of asymptomatic cases without seroconversion is urgently needed although it is generally considered a beneficial role of specific antibody response during viral infection we did not identify a strong association of seroconversion and disease severity in our cohort for both non-severe and severe covid-19 cases the viral specific antibody responses were detected meanwhile our study revealed an early induction of antibody responses in severe cases consistently a recent study also revealed that high level of antibody titer might be independently associated with a worse disease severity for covid-19 patients 12 a similar clinical observation was also observed from a previous study of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in which deceased infected patients reached the peak of anti-spike neutralizing antibody much earlier than that of the clinical recovered patients 13 however only measurement of peripheral antibody responses may not be sufficient we can also speculate that high level of initial viral load early in infection may lead to severe covid-19 cases such high viral load can drive strong extrafollicular b cell responses leading to rapid antibody responses which do not follow the sequence of igm to igg development stages 1011 such high quantity of antibodies produced from extrafollicular b cells can contribute greatly to the inflammatory responses by promoting monocyte and macrophage accumulation and the massive cytokine storm including il-8 and mcp-1 which might be responsible for fatal acute lung injury as indicated during sars-cov infection 14 also antibody might facilitate the infection of target cells by promoting the uptake of virion-antibody complex via fc receptors fcr 15 whether the acute anti-sars-cov-2 antibody responses attributed to disease progression of covid-19 disease deserves further investigation on the other hand a graduate development of viral antigen specific b cells undergoes the somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation at the traditional germinal centre which ultimately lead to high affinity protective antibody responses as observed in non-severe covid-19 patients our study also has several limitations first our study is limited by small sample size thereby it is not known whether our finding could be generalized nevertheless our cohort is representative of different covid-19 disease spectrum including non-severe cases severe cases and asymptomatic carriers furthermore the quantitative viral load and titers of antibody response were not available so the kinetics of viral shedding and the magnitude of antibody response during covid-19 disease progression remained unknown in this study collectively our study of serial nucleic acid and serological testing among various covid-19 patients indicated distinct dynamic patterns among three groups of sars-cov-2 infected individuals our findings contribute to the evolving understanding of the sophisticated interaction between this emerging sars-cov-2 virus and host immune system  persistence of positive

february 2020 the cabinet orders cabinet order nos 28 and 29 of 2020 allowed that the government could isolate an asymptomatic carrier with a positive sarscov2 test result by hospitalizing himher in an entrusted medical institution designated for infectious diseases we report the case of an asymptomatic patient infected with sarscov2 with abnormal chest computed tomography ct findings who remained reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction rtpcrpositive for 24 days she was quarantined in an isolation hospital on 15 february 2020 a 64yearold asymptomatic woman on board a cruise ship was tested for sarscov2 using rtpcr undertaken with a throat swab sample her husband was diagnosed with laboratoryconfirmed covid19 and transferred to an isolation ward at a healthcare facility although she remained asymptomatic without fever on 20 february 2020 she was diagnosed with sarscov2 infection and was transferred to our hospital for quarantine the patient had been in her usual health without fever after her husband developed fever approximately 10 days before her current admission her medical history included hypertension her regular medications were amlodipine candesartan hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol on initial examination her blood pressure pulse rate and body temperature were 10857 mmhg 57 bpm and 366c respectively while she was breathing ambient air her respiratory rate and oxygen saturation were 18 breathsmin and 98 respectively physical examination revealed the absence of cough and vesicular sound without crackles based on the patients laboratory test results her white blood cell count and creactive protein level were 7300 cellsl and 041 mgdl respectively table 1 chest xray showed no abnormal findings chest ct revealed patchy groundglass opacities in the peripheral areas under the pleura on the right lower lobe fig 1 the patient was quarantined in a single room with a bathroom she was not allowed to move outside the room she did not develop fever during her hospitalized isolation fig 2 followup with chest xray and chest ct was not carried out ten days after the first day of acquiring a positive rtpcr test result rtpcr was undertaken on nasal swabs every few days following the instructions of the quarantine station the first day of continuous negative rtpct test results was 9 march 2020 all the following criteria had to be met so that an asymptomatic patient infected with sarscov2 can be discharged from a hospital i hospital isolation longer than 125 days ii normal temperature lasting longer than 3 days iii absence of respiratory symptoms iv two consecutively negative rtpcr test results separated by at least 12 h as the patient met the criteria for the discontinuation of quarantine in japan on 10 march she was discharged from our hospital on 11 march the major finding of the present case indicated that an asymptomatic patient diagnosed with sarscov2 infection remained rtpcrpositive for 24 days and the potential communicable period was 24 days although she was quarantined in an isolation hospital this finding suggests that an asymptomatic patient diagnosed with sarscov2 infection can be an asymptomatic carrier for more than 3 weeks a previous study has shown that sarscov2 infection appears to have been transmitted during the incubation period of a patient who was diagnosed with covid19

 however it is still unclear whether asymptomatic individuals are potential sources of sarscov2 infection causing the current outbreak leekha et al revealed that a patient with nonenveloped virus infection who remained pcrpositive was shedding virus as a carrier

 this case possibly suggests that asymptomatic patients diagnosed with sarscov2 infection continuously transmit sarscov2 for more than 3 weeks a previous study has indicated that recovered covid19 patients had positive rtpcr test results 513 days after the discontinuation of quarantine although they met the criteria for hospital discharge including the absence of clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities with two negative rtpcr test results
3
 the following are the two possible reasons why recovered covid19 patients still have positive rtpcr test results the patient infects with another type of sarscov2
4
 as the result of inadequate isolation at home or falsenegative rtpcr test results are obtained regardless if continuous sarscov2 infection
5
 is observed as we strictly isolate our patients infected with sarscov2 with or without symptoms under the quarantine act and cabinet order of japan in our hospital the present case indicated that an asymptomatic patient diagnosed with sarscov2 infection could remain rtpcrpositive for more than 3 weeks hu et al
6
 reported that 208 and 500 of cases of asymptomatic patients infected with sarscov2 developed symptoms during hospitalization and showed typical ct images with groundglass opacities in the lung respectively in our case report the patient did not develop fever cough or fatigue and there were no abnormalities on chest xray but she had patchy groundglass opacities in the peripheral areas under the pleura on the right lower lobe we defined the communicable period as the interval from the first day of a positive rtpcr test result to the first day of continuous negative test results
6
 the same study also revealed that the communicable period of sarscov2 infection ranged from 1 to 21 days median 95 days interquartile range 35130 days in the whole cases and the communicable period was 40 days interquartile range 20150 in patients who are asymptomatic with normal chest ct findings
6
 however to the best of our knowledge the communicable period in asymptomatic patients with abnormal chest ct findings was not mentioned in any studies in our case report the patient was asymptomatic with abnormal chest ct findings and the communicable period was 24 days this result suggests that abnormal chest ct findings would prolong the potential communicable period in asymptomatic patients infected with sarscov2 although several countries imposed a mandatory 14day period of quarantine on individuals arriving from countries considered highrisk for sarscov2 infection our findings suggest that prolonged period of quarantine might prevent the outbreak of covid19 however a previous study has revealed the negative association between covid19 mortality and healthcare resource availability
7
 in general asymptomatic patients infected with sarscov2 are identified only from systematic screening which includes the assessment of their close contacts with covid19 patients or covid19suspected patients by undertaking chest ct the clinician could identify asymptomatic patients with abnormal chest ct findings as high risk for a prolonged potential communicable period the present finding shows that an asymptomatic patient infected with sarscov2 with abnormal chest ct findings remained rtpcrpositive for 24 days and the communicable period might be longer than 3 weeks disregarding healthcare resource availability we could carry out a chest ct scan in order to identify the patient as high risk with a prolonged potential communicable period among asymptomatic patients this finding suggests that a prolonged communicable period even greater than expected in asymptomatic patients infected with sarscov2 with abnormal chest ct findings might cause asymptomatic carrier transmission suggesting that prolonged period of quarantine of at least 4 weeks might prevent the outbreak of covid19 approval of the research protocol na informed consent written informed consent was obtained registry and

shaman marta galanti  the pandemic potential of the novel coronavirus ncov that emerged in wuhan china during december 2019 is strongly tied to the number and contagiousness of undocumented human infections here we present findings from a proactive longitudinal sampling study of acute viral respiratory infections that documents rates of asymptomatic infection and clinical care seeking for seasonal coronavirus we find that the majority of infections are asymptomatic by most symptom definitions and that only 4 of individuals experiencing a seasonal coronavirus infection episode sought medical care for their symptoms these numbers indicate that a very high percentage of seasonal coronavirus infections are undocumented and provide a reference for understanding the spread of the emergent ncov  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint   the wuhan novel coronavirus ncov appears to have emerged in humans in the hubei province of china during december 2019 1  the virus was definitively identified in the first week of 2020 and as of january 29 had spread to 15 other countries 6065 confirmed cases 9239 suspected cases and 132 deaths have been reported 2  however the total number of infections confirmed suspected and unreported remains unknown quantification of the reporting rate ie the ratio of confirmed and suspected cases to total infections is vital for delineation of the prevalence scope and potential spread of ncov indeed the speed and geographic extent of its translocation throughout china and internationally are likely tied to the true prevalence of the pathogen and suggest that there are many more infections ie the reporting rate is low that contagiousness is not negligible among these undetected infected persons and that ncov will be difficult to contain to contextualize the issue of unreported infection we here present the findings from a recent proactive sampling project carried out in new york city nyc that documented rates of asymptomatic infection and clinical care-seeking among individuals shedding seasonal cov types hku1 229e nl63 and oc43 data are derived from sampling performed between october 2016 and april 2018 as part of the virome project a proactive sampling of respiratory virus infection rates associated symptom reports and rates of seeking clinical care we enrolled 214 healthy individuals from multiple locations in the manhattan borough of nyc cohort composition is described in galanti et al 3 4 and includes children attending two daycares along with their siblings and parents teenagers and teachers from a high school adults working at two emergency departments a pediatric and an adult hospital and adults working at a university medical center the cohort was obtained using convenience sampling and all participants were younger than 65 years while the study period spanned two years from october 2016 to april 2018 some individuals enrolled for a single cold and flu season october -april and others for the entire study period participants or their guardians if minors provided informed consent after reading a detailed description of the study cumc irb aaaq4358 nasopharyngeal samples were collected by study coordinators once a week irrespective of participant symptoms samples were screened using the genmark esensor rvp system for 18 different respiratory viruses including coronavirus 229e nl63 oc43 and hku1 sample collection and extraction followed the same protocol as in shaman et al 5  in addition participants completed daily self-reports rating nine respiratory illnessrelated symptoms fever chills muscle pain watery eyes runny nose sneezing sore throat cough chest pain each of which was recorded on a likert scale 0none 1mild 2moderate 3severe the daily self-report also documented whether participants had sought medical attention stayed home or taken cold and flu-related medications both over-the-counter and prescription as a consequence of their listed symptoms see

an infection episode note definition 4 is relative to an individuals long-term average total symptom score definition 1 at least one day with a daily score 3 definition 2 minimum two individual symptoms 0 and at least one symptom 1 definition 3 total symptom score 9 definition 4 total symptom score greater than twice the weekly average for the infected individual definition 5 total symptom score 0 ie any reported symptom we defined an infection or viral episode as a group of consecutive weekly specimens from a given individual that were positive for the same virus allowing for a one-week gap to account for false negatives and temporary low shedding medically attended illness sick days at home and medicine uptake were defined as episodes in which the participants reported seeking care staying home or taking medicines due to respiratory symptoms we classified all infection episodes as symptomatic or asymptomatic according to individual symptom scores in the days surrounding the date of the first positive swab of an episode we used multiple definitions as a standard for symptomatic infection does not exist table 1  these symptom definitions are described in

were identified cov-oc43 infection was most frequent n61 and cov-nl63 infection was least frequent n15 note that co-infections occurred hence the sum of the type infections is greater than the total reported in the final column of table 2  adults 20 years old constituted 64 of the cohort provided 67 of collected swab specimens and experienced 50 of all cov infection episodes based on definitions 1-4 the majority of cov infection episodes were asymptomatic when stratified by type differences emerge cov-nl63 was more than twice as likely to produce symptomatic infection episodes as cov-229e by definitions 1-4 definition 5 which defines symptomatic infection as the manifestation of any symptom during the 11day window spanning the initial positive swab collection indicates that a majority of infected persons reported at least one mild cold-related symptom participants reported taking medicine in response to cold and flu symptoms for 26 n35 of cov infection episodes participants were three times more likely to take medicine in association with cov-nl63 infection 40 than cov-229e infection 12 10 of participants reported staying home from work or school during cov infection episodes and 4 of participants reported seeking medical care  reporting of seasonal cov prevalence has been limited to date the us cdc only began releasing cov positivity rates in 2018 and understanding of its epidemiological features is incomplete here we present direct measurement of rates of seeking clinical care and show that only 4 6 of 135 of persons shedding seasonal cov sought care reporting rates and rates of seeking medical care may differ as most individuals visiting a clinician for acute respiratory illness are not tested for seasonal cov however testing for the 2019 ncov is expected to be more robust than for seasonal cov as there is pressing need to understand and contain this novel pathogen this high testing rate could result in the reporting rate for ncov equaling the rate of seeking medical care thus if rates of seeking medical care for ncov were to align with seasonal cov the reporting rate for ncov would approach 4 should the remaining 96 of unreported infections be sufficiently contagious their high numbers could support rapid spread of ncov it is important to note that rates of seeking medical care for ncov may not align with the rates found here for seasonal cov concern over the virus may lead to elevated rates of seeking medical care our estimates for seasonal cov represent a moderate sample size and the symptom severity of emergent wuhan ncov may differ from seasonal cov further early outbreak instances of death due to ncov occurred predominantly in elderly patients and often elderly with co-morbidities 6  the data we present here for seasonal cov are from a cohort with no individuals 65 year or older so the findings identified here might not have bearing on the elderly still several recent studies suggest that reporting rates for ncov may align with the rates found here for seasonal cov chinazzi et al 7 used an agent-based modeling approach to estimate the overall ncov incidence reported and unreported necessary to support the observed numbers of geographically exported infected individuals as of january 21 2020 they estimated a 5-16 ncov reporting rate depending on model assumptions in addition phylogenetic analysis has identified wuhan ncov as a betacoronavirus the genus that includes cov-oc43 and cov-hku1 as well as cov-sars and cov-mers 8  among our cohort participants 7 6 of 91 of infection episodes with seasonal betacoronavirus oc43 and hku1 sought medical care  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  the impact of unrecognized and unattended infections on transmission dynamics is likely a key determinant of whether control of the ncov outbreak is possible for example although cases of seroconversion without sign of disease were documented during the sars outbreak asymptomatic and subclinical rates are believed to have been low no cases of asymptomatic sars transmission were documented 9  which may have facilitated the containment of the epidemic a higher asymptomatic ratio was reported for mers infections which presented with a broader spectrum of clinical manifestations 21 of laboratory identified cases were mild or asymptomatic and 48 had severe disease or died 10 the potential for asymptomatic transmission of mers has been reported 11 however the majority of transmission events happened within hospital or household suggesting that close proximity may have facilitated transmission ncov has spread rapidly in a short time which suggests a substantial number of unreported infections exist the results presented here provide a unique direct measure of seasonal cov infection symptom severity and rates of seeking medical care these findings provide a baseline reference for contextualizing ncov pandemic potential  comparison of clinical characteristics of patients with asymptomatic vs symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 in wuhan china rongrong yang xien gui yong xiong   coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 emerged in wuhan china in december 2019 and has spread globally with sustained human-to-human transmission outside china12 to control the spread of covid-19 and isolate patients as early as possible the chinese government requested that close contacts of individuals with covid-19 must be screened for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection during the screening process we found some patients whose test results were positive for sars-cov-2 but who had no symptoms or signs throughout the course of the disease considering that little is known about the differences of clinical features and prognosis between patients who were asymptomatic vs those who were symptomatic34 this case series aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of patients with sars-cov-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction rt-pcr from 26 transmission cluster series in wuhan china from december 24 2019 to february 24 2020 this case series was approved by the institutional ethics board of zhongnan hospital of wuhan university all consecutive patients with covid-19 confirmed via rt-pcr admitted to zhongnan hospital of wuhan university from december 24 2019 to february 24 2020 were enrolled oral informed consent was obtained from all patients epidemiological symptoms signs laboratory values chest computed tomography ct scans treatment measures and outcomes data during the hospital stay were collected nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected for extracting sars-cov-2 rna from patients suspected of having sars-cov-2 infection the indicative patients were recruited from 26 cluster cases and had confirmed history of exposure to the hunan seafood market or had close contact with another patient who had been hospitalized for covid-19 and they were confirmed to have sars-cov-2 infection by rt-pcr from nasopharyngeal swabs routine chest ct scans and sars-cov-2 testing from nasopharyngeal swab were performed on their close contacts the close contacts with other exposure histories were excluded the included patients who were exposed to the same indicative patients with covid-19 were defined as clustered cases and the date of initial exposure was identified to determine incubation period data were analyzed using spss statistical software version 190 ibm categorical variables were described as frequency rates and percentages and continuous variables were described using mean median and interquartile range iqr values 2 analysis was conducted to examine the categorical variables means for continuous variables were compared using independent group t tests when the data were normally distributed otherwise the mann-whitney u test was used all p values were 2-tailed and p  05 was considered to be significant this case series includes data for 78 patients from 26 cluster cases of exposure to the hunan seafood market or close contact with other patients with covid-19 all patients were confirmed to have sars-cov-2 infection by rt-pcr from nasopharyngeal swabs the median iqr number of patients per cluster was 3 2-3 patients and the range was 2 to 10 patients per cluster the 78 close contacts confirmed with sars-cov-2 infection were hospitalized in same medical area and provided the same treatments administered by the same health care workers a total of 33 patients 423 were asymptomatic while 45 patients 577 were symptomatic the symptoms and signs such as fever fatigue and dry cough were monitored every day detecting sars-cov-2 from nasopharyngeal swab was monitored every 24 to 48 hours for patients with stable conditions a second chest ct was conducted 4 to 6 days after the first time then 6 to 7 days after the second time chest ct was also conducted at any time a patients condition became worse cd4t lymphocyte count was tested every 5 to 6 days data about clinical characteristics of patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic sars-cov-2 infection are presented in the table patients who were asymptomatic compared with patients with symptomatic sars-cov-2 infection were younger median iqr age 37 26-45 years vs 56 34-63 years p  001 and had a higher proportion of women 22 667 women vs 14 31 women p  002 lower proportion of liver injuries 1 patients 30

009 faster lung recovery in ct scans median iqr duration 9 6-18 days vs 15 11-18 days p  001 shorter duration of viral shedding from nasopharynx swabs median iqr duration 8 3-12 days vs 19 16-24 days p  001 and more stable results of sars-cov-2 testing 4 fluctuated results 121 vs 15 fluctuated results 333 our finding of less consumption of cd4t lymphocyte in asymptomatic infections suggests that damage to the immune system in asymptomatic infections was milder compared with symptomatic infections although patients who were asymptomatic experienced less harm to themselves they may have been unaware of their disease and therefore not isolated themselves or sought treatment or they may have been overlooked by health care workers and thus unknowingly transmitted the virus to others fortunately patients with asymptomatic sars-cov-2 infection have a shorter duration of viral shedding from nasopharyngeal swabs and lower risk of a recurring positive test result of sars-cov-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs which can provide a reference for improving the prevention and control strategies for patients who are asymptomatic this study has some limitations although all patients whose rt-pcr tests were positive for sars-cov-2 had been exposed to same patients were hospitalized in same medical area and provided the same treatments administered by the same health care workers the clinical differences between patients who were asymptomatic vs those who were symptomatic could have been more objectively observed since patients with asymptomatic covid-19 were relatively concealed the fact of viral shedding detected via nasopharyngeal swabs must not be ignored therefore identifying and isolating patients with asymptomatic covid-19 as early as possible is critical to control the transmission of covid-19 close contacts of patients with covid-19 should be closely monitored to avoid secondary transmission  forecasting the daily and cumulative number of cases for the covid-19 pandemic in india subhas khajanchi kankan sarkar  the ongoing novel coronavirus epidemic has been announced a pandemic by the world health organization on march 11 2020 and the govt of india has declared a nationwide lockdown from march 25 2020 to prevent community transmission of covid-19 due to absence of specific antivirals or vaccine mathematical modeling play an important role to better understand the disease dynamics and designing strategies to control rapidly spreading infectious diseases in our study we developed a new compartmental model that explains the transmission dynamics of covid-19 we calibrated our proposed model with daily covid-19 data for the four indian provinces namely jharkhand gujarat andhra pradesh and chandigarh we study the qualitative properties of the model including feasible equilibria and their stability with respect to the basic reproduction number r0 the disease-free equilibrium becomes stable and the endemic equilibrium becomes unstable when the recovery rate of infected individuals increased but if the disease transmission rate remains higher then the endemic equilibrium always remain stable for the estimated model parameters  in india 173763 confirmed cases 7964 confirmed new cases and 4971 confirmed deaths due to covid-19 were reported as of may 30 2020 as the ongoing covid-19 outbreak is quickly spreading throughout india and globe short-term modeling predictions give time-critical statistics for decisions on containment and mitigation policies a big problem for short-term prediction is the evaluation of important parameters and how they alter when the first interventions reveal an effect in the absence of any therapeutics or licensed vaccine antivirals isolation of populations diagnosed with covid-19 and quarantine of populations feared exposed to covid-19 were used to control the rapid spread of infection during this alarming situation forecasting is of utmost priority for health care planning and to control the sars-cov-2 virus with limited resources we proposed a mathematical model that monitors the dynamics of six compartments namely susceptible s asymptomatic a reported symptomatic i unreported symptomatic u quarantine q and recovered r individuals collectively termed saiuqr that predicts the course of the epidemic our saiuqr model discriminates between reported and unreported infected individuals which is important as the former are typically isolated and hence less likely to spread the infection a detailed theoretical analysis has been done for our saiuqr model in terms of the basic reproduction number r 0  all the analytical findings are verified numerically for the estimated model parameters we have calibrated our saiuqr model with real observed data on the covid-19 outbreak in the four provinces of india the basic reproduction number for all the provinces is greater than unity which resulted in a substantial outbreak of covid-19 based on the simulation our saiuqr model predict that on june 13 2020 the daily new covid-19 cases will be around 15 454 12 96  and cumulative number of covid-19 cases will be around 661 23955 514 4487 in jharkhand gujarat chandigarh and andhra pradesh respectively after a novel strain of covid-19 was detected in wuhan the city of hubei province china in december 2019 1  an exponentially increasing number of patients in mainland china were identified with sars-cov-2 immediately the chinese health authorities to initiate radical measures to control the epidemic coronavirus in spite of these radical measures a sars-cov-2 coronavirus pandemic ensued in the subsequent months and china became the epicenter sars-cov-2 viruses are enveloped non-segmented positive-sense rna viruses that belong to the coronaviridae family and the order nidovirales and are extensively disseminated among humans as well as mammals 2  the covid-19 is re-sponsible for a range of symptoms together with fever dry cough breathing difficulties fatigue and lung infiltration in severe cases similar to those created by sars-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and mers-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections 3  sars-cov-2 has already crossed the earlier history of two coronavirus epidemics sars-cov and mers-cov posing the substantial threat to the world people health problem as well as economical problem after the second world war 4  according to the world health organization report dated 29 may 2020 reported 5596550 total cases and 353373 deaths worldwide 5  till date there is no licensed vaccine drugs and effective therapeutics available for sars-cov-2 or covid-19 due to absence of pharmaceutical interventions govt of various countries are adopting different strategies to control the outbreak and the most common one is the nation-wide lockdown it was started with the local govt of wuhan by temporarily prevention of all public traffics within the city on january 23 2020 and soon followed by other cities in hubei province 6  in the absence of drug or specific antivirals for sars-cov-2 viruses maintaining social distancing is the only way to mitigate the human-to-human transmission for coronavirus diseases and thus the other countries also incorporated the strict lockdown quarantines and curfews in india the first coronavirus case was reported in keralas thrissur district on january 30 2020 when a student returned back from wuhan the sprawling capital of chinas hubei province 7  the govt of india has implemented a complete nationwide lockdown throughout the country on and from march 25 2020 for 21 days following one day janata curfew on march 22 2020 to control the coronavirus or sars-cov-2 pandemic in india 8  due to massive spread of coronavirus diseases the govt of india has extended the lockdown and it is going on phase 4 from may 18 2020 to may 31 2020 besides the implementation of nationwide lockdown the ministry of health and family welfare mohfw of india recommended different individual hygiene measures for example frequent hand washing social distancing use of mask avoid gathering and touching eyes mouth and nose etc 9  the govt also ceaselessly using different media and social network to aware the public regarding coronavirus diseases and its precautions albeit the factors such as diverse and huge population the unavailability of specific therapeutics drugs or licensed vaccines inadequate evidences regarding the mechanism of disease transmission make it strenuous to combat against the coronavirus diseases throughout india to control the transmission of covid-19 lockdown is a magnificent measure but testing is also an important factor to identify the symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals the symptomatic individuals should be reported by the public health agencies to separate them from the uninfected or asymptomatic individuals for their icu intensive care unit treatment also from an economic viewpoint the strict lockdown may be the cause of a substantial financial crisis in near future in particular the lockdown in high dense countries can mitigate the disease transmission rate although entirely control not be obtainable thus to survive the economical status of a country a strict lockdown for a long period is not advisable at all in any situations hence there should be a acceptable balance between the two different characteristics of governmental strategies strict lockdown and healthy economical situations albeit few questions remains to answer whether this cluster containment policy can be effective in mitigating sars-cov-2 transmission or not  if not then what can be the possible solutions to mitigate the transmission of sars-cov-2 viruses  these questions can only be replied by investigating the dynamics and forecasting of a mechanistic compartmental model for sars-cov-2 transmission and comparing the outcomes with real scenarios a plenty of mathematical models has been investigated to study the transmission dynamics and forecasting of covid-19 outbreak 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20  kucharski and colleagues 10 performed a model-based analysis for sars-cov-2 viruses and calculate the reproduction number r 0  235 where the authors have taken into account all the positive cases of wuhan china till march 05 2020 wu and colleagues 12 studied a susceptible-exposedinfectious-recovered seir model to simulate the epidemic in wuhan city and compute the basic reproduction number r 0  268 and predict their model based on the data recorded from december 31 2019 to january 28 2020 tang and colleagues 11 developed a compartmental model to study the transmission dynamics of covid-19 and calculate the basic reproduction number r 0  647 which is very high for the infectious diseases recently fanelli  piazza 13 analyzed and predicted the characteristics of sars-cov-2 viruses in the three mostly affected countries till march 2020 with an aid of the mathematical modeling stochastic based regression model also been studied by ribeiro and colleagues 14 to predict the scenarios of the most affected states of brazil chakraborty  ghosh 15 investigate a hybrid arima-wbf model to predict the various sars-cov-2 affected countries throughout the world khajanchi and colleagues 18 developed a compartmental model to forecast and control of the outbreak of covid-19 in the four states of india and the overall india sarkar  khajanchi 16 developed a mathematical model to study the model dynamics and forecast the sars-cov-2 viruses in seventeenth provinces of india and the overall india a discrete-time sir model introducing dead compartment system studied by anastassopoulou et al 19 to portray the dynamics of sars-cov-2 outbreak giordano and colleagues 20 established a new mathematical model for covid-19 pandemic and predict that restrictive social distancing can mitigate the widespread of covid-19 among the human a couple of seminal papers has been investigated to study the transmission dynamics of covid-19 or sars-cov-2 viruses for different countries including mexico city chicago and wuhan the sprawling capital of central chinas hubei province 21 22 23 24  short-term prediction is too important as it gives time-critical information for decisions on containment and mitigation strategies 18 25  a major problem for short-term predictions is the evaluation of important epidemiological parameters and how they alter when first interventions reveal an effect the main objective of this work is to develop a new mathematical model that describes the transmission dynamics and forecasting of covid-19 or sars-cov-2 pandemic in the four different provinces of india namely jharkahnd andhra pradesh chandigarh and gujarat we estimated the model parameters of four different states of india and fitted our compartmental model to the daily confirmed cases and cumulative confirmed cases reported between march 15 2020 to may 24 2020 we compute the basic reproduction number r 0 for the four different states based on the estimated parameter values we also perform the short-term predictions of the four different states of india from may 25 2020 to june 13 2020 and it shows the increasing trends of covid-19 pandemic in four different provinces of india the remaining part of this manuscript has been organized in the following way in the section 2 we describe the formulation of the compartmental model for covid-19 and its basic assumptions section 3 describes the theoretical analysis of the model which incorporates the positivity and boundedness of the system computation of the basic reproduction number r 0  existence of the biologically feasible singular points and their local stability analysis in the same section we perform the global stability analysis for the infection free equilibrium point e 0 and the existence of transcritical bifurcation at the threshold r 0  1 in the section 4 we conduct some model simulations to validate our analytical findings by using the estimated model parameters for jharkhand the state of india the parameters are estimated for the real world example on covid-19 for four different states of india and perform a short-term prediction based on the estimated parameter values a discussion in the section 5 concludes the manuscript a compartmental mathematical model has been developed to study the transmission dynamics of covid-19 outbreak in india and throughout the world we adopt a variant that focuses some important epidemiological properties of covid-19 or sars-cov-2 coronavirus diseases based on the health status we stratify the total human population into six compartments namely susceptible or uninfected s asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic infected a symptomatic reported infected i unreported infected u  quarantine q and recovered r individuals collectively termed saiuqr at any instant of time the total population is denoted by n  s ai u qr depending on the six state variables we aim to develop an autonomous system using first order nonlinear ordinary differential equations in the model formulation quarantine refers to the separation of coronavirus infected population from the general population when the individuals are infected but clinical symptoms has not yet developed whereas isolation refers to the separation of coronavirus infected population when the population already identified the clinical symptoms our mathematical model introduces some demographic effects by assuming a proportional natural mortality rate   0 in each of the six compartments in addition our model incorporates a constant recruitment of susceptible populations into the region at the rate  s per unit time this parameter represents new birth immigration and emigration the parameter  s represents the probability of disease transmission rate however the disease transmission from vulnerable to infected individuals for our model the class is a depend on various factors namely safeguard precautions use of mask social distancing etc and hygienic safeguard use of hand sanitizer taken by the susceptible individuals as well as infected population in our model formulation we incorporate the asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic infected undetected individuals which is important to better understand the transmission dynamics of covid-19 which also studied by giordano et al 20 and xiao-lin et al 21  in our model formulation we assumed that the covid-19 virus is spreading when a vulnerable person come into contact with an asymptomatic infected individuals the uninfected individuals decreases after infection obtained through interplays among a susceptible population and an infected individuals who may be asymptomatic reported symptomatic and unreported symptomatic for these three compartments of infected population the transmission coefficients are  s  a   s  i  and  s  u respectively we consider  s as the disease transmission rate along with the adjustment factors for asymptomatic  a  reported symptomatic  i and unreported symptomatic  u individuals the interplays among infected populations asymptomatic reported symptomatic and unreported symptomatic and susceptible individuals can be modeled in the form of total individuals using standard mixing incidence 26 27 28 29  the quarantined population can either move to the susceptible or infected compartment reported and unreported depending on whether they are infected or not 30  with a portion  s  here  q is the rate at which the quarantined uninfected contacts were released into the wider community asymptomatic individuals were exposed to the virus but clinical symptoms of sars-cov-2 viruses has not yet developed the asymptomatic individuals decreases due to contact with reported and unreported symptomatic individuals at the rate  a with a portion   0 1 and become quarantine at the rate  a  also the asymptomatic individuals become recov-ered at the rate  a and has a natural mortality rate  a fraction of quarantine individuals become reported infected individuals at the rate  q with a portion  s where  s  0 1 as we know that an individual is whether infected by coronavirus diseases or not can be identified by rt-pcr screening test and a person with negative results with the rt-pcr screening test may yet be coronavirus positive as it may take around 7-21 days to express the coronavirus symptoms 31  thus a fraction of coronavirus positive class can be considered as reported symptomatic individuals  and unreported symptomatic individuals 1   the reported symptomatic individuals separated from the general populations and move to the isolated class or hospitalized class for clinical treatment also it can be noticed that once an individual recovered from the sars-cov-2 diseases has a very little chance to become infected again for the same disease 31  therefore we assume that none of the recovered individ-uals move to the susceptible or uninfected class again in our mathematical model formulation we assume that the reported infected individuals i are unable to spread or transmit the viruses as they are kept completely isolated from the susceptible or uninfected individuals as the reported infected individuals are moved to the hospital or intensive care unit icu 32  for our modeling perspective we are mainly interested in predictions over a relatively short time window within which the temporary immunity is likely still to be in placed and the possibility of reinfection would negligibly affect the total number of uninfected populations and so there would be no considerable difference in the evolution of the epidemic curves we consider social mixing patterns are introduced into our contagion parameters in an average fashion over the entire individuals irrespective of age based on these biological assumptions we develop the following mathematical model using a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations to study the outbreak of covid-19 or sars-cov-2 coronavirus diseases the model is supplemented by the following initial values in our model t  t 0 is the time in days t 0 represents the starting date of the outbreak for our system 1 the transmission dynamics of the covid-19 is illustrated in the figure 1  the description of the model parameters are presented in the table i  in this section we provide the basic properties of the saiuqr model 1 including positivity and boundedness of the solutions basic reproduction number and the biologically feasible singular points and their stability analysis subject to the non-negative initial values theorem iii1 the solutions of the saiuqr system 1 with the initial values 2 are defined on r 6  remain positive for all t  0 proof iii1 the proof of this theorem is given in the appendix a theorem iii2 the solutions of the saiuqr system 1 with the initial conditions 2 are uniformly bounded in the region  proof iii2 the proof of this theorem is given in the appendix b in any infectious disease modeling the basic reproduction number is the key epidemiological parameter for describing the characteristics of the diseases the basic reproduction number symbolized by r 0 and is defined as the number of secondary infected individuals caused by a single infected individuals in the entire susceptible individuals 33  the dimensionless basic reproduction number r 0 quantifies the expectation of the disease die out or the spreading of the diseases for r 0  1 describes on an average an infected population spreads less than a new infective during the course of its infection period and thus the diseases can die out for a schematic representation of the mechanistic saiuqr model for the transmission dynamics of covid-19 or sars-cov-2 the interaction among different stages of individuals is shown in the graphical scheme s susceptible or uninfected population a asymptomatic infected population i covid-19 reported symptomatic infected individuals u covid-19 unreported symptomatic infected individuals q quarantine individuals and r covid-19 recovered individuals biological interpretations of the model parameters are given in the table i describes each infected individuals spread on an average more than 1 new infection and the disease can spread throughout the population various techniques can be used to compute the basic reproduction number r 0 for an epidemic outbreak in our present study we use the next generation matrix to evaluate r 0 33  in our compartmental model the following classes are explicitly related to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus diseases a i u  and q thus from the saiuqr model system 1 we get the matrices f for the new infection and v for the transition terms are given by respectively the variational matrix for the saiuqr system 1 can be evaluated at an infection-free singular point the basic reproduction number r 0  f v 1  where f v 1  represents the spectral radius for a next gener-ation matrix f v 1  therefore from the saiuqr model 1 we get the basic reproduction number r 0 as the saiuqr model 1 has two biologically feasible equilibrium points namely the expression of a  is given by it can be observed the the infection free singular point e 0 s 0  a 0  q 0  i 0  u 0  r 0  is always feasible and the endemic equilibrium point e  s   a   q   i   u   r   is feasible if the following condition holds in the present subsection we investigate the linear stability analysis for the saiuqr model 1 for the two feasible steady states by using the techniques of linearization we investigate the local dynamics of the complicated system of the coronavirus compartmental model generally we linearize the saiuqr model around each of the feasible steady states and perturb the compartmental model by a very small amount and observe whether the compartmental model returns to that steady states or converges to any other steady states or attractor the local stability analysis aids in understanding the qualitative behavior of the complex nonlinear dynamical system by using the following theorem we prove the local stability of the infection free singular point the proof of this theorem is given in appendix c theorem iii 4 the infection free steady state e 0 is globally asymptotic stable for r 0  1 in the bounded region  proof iii 4 the proof of this theorem is given in appendix d theorem iii5 the saiuqr model system 1 admits a locally asymptotic stable around the endemic equilibrium point e  for r 0  1 also the system 1 experiences forward bifurcation at r 0  1 proof iii5 the proof of this theorem is given in appendix e in this section we conduct some numerical illustrations to validate our analytical findings analytically we perform the local stability analysis for infection free steady state e 0 and a unique endemic equilibrium point e   we also perform the transcritical bifurcation at the threshold r 0  1 and the global stability analysis for disease-free steady state e 0  in order to validate the analytical calculations we used the estimated parameter values for jharkhand the state of india and the techniques for parameter estimation are described in the subsection iv a we have calibrated our saiuqr model 1 with the observed daily new covid-19 cases we have considered three states of india namely jharkahnd gujarat andhra pradesh and one city of india namely chandigarh the daily new covid-19 cases are collected from the first covid-19 case reported and up to may 24 2020 the daily reported covid-19 data were obtained from covid19 india httpswwwcovid19indiaorg 34  we have estimated six model parameters namely  s   a   i   u   a and  q  out of fourteen system parameters for the system 1 by using least square method 35  the values of these parameters and the initial population size plays an important role in the model simulation the parameters are estimated by assuming the initial population size the initial population are presented in the table iii  three days moving average filter has been applied to the daily covid-19 cases to smooth the data the daily reported confirmed covid-19 cases are fitted with the model simulation by using the least square method the estimated parameter values are listed in the table ii  different set of parameter values locally minimizes the root mean square error rmse and we have considered the set of parameter values which gives the realistic value of the basic reproduction number r 0  rmse is the measure of the accuracy of the fitting data and the rmse is defined as follows where n represents the size of the observed data oi is the reported daily confirmed covid-19 cases and m i represents the model simulation the figure 2 shows  in this section we have validated our analytically findings by using numerical simulations for the parameter values in the table i and the estimated parameter values  in the table ii for our saiuqr model for the coronavirus diseases the parameter values are estimated for the observed covid-19 data for the three states of india namely jharkhand gujarat and andhra pradesh and for the city chandigarh our analytical findings stated in the theorem iii3 shows that the disease free equilibrium point e 0 is locally asymptotically stable with r 0  1 and the theorem iii5 stated that a unique endemic equilibrium point e  is locally asymptotically stable for r 0  1 the numerical simulations of the saiuqr model system 1 the theorem iii5 states that the saiuqr model system 1 undergoes a transcritical bifurcation at the threshold r 0  1 we have plotted the covid-19 reported symptomatic individuals i in the r 0  i plane by gradually increasing the disease transmission rate  s see the figure 4  the model parameter values are  a  0264  i  076  u  096  a  00012  q  00015   003  s  1200 and the other parameter values listed in the table i  we vary the disease transmission rate  s from 067 to 110 and computed the basic reproduction number r 0 and the covid-19 reported symptomatic individuals i the numerically computed values are presented in the figure 4  which clearly shows that the system 1 experiences transcritical bifurcation at the threshold r 0  1 the blue curve represents the stable endemic equilibrium point e   black line represents the stable disease free equilibrium point e 0 and the red line represents the unstable branch of the disease free equilibrium point e 0  hence the figure 4 shows that disease free equilibrium point e 0 is stable for the reproduction number r 0  1 and an endemic equilibrium point e  is stable for the reproduction number r 0  1 from the biological point of view it can be described that the model system 1 will be free from covid-19 for the reproduction number r 0  1 and the coronavirus diseases will spread throughout the people for r 0  1 figure 5 a represents the reproduction number r 0 decreases as the recovery rate  i of reported infected individuals increases and the reproduction number r 0 becomes less than one for  s  085 and  s  076 this indicates that the disease free equilibrium point e 0 switches the stability of the model system 1 as  i changes but the reproduction number r 0 remains grater than one for the disease transmission rate  s  110 and  s  095 that is for large  s unique endemic equilibrium point remains locally asymptotically stable even if  i changes in terms of covid-19 diseases this interprets that if the rate of recovery for infected individuals  i  be increased which can be done by vaccinees or specific therapeutics the model system 1 changes its stability to disease free equilibrium e 0 from endemic equilibrium e  but if the transmission of the disease  s  is high enough then by vaccines or specific therapeutics the system 1 can not change its stability from endemic equilibrium to disease free equilibrium figure 5 b represents the reproduction number r 0 increases as  a transition rate from asymptomatic in- dividuals to symptomatic individuals increases but the reproduction number r 0 remains less than one for the disease transmission rate  s  055 and  s  045 for  s  066 and  s  076 the basic reproduction number r 0 becomes grater than one and the saiuqr model system 1 loses the stability of disease free equilibrium point e 0  thus to flatten the covid-19 curve in any of the four provinces of india reduction of the transmission of the covid-19 disease is utmost priority even if the recovery rate increased by medication biologically it means that to mitigate the covid-19 diseases the people must have to maintain the social distancing contact tracing by avoiding the mass gathering the predictive competency for the saiuqr model system 1 requires valid estimation of the system parameters  a rate of transition from asymptomatic to symptomatic infected individuals  q the rate that the quarantine become susceptible  fraction of asymptomatic infectious that become reported symptomatic infectious  a rate at which asymptomatic individuals become quar-antined in the figure 6a  we plot the reproduction number r 0 as a function of  a and  q for the parameter values in the table i and estimated parameters for the state jharkhand to encapsulate the significance of these values in the evolution of covid-19 outbreak from the figure 6a  it can be observed that the parameters have a little influence on the outbreak of the coronavirus diseases as the parameters  a and  q has a little contribution for the reproduction number r 0  in the figure  6 b we plot the reproduction number r 0 as a function of  and  a for the parameter values in the table i and estimated parameters for the state jharkhand to encapsulate the significance of these values in the evolution of covid-19 outbreak the figure 6 b shows that the parameters  and  a are more influential in increasing the reproduction number r 0  thus to control the outbreak of covid-19 we must control the parameters  and  a  the correctness of these values rely on the input of medical and biological epidemiologists thus the fraction  of reported symptomatic infected individuals may be substantially increased by public health reporting measures with greater efforts to recognize all the present cases our model simulation reveals the effect of an increase in this fraction  in the value of the reproduction number r 0  as evident in the figure 6 b for the covid-19 epidemic in the four sates of india mathematical modeling of infectious diseases can provide short-term and long-term prediction of the pandemic 16 18 20 32  due to absence of any licensed vaccines or specific therapeutics forecasting is of utmost importance for strategies to control and prevention of the diseases with limited resources it should be noted that here we can predict the epidemiological traits of sars-cov-2 or covid-19 for short-term only as the governmental strategies can be altered time to time resulting in the corresponding changes in the associated parameters of the proposed saiuqr model also it is true that the scientists are working for drugs andor effective vaccines against covid-19 and the presence of such pharmaceutical interventions will substantially change the outcomes 36  thus in this study we performed a short-term prediction for our saiuqr model system 1 using the parameter values in the table i and the estimated parameter values in the table ii  using the observed data up to may 24 2020 a short-term prediction for 20 days has been done for daily new covid-19 cases first column and cumulative confirmed cases second column are presented in the figure 7  the black dot-dashed curve represents the short-term prediction of our saiuqr model from may 25 2020 to june 13 2020 red shaded region is the standard deviation band of our saiuqr model simulated curve the standard deviations are computed from the model simulation based on the estimated data in each of four states we plot the standard deviation bands at a standard deviation level above and below the model simulation for different days standard deviation band gives an estimation of the deviation of the actual model data the trend of the predicted daily covid-19 cases is increasing for all the four provinces of india prediction of the saiuqr model should be regarded as an estimation of the daily infected population and cumulative confirmed cases of the four states of india from the saiuqr model simulation we can predict that the estimated daily new reported covid-19 cases on june 13 2020 will be approximately 15 454 12 and 96 in jharkhand gujarat chandigarh and andhra pradesh respectively see the left column of the figure 7  our saiuqr model simulation predict that the confirmed cumulative number of cases on june 13 2020 will be approximately 661 23955 514 and 4487 in jharkhand gujarat chandigarh and andhra pradesh respectively see the right column of the figure 7  the sars-cov-2 pandemic in india is a potential menace throughout the country due to its exponential growth everyday the new cases are reported around 5-6 thousands and more than that from different states and territories of india which is an alarming situation as with the second most populated country worldwide 34  due to absence of any licensed vaccine therapeutics or treatment and with a peculiar epidemiological traits of sars-cov-2 one would depend on the qualitative control of the diseases rather than complete elimination during this period of an epidemic when person-to-person transmission is confirmed and the reported cases of sars-cov-2 viruses are rising throughout the globe prediction is of utmost priority for health care planning and to manage the virus with limited resource furthermore mathematical modeling can be a powerful tool in designing strategies to manage exponentially spreading coronavirus diseases in absence of any antivirals or diagnostic test in this study we proposed and analyzed a new compartmental mathematical model for sars-cov-2 viruses to forecast and control the outbreak in the model formulation we incorporate the transmission variability of asymptomatic and unreported symptomatic individuals we also incorporate the symptomatic infected populations who are reported by the public health services we assume that reported infected individuals will nolonger associated into the infection as they are isolated and move to the hospitals or intensive care unit icu in our model we incorporate the constant transmission rate in the early exponential growth phase of the sars-cov-2 diseases as identified in 18 29  we model the role of the govt imposed restrictions for the public in india beginning on march 25 2020 as a time-dependent decaying transmission rate after march 25 2020 but due to less stringent lockdown exponentially increasing the disease transmission rate we are able to fit with increasing accuracy our model simulations to the indian reported cases data up to may 24 2020 table i  stability of the saiuqr system 1 exchange at the threshold r0  1 we fit our saiuqr model for the daily confirmed cases and cumulative confirmed cases of the four different provinces of india namely jharkhand andhra pradesh chandigarh and gujarat with data up to may 24 2020 the estimated model parameters for different states of india are given in the table ii and the corresponding  initial population size are listed in the table iii  it can be observed that the basic reproduction number for four different provinces of india namely jharkhand andhra pradesh chandigarh and gujarat are 16877 12435 14775 and 18830 respectively which demonstrates the disease transmission rate is quite high that basically indicates the substantial outbreak of the covid-19 diseases this higher value of reproduction number r 0 captures the outbreak of covid-19 phenomena in india based on the estimated parameter values our model simulation suggest that the rate of disease transmission need to be controlled otherwise india will enter in stage-3 of sars-cov-2 disease transmission within in a short period of time based on the estimated model parameters we have validated our detailed analytical findings our proposed saiuqr model has two biologically feasible singular points namely infection free steady state e 0 and a unique endemic steady state e  and they become locally asymptotically stable for r 0  1 and r 0  1 respectively analytically we have shown that the infection free steady state e 0 of the saiuqr model 1 is globally asymptotically stable for r 0  1 we also showed that the saiuqr model 1 experiences transcritical bifurcation at the threshold parameter r 0  1 which has been shown in the figure 4  the figure 3 blue curves and the figure 3 red curves represents the local asymp-totic stability as well as global asymptotic stability of the infection free steady state e 0 for r 0  1 and endemic steady state e  for r 0  1 respectively the calibrated model then utilized for short-term predictions in the four different states of india our saiuqr model performs well in case of all the four provinces of india namely jharkahnd chandigarh gujarat and andhra pradesh for daily confirmed cases and cumulative confirmed cases albeit the increasing or exponential pattern of daily new cases and cumulative confirmed cases of sars-cov-2 is well captured by our proposed model for all the four states of india which has been shown in the figure 2 our model simulation showed a short-term prediction for 20 days from may 25 2020 to june 13 2020 for daily confirmed cases and cumulative confirmed cases of the four provinces of india the short-term prediction for the four provinces of india will demonstrates the increasing pattern of the daily and cumulative cases in the near future see the figure 7  from the simulation our model predict that on june 13 2020 the daily confirmed cases of covid-19 of the four provinces of india namely jharkhand gujarat chandigarh and andhra pradesh will be 15 454 12 and 96 respectively see the left column of the figure 7  similarly from the simulation our model predict that on june 13 2020 the cumulative confirmed cases of covid-19 of the four provinces of india namely jharkhand gujarat chandigarh and andhra pradesh will be 661 23955 514 and 4487 respectively see the right column of the figure 7  it is worthy to mention that the scientists or clinicians are working for effective vaccine or therapeutics to eradicate andor control the outbreak of sars-cov-2 diseases and the existence of such pharmaceutical interventions will substantially change the outcomes 36 37  thus in this study we are mainly focusing on shortterm predictions for the covid-19 pandemic and subsequently there would be a very little chance to alter in corresponding parametric space but the framework of our present compartmental model provides some significant insights into the dynamics and forecasting of the spread and control of covid-19 moreover our model simulation suggest that the quarantine reported and unreported symptomatic individuals as well as government intervention polices like media effect lockdown and social distancing can play a key role in mitigating the transmission of covid-19 table i  all the data used in this work has been obtained from official sources 34  all data supporting the findings of this study are in the paper and available from the corresponding author on request subhas khajanchi and kankan sarkar designed and performed the research as well as wrote the paper  the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest proof to prove the positivity of the system 1 we show that any solution initiating from the non-negative octant r 6  remains positive for all t  0 in order to do this we have to prove that on each hyperplane bounding the non-negative octant the vector field points into r 6   for our system 1 we observe that therefore the positivity of the solutions starting in the interior of r 6  is assured r 6  is positively invariant set of the saiuqr model system 1 proof to prove the boundedness of the saiuqr system 1 we add all the model equations which gives n  s  a  i  u  q  r taking the differentiation gives without any loss of generality we can assume that lim sup t st  s   lim sup t at  s   lim sup t it  s   lim sup t u t  s   lim sup t qt  s   and lim sup t rt  s   thus we have a bounded set   s a i u q r  r 6   0  s a i u q r   s   which is also a positively invariant set with respect to the saiuqr model 1  thus any solution trajectory starting from an interior point of r 6  ultimately enter into the region  and remains there for all finite time this results indicates that none of the individuals grow unboundedly or exponentially for a finite time window appendix c proof of theorem iii3 proof the variational matrix around the infection free steady state e 0 for the saiuqr model system 1 is given by the above jacobian matrix j e 0 has two repeated eigenvalues which are - while the other four eigenvalues are the roots of the following characteristics equation which can be rewritten in the following form  s  a  a   a   a       a  s  i  a   a   a     i     1   a  s  u  a   a   a     u     1   s  q  a  s  i  a   a   a     i     q      1 denote the above expression as the following m 1    s  a  a   a   a       a  s  i  a   a   a     i     1   a  s  u  a   a   a     u     1   s  q  a  s  i  a   a   a     i     q       m 11   m 22   m 33   m 44  say substitute   x  iy and we know that re  0 then the above expression leads to m 11    s  a  a   a   a      m 11 x  m 11 0 m 22    a  s  i  a   a   a     i      m 22 x  m 22 0 m 33   1   a  s  u  a   a   a     u      m 33 x  m 33 0 1   s  q  a  s  i  a   a   a     i     q      m 44 x  m 44 0 thus m 11 0  m 22 0  m 33 0  m 44 0  m 1 0  r 0  1 which gives that m 1   1 therefore for r 0  1 all the eigenvalues of the characteristics equation m 1   1 are real or have negative real parts thus for r 0  1 all the eigenvalues are negative and hence the infection free steady state e 0 is locally asymptotically stable now if we consider r 0  1 that is m 1 0  1 then lim  m 1   0 then there exists   1  0 in such a way that m 1   1   1 this indicates that there exists non-negative eigenvalue   1  0 for the variational matrix j e 0  hence the infection free steady state e 0 is unstable for r 0  1 proof to prove the global asymptotic stability of the infection free steady state e 0 s 0  a 0  q 0  i 0  u 0  r 0  we can rewrite the saiuqr model 1 in the following form where x  s r  r 2 represents its components the number of susceptible or uninfected individuals and v  a i u q  r 4 represents its components the number of infected individuals incorporating asymptomatic quarantine and infectious etc e 0  x   0 designates the infection free steady state for the saiuqr model system 1  for the compartmental model 1 f x v  and gx v  are defined as follows from the above expression of gx v  it is clear that gx 0  0 the following two conditions c1 and c2 must be met to assure the global asymptotic stability c1 for dx dt  f x 0 x  is globally asymptotically stable c2 gx v   bv  gx v  gx v   0 for x v    where b  d i gx   0 is an m-matrix the non-diagonal components are non-negative and in the region  the saiuqr model system 1 is biologically feasible the compartmental model 1 stated in the condition c1 can be expressed as analytically solve the above system of equations we obtain that st  s   expts0  s   and rt  exptr0 considering t   st  s  and rt  0 thus x  is globally asymptotically stable for dx dt  f x 0 thus the first condition c1 holds for the system 1 now the matrices b and gx v  for the saiuqr model system 1 can be expressed as b      a   a   a     a  s  i  s  u  s 0  a  i   it is clear that b is a m-matrix as all its non-diagonal components are non-negative also gx v   0 in the region  as st  n t also we showed that x  is a globally asymptotically stable steady state of the system dx dt  f x 0 therefore the infection free steady state e 0 of the saiurq model 1 is globally asymptotically stable in the region  for r 0  1 and b  6 ik1  k  i  2 f k 0 0 x i  s  by substituting the values of all the nonzero second-order partial derivatives and the left and right eigenvectors from above analysis at the threshold  s   c s  we have a    s  2  s   2  3  a   i    2  4  a   u    2  5  a   2  6  a   3  4  i   u    3  5  i   3  6  i   4  6  u   4  5  u  2 2 2  a  2 2 3  i  2 2 4  u  and b   2  s   2  a   3  i   4  u  from the above expressions it can be observed that a  0 and b  0 therefore due to the remark 1 of the well-known theorem 41 by castillo-chavez  song 38  and by khajanchi et al 39 a transcritical bifurcation occurs at the basic reproduction number r 0  1 and the interior equilibrium point e  is locally asymptotically stable

has spread 28 across the world and has been characterized as a global pandemic the propagation 29 from asymptomatic polymerase chain reaction pcr-positive individuals represents a 30 complicating factor in the efforts to control the covid-19 pandemic we examined the 31 course of pcr assays and duration of viral shedding in 23 asymptomatic or mild 32 covid-19 patients from the cruise ship who were admitted to our hospital among 33 these 23 cases the median duration of viral shedding was 19 days range 6-37 days 34 from initial viral detection eight cases 35 had another positive pcr result after 35 testing negative once although the duration of viral shedding was approximately 3 36 weeks the infectivity and transmissibility period from asymptomatic and mild 37 covid-19 cases is unclear further studies are needed to determine how long such 38 asymptomatic and mild covid-19 cases have the infectivity 39 wuhan china has spread across the world and has been characterized by the world 51 health organization as a global pandemic bedford et al 2020  in february 2020 at 52 yokohama port japan an outbreak of covid-19 among passengers and crew of the 53 diamond princess cruise ship occurred with approximately 700 confirmed cases all 54 patients including those with asymptomatic and mild disease were transferred to 55 japanese medical institutions including our hospital for quarantine and treatment until 56 viral shedding stopped kakimoto et al 2020 zhang et al 2020  the information 57 that can be gleaned from the results of polymerase chain reaction pcr assay about the 58 time course of asymptomatic or mild covid-19 is limited hu et al 2020 zhou et al 59 2020  therefore we reported the course of pcr assays and duration of viral shedding 60 in 23 asymptomatic or mild covid-19 patients from the cruise ship who were admitted 61 to our hospital 62 we performed a retrospective review of these 25 laboratory-confirmed 63 covid-19 cases whose oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swab samples were positive 64 for sars-cov-2 by quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr while at the government 65 quarantine facility before admission to our hospital and who were

achieve pcr negativity in asymptomatic patients    epidemiology of covid-19 cemal bulut yasuyuki kato   coronoviruses have been reported as causes of mild and moderate respiratory infections forover 50 years 1 even though this group of viruses have been isolated from many different animals bats are accepted major natural reservoir of coronaviruses 23 four human coronavirus 229e hku1 nl63 and oc43 are known as causes of common cold in humans 1 however recently-detected coronaviruses sars cov 2002 mers-cov 2012 completely altered all known approaches about this virus group because these viruses caused severe acute respiratory infections and nosocomial outbreaks in the end of 2019 a novel coronavirus now known as sars-cov-2 2019 suddenly emerged in wuhan china the world health organization declared that the epidemic is a public health emergency of international concern on january 31 2020 as of april 16 2020 the emerging coronavirus infection covid-19 has been spreading worldwide causing over 2 million cases and over 137 thousand of death in as much as this disease recently taken a significant place in our daily practice as a new group of respiratory diseases due to their higher rates of transmissibility hospitalization intensive care unit admission severity of disease mortality and so on we should pay more attention than past to prevention and treatment of coronavirus infection  the first cases of coronavirus disease covid-19 were directly related to an animal market in wuhan china early investigations suggested that the origin of sarscov-2 may be bats zhou et al demonstrate that sars cov-2 possesses 96 nucleotide identity with a bat coronavirus for instance betacovratg132013 4 an epidemic curve of infection is a statistical chart used in epidemiology to visualize the onset of the coronavirus outbreak in an epidemic curve there are three zones increasing plateau and declining phases  increasing phase this period is affected by many different parameters such as country demographics age distribution preparedness of health system to an outbreak implementation of some preventive measures country reaction time to a pandemic reaction of society to new implementing rules different countries can exhibit quite different curve patterns and these facts could complicate to make any assumption about pandemic pattern for a country figure 1 however it seems that this period takes generally 3 or 4 weeks for covid-19 table 1 plateau phase at this phase disease incidence is stable according to daily country reports it takes 2 or 3 weeks for covid-19 table1 decreasing phase today we have only chinas data about this phase figure 2 showing that 2 or 3 weeks later disease activity could be detected very low levels the incubation period of covid-19 was defined 52 days 95 ci 41125 days 51 days 95 ci 45 to 58 days and 4 days in three separate study 56 however in a familial cluster of 5 patients this period was reported between 1 and 19 days 7 these data show that the incubation period of covid-19 was similar to mers and sars and its a bit longer than influenza 8 asymptomatic infection has a special importance as a source of disease in the community especially asymptomatic infants and children may take an important role in human-to-human transmission 13 dong and colleagues report that over 90 of pediatric patients could be asymptomatic or could have mild or moderate disease 11 it seems that asymptomatic infection could be detected at every age although it was frequent at younger ages 14 these asymptomatic patients could cause familial clusters 15 according to tian et al asymptomatic infection rate was 5 whereas in diamond princess cruise ship berthed at tokyo bay japan it was nearly 18 1617 among a total of 72314 chinas cases 889 were classified as asymptomatic 1 9 however we need more accurate numbers before making some assumption about its public health importance current evidence shows that sars cov-2 was detected in air samples for up to 3 h in experimental models 19 gou et al found that air samples were positive in many different sites of wards 20 however when cheng et al collected 8 air samples at a distance of 10 cm from the patients chin with or without wearing a surgical mask they were not able to detect sars cov-2 21 another study although some environmental samples were positive for sars cov-2 all air samples were negative 22 in a study from iran authors reported that all air samples collected 5 m around the patients were negative 23  there are some limitations in these studies where different patients and methods were included in which stage of disease these samples were collected or what kind of procedures were performed today we have not known yet whether detected sars cov-2 in air samples are viable or not or whether detected viral loads are high enough to cause covid-19 it is important to realize here that prior to answering such questions and obtain some strong evidence taking airborne precautions for aerosol producing process seems to be logical fecal transmission is another unanswered question about covid-19 presence of patients with diarrhea 6 finding of fecal samples positive for sars cov by rt-pcr 2425 and detection of live virus in stool at least one study 25 suggest that stool is infectious even though it has not been verified by other studies 24 detection of sars cov-2 rna in patients fecal samples with negative respiratory tract samples for a mean of 11 days might be important 26 even if gastrointestinal involvement or digested sputum was the origin of virus existence in the stool this fact gives another reason to emphasize good personal hygiene possibility of fecal transmission remains unanswered until viable virus is detected in stool samples and new data is available to prove oral-fecal transmission which affect procedures for quarantine hospitalization and self-isolation practices intrauterine or transplacental transmission from infected pregnant women to their fetuses is another important point for transmission according to a study about analyzing of 38 pregnant women with covid-19 there were no signs of intrauterine transmission of sars cov-2 from mothers to their fetuses 27 studies also emphasized that the course of covid-19 was normal in pregnant women as opposed to those of sars and mers 2728 another study also reviewed that we have no definitive evidence of vertical transmission 29 people infected with sars cov-2 can be contagious prior to onset of symptoms in a study 13 of patients were contagious before onset of symptoms 30 in a familial cluster 3 of 8 laboratory-confirmed patients were asymptomatic 31 presymptomatic transmission would be a challenge to contact tracing 32 these kind of reports show that asymptomatic carriers emerge as an important target group to be taken into consideration in the control of the disease viral shedding might be longer than previously thought in a retrospective multicenter cohort study of 191 adult patients the median duration of viral shedding was found to be 20 days iqr 170240 and the longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days 33a study of postdischarge surveillance of patients after clinical recovery two patients were found positive 34 although covid-19 was reported from every aged patient patients with advanced age seem more susceptible to infection an early report shows that the most affected age group was middle ages table 2 among children and young adults infection rates were very low and it changed between 0840 in addition asymptomatic infection rate is quite high in this ages  early reports from china show that a reproductive number for covid-19 was 22 to 27 days 5 this means that the number of infected person will be doubled every 67 day a reproductive number of the outbreak on the diamond princess cruise ship also supports this preliminary data 35 however sanche et al found that a serial interval was 57 days 95 ci 3889 days 36 in another study which prefer to use real-time reproduction number rt instead of basic reproduction number r0 yuan et al showed that their rt values for italy germany france and spain were 31 443 656 and 395 respectively 37 liu et al found that average r0 was 38 14649 in their review of 14 studies 38 this study also showed that even in the same geographic region different ro values can be calculated by using different methods and assumptions it seems that we need more data to determine more accurate r0 value  increasing of mortality with advanced age is now a well-known fact it is also well known that success in prevention of covid-19 among these age groups directly determines th emortality rate in countries early chinese reports showed that mortality rate could be 3 times higher in older patients especially those at age over 80 9 in an italian study icu mortality was 26 whereas it was 36 after 65 of ages 42 demonstration of median days between onset of symptoms to death was shorter in older patients which is another important point 43 as of april 7 2020 in italy 83 of all covid-19 related deaths were reported in an age group over 70 years 44 in a korean study although overall mortality rate was 09 mortality rate in those aged 80 and over was 93 45 similar results were also reported form usa 45 disease progression can be rapid and the median survival time can be as short as 5 days in advanced aged patients 28  in a metaanalysis which evaluated 46248 patients from eight studies most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension diabetes mellitus cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases another finding of this study was that these comorbidities were more likely detected in severe patients 47 another metaanalysis showed that hypertension cardiovascular diseases diabetes mellitus smoking chronic obstructive pulmonary disease malignancy and chronic kidney disease were most frequently detected underlying diseases among hospitalized patients 48 in a summary report form china cdc preexisting comorbid condition can increase fatality rate by 105 for cardiovascular disease 73 for diabetes 63 for chronic respiratory disease 60 for hypertension and 56 for cancer 9 according to the italian weekly report on death from covid-19 most frequently detected comorbidities were hypertension diabetes mellitus ischemic heart disease and chronic renal failure as 72 315 274 and 235 respectively this report showed that patients without any comorbidities accounted for only 28 of those died from covid-19 40 in a pooled analysis risk of severe disease and mortality was higher in hypertensive patients nearly 25 fold increases especially among advanced aged individuals 49  every day we learn new data about the current pandemic of covid-19 since the outbreak has not been over yet the updates should be followed closely to monitor the disease and the risk factors as well as therapy modalities

coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 emerged in wuhan city hubei province china causing a cluster of pneumonia cases 1 since then the infection has spread worldwide causing more than a million cases and thousands of deaths httpsgisanddatamapsarcgiscomappsopsdashboardindexhtmlbda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6 to date we know that individuals of all ages are susceptible to sars-cov-2 and that the elderly and those with underlying comorbidities are more likely to develop complications however in spite of the growing amount of data available on the sars-cov-2 a clear understanding of how sars-cov-2 affects children is still missing the novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team reported the occurrence of a series of 72314 cases the authors describe incident infection in 416 children aged 010 057 of all cases with no reported fatality and 549 adolescents 076 aged 10 to 19 with one death reported 01 of all patients aged 19 years or less 1 however no further details were provided on this pediatric population we do not know about their comorbidities need for admission or invasive procedures other case reports mostly in chinese language are providing similarly reassuring information on the outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 in children 2 3 however the lancet reported a family cluster of sars-cov-2 infections in which an asymptomatic child developed ground-glass opacities as seen on a ct scan performed because of parents pressure 4 this finding although generally unnoticed by the experts highlights an important point children can be asymptomatic but they can nonetheless develop lung abnormalities this data can suggest that several other asymptomatically infected children might have developed lung disease in that case concerns regarding their viral load and spreading into the community should arise recently published studies are providing a better understanding of the sars-cov-2 infection and natural history zou and colleagues 5 analyzed the nasal and pharyngeal viral load in 17 symptomatic adult patients higher viral loads were detected soon after the onset of symptoms with higher viral loads detected in the nose than the throat importantly a comparable viral load was detected in asymptomatic patients tested suggesting the possibility of transmission from asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic patients similarly rothe et al 6 reported the first probable case of sars-cov-2 transmission in europe occurring from an asymptomatic adult during the incubation period recently first data regarding viral load in children have been published cai et al 7 described the sars-cov-2 infection in 10 children and confirmed a mild presentation and importantly documented prolonged virus shedding from both the respiratory tract and the feces during the convalescent stage also xu et al documented the fecal spreading of sars-cov-2 in children 8 importantly they found that fecal shedding lasted more than the nasopharyngeal one also in asymptomatic children suggesting that thay can play a role in the spread of the infection as they do with other respiratory viruses these observations have several implications particularly in regard to the daily pediatric practice to date sars-cov-2 infection in children is not bearing attention and interest because it seems not clinically relevant however as pediatricians we are aware that children are extremely prone to contract and spread viral infections since the sars-cov-2 test is performed only to symptomatic patients or known contacts how can we ensure that the small number of documented pediatric infections is not a huge underestimation moreover the isolation of common respiratory viruses from childrens nasal swabs is very frequent and in the current circumstances we could have mistakenly confirmed an exclusive etiological diagnosis without suspecting sars-cov-2 as an additional threat we know little about potential coinfections of sars-cov-2 and other more common respiratory viruses another consideration to bear in mind is that children are those that we all hug and kiss the most children spend much of their free time with the grandparents which appear to be the subjects affected the most by the sars-cov-2 infection are we sure that children although not significantly clinically involved are not playing a role in the sars-cov-2 diffusion to date epidemiological data and studies in these groups are lacking and worldwide guidelines suggest to test only symptomatic or suspected cases without mentioning the necessity to test children that although being asymptomatic have possibly a hidden burden of infection this would not be the first time children are neglected during an outbreak of infectious diseases a similar situation has been happening for the past decades with pediatric tuberculosis defined as neglected disease and human right violation 9 by major experts pediatric tuberculosis receives little attention and interest because it is usually paucisymptomatic and paucibacillary in children therefore has a milder impact on human population and economies however the epidemiology of this disease in the pediatric population plays a key role for a good understanding of the real tuberculosis burden and diffusion within the population is a similar phenomenon happening with pediatric sars-cov-2 infection it is possible that testing children would raise the number of confirmed cases dramatically with catastrophic economic consequences would world health authorities and national governments commit to a better understanding of the epidemiology of the pediatric sars-cov-2 infection at the dangerous cost of a rise of detected cases fear in the general population national and international restrictions and heavy economic consequences in the developed countries where sars-cov-2 is currently spreading the survival of children with severe morbidities immune disorders cancer or transplant is much higher than other countries including china due to high-standards of medical care we could suspect that the infection of compromised children carried out by peers potential asymptomatic carriers could lead to serious consequences although fatal cases have not yet been reported in the pediatric population we cannot exclude that the vulnerable children have not been infected yet to prevent the contagion of children at increased risk a better understanding of the dynamics of sars-cov-2 among children is necessary china and italy first and subsequently many other countries in the world have currently closed all schools from primary nurseries to universities this choice was based on the concern for aggregation and not on scientific evidence of a child-to-child transmission further information on transmission dynamics are needed as well as a good understanding of the real burden of sars-cov-2 infection in children in order to improve our screening practices children in high-burden areas should be tested and results correlated with their recent medical history as well as with infectious status of close contacts in order to understand how and how long they shed the virus moreover the better knowledge of the pediatric sars-cov-2 infection can clarify the underlying mechanisms that lead children to develop paucysymptomatic disease this in turn can help researchers in findings novel therapeutic strategies against viral infections in general and covid-19 in particular recenlty spanish researchers evaluated a large series of children evaluated in 30 tertiary hospitals during the first 2 weeks of the epidemic in spain 10 although they found that only 41 of the 4695 confirmed cases 08 were children younger than 18 years of age they only tested those evaluated in hospitals this is an important limitation since most children are expected to be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms 11 and to know the real burden of pediatric covid-19 and how this influences the sars-cov-2 diffusion we need to test children in the community in both high and low sars-cov-2 burden settings and compare results importantly children should be tested with both nasopharyngeal and rectal swab since authors state that pharyngeal and nasal swab sensitivity is as low as 3263 12 more importantly serological studies are necessary to understand the real burden of pediatric covid-19 we need to know that and stop neglecting and not considering children this will really help in understanding epidemics in general not only the current one and knowledge gained will help to better manage the next one which will come soon or later in conclusion according to the current estimates about 1 of all confirmed sars-cov-2 cases involve children this could be an underestimation as sars-cov-2 is not actively searched in children there are still many open questions about the epidemiology of sars-cov-2 infection in children the original contributions presented

reliable and sound conclusions on the transmission rates of the coronavirus by the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients methods we exclude the cases associated with the super-spreader and adopt more appropriate statistical methods including the permutation test and fishers exact test to reanalyze the covid-19 data from the city ningbo results after excluding the cases related to the super-spreader fishers exact test yields p-value84 which indicates stronger evidence of no difference in the transmission rates compared with the original analysis the odds ratio of transmission rates

tu-hsuan chang jhong-lin wu luan-yin chang   in december 2019 an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 occurred in wuhan hubei province china1 covid-19 has spread rapidly to other provinces of china and now internationally on january 30 2020 the world health organization who declared covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern pheic as of april 7 1279722 cases were confirmed and 72616 57 patients died in 211 countries in the beginning of the outbreak covid-19 was considered a zoonotic disease with limited human-to-human transmission initially pneumonia cases were linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market soon after this emerging coronavirus was found to be highly infectious the basic reproductive number ranged from 22 to 358 with a mean serial interval of 75 days1 2 3
 children are more susceptible than adults to some infectious diseases which may cause fatal outcomes for instance young children especially infants aged less than 6 months have higher mortality rates due to seasonal influenza infection than individuals in other age groups4 during enterovirus outbreaks enterovirus 71 and echoviruses lead to death in different age groups of children5

streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae type b were associated with high childhood mortality in the era without conjugate vaccines7
 the clinical spectrum of covid-19 ranges from asymptomatic to critically ill cases fever and cough are the most common manifestations in symptomatic adults8

9 it seems that sars-cov-2 is less invasive in children than in adults however reports about the clinical characteristics of pediatric covid-19 are limited facing this unknown and emerging pathogen we aimed to collect current evidence about covid-19 in children after full-text screening for eligibility and review two authors thc lyc independently extracted data disagreements were resolved by consensus the following items were extracted from each study if available author journal date of publication study design study country time period contact or travel history clinical symptoms laboratory results complications and chest computed tomography ct findings the publication date author hospital and case report content were carefully examined to avoid repeated calculation during data pooling the quality of studies included in meta-analysis was assessed using the newcastleottawa scale nos articles with poor quality score  03 were excluded we presented the data with descriptive statistics and pooled the available data for overall demonstration disease severity was categorized into four types according to officially published guideline in china 1 mild type asymptomatic or some upper respiratory tract infection signs 2 moderate type the above manifestations with pneumonia in imaging study 3 severe type disease progression with danger signs 4 critical type shock or organ failure needing intensive care10 the pooled data were further compared with those for laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome sars children reported in previous studies categorical data were compared with the chi-square test a p-value less than 005 by a two-tailed test was considered statistically significant when at least 3 studies with available data reported the same characteristic we used comprehensive meta-analysis version 3 biostat englewood nj to conduct meta-analysis we used random effects models to calculate the pooled frequency among each clinical manifestation or outcome the results are expressed as incidences and 95 cis i2 was calculated to examine statistical heterogeneity across the included studies i2  50 and a p  005 were considered substantial heterogeneity egger precision weighted linear regression tests and funnel plots were used to test potential publication bias if publication bias was present the trim and fill method would be performed and rosenthals fail-safe n would be calculated to evaluate the effect in table 1

 the clinical data in pediatric covid-19 have to be reviewed with caution most of the authors in our review used the diagnosis and treatment protocol for 2019-ncov 5th ed to categorize disease severity10 we unified the pooled data according to this classification based on this rule the disease severity in children seems to be mild or moderate mild disease makes the clinical features subtle and transient hence the proportion of asymptomatic patients varied among studies also one retrospective study was conducted before mid-january11 the result might be representative of the early stage of covid-19 outbreak therefore more symptomatic or severe cases were reported the same as adults8

9 which make moderate heterogeneity of the pooled data in clinical features despite the benign presentation of pediatric covid-19 a 1-year-old boy who was classified as critical in one report26 presented with vomiting and diarrhea for 6 days there was no obvious cough or respiratory tract symptom initially his condition deteriorated quickly after admission shock developed and soon progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards so he received mechanical ventilation acute kidney injury with hemodialysis also occurred during admission prompt diagnosis is more challenging in pediatric cases with unusual presentations compared with other pandemic or epidemic viral illnesses the small numbers of cases and low mortality rate in pediatric covid-19 are of great interest compared with the most relevant virus sars-cov sars-cov-2 causes less severe disease human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is proposed to be the key factor ace2 is the primary entry receptor for both coronaviruses after replacing four out of five important interface amino acid residues from sars-cov the affinity of sars-cov-2 for ace2 is weaker27 nevertheless sars-cov-2 still exhibits significant binding affinity to human ace2 the binding strength of sars-cov-2 to ace2 partially explains why it causes less severe disease than sars-cov but remains highly infectious however this result did not answer the question of why children are spared from severe covid-19 in previous studies sars-cov induced higher ace2 shedding than human coronavirus nl63 the differential downregulation of ace2 is related to lung injury28 in one study about the pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards increasing age led to an imbalance of the pulmonary renin-angiotensin system which correlates with aggravated inflammation and enhanced lung injury in a rat model29 nevertheless no age-dependent differences in ace and ace2 were seen in a prospective observational cohort study30 there is one hypothesis that smoking increases ace2 expression and thus enhances coronavirus entry into pulmonary epithelial cells31 undoubtedly smoking is more prevalent among adults than among children nonetheless some controversies exist32 another important fact is that children rarely have underlying diseases such as diabetes mellitus chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cardiovascular diseases as adults do these underlying diseases may predispose patients to critical conditions during covid-19 however the definite pathogenesis is unknown therefore the severity difference between adults and children with covid-19 needs more investigation the diagnosis of pediatric covid-19 is a challenge in china clinicians should have a suspicion of covid-19 when patients meet one epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations according to our literature review the main symptoms in pediatric covid-19 are fever and cough resembling common viral illness frequently encountered in school or kindergarten33 epidemiological features are the main diagnostic clue children with familial clustering contact with infected cases travel or living in areas with persistent local transmission within 14 days prior to disease onset are at risk of being infected with sars-cov-2 since covid-19 has spread to many other countries the epidemiological history should be modified outside mainland china in addition asymptomatic cases are a potential source of infection although only 1 of the patients had been reported as asymptomatic24 26 of infected children were asymptomatic in the pooled data namely children may act as silent carriers or spreaders34 notably an asymptomatic infection does not always mean a carrier chan et al presented a familial cluster with one family member a 10-year-old boy who tested positive for sars-cov-2 without symptoms he had ground glass lung opacities identified incidentally by ct scan35 a similar scenario occurred in another report chest ct performed in one asymptomatic child revealed patchy density16 this finding raised another issue that needs to be further considered according to our review the radiographic findings in pediatric covid-19 are similar to those in adults36 in china chest ct has been used as a screening tool for covid-19 the disease severity and clinical suspicion are associated with radiographic findings however this diagnostic policy might not be applicable in all countries household contact and epidemic area travel history are two major transmission routes for sars sars-cov-2 shows the same characteristics familial clustering is a strong epidemiological link with covid-19 especially in children some reports have already demonstrated that asymptomatic infections in children occurred in family clusters35

38 because of the high asymptomatic ratio pediatric covid-19 cases are usually detected by contact tracing unfortunately presymptomatic or asymptomatic transmission of sars-cov-2 has been reported38

39 the transmission of sars-cov-2 via asymptomatic children is reasonable to date no clustering or asymptomatic transmission among children has been documented there are some possible explanations first the outbreak of covid-19 occurred during winter vacation for students moreover the chinese government imposed lockdowns and travel restrictions in hubei province beginning on january 24 2020 furthermore the government announced that the lunar new year holiday would be extended to february 2 2020 across the country the new semester in school will also be postponed indefinitely these events limited the community spread of sars-cov-2 within school-age children however contact tracing and case isolation alone may be unlikely to control the sars-cov-2 outbreak in pediatric groups when a new semester starts there are some important issues not addressed in our review first the outbreak of covid-19 occurred 2 months ago so detailed case descriptions and clinical courses are limited in addition some patients are still hospitalized and quarantined the long-term outcome and sequelae may need further follow-up second critical or fatal pediatric covid-19 cases are rare indicating that

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection in a population the differences are extreme authors of a world health organization report stated that the proportion of truly asymptomatic infections is unclear but appears to be relatively rare and does not appear to be a major driver of transmission 1 in contrast reports of new infections found on a single day have led to statements that the large majority of coronavirus infections do not result in symptoms 2 the disagreement results in part from the interpretation of studies that report a proportion of asymptomatic people with sars-cov-2 detected at a single point 2 3 these studies include both people who will remain asymptomatic throughout and those known as pre-symptomatic 4 who will develop symptoms of coronavirus

symptoms viral pneumonia respiratory distress syndrome and death are not yet known 6 without follow up however the proportions of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections cannot be determined accurate estimates of the proportions of true asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections are needed urgently because their contribution to overall sars-cov-2 transmission at the population level will determine the appropriate balance of control measures 6 if the predominant route of transmission is from people who have symptoms then strategies should focus on testing followed by isolation of infected individuals and quarantine of their contacts if however most transmission is from people without symptoms social distancing measures that reduce contact with people who might be infectious should be prioritised 6 the objectives of this study were to address three questions 1 amongst people who become infected with sars-cov-2 what proportion does not experience symptoms at all during their infection 2 amongst people with sars-cov-2 infection who are asymptomatic when diagnosed what proportion will develop symptoms later 3 what  cc-by 40 international license it is made available

we clearly distinguish between sars-cov-2 infections that remain asymptomatic throughout their course from those that become symptomatic and we separate the proportions of people with infection from their contribution to overall transmission in a population this rapid systematic review follows a published protocol and uses methods to minimise bias whilst increasing the speed of the review process 7 as a living systematic review we will update it regularly using a living evidence database that includes preprints one main limitation of the review is that the database does not include all sources the four databases cover the majority of publications and we do not believe that we have missed studies that would change our conclusions we identified one online summary of asymptomatic sars-cov-2 infection that listed 21 articles found through searches of five electronic databases 27 there was no published protocol the authors did not distinguish between asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infection and present crosssectional studies alongside longitudinal studies and mathematical modelling studies the review gave a wide range 5 to 80 of infections that might be asymptomatic the advantage of our review is that it is a systematic review and although we included fewer studies we only report findings from empirical studies that followed participants for at least 14 days from the last exposure and we quantify the proportion of asymptomatic infection in a meta-analysis the findings from this systematic review do not support the claim that a large majority of sars-cov-2 infections is asymptomatic 2 our estimate 29 95 ci 23 to 37 is an upper bound of sars-cov-2 infections that remain asymptomatic throughout we believe that our analysis is likely to have overestimate the true proportion because all the included contact investigations included at least one asymptomatic individual at this stage of a pandemic of a new infectious disease there is likely publication bias with rapid publication of case reports of newsworthy findings such as person-to person transmission by asymptomatic individuals the denominator of all contact investigations is not known but the

manifestations of disease was also a feature of the zika epidemic analysis of published studies showed that estimates of the duration of infection decreased over time as less biased studies were published 28 we anticipate that as larger more representative studies are conducted and published the proportion estimated to be asymptomatic will decrease the statistical modelling study by mizumoto which accounted for right censoring provides an upper uncertainty interval of 20 asymptomatic infections 23 which might be closer to the true proportion if that assumed incubation period distribution is accurate the level and duration of transmissibility from individuals with asymptomatic infections is not known but in this review three asymptomatic cases were reported to be the source of subsequent sars-cov-2 infections within families the proportion of people who are pre-symptomatic could not be determined with certainty presumably because the distribution of dates at which sars-cov-2 was detected differed between studies nevertheless transmission from pre-symptomatic individuals has been found to occur one to three days before symptom onset 29 only mathematical modelling studies can determine the overall contribution to sars-cov-2 transmission of individuals with asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infection at the population level because of the non-linear dynamics of infection transmission in the studies included in this review three estimates from two studies found that 40-60 of all sars-cov-2 infections are the result of transmission whilst pre-symptomatic with a smaller contribution from asymptomatic infections 24 25 the consistency of the findings is reassuring because the studies used different methods of note ganyani et al used data about the serial interval to derive their estimate and did not use assumptions about the proportion of asymptomatic infections 24 our finding differs from a modelling study that has been interpreted as showing that up to 90 of sars-cov-2 transmission is asymptomatic 30 li and colleagues found that 86 of infections were defined as undocumented 30 but it appears that this proportion is a composite of asymptomatic infections infections that were symptomatic and diagnosed but unreported and infections that were mild and undiagnosed  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is

to the editor coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has spread rapidly around the world currently the identification of this disease is mainly conducted by using nasopharyngeal swabs 1  but the presence of sars-cov-2 rna in feces of covid-19 patients indicates the possibility of transmission via fecal-oral route 2 3 4  herein we report the distinctive clinical characteristics of an asymptomatic case in which sars-cov-2 viral nucleotide detection was positive in anal swabs but negative in nasopharyngeal swabs for such a long period 42 days in this case an 8-year-old girl patient 1 did not show any clinical symptoms abnormal chest ct image findings or a decreased lymphocyte count moreover she was identified as asymptomatic case on feb 19 and until now she did not become a confirmed patient with either respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms was capable of transmitting the virus to others remains unknown although her mother never became infected even though she was in contact with confirmed covid-19 and asymptomatic patients recent evidence demonstrates sars-cov-2 viral rna is detectable in feces during recovery period of covid-19 pneumonia 5 6  intriguingly studies have also illustrated that both adult and children patients of covid-19 persistently tested positive on anal swabs even after nasopharyngeal testing was negative 7 8  this case will further provide the new information that besides confirmed covid-19 patients the asymptomatic sars-cov-2 infected case can be persistently tested positive in the stool samples but negative in nasopharyngeal swabs for a long time the number of asymptomatic infections is rapidly increasing all around the world 9

the temporal evolution of the sars-cov-2 in italy the time window of the real data is between february 24 and march 25 after we upgrade the data until april 1we perform the analysis with 4 different

early december or reasonably during november the sars-cov-2 or commonly coronavirus appear in wuhan china coronaviruses are a large family of viruses known to cause diseases ranging from the common cold to more serious diseases such as middle eastern respiratory syndrome mers and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronaviruses were identified in the mid-1960s and are known to infect humans and certain animals including birds and mammals the primary target cells are the epithelial cells of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract and seven coronaviruses are identified to be able to infect humans they can cause common colds but also serious lower respiratory tract infections the virus causing the current coronavirus epidemic has been called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 this was announced by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv which deals with the designation and naming of viruses ie species genus family etc the name is indicated by a group of experts specifically appointed to study the new coronavirus strain according to this pool of scientists the new coronavirus is the brother of what caused sars sars-covs hence the chosen name of sars-cov-2 the disease caused by the new coronavirus has a name covid-19 where co stands for corona vi for virus d for disease and 19 indicates the year in which it occurred the oms director-general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus announced it on february 11 2020 during the extraordinary forum dedicated to the virus the appearance of new pathogenic viruses for humans previously circulating only in the animal world is a widely known phenomenon called spill over and it is thought that it may also be at the basis of the origin of the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 the scientific community is currently trying to identify the source of the infection on december 31 2019 the municipal health commission of wuhan china reported to the oms a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology in the city of wuhan in the chinese province of hubei on january 9 2020 the chinese center for disease prevention and control cdc reported that a new coronavirus initially called 2019-ncov and now called sars-cov-2 has been identified as the causative agent and has been rendered publishes the genomic sequence on january 30 2020 the world health organization declared that this epidemic represents an international public health emergency oms on march 11 2020 declared that covid-19 can be defined as a pandemic after notification of the epidemic by china italy immediately recommended postponing unnecessary flights to wuhan and subsequently with the spread of the epidemic to all of china consequently the latter has canceled all flights from wuhan on 30 january the minister of health ordered the suspension of air traffic with the peoples republic of china including the special administrative regions of hong kong and macao on 30 january the measure also applies to taiwan in consideration of the oms declaration of international public health emergency on january 31 2020 the council of ministers declared a state of emergency as a consequence of the health risk associated with coronavirus infection this disease does not save italy that has become a protected area with the dpcm signed on the evening of 9 march by the prime minister giuseppe conte who has extended the restrictive measures already applied for lombardy and the 14 northern provinces most affected by the coronavirus infection to the whole national territory the new action comes into force on march 10 and will take effect until april 3 among the main innovations it limits the movement of people blocks sporting events suspends teaching activities in schools and universities throughout the country until april 3 with the new ordinance of 22 march 2020 issued by the minister of health and the minister of the interior from 22 march people are prohibited from moving or moving with public or private trasportation in a municipality other than that in which they are located except for proven work needs of absolute urgency or for health reasons 1 in this scenario lets try to analyze the time evolution of the sars-cov-2 in italy with growth patterns many growth models have been very recently applied to study the covid-19 infection 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  two very famous examples of these models are described by the logistic 10 and the gompertz 11 equations the logistic law has been applied in population dynamics in economics in material science and in many other sectors while the gompertz one describes tumor growth kinetics of enzymatic reactions oxygenation of hemoglobin intensity of photosynthesis as a function of co2 concentration drug dose-response curve dynamics of growth eg bacteria normal eukaryotic organisms the logistic behaviour assumes that growth stops when maximum sustainable population density is reached through the carrying capacity k that depends on the environmental conditions for example the ordinances of the prime minister gconte the peoples hygiene habits are encoded in the carrying capacity k whereas the gompertz equation takes into account the aging of the population through a lower reproductive capacity over time not knowing yet the characteristics of the virus we thought it could be a correct choice now we describes the regional and national choices to contain the epidemic and and consequently our strategy at first in italy pharyngeal swabs were initially made only at seriously ill people this choice extremely correct in safeguarding the hospital structure at least apparently is wrong for a study of the disease data we explain better if we believe that the case fatality ratio cfr is 1 12 the number of deaths is the only data extremely relevant from the extrapolation of total number of infected 15 we observe that the number of infected detected is only 10 of the total this means that in italy about 90 of the sick are not detected having no information therefore on asymptomatic and infected with mild symptoms we decided to study the population of the severe infected with 2 equations one for the severe infected and another coupled for the deaths obviously the latter are related to the former so we implement a logistic model that take into account a possibility to consider the contribute of asymptomatic people in the evolution of the sars-cov-2 by means of additional constant and an equation of proportionality between infected and deaths we consider also an interpolating between logistic and gompertz model we show that the first scenario is more optimistic and faster respect to the second one finally we observe the data of each region separately noting that is present a delay in the evolution of the virus between the various regions and that each region has its own trend in particular lombardia has the fastest trend and veneto the slowest one we conclude with the observation that venetos strategy of performing swabs even to asymptomatic potential seems to have successful as can be seen from the estimate of the constant term of the logistic model a possible scenario of the evolution of the evolution of sars-cov-2 virus in italy is described by the logistic differential equation the model is represented by the following equation where it is the number of infected and the time t is the integration variable the constant r 0 is the growth rate of this particular population the sars-cov-2 and k is the carrying capacity the growth rate r 0 is typical of the population because it is linked to the reproductive mechanism of the virus while the carrying capacity k depends on the environmental conditions for example the government action of the prime minister gconte locked downld the peoples hygiene habits are encoded in the carrying capacity k however we change this equation adding a constant term a that represents the contribution of asymptomatic people we explain our idea for the italian situation studying 12 we assume that the cfr is 1 consider for example the situation of the march 19 in italy  3405 deaths  41035 infected severe cases which is presented the necessity to verify the positivity to avoid the collapse of the healthcare facility  340500 estimated data of deaths  severe symptomatic and asymtomatic cases this means that we have a bath of 300000 infected that can produce severe cases we consider for simplicity that this growth rate is constant the exact solution for this equation is well-known and the limit for t   represents the maximum possible number for this population after the march 23 we think it will be necessary recalibrate a with the data of the civil protection why because 14 days after the ld the incubation period is over and we suppose that this action destroys possible places for the propagation of the virus finally we have where a ld  a has the meaning that the ld restricts the possibility of contagion through asymptomatic in individual houses or just on the job places after 11 days the possibility to have symptoms are 2 5 13 then also march 20 is a good candidate to impose with the data a ld  a we can also imagine the possibility that the ld would be so good that a ld  0 we remark that the exact date of the decrease in the infected is so difficult because the results of the test is not always referred to the same day but we can have a delay for the incredible number of pharyngeal swabs in conclusion we think that a day between march 20 and march 23 is a good candidate to the drop in infections 16 now we consider the second population of this model the deaths we couple the infected i with the deaths d in the following equation after a simple integration we obtain where t 1 is the first integration extreme reasonably the february 24 so we fix to have the same growth for the severe cases and the deaths t d represents the interval between the appearance of symptoms and the deaths from 14 we estimate t d  13 days but we observe from numerical aspects that t d  4 a brief comment this reflects the italian choice to do swabs only to severe cases and not at the very beginning of the disease the second scenario of the evolution of sars-cov-2 virus in italy is described by the gompertz differential equation the model is represented by the following equation where it is the number of infected and the time t is the integration variable the constant r 0 is the growth rate of the virus sars-cov-2 and k is the carrying capacity this model takes into account the aging of the population through a lower reproductive capacity over time in other words we consider the virus less contagious over time the solution of the previous equation give us the gompertz law as in the logistic study we compute the limit or t   and we obtain this represents the asymptotic term of the population defined by the resources available in the environment in some sense also in this model we can encoded the human external action we choose to implement also in this model a constant term that we think that describes the role of the asymptomatic people so we study numerically this generalized gompertz equation from the study of the data as we will see later in this letter its clear that the logistic scenario is very optimistic respect to the natural disaster described by the gompertz model our idea is to create a model with a new parameter that enables to interpolate between the two regimes so we take into account the following differential equatio where r 0  k l are respectively the growth rate and the carrying capacity of the logistic model and r 0  k g for the gompertz one obviously the time t is always the integration variable the parameter q has range between 0 and 1 and obviously for q0 we obtain the gompertz behaviour and for q1 the logistic one from the numerical simulations performing 200 stochastic runs of the gillespie direct method algorithm applied to the logistic equation we obtain the following parameters for the italy situation described by fig1  and k 1  014 and t d  4 the errors are estimated at 5  or about 5 with the interpolating model at 21 march in fig 2 we observe how the situation could become particularly dramatic especially as regards the duration of the epidemic the curve becomes flat in late may however it becomes comforting with the data of march 25 the two graphs overlap and from the numerical simulations we find q  1 this means that environmental factors or ld prevail over virus growth factors 15 days after the ld we therefore started to see concrete effects and this is compatible with the incubation times of the virus it therefore seems obvious to study the evolution of the virus with a logistic model when a government applies ld in conclusion we expect around 111000 diagnosed patients and around 16000 deaths this considering a cft of 12 would lead to a total of about 1334000 infected in fig 3 we see that the peak is near 21-22 march and the end of the epidemic at the early may  in this section we update the italy situation according to the calibration performed using the real data of civil protection at 27032020 in fig 4 we report the previsions of infected and deaths with the assimilation of two new data for the calibration of the model the total number of infected goes to about 124800 and the deaths to about 17800 observing fig 5  we can note how the curve of daily total infected changes from day to day according to the acquisition of a new data but the right tails of the considered curves are similar this suggests that the end of contagion is confirmed according to our study at the end of april or early may finally in fig 6 we show the correlation according to the delay between the temporal series of total infected and deaths the plot represents the real data of deaths and the real ones of the total infected shifted of 4 days and rescaled according to the minimum difference between them ie we search the best correlation between the deaths data and the infected shifted forward according to eq7 the deaths are delayed compared to infected by means of this analysis we found the correct delay and we calibrate the parameter k 1 of eq7 that represents the rate between the derivatives of infected and deaths the value of k 1  update at 27032020 is 01429 6  analysis of delay between infected and dead for italy delay is 4 days the plot represent the real data of dead blue circles and the real data of total infected red diamonds shifted of 4 days and rescaled according to the minimum difference we consider the following generalized logistic equation where  is an experimentally parameter to fit better the initial power law climb we show the trend of the severe infected in fig7 fig8 and in fig9 respectively with the -model the logistic calibrated with data at 29 march and with the -model calibrated at 1 april we observe as fitting better the initial power law the estimated number of severe infected and deaths increases of 2 so we choose to use the -model to estimated the total number of severe infected and deaths we obtain iend  138500 dend  19900  a brief comment as we expect the growth coefficient r 0 is falling and the carrying capacity is obviously increased simply because the number of infected has grown it is interesting that the contribution a of asymptomatics is also increased we can explain this by thinking that asymptomatics remain the most important sources of contagion in the single houses of italian people during the ld we observe as in a week after the peak the estimated number of severe infected and deaths are increased of 20 but in the last 4 days the trend is in accordance with the data both numerically and in forecasting the end of the epidemic in particular the end date is stable from march 27 for this stability we decide to estimate the errors at 25  ie 2 5 a possible marker of the presence of the peak could be the following quantity where it i  is the total number of infected at the day t i and st i  is the total number of swabs at the same day as we see in fig 10 p marker has a peak at 24 march which is basically in agreement with our prediction the graph of fig 10 has been reproduced with a moving average to complete the peak picture we show the diagrams of the severe infected and the deaths for single day fig11 e fig12  that are in agreement with the delay time t d of 4-5 days stimated numerically considering the uncertainty in performing swabs the possible delays in processing swabs and the end of the incubation time 10-14 days the picture of the peak in the temporal window 21-24 march seems to be reasonable as we see in fig 13 the two scenarios are very different we compare the generalized logistic curve at 1 april  fig 8 with the gompertz one calibrated with the data at 21 march  ie with the data before the effect of the  831000 severe infected  119000 deaths  11900000 total infected  the end of epidemic at early september this means that with ld we probably saved 100000 human lifes lets start with the analysis of the single regions if we show the data of the civil protection in fig14 its evident as any region has a velocity of propagation of the virus different from each other in particular lombardia is very fast and veneto is much slow at the beginning of the spread of the disease we observed how in each region the number of days in which the number of infections rises by an order of magnitude ranges from 10 days in lombardia to 16 in veneto looking at the data and from the previous simple observation it is spontaneous to think that an analysis of the individual regions is more sensible than a global analysis of italy this idea seems correct for two reasons the virus arrives in the various regions at different times and each region has its different environmental and working characteristics which mainly involves a different population density after these considerations we therefore propose an analysis for the 6 regions mainly affected by the virus on 25 march unfortunately the forecast of lombardia shows us that 59 of future deaths are due to this region the parameter a is the highest of all regions and this seems to confirm the interpretation that a is the contribution of asymptomatics from the numerical simulations we obtain the following parameters  and k 1  021 and t d  5 21 the region emilia-romagna will probably be the second most affected region in italy the geographical proximity to lombardy and a large industrial activity could be the main causes from the numerical simulations we obtain the  and k 1  012 and t d  2 23 for veneto we make the opposite consideration compared to lombardia the coefficient a is the lowest among the regions that performed the largest number of swabs this data seems to be in agreement with the fact that veneto has carried out a large number of swabs also with  and k 1  006 and t d  5 yet another demonstration of our idea is contained in the k 1 value of the veneto region which is the lowest ever  and k 1  011 and t d  7 a brief comment about the numbers of these regions the contagion in these regions certainly started later than the other 3 then it could be that in the initial stages of the contagion the coefficient r is greater as it was in our previous simulations for italy and then slowly going down as you can see from fig 14 piemonte and toscana are quite fast we justify the largest r 0 parameter for piemonte and toscana compared to lombardia we will do a sensitivity analysis of the parameters later  these numbers are very significative it is the signal that lombardia is the carrier region of the spread of the virus in italy finally as we see in figs 25-29 it is evident how the spread of the infection occurred at different times between the various regions as the peaks are at different times in particular observing the tails of the curve toscana seems to be the region that will last come to zero infections at 4-5 may  in summary we studied the evolution of sars-cov-2 in italy with civil protection data in the time window from 24 february to 25 march with the logistic model we upgrade the curves of severe infected and deaths until 1 april with a generalized logistic model that works very well at the early of the contagion we provide around 1385000 diagnosed patients and around 19900 deaths on the whole italian territory this considering a cft of 12 would lead to a total of about 1658000 infected at the end of coronavirus epidemic we observe how the peak is more or less in correspondence of 21-24 march and the end towards the last days of april and early may as we see in fig 9  we stress with the idea that a possible marker of the presence of the peak could be the quantity this a quantity that has no fluctuations after passing its maximum value for our opinion it is a great signal of stability another important result is the estimate of the delay time t d between the peak of the severe infected and the peak of the deaths which seems to be truly in agreement with the data of the civil protection it is also interesting the comparison between the coefficient at 25 march and 1 april  r 0  0200 k  110950 and a  49 at 25 march  r 0  0173 k  138400 and a  79 at 1 april as it is obvious the coeffecient r 0 is falling during the ld and the the coeffecient k is rising we stress that it is very interesting that the contribution a of asymptomatics is also increased a possible interpretation is that asymptomatics remain the most important sources of contagion in the single houses of italian people during the ld finally we studied the evolution of the virus in the most affected regions a delay is present in the appearance of the virus between the individual regions so it seems more sensible to study them individually we have noticed how venetos strategy in making swabs to as many people as possible has proved successful in containing the evolution of the virus in the upgrading of the single regions with the data at 1 april we observe explicitly the peak of the daily severe infected and we show the effective time delay of the comparison of the sars-cov-2 in every regions finally tuscany will be the last region with zero infections at 4-5 may the last consideration about the importance of the ld with a simulation with a gompertz model ie a model that predicts that the virus stops only because its infectivity propagation goes to zero we estimate 119000 deaths with ld we have probably saved 100000 human lifes obviously this project is on-going being the possibility that the data of the next few days may change the scenario hopefully positive maybe in a further 6-7 days following the governments even more restrictive measures on 22 march  covid19 transmission through asymptomatic carriers is a challenge to containment xingxia yu rongrong yang   since the first report on the outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease covid19 in wuhan hubei china in december 2019

 there have been 78 064 cases have been confirmed and 2715 deaths as of february 25 2020 for any infectious disease there are three kinds of way to control the epidemic of infectious diseasethat is to control the source of infection to cut off transmission routes and to protect the susceptible population as a new infectious disease it is difficult to develop a safe and effective vaccine against covid19 in a short period of time so it is not possible to protect susceptible population at present social distancing is one of the main ways to cut off transmission routes  people cannot pass on infection if they do not come into contact with other people based on the understanding that covid19 spreads through respiratory droplets there has been widespread use of face masks in wuhan the propaganda no masks no going outside has been adopted by the public this can help to cut off the transmission routes of covid19 increases in capacity for laboratory testing allowing treatment and isolation of covid19 patients also helps to reduce onwards transmission in the period of initial success for covid19 control and prevention one bottleneck has been screening out asymptomatic carriers for reducing new infections as frontline doctors we believe that there have been asymptomatic carriers of covid19 who can infect their close contacts although asymptomatic patients with sars were uncommon they were documented in a retrospective study in the minor 2004 sars outbreak after reopening of the wildlife market in guangzhou
2
 similarly during the epidemic of covid19 in wuhan one asymptomatic child aged 10 years who had a history of travel to wuhan from shenzhen was described in the report about a family cluster of covid19
3
 he had radiological groundglass lung opacities and he was rtpcr positive for genes encoding the internal rnadependent rna polymerase and surface spike protein of this novel coronavirus which were confirmed by sanger sequencing the child was virologically confirmed to have an asymptomatic infection in addition another family of three who travelled from wuhan to guangzhou was reported to be infected with covid19
4
 the father had clinical symptoms a decreased lymphocyte count abnormal chest ct images and a positive result on qrtpcr its interesting that the mother and the son were both asymptomatic with normal lymphocyte counts and chest ct images but positive qrtpcr for covid19 infection in both cases asymptomatic carriers were diagnosed by screening after other family members developed symptoms we presume there would be many other asymptomatic carriers who were never tested even if those carriers were in the hospital perhaps for another reason would the doctor think of doing a viral nucleic acid test for covid19 in time if it is not possible to screen these asymptomatic carriers from truly healthy populations they will be a source of covid19 infection back into the community which will also pose a huge challenge for covid19 prevention and control on february 25 the case of covid19 transmission occurring in a prison in rencheng district jining city shandong province has sounded an alarm for us on february 9 a man was released from prison and returned home but he was informed to isolate himself because a prison officer was confirmed to have covid19 infection on february 14 in order to avoid isolation and observation the man absconded from his home later it was confirmed that this man was an asymptomatic carrier and his brother who had close contact with him became infected with covid19 this case is an example of asymptomatic transmission one study has reported that the viral load that was detected in the asymptomatic patients was similar to that in the symptomatic patients which also theoretically suggests the potential transmission of asymptomatic patients

 in conclusion we considered that asymptomatic covid19 infection is possible and persontoperson transmission can occur from asymptomatic covid19 carriers to the community therefore vigilant control measures are warranted at this stage of the covid19 epidemic to avoid a resurgence in cases we declare no competing interests

epidemic model sipherd and its application for prediction of the spread of covid-19 infection for india and usa ashutosh mahajan ravi solanki namitha  a s  we propose an epidemic model sipherd in which three categories of infection carriers symptomatic purely asymptomatic and exposed are considered with different rates of transmission of infection that are taken dependent on the lockdown and social distancing the rate of detection of the infected carriers is taken dependent on the tests done per day the model is applied for the covid outbreak in germany and south korea to validate its predictive capabilities and then applied to india and the united states for the prediction of its spread with different lockdown situations and testing in the coming months  the outbreak of pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has led to more than 4 million total infections and 285 thousand deaths worldwide 1  and serious efforts are needed for its containment the coronavirus sars-cov-2 has affected not just the public health but made a drastic impact on the economy of the world as well due to the lockdown situations in many countries pandemics have hit humanity many times in the past as well and mathematical models are already available for infectious diseases modeling and simulation can help to predict the extent of the contagious disease and can give useful inputs on correction measures for its containment in order to devise the lockdown strategy it is important that the prediction of the disease spread is available to the decision-makers covid-19 is different from the previously known sars severe acute respiratory syndrome infection such as the existence of purely asymptomatic cases 2 and the spread of the infection from them as well as from the exposed ones in the incubation period 3  our proposed mathematical model sipherd incorporates the above facts for the covid-19 epidemic many epidemiological models exist in the literature and the basic sir model 4 is the widely used one which needs to be modified to incorporate the complexities involved in coronavirus spread and control an approximate mathematical model of the covid-19 is initially reported in the literature 5 based on the between-countries disease spread be-codis which is a spatial epidemiological model for the study of the spread of human diseases between and within the countries  ashutoshmahajanvitacin an improved mathematical model for the spread of covid-19 is proposed in 6  by taking into account the infected and undetected cases but this study and forecast is particularly based only on china an extended sir model is proposed in 7  in which the entire people in the country are divided into eight compartments though it is an improved version of the sir model the study and simulation results are done only for italy and the model does not take into account purely asymptomatic cases and the role of tests done per day another compartmental epidemic model seir 8 forecast for few countries and the impact of the quarantine on the covid-19 is investigated a better adaptive and improved version of the sir model is illustrated in 9  in this method the time dependency of some parameters used for the analysis makes it more robust than the conventional sir method some other curve fitting based methods are also available in the literature for the forecast of covid-19 in 10  11 and 12  although these methods can track the available data correctly they are not developed based on the physical insights that affect the rate of spreading of the disease and also it is extremely sensitive to the initial conditions in this paper we formulate the mathematical model sipherd for the covid-19 epidemic and apply it for forecasting the number of active cases confirmed cases daily new cases and deaths for india and usa depending on the lockdown strategy and the number of tests performed per day we model the evolution of the covid-19 disease by dividing the population into different categories as listed below as seen in fig 1 the rates of transfer from one category to another can are the model parameters and a set of differential equations for the entity in each category can be formed we write the model equations that are independent of the population of the country by considering the fraction of the people in each category  s -fraction of the total population that is healthy and has never caught the infection  e -fraction of the total population that is exposed to infection transmit the infection and turn into either symptomatic or purely asymptomatic and not detected  i -fraction of the total population infected by the virus that shows symptoms and undetected  p -fraction of the total population infected by the virus that doesnt show symptoms even after the incubation period and undetected these are the purely asymptomatic cases  h -fraction of the total population that are found positive in the test and either hospitalized or quarantined  r -fraction of the total population that has recovered from the infection  d -fraction of the total population that are extinct due to the infection the sipherd model equations are a set of coupled ordinary differential equations 1 to 7 for the defined entities sipherd where initial conditions e0 p0 and i0 are not exactly known the various rates listed in table i are the parameters of the problem which are also not known and only possible range is available some of the parameters such as rates of infection    change with time in steps depending on the conditions such as lockdown where t r and t d are the delay associated with the recovery and death respectively with respect to active cases h we have taken into account this delay because the active cases are reported after the testing and admission to healthcare or quarantine center and the number of recovery and death of the admitted will not immediately follow the active or h category number all fractions add up to unity that can also be seen from summing the above equations the probability of getting the infection is assumed uniform among the susceptible people although the disease spreads localised in hot-spots the asymptomatic proportion of the infected persons onboard the diamond princess cruise ship is estimated in 2  among the 634 tested positive onboard 328 were found asymptomatic ie more than 50 percent of the confirmed cases were not showing any specific symptoms of covid-19 this factor is incorporated in the model by considering the purely asymptomatic category the ratio of purely asymptomatic p to total asymptomatic ep cases is reported to be 035 and the ratio of purely asymptomatic to the total infected epi is 0179 2  these reported numbers are used to fix the proportion between  p and  i as 036 and the proportion of initial conditions e0 i0 and p 0 as well in other words out of 100 exposed cases after the incubation period 36 will turn to be purely asymptomatic and 74 will have symptoms coronavirus-ncov2 has shown particular characteristics that the asymptomatic patients do transmit the disease the infection can be transmitted from the person who is not showing illness during the incubation period 3  this can be included in the model by considering e category people and their transmission as well hospitalized and quarantined cases can also transmit the disease and this small rate is taken as parameter  the detection of the asymptomatic and symptomatic cases can be taken dependent on the number of tests done per day t p d  for the symptomatic cases the detection is more probable as the infected person can approach for the tests and more likely to be tested the detection of symptomatic is taken in two parts one a constant and another part proportional to the tests done per day this can be written in terms of parameters as where  0   0  and  1 are positive constants recovery of asymptomatic cases is taken faster than the symptomatic cases the total confirmed cases are the addition of the active cases extinct cases and a part of the recovered that were detected this can be written as the set of coupled ordinary differential equations for the model can be readily solved numerically for a given set of parameters and initial values the non-trivial part is the accurate determination of the parameters that will mimic the situation on the ground the mathematical problem is to take into account the four actual data sets of the total number of confirmed cases active cases on a particular day cumulative deaths and tests done per day and find the set of parameters that will provide the best possible match between the data and model the extraction of the parameters is also to be automated so that the model can be run on data for various countries a cost function is written in terms of errors between the actual and solver data sets the minimizer of the cost can be found to obtain the optimized set of parameters that best fit with the data available till date the model and the optimization scheme is implemented in matlab  we collected the number of total positive or confirmed cases present active cases and deaths from 1 13  and the number of tests per day from 14  which is plotted in fig 2 the day on which lockdown is imposed in a country is also taken into account as changes in the slopes of the data are observed according to it the rate of transmission of infection from the asymptomatic carrier   for a country is taken higher than the symptomatic ones  as the asymptomatic carrier may not be aware of hisher infection and susceptible may not be keeping distance as no symptoms are seen the mortality rate   is taken different for different countries as it depends on the immunity and how effectively the critical patients are taken care of by the hospitals the home recovery rates of asymptomatic  and symptomatic  rate of transmission of infection from hospitalized and quarantined  and rate of selfreporting of the symptomatic people  0  are taken uniform for all countries the transfer rate  i is the inverse of the incubation period whose mean is reported 52 days 15  the parameters determined by our model are listed in table ii for the countries we studied we apply the sipherd model to south korea and germany for exhibiting the predictive capability of our model as the disease has almost reached the end stages in these countries we used the data for the first 23 and 40 days respectively for these counties ie till march 9 th and march 30 th and compared the future evolution generated by the model to the actual data as shown in the grey region in fig 3 for south korea and in fig4 for germany model predicted higher deaths for south korea as the mortality rate 22e-3 was higher before march  fig 3  model prediction using the south korea data up-to march 9 and comparison with the actual data for the confirmed active cases and total deaths 9 that improved later to fitted value 09e-3 march 30 and comparison with the actual data for the confirmed active cases and total deaths for the available data till date we run the model to extract parameters and then with the extracted parameters the model is run for 180 days starting from march 2 nd  if the lockdown conditions are relaxed on may 17 th  the rate of transmission of infection is going to increase in the relaxed lockdown the  and  values are assumed to jump by 20 the prediction for both cases with a 4k increase in tests per day and saturation at 200k tests is compared in fig 5 and in fig 6  we plot the prediction band for the daily new cases considering two percent error in the estimation of rate of transmission of infection we compare the effect of testing on the prediction  the recovery rate of the h category is found to be slow compared to south korea or germany which may be attributed to either incorrect reporting of the active cases or the testing of serious cases only and longer recovery time in hospitals compared to quarantined with mild symptoms the prediction for the next 240 days that is till the end of the year 2020 is plotted in fig 8 for 10k test per day and saturated at 1 million tests per day the recovery rate  is taken improved by 25  after may 4 th and mortality rate is taken improved in steps from initial 6e-3 to 4e-3 to 25e-3 after april 9 th and april 19 th  the time evolution of the totally unknown and un- fig 9 the evolution of the undetected number of infected in exposed e symptomatic i and purely asymptomatic p category for usa sipherd model is developed by considering purely asymptomatic category of covid-19 infected cases in addition to the symptomatic and the disease spread by the exposed the effect of lockdown on the rates of transmission of infection and the influence of tests per day on detection rates has been incorporated in the model the sipherd model is put for trial for the data of south korea and germany and with a limited number of days data the model is found to correctly predict the known evolution the prediction for india suggests that even increasing the rate of infection transmission by 20 due to relaxation of lockdown leads to around 50k increase in the total number of cases and 3k increase in total deaths the prediction for the usa shows that in the absence of vaccine the infection can last long till the end of this year and number of deaths could be around 250k if lockdown and social distancing conditions remain the same  clinical impact of human coronaviruses 229e and oc43 infection in diverse adult populations edward walsh e

antigens coated onto enzyme immunoassay plates and control plates were coated with uninfected cell preparations serial 2-fold dilutions of sera were incubated in antigen-coated plates and developed by addition of alkaline phosphataseconjugated goat antihuman immunoglobulin g igg followed by substrate the usual convention of a 4-fold rise in serum igg specific for the cov antigens was considered evidence of infection infection with other viruses were also identified by culture rt-pcr or serology influenza a and b rsv hmpv or culture alone parainfluenza virus in the same samples as previously described 12 13 symptomatic cov infection was defined as an illness with upper or lower respiratory symptoms associated with a positive rt-pcr at the time of symptoms andor a 4-fold rise in cov-specific igg between acute and convalescent serum samples incompletely evaluated cov illnesses were those for which participants failed to report symptoms during the winter surveillance or were out of town at the time of the illness but were reported to study staff at the final spring interview and demonstrated a significant increase in cov-specific serum igg asymptomatic infection was defined as a 4-fold increase in cov-specific serum igg bracketing a period when no respiratory symptoms were reported differences between groups were analyzed using the 2 test of independence for dichotomous variables and unpaired 2-tailed t tests for continuous variables p values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the bonferroni correction method the prospective cohorts included 611 healthy elderly adults 537 high-risk adults with underlying cardiopulmonary disease and 291 healthy young adults and the hospital cohort numbered 1388 table 1 these cohorts have previously been described in detail 12 13 the young adult cohort was approximately 40 years younger on average than the other cohorts and had a substantially greater frequency of living with or exposure to children compared to the healthy elderly cohort the high-risk and hospital cohorts had a relatively high prevalence of cardiac and pulmonary disease and greater impairment in the instruments of activities of daily living iadl scores during the 4 winters 398 coronavirus infections in 394 subjects were identified 4 subjects had a dual oc43229e infection in all years oc43 was more common than 229e early in the surveillance period and in years 2 and 4 229e peaked later figure 1
 a total of 302 cov infections occurred in the prospective cohorts with slightly more oc43 than 229e infections table 2 overall there were 113 cov infections in the healthy elderly cohort 54 229e 59 oc43 112 in the high-risk group 57 229e 55 oc43 and 77 in the young cohort 36 229e 41 oc43 the percentage of subjects infected with coronaviruses varied considerably from year to year with infection rates for 229e ranging from 05 to 150 and oc43 from 23 to 114 overall infection rates were greatest during the winter of year 2 20002001 when 2326 of subjects in each of the prospective cohorts were infected with 1 of the 2 strains
 of note asymptomatic infection in the prospective cohorts defined as a serologic response without a reported illness was relatively common and was significantly greater for 229e than for oc43 infections 367 vs 181 p  0003 when the 3 cohorts are considered together mixed viral infections were also significantly more frequent with symptomatic 229e 161 than oc43 infection 63 p  03 for 229e-infected persons coinfecting viruses were hmpv 6 rsv 5 influenza a and b 1 each and oc43 1 for oc43-infected persons coinfecting viruses were rsv 3 hmpv 2 influenza a and b 1 each and 229e 1 to compare clinical characteristics and outcomes associated with 229e and oc43 infections in the prospective cohorts we analyzed fully evaluated symptomatic illnesses not associated with other viruses table 3 upper respiratory symptoms were relatively common in all 3 cohorts and nasal congestion and rhinorrhea were nearly universal regardless of infecting strain other upper respiratory symptoms were less common with 3063 of subjects complaining of sore throat and 2544 complaining of hoarseness cough was more common in oc43 infections when all 3 cohorts were considered together although lower respiratory signs and symptoms were similar for both strains
 the outcome of coronavirus illness in these same subjects is shown in table 4 for each cohort there was a trend toward longer duration of illness with oc43 infection in aggregate oc43-infected subjects used significantly more cough suppressants and bronchodilators in addition there was a trend toward more health service use such as physician or emergency room visits in the healthy elderly and high-risk groups during oc43 infection
 the hospital cohort included 1388 subjects admitted for 1471 illnesses table 1 subjects were similar in age to the healthy elderly group and slightly older than the high-risk group rates of underlying cardiopulmonary disease and tobacco use were also similar to the high-risk group whereas home oxygen use was significantly greater in the hospital cohort 24 vs 18 p  003 during the 4 winters 96 coronavirus infections were identified in the 1388 subjects in the hospital cohort of these 34 24 were 229e and 62 45 oc43 with 2 subjects having both 229e and oc43 identified table 2 similar to the prospective cohorts the highest incidence of coronavirus infections occurred in year 2 118 and ranged from 33 to 75 in other years because all subjects had respiratory symptoms none were classified as asymptomatic however overall 25 of cov infections in the hospital cohort were associated with a second virus as in the prospective cohorts a significantly greater percentage of dual virus infection was noted in 229e-infected subjects than in oc43-infected subjects 1634 47 vs 762 11 p  0002 for the 229e-infected persons the coinfecting viruses were rsv 7 hmpv 9 oc43 2 and influenza a and b 1 each for the oc43-infected persons the viruses were rsv 2 229e 2 hmpv 1 parainfluenza virus 1 and influenza a 1 admission diagnoses were similar for 229e and oc43 with pneumonia 32 and 35 respectively and aecopd 36 and 41 respectively most common the clinical presentation of the 2 strains in the hospital cohort was similar although there was a trend toward longer hospital stay and greater need for intensive care unit care and ventilatory support in oc43-infected subjects table 5 the only significant difference between strains was that oc43-infected subjects were more likely to have pulmonary infiltrates noted on chest radiographs
 for both strains the combination of serology and rt-pcr greatly enhanced the diagnosis of infection results from symptomatic subjects in whom both tests were available indicate that a significantly greater proportion of oc43-infected subjects were rt-pcr positive 109158 69 than 229e-infected subjects 52108 48 p  001 for both strains approximately 30 were positive by both rt-pcr and serology we had previously reported the incidence and clinical outcomes of several other viruses in these same cohorts thus providing an opportunity to compare 229e and oc43 to influenza a rsv and hmpv 12 13 figure 2a and 2b shows the virus-specific medical care utilization for the 2 older prospective cohorts in subjects with symptomatic illness not associated with dual virus infection influenza a infection followed by hmpv and rsv had the greatest impact and 229e the least it should be noted that the majority of influenza a illnesses occurred when h3n2 strains were the dominant circulating viruses
 we next compared the incidence of each virus in the prospective cohorts to the incidence in the hospital cohort this should provide a reasonable gauge of the relative virulence of each virus with a low ratio indicating that fewer outpatient infections are required to produce similar numbers of hospitalizations compared to a virus with a high ratio for this analysis asymptomatic infections and dual virus infections are included in the prospective cohorts figure 2c shows that influenza a has the lowest ratio 030 followed in ascending order by rsv 085 hmpv 095 oc43 21 and 229e 62 noninfluenza respiratory viruses are increasingly recognized as significant pathogens in adult populations especially in elderly adults however unlike influenza the impact and importance of other respiratory viruses are less well documented in this age group although coronaviruses have been identified in elderly adults and high-risk populations such as those with copd cystic fibrosis or immune deficiencies only a few studies have included extended periods or directly compared results to other viruses 10 11 1519 our data indicate that depending upon the year 326 of prospectively enrolled outpatients were infected with oc43 and 229e cov strains more importantly among the hospital cohort the incidence of coronavirus infection varied from 33 to 118 with an average of 68 per year these findings are consistent with reports from other investigators in a 1-year analysis of 2215 patients with copd enrolled in an influenza vaccine efficacy study gorse et al identified coronaviruses in 14 of acute influenza-like illnesses defined as 3 respiratory symptoms or fever plus 2 respiratory symptoms a rate similar to that of influenza 10 in that study oc43 was approximately 3 times more common than 229e however asymptomatic infection was not sought and thus the true number of infections was likely greater in our study we used less stringent criteria for evaluation and thus we likely detected a broader spectrum of illness in contrast to our study gorse et al found that coronavirus and influenza infections were equally associated with the need for hospitalization although only influenza was temporally linked to impairment of pulmonary function in a community-based study from the netherlands graat et al detected coronaviruses by rt-pcr in 19 of 97 elderly subjects during a 1-year period none of whom required hospitalization 20 in studies from houston texas greenberg identified oc43 or 229e in 16 of 62 copd patients during 30 months of surveillance with the majority of infections caused by oc43 whereas glezen et al diagnosed serologically confirmed 229e or oc43 infection in 34 of 417 hospitalized adults during a 4-year period 11 15 in an analysis of a large number of outpatient respiratory illnesses in the united kingdom gaunt identified cov in approximately 11 of older adults over 3 years 8 in that study lower respiratory tract illness was noted in 43 of oc43 infections but in no 229e infections our data also suggest that oc43 has greater clinical impact than 229e in adults oc43 infection was significantly less likely to be asymptomatic or associated with mixed viral infection the latter a common finding also noted by other investigators we defined asymptomatic infection by a positive serologic rise during an asymptomatic interval rather than by a positive pcr in asymptomatic persons the latter may represent colonization whereas the former likely represents true infection the true frequency of coinfections is likely to be considerably greater as we did not assess subjects for rhinovirus and we only performed culture for parainfluenza viruses the most frequent coinfecting viruses rsv and hmpv have previously been shown by us and others to account for significant morbidity in elderly adults 12 13 2123 thus the observed illness in coinfected subjects may primarily be attributable to the coinfecting virus a suggestion made by prill et al in a study of cov infection in infants 24 perhaps most significant is the lower ratio of outpatient infections to inpatient infections for oc43 compared to 229e suggesting a virulence difference between strains our results imply that in elderly adults with a high incidence of underlying cardiopulmonary disease it would require approximately 3-fold more outpatient 229e infections than oc43 infections to result in an equivalent number of hospitalizations although another group of investigators also simultaneously measured the incidence of infection in outpatient and hospitalized adults in the same community with a similar trend they did not differentiate the coronavirus or influenza strains in the outpatient groups 11 15 in a similar fashion we were also able to compare the relative impact of both coronaviruses to that of other previously characterized respiratory viruses in these same cohorts not surprisingly the results indicate that the clinical impact is greatest for influenza a followed by rsv hmpv oc43 and 229e in order of decreasing importance although the relative impact of coronavirus infection appears to be less than the other viruses the overall burden particularly for oc43 is not insignificant less virulent organisms such as rhinoviruses have also been shown to have significant overall disease burden in the elderly due to their relatively high prevalence 25 using our coronavirus data in relation to influenza a during the 4-year period of surveillance and eliminating viral coinfections the hospital burden of these 2 coronaviruses combined was approximately 47 of the influenza a our study has several important limitations the first is that we did not test for nl63 and hku1 infections and thus are unable to provide a complete picture of the clinical impact of coronavirus infection in adults in some studies nl63 or hku1 has been more frequently identified than oc43 and 229e although the majority reported oc43 to be the most common coronavirus strain identified 8 9 1719 24 26 it is possible that some of our subjects diagnosed with oc43 or 229e by serology alone could include hku1 or nl63 infections due to antigenic cross-reactivity within coronavirus groups 27 in addition we also did not include an asymptomatic control group for the hospital cohort to assess illness causality as done in one pediatric study 24 futhermore viral coinfections were likely underestimated and thus the attributable impact of cov infection may be overestimated finally our study was limited to winter seasons and although coronaviruses tend to be most active in the winter we likely missed some cov infections especially in year 2 when oc43 was highly active at the start of our surveillance period because we performed serology for each winter season separately we would not have detected summer illnesses in conclusion the overall incidence and impact of combined coronavirus 229e and oc43 infections in diverse adult populations over 4 consecutive winters is relatively high and the overall medical burden of disease is substantial  clinical features of pediatric patients with coronavirus disease covid-19 wenliang song junhua li ning zou wenhe guan jiali pan wei xu   the 2019 outbreak of coronavirus in wuhan hubei province of china has been since attributed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 1 2 3 4 5 6 termed coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the world health organization who it has spawned a public health emergency of international concern pheic 7 at present there are 100 affected countries and districts 8 sars-cov-2 is the seventh member of the enveloped rna human coronavirus hcov family which also includes hcov-229e oc43 -nl63 -hku1 sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 9 earlier data have shown that adult patients with covid-19 present with fever dry cough dyspnea fatigue and lymphopenia serious pneumonia may also ensue more often in elderly adult men and those with chronic comorbidities posing greater risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome and even death 1 2 3 4 5 6 although all humans are susceptible to sars-cov-2 it does appear that covid-19 occurs less and is less severe in children than in adults 1011 reports of pediatric vulnerability are increasing nonetheless 12 13 14 15 16 without comprehensive analysis or conclusive proof to address this issue we went through clinical data of our patients our findings attest to some distinctive differences which may help in managing children hereafter objective to assess clinical profiles of children infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 covid-19 clinical data were collected from 16 children 1 months-14 years diagnosed with covid-19 at central hospital of xiangyang city hubei province of china between january 31 2020 and march 17 2020 informed consent was obtained for experimentation with human subjects all subjects met diagnostic guidelines established in china as stipulated in diagnosis and treatment recommendation for pediatric coronavirus disease-19 2nd edition 17 any of the epidemiologic conditions set forth and at least two related clinical provisions were required to define a suspected case the epidemiologic criteria were as follows 1 travel or residence in wuhan area or other areas showing continuous local spread within 2 weeks of onset 2 exposure within prior 2 weeks to fever or respiratory symptoms from wuhan area or other areas where local spread was ongoing 3 close contact with confirmed or suspected cases of covid-19 within 2 weeks of onset 4 disease clusters comprised of patients other than the child in question with fever or respiratory symptoms suggesting or identified as covid-19 and 5 newborns of mothers with suspected or confirmed covid-19 qualifying clinical manifestations were as follows 1 fever fatigue dry cough or some with no fever 2 abnormal chest imaging x-ray or computed tomography ct 3 normal or low total leukocytes counts or lymphopenia in the early phase of disease suspected cases were ultimately confirmed by one of the following diagnostic outcomes using pharyngeal swabs sputum feces or blood samples 1 sars-cov-2 nucleic acid detected by real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction pcr 2 genetic sequencing of virus highly homologous to sars-cov-2 or 3 culture and isolation of sars-cov-2 particles we gauged the severity of covid-19 by clinical features laboratory testing and chest x-ray imaging symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection only such as stuffy nose sore throat and fever constituted mild disease some children were asymptomatic only identified by sars-cov-2 nucleic acid positivity using pharyngeal swabs and were classified as mild cases in

 despite the delayed nat conversion chest ct abnormalities and clinical symptoms did not worsen implying that covid-19 in children is a mild disease with a good prognosis once unleashed in december 2019 covid-19 due to sars-cov-2 spread with ferocity across china and around the world 1 2 3 4 5 pathogen detection improved as the outbreak took hold so reports of pediatric infections began to mount 12 13 14 15 16 herein we have analysed 16 patients of xiangyang city with laboratory confirmed covid-19 12 of whom had immediate family members sometimes two or more harbouring the same illness it is suggested that the extent of epidemics in children reflects the dynamics of family units although avoidance of public places and social gatherings under our national prevention and control policies effectively reduced overall morbidity children clearly rely on parental care close contact within the family is thus the likely mode of sars-cov-2 infection in children of xiangyang city similar to sars and mers 1819 we are subsequently reminded that prevention and control of pediatric infections is indeed a family effort respiratory isolation hand hygiene and surface disinfection are all simple yet important preventive measures aside from the current lack of medical masks suitable for children it is quite unrealistic for infants or toddlers to don masks and many older children are incapable of self-discipline entailed in viral combat while tending to their own obligations parents must then do the same for their children insisting on respiratory protection and hand hygiene half of the children we studied had no clinical manifestations they were detected by nat as contacts of confirmed family members the median incubation time 155 days was also lengthy enabling a prolonged period of concealment and four patients had demonstrable ct abnormalities such departure from customary adult presentations compounds other diagnostic obstacle we have not known clearly the pathogenic features of sars-cov-2 so by using chest ct we can effectively identify patients with pneumonia determine severity of lung lesions and isolate the source of infection 15 whereas in our study eight asymptomatic patients with or without chest ct abnormalities didnt show any sign of deterioration during the course and their outcomes were good hence we should keep an eye on illness and think twice about ct scans when necessary regular use of nat may be a workable approach to detecting asymptomatic carriers in family units the rest of the children 50 examined presented with fever and cough much like first symptoms of adult infection 1 2 3 4 5 6 however fever in children was of shorter duration and not as high maximum 386 c none of them had early respiratory tract symptoms and no dyspnea or extrapulmonary issues emerged in the course of disease we thus concluded that covid-19 in children is an asymptomatic or mild clinical illness in adults with covid-19 up to 832  are lymphopenic 134 337  are leukopenic 1 and 86  1 have elevations of crp alanine aminotransferase alt aspartate aminotransferase ast ldh procalcitonin and d-dimer to some extent especially those with severe disease primarily ldh and d-dimer 1 2 3 4 total leukocyte counts were almost normal in the children we studied although two were leukopenic and one was lymphopenic crp was elevated in one instance 40 mgdl and three patients had ldh elevations other laboratory results were all normal these were minor deviations compared with those occurring in adults lymphopenia reflects consumption of lymphocyte by sars-cov-2 and signals severe disease 134 which is rare in children ultimately laboratory testing in children with covid-19 yields nonspecific results of little consequence offering no strong diagnostic support it may serve to exclude other pathology active monitoring is also helpful in determining the severity and progress of ongoing infections early chest ct findings of children with covid-19 have some similarities to those of adults but differ in ways 1 2 3 420 lesions in children commonly occupy lung periphery sitting close to the pleura in adults lesions are likewise shown pleural distributions positioned at interlobar fissures however those in children seem to align with bronchovascular bundles simulating changes of bronchopneumonia and although ggos and consolidation are shared features single lung involvement by few nodular or smallpatchy changes are characteristic of children furthermore the ggo halos are diminutive consolidation is limited and air bronchograms are unusual adult patients in contrast have bilateral broad-ranging lung changes mainly large patches with paving-stone pattern and halo or reverse-halo signs these phenomena suggest a more robust inflammatory response in adults more so than in children extrapulmonary manifestations such as nodal enlargement and pleural effusions that appear in adults are actually rare or absent in children finally the pulmonary lesions in the pediatric patients tend to resolve after treatment without sequelae and not reappear whereas fibrous cords and secondary diseases may develop in adults by comparison then children with covid-19 have atypical clinical symptoms showing nonspecific and inconsequential ct changes of lung as in patients with sars and mers severe illness is proportionately low in children with covid-19 and deaths are rare 1819 both sars-cov 21 and sars-cov-2 gain entry to airway cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors 2223 triggering massive inflammatory cytokine release and causing tissue necrosis the resultant immune imbalance may be catastrophic culminating in systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs or ards it is still unclear whether the maturity functionality or affinity of ace2 receptors is lower in children than in adults or whether other mechanisms eg accessory receptors are operant explaining the many discrepancies in pediatric and adult disease expression the need for more research is urgent all patients in our study received symptomatic antipyretic treatment but only four were given lopinavir-ritonavir in retrospect data on these four children was not distinctive with respect to scope of disease age or severely affected family members our early inexperience in treating of children during the outbreak prompted some questionable decisions based on adult guidelines 24 we now recognize the innocuous course that most children without underlying ailments will follow so antivirals are not warranted however the principles of traditional chinese medicine are worthy of further study although recommended by guidelines and experience 172425 the disease is self-limited calling for greater focus on supportive treatment especially a variety of foods that maintain the physical psychologic and emotional well-being of growing children 26 27 28 in summary covid-19 in children of xiangyang city is generally family acquired and often not serious with a good prognosis asymptomatic children can be diagnosed as pneumonia because of chest ct abnormalities atypical symptomology and nonspecific laboratory findings tend to muddy the diagnosis especially if the sole manifestations are chest ct changes a patient profile incorporating aspects of epidemiologic exposure nat and lung ct funding provides a basis for diagnosis we must be attentive to the many children who are asymptomatic carriers to prevent and control this pandemic this study was funded by the 1013039501100001809national

research in context
evidence before this study
we searched pubmed on march 14 2020 with no date restrictions for articles in english using the terms covid-19 coronavirus antibody viral load cruise ship quarantine shedding and seroconversion our search did not identify any reports on the prospective follow-up of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 viral shedding and seroconversion in a cruise ship setting we identified one case report on the clinical presentation of two individuals on the diamond princess cruise ship and an article estimating the effectiveness of public health measures on controlling the covid-19 epidemic potential on a cruise ship
added value of this study
to our knowledge this is the first cruise ship study of the clinical evolution and seroconversion from coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 from last possible exposure to the pathogen to the end of the suspected incubation period the study showed that asymptomatic individuals might seroconvert while carrying a high viral load and continue to shed the virus patients who had viral pneumonitis detected by high-resolution ct tended to have a higher antibody response high-resolution ct also helped to establish a clinical diagnosis and detect cases of asymptomatic lung infection
implications of all the available evidence
asymptomatic covid-19 infection with continuous viral shedding makes infection control difficult therefore a combination of rt-pcr and serology should be implemented for case finding and contact tracing in a community outbreak of covid-19 to facilitate early diagnosis prompt isolation and treatment high-resolution ct could also help to detect cases of asymptomatic infection

 on feb 1 2020 he was hospitalised with fever and tested positive for sars-cov-2 the cruise continued to vietnam and taiwan then returned to yokohama at which time ten passengers were diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 covid-1911 and a 14-day quarantine order was imposed for all passengers and crew on board between feb 5 and feb 17 2020 the japanese health ministry tested all passengers by throat swab rt-pcr individuals who tested positive were isolated in local hospitals individuals who tested negative were kept on board confined to their cabins and were only allowed out of the cabin for 1 h per day to exercise the ship remained docked in the port of yokohama by feb 17 countries were allowed to air-evacuate citizens back to their home nations therefore the hong kong government chartered two flights on feb 20 and feb 21 to transfer passengers who had tested negative to hong kong for a further 14 days of quarantine in a newly completed public estate as of may 14 2020 712 19 of the 3711 passengers and crew had been infected with sars-cov-2 and 13 deaths had occurred among those with confirmed infection12 we investigated the sequential sars-cov-2 shedding and the specific antibody response in this cohort of passengers quarantined in hong kong hong kong citizens were air-evacuated from the diamond princess cruise ship on feb 20 and feb 21 2020 and entered quarantine in the chun yeung estate a newly built and vacant public estate in hong kong on feb 22 each unit had a bathroom and kitchen and housed one to two people during the 14-day quarantine period they were placed in complete isolation only health-care workers from the hong kong department of health would visit daily to do health checks and to deliver meals family visits and contact with the general public were not allowed and individuals were asked to handle their own laundry with approval by the department of health we visited and collected samples from the individuals together with the aforementioned health workers all adult passengers aged 18 years and older were screened and given the choice to join the study there were no exclusion criteria all participants provided written informed consent and could withdraw from the study at any point the institutional review board of the university of hong kong and hospital authority approved this study participants were screened by quantitative rt-pcr rt-qpcr for sars-cov-2 in nasopharyngeal throat and rectal swabs at baseline feb 22 2020 day 4 day 8 and day 12 and tested for serum igg and igm against both internal nucleoprotein and the surface spike receptor-binding protein rbd of sars-cov-2 at baseline day 4 day 8 and day 12 the following participant data were entered into a database name hong kong personal identification number age sex medical history by completion of a questionnaire presenting symptoms and signs and laboratory radiological virological and serological findings participants who developed symptoms or who were found to have virological or serological evidence of sars-cov-2 infection at the time of screening were admitted to the queen mary hospital or the queen elizabeth hospital in hong kong for further investigation and treatment all hospitalised participants underwent chest radiograph and high-resolution ct examination nucleic acid extraction and rt-qpcr were done as previously reported13 enzyme immunoassays for nucleoprotein and rbd and optical density od cutoff values at 450 nm and 620 nm were established as previously described14 the cutoff value for positivity was based on the mean value plus 3 sds of the negative control using archived serum specimens collected in 2018 from 93 anonymous individuals without sars-cov-2 infection14
 descriptive statistics are presented findings of the participants who tested positive for sars-cov-2 are presented as a case series all data were analysed with spss version 260 the funders of the study had no role in study design data collection data analysis data interpretation or writing of the report the corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication of 3711 passengers and crew members on board the diamond princess cruise ship 369 passengers 10 were from hong kong appendix the passengers returned to yokohama on feb 1 2020 and were quarantined onboard for a further 20 days figure 1 by feb 20 2020 76 passengers from hong kong were hospitalised in japan after testing positive for sars-cov-2 by throat swab rt-pcr of whom two individuals died from complications of the infection appendix 293 passengers from hong kong who tested negative were allowed to disembark of whom 65 decided to stay in japan and 228 passengers 225 adults and three children returned to hong kong for further quarantine the three children were excluded from the study because their clinical data were not available for assessment ten passengers declined to join the study and remained well until discharge thus 215 adult participants were enrolled baseline characteristics of participants who tested positive n9 and negative n206 for sars-cov-2 were well matched table 1
 nine 4 95 ci 28 of 215 participants were found to have evidence of sars-cov-2 infection and were hospitalised these nine individuals were not related to each other they boarded the ship in hong kong on jan 25 2020 when the index passenger had already disembarked and therefore had no contact with him figure 1 at the last onboard covid-19 testing by throat swab on feb 17 2020 all nine individuals tested negative both parents and the grandfather of patient 7 had tested positive for sars-cov-2 at the initial governmental screen in japan they were subsequently discharged from hospital in japan after testing negative and they returned to hong kong in march 2020 we have ordered the nine patients who tested positive for sars-cov-2 in the probable order of infection according to their viral load and serological profile table 2

 that suggested recent covid-19 the other eight patients 89 95 ci 5799 were positive on nasopharyngeal swab rt-pcr for sars-cov-2 at baseline patients 6 and 7 had transient detectable viral load at baseline and patients 3 and 4 had transient detectable viral load on baseline and day 4 patients 5 8 and 9 had persistent detectable nasopharyngeal viral load through to day 12 positive viral load could precede the onset of symptoms as evidenced by patient 9 the median nasopharyngeal viral load at baseline was 431 log10 copies per ml iqr 379665 on day 4 was 287 log10 copies per ml 270495 on day 8 was 284 log10 copies per ml 270461 and on day 12 was 27 log10 copies per ml 270344 three patients 33 95 ci 1265 were found to be positive for sars-cov-2 on throat swab rt-qpcr table 2 the median throat swab viral load at baseline was 270 log10 copies per ml iqr 270550 and at day 4 was 270 log10 copies per ml 270366 the viral loads in the throat swabs were lower than those in the nasopharyngeal swabs at the same timepoints rectal swab viral load was negative in all nine patients the nasopharyngeal sars-cov-2 rt-qpcr median viral load was higher in symptomatic patients than in asymptomatic patients 762 log10 copies per ml vs 386 log10 copies per ml chest radiographs showed changes consistent with interstitial pneumonia in four patients 44 95 ci 1973 with right lower lobe

rhinorrhoea on day 2 three patients patients 1 2 and 6 had pulmonary ct changes but were asymptomatic all nine patients were found to be positive for anti-rbd igg 100 seroconversion on days 8 and 12 table 2 eight patients 89 95 ci 5799 were simultaneously positive for anti-rbd igg and nasopharyngeal swab rt-qpcr anti-nucleoprotein igm and anti-rbd igm were positive in three patients 33 95 ci 1265 patient 9 was the only patient who seroconverted for both anti-nucleoprotein and anti-rbd igg on day 8 while remaining positive for nasopharyngeal and throat swab viral load the igmigg ratios for anti-nucleoprotein and anti-rbd are shown in table 2 all ratios were less than 1 suggesting that igg was higher than igm at all four timepoints and that the serological response for igg was probably more robust than for igm no obvious pattern could be found to suggest the timing of infection the number of patients with positive anti-nucleoprotein igg increased with a corresponding decrease in positive nasopharyngeal swab rt-qpcr over the 12 days figure 2 the five patients with high-resolution ct ground-glass changes suggestive of pneumonitis were found to have higher median anti-nucleoprotein igg od 202 iqr 181238 vs 048 021085 on day 8 206 179275 vs 047 021091 on day 12 and higher median anti-rbd 106 076116 vs 042 026055 on day 12 than the four patients without high-resolution ct changes to our knowledge this is the first study that investigates the real-time progression of a group of individuals who were initially negative for sars-cov-2 on rt-pcr after exposure to an outbreak of covid-19 on a cruise ship nine individuals later tested positive on rt-pcr from nasopharyngeal swab had high-resolution ct changes or showed seroconversion and were thus found to be infected with sars-cov-2 despite the positive clinical findings six of the nine patients remained asymptomatic throughout the 14-day quarantine after leaving the ship ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic patients 12 if the cruise ship epidemic is a microcosm of the community outbreak scenario then individuals with or without pneumonia could carry the virus for a long period but remain asymptomatic8 9 asymptomatic patients with few or no comorbidities could spread the disease whereas symptomatic patients represent only a small but visible proportion of total cases15 this finding is particularly important in densely populated cities like hong kong with an average living space of 46 m2 per person equivalent to half a parking space16 viral shedding from asymptomatic individuals could be transmitting the virus to others making it difficult to identify and isolate index patients by contact-tracing for early quarantine transmission from asymptomatic individuals could explain in part the rapid increases in numbers of new cases in high-incidence countries such as the usa russia the uk brazil and european nations10
 sars-cov-2 could be spreading via respiratory droplets or through direct and indirect contact via the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts17 18 considering that most outbreaks on cruise ships are of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections the risk of infection and associated morbidity and mortality in passengers increases with longer duration of travel and colder weather19 20 the period of exposure on the diamond princess cruise ship was 3 weeks during which the passengers were unable to disembark which is consistent with the high number of passengers n712 who contracted the infection12 the situation was likely to have been made worse by infected but asymptomatic crew members who continued to work unprotected but who could have been shedding the virus a recent modelling study11 estimated that the initial basic reproduction number r
0 of the outbreak on the diamond princess cruise ship was 148 before any infection control measures had been implemented and while the passengers were a completely naive group the r
0 then decreased to 178 after the quarantine and transfer interventions were initiated feb 517 202011 this estimation of r
0 was lower than that of 22 95 ci 1439 that was suggested at the beginning of the outbreak in wuhan21 although a higher r
0 of more than 3 has also been reported22 an r
0 of 22 for covid-19 would be similar to that of sars and influenza23 nevertheless evacuation of all passengers and crews early on in the outbreak would probably have prevented more infections as suggested by the current findings because the screening test was done between early february and mid-february before the air evacuation we assumed that passengers could have acquired and been incubating the infection shortly before the test and therefore tested negative or they could have acquired the infection after the test based on this assumption we screened 215 passengers by serial virological serological and radiological methods our findings show a dynamic clinical presentation of sars-cov-2 of the three diagnostic methods we used the immunoassay for igg and nasopharyngeal swab rt-qpcr were the most sensitive throat swab rt-qpcr was less sensitive24 it identified only the two patients who consistently had the highest viral load in nasopharyngeal swab rt-qpcr and did not identify the other six patients identified by nasopharyngeal swab rt-qpcr the apparent low sensitivity of throat swab rt-qpcr might also account for the negative screening test done on board the ship by the japanese health ministry the three patients who were febrile felt transiently unwell with concomitant symptoms of malaise unproductive cough and rhinorrhoea the higher baseline nasopharyngeal swab viral load in symptomatic than asymptomatic patients in this study could be explained by the difference in time and degree of exposure to the virus and might not be related to the symptoms25 nevertheless the persistent nasopharyngeal viral load in asymptomatic patients is a major concern for infection control rectal swabs were negative in all nine patients which was expected because none of the patients presented with diarrhoea18 important initial laboratory markers including lymphocyte count c-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase remained normal in these asymptomatic patients seroconversion occurred in all nine patients and it was the only diagnostic marker that was positive for one patient in this cohort who had high-resolution ct changes characteristic of a recent sars-cov-2 infection for those patients who might have acquired the infection earliest and only shortly before the screening test they might have seroconverted with a high igg titre and remained asymptomatic with a negative rt-qpcr with high-resolution ct radiological evidence of sars-cov-2 pneumonitis with ground-glass changes the immunological response could be explained by the lower respiratory tract infection consistent with pneumonia similar to influenza viral infection patients with severe disease and pneumonia had the highest antibody response26 this finding could be related to the more severe viral infection resulting in a stronger induction of the hosts adaptive immunity mediated by b and t cells27 because sars-cov-2 and sars-cov have 90 amino acid homology for nucleoprotein and 73 amino acid homology for rbd serum from patients with sars-cov might cross-react with our sars-cov-2 immunoassay as shown by another group28 however the cross-reactivity between sars-cov-2 and other human coronaviruses is expected to be lower because the amino acid homology with nucleoprotein is less than 50 based on our previous study14 the sensitivity of the serology assay was 94 for anti-nucleoprotein igg 88 for anti-nucleoprotein igm 100 for anti-rbd igg and 94 for anti-rbd igm as stated in the methods the cutoff was based on a pre-pandemic general population cohort of 93 individuals without sars-cov-2 infection therefore we expected that 1 would be outliers14
 the clinical presentation of the nine patients in this cohort ranged from mild to severe among the mild cases patients could remain asymptomatic patients 3 4 and 5 or symptomatic patient 8 with no lower respiratory tract involvement as suggested by normal chest radiograph and high-resolution ct their anti-nucleoprotein and anti-rbd igg levels were low patients with moderate infection had lower respiratory tract involvement as suggested by the ground glass changes on high-resolution ct nevertheless they could still remain asymptomatic patients 1 2 and 6 or become symptomatic patient 7 these patients had higher anti-nucleoprotein and anti-rbd igg than patients with mild disease patient 9 who acquired the infection more recently developed symptoms upon hospitalisation the infection was more severe involving the lower respiratory tract with ground glass changes on high-resolution ct seroconversion took place during the observation period with anti-nucleoprotein and anti-rbd igg still increasing at the end of the observation period overall anti-rbd igg was the most sensitive serology marker although the anti-nucleoprotein igg response was stronger the difference in anti-rbd igg and anti-nucleoprotein igg could be related to the severity of the viral infection in which anti-rbd igg was positive even in patients with upper respiratory tract infection but at low od values indeed serology provides a feasible strategy to track sars-cov-2 infections29 we also investigated changes in igmigg ratio for anti-nucleoprotein and anti-rbd and did not identify any trends that might reflect the timing of infection similar to findings from one of the largest case series from china8 high-resolution ct provided a reasonable diagnostic tool especially in asymptomatic patients in this cohort it was able to detect lung ground-glass opacities in five of nine patients including the three patients with asymptomatic lung infection similar to other studies right-side changes were more common30 individuals with more severe radiological changes tended to have higher nasopharyngeal viral load high-resolution ct could also detect an rt-qpcr-negative asymptomatic patient patient 1 who had high igg and igm titres suggestive of a recent infection nevertheless individuals who develop only an upper respiratory tract infection could still have a normal high-resolution ct chest radiograph detected radiological changes in only four patients this study has several limitations we did not have access to the data of patients who were hospitalised in japan we also did not have the cabin number and location of the participants when they were on board the ship which could have provided some insight into how the infection was transmitted ten passengers did not give consent to participate in the study and therefore we did not have their virological or serological data lastly the study period was limited by the quarantine period and we could not follow up the participants beyond 14 days the participants could have become rt-pcr-positive or antibody-positive after the quarantine period the cruise ship setting provided an unusual opportunity to study the viral shedding and seroconversion of sars-cov-2 mimicking the start of a community outbreak passengers who are exposed to the virus might seroconvert while remaining asymptomatic with a high viral load and they could continue to shed the virus high-resolution ct also helped to establish a clinical diagnosis and to detect cases of asymptomatic lung infection a combination of rt-qpcr and serology should be done to screen for community outbreaks and effectively perform contact tracing  genetics and pathogenesis of feline infectious peritonitis virus meredith brown a jennifer troyer l jill pecon-slattery

eu663755eu664317 during 20042006 fifty-six domestic cats with suspected fip or exposure to infected fip cats from maryland farms and veterinary hospitals were sampled appendix table 1 all samples producing rt-pcr products were from cats positive for antibodies against fcov titers 25 thirty-six sampled cats were from the weller farm where several individual cats were sampled once per year for the 3-year study period healthy and recently deceased or euthanized cats were included from the ambrose farm n  7 palmer veterinary hospital n  3 frederick county animal shelter n  7 seymour farm n  1 and the new market animal hospital n  2 fca-4590 from the weller farm is an important fip case because samples were obtained on may 20 2004 when the cat was clinically healthy predisease and again on december 22 2004 when fip developed in the cat and it died postdisease necropsies were performed on 23 cats that died or were euthanized due to suspected fip most of the necropsied cats were fcov antibody positive appendix table 1 eight cats were classified as fip cases based on histopatholgic findings fca-4549 fca-4566 fca-4590 fca-4618 fca-4653 fca-4662 fca-4663 and fca-4664 figure 2 appendix table 1 the presence of pyogranulomatous lesions at histology evaluation was sufficient for designation of an fip case additionally 5 of the 8 fip cases were evaluated by ihc testing multiple tissues were positive by ihc in each of these cats one cat fca-4561 was ihc positive only in the jejunum and negative by histopathologic analysis on all tissues therefore it was classified as fecv asymptomatic the fcov-seropositive necropsied cats with no characteristic fip histopathologic changes and ihc lesions were classified as fecv asymptomatic appendix table 1 figure 2 healthy cats were classified as fecv asymptomatic if they had normal results on physical examinations were fcov antibody positive titer 25 but not lymphopenic 15 cellsl or were monitored until 2007 and known to be free of fip disease appendix table 1 rt-pcr was attempted with 4 primer pairs designed from fcov genes for all cats figure 3 panel b of the 82 samplings from 56 cats 42 samplings amplified virus with at least 1 primer pair yielding a 51 rate of recovery of viral sequence appendix table 1 from 8 cats with clinical fip and 23 fecv-asymptomatic cats amplification from the 4 viral regions produced 735 cloned viral gene segments that resulted in 501 unique gene sequences  appendix table 2 figure 3 panel b phylogenetic analysis of the cloned virus sequences from 3 maryland locales sampled during 20042006 showed specific patterns of viral dynamics first gene sequences from healthy cats infected with fecv displayed a monophyletic cluster pattern that was generally distinctive from cats diagnosed with fip in the membrane nsp 7b and spike-nsp3 gene segments figure 4 for example every fcov gene sequence for the membrane gene from fip cases fell within a major cluster consisting of 3 principal clades figure 4 by contrast 127154 82 virus gene sequences from fecv-asymptomatic cats sorted in 2 separate clades that were distinct 100 bootstrap statistical support from the viral gene sequences of fip cases figure 4 similar reciprocal monophyly of 140 nsp7b sequences was obtained for fip cases versus fecv-asymptomatic cats figure 4 a consistent disease driven phylogeographic sorting was also observed for the 1017-bp sequence spanning the spike-nsp3 genes albeit with less statistical resolution likely because of evolutionary constraints on gene divergence in this region figure 4 together the remarkable reciprocal monophyly in these 3 genes supports the predictions of the circulating virulent-avirulent strain hypothesis illustrated in figure 1 samples from 1 cat fca-4590 were particularly informative the virus was isolated from the cat predisease and then again 7 months later postdisease fca-4590 was asymptomatic but infected with fecv in may 2004 fcov sampling from that month showed strong high bootstrap affiliation with the fecv-asymptomatic clades for the membrane and the nsp7b genes however virus isolated 7 months later in december 2004 after fip developed in fca-4590 fell within the fip-case clades also with high bootstrap and was indistinguishable from fcov isolated from other cats with fip this finding suggested that the pathogenic fip-case type of fcov infected this cat subsequent to its infection with an avirulent fecv and apparently replaced it tissue-specific differentiation within each cat was minimal figure 4 by contrast there were notable locale-specific distinctions within the sick and healthy cats figure 4 for example the fecv strains in asymptomatic cats from the weller household were associated together in a major fecv subclade strains in cats from the frederick animal shelter were classified in a different subclade nested within the fecv-asymptomatic clade figure 4 the archival fcov virulent strain aju-92 isolated from cheetahs in oregon in 1982 30 defined a phylogenetic lineage distinctive from the fip and fecv-asymptomatic clades resolved in the maryland domestic cats figure 4 nucleotide sequences of membrane and nsp 7b generated in this study were translated to amino acid sequences appendix figure 1 relative to pathogenesis 5 informative amino acid sites were found in the membrane protein at positions 108 120 138 163 and 199 based on reference sequence for tgev genbank no np058427 22 giving rise to 6 composite genotypes potentially diagnostic of fip cases versus fecv-asymptomatic cats  appendix table 2 among the 8 cats with fip 19 fecv-asymptomatic cats and 1 cheetah with fip 6 composite genotypes were identified based on these 5 diagnostic sites  appendix table 2 all domestic cats with fip diagnosed by pathologic or immunohistochemical changes displayed the amino acid signature of either yival i or yiial ii infected cats without clinical fip had the hiivi iii hiivl iv hvial v yvval vi or yival i haplotype no fip cases had haplotype iii iv v or vi whereas 3 fecv-asymptomatic cats carried the yival signature found predominately in fip cases fca-4594 4624 and 4657  appendix table 2 of these 2 cats 4624 and 4657 were euthanized at the time of sampling all euthanized fecv-asymptomatic cats are highlighted in light green in  appendix table 2 therefore whether clinical fip would have later developed in these cats is unknown the other exception cat 4594 was sampled twice in 2004 and again in 2006 the switch in genetic signature from yival in 2004 to hiivi in 2006 may indicate that this cat was able to clear a virulent fipv strain after the 2004 sampling and become reinfected with an avirulent strain by 2006 although a strong phylogenetic signal differentiating fip cases from fecv-asymptomatic cats was seen in nsp 7b figure 4 no diagnostic amino acid changes specific to fip cases vs fecv-asymptomatic controls were found in the nsp 7b nucleotide or amino acid alignments in contrast to the monophyletic findings in the membrane nsp 7b and spike-nsp3 genes cloned viral sequences of pol 1a were paraphyletic in terms of disease phenotype appendix figure 2 infection with fcov is common in cats throughout the world although in most cats the virus causes no clinical signs however in some cats fcov infection is associated with the development of the progressive and fatal disease manifestation of fip this disease is among the most serious viral infections in cats not only because of its fatal nature but also because of the difficulties in diagnosing fip antemortem and controlling the spread of fcov we have presented a molecular virologic study of naturally occurring fcov infection and phylogenetic analysis of the cloned virus sequences obtained from the membrane nsp 7b spike-nsp3 and pol 1a genes isolated from domestic cats located in maryland households infected with fcov during 20042006 we observed predominately monophyletic clustering of strains correlating with disease phenotype in membrane and nsp 7b genes consistent with the circulating virulentavirulent strain hypothesis of fip pathogenesis which calls into question the in vivo mutation hypothesis the amino acid alignments presented in appendix figure 1 clearly demonstrate that in the fipv cases included in this study the genotypes correlated with disease phenotype are ancestrally derived and not the result of a few de novo mutations given the clear genetic differentiation between viruses from fip cases and fecv asymptomatic cats in multiple gene segments we infer that cats become reinfected with new strains of fcov from external sources rather than by in vivo mutations cats in our study were not co-infected with multiple strains of fecv and fipv at the same time and were generally infected with one predominant virus strain two exceptions to this finding in our study were cats with cases of fipv fca-4662 and 4664 that from which distinct gastrointestinal feces or intestine and systemic liver andor ascites fluid viral isolates were obtained which indicates that in vivo superinfection does occur figure 4  appendix table 2 a role of the membrane protein in fip pathogenesis seems likely given its known functions in other coronaviruses the membrane protein is the most abundant structural protein with important functions in virus budding and with cell-mediated host immunity 31 the specific functions of the membrane protein amino acid sequences have been determined in severe acute respiratory syndrome sarscov 32 aligning the sequences from this study with sars-cov the first diagnostic amino acid site 108 aligns to a site just upstream from the second transmembrane helix appendix figure 1 a tyrosine at position 108 which is found in all fipv biotypes and shared among sars-cov has a neutral polarity in contrast to a histidine there found in most fecv biotypes which have a positive polarity and may play a role in the stability of the virus within the membrane site 120 aligns within the third transmembrane helix site 138 aligns just downstream to the transmembrane helice site 163 aligns within the c-terminus which projects inside the virus particle and site 199 also within the c-terminus domain aligns within a defined sars-immunodominant epitope 32 figure 5 the demonstration of 6 naturally occurring composite genotypes based on 5 variable sites in the membrane protein amino acid alignment that are highly correlative with disease phenotype  appendix table 2 offers specific opportunities for developing diagnostics and for the preventive management of this disease by extending this study to additional cat populations in disparate geographic locations designing chimeric fcov challenge experiments and investigating host genetic correlations with pathogenesis we will be able to further discern the causative factors in fip pathogenesis fca-4594 which was infected with the disease-associated genotype composite without succumbing to fip suggests additional requirements for viral pathogenesis as has been suggested in the outbreak of fip in a colony of captive cheetahs 33 host immune genetics may play a role both the viral strain and host immune genes contribute to disease progression and virus-related death such as aids progression in hiv infection with the recent publication of the full cat genome sequence 34 and the viral genotype composites described here new genomic tools are now available to proceed with both viral and host genetic association studies in the pathogenesis in fcov infection a model for coronavirus infection in humans such as sars-cov  the time for universal masking of the public for coronavirus disease 2019 is now monica gandhi diane havlir   although the debate on whether sars-cov-2 is airborne versus droplet is still raging 27 sars-cov-2 is highly contagious compared with the following sars-cov-1 the coronavirus that led to the sars epidemic in 2002 8 middle east respiratory syndrome mers the coronavirus that led to mers in 2012 9 and seasonal viral influenza coronavirus disease 2019 has spread exponentially worldwide since the cluster of infections in wuhan province was first reported to the who on december 31 2019 10 as of this writing worldwide estimates of covid-19 cases exceed 18 million a number that is likely grossly underestimated due to inadequate testing capability in many settings although the airborne versus droplet question is relevant to healthcare settings which involve close contact and has guided infection control recommendations and type of masks required accordingly 7 10 the most compelling reason for public masking is due to the data on spread from asymptomatic individuals 11 for the general public surgical isolation masks as part of an overall public health strategy should be able to curb dissemination of both droplet-spread and airborne viruses to the breathing zones of nearby individuals 1217 there is considerable evidence that presymptomatic persons those without current symptoms who eventually go on to develop symptoms or asymptomatic persons defined as individuals who never go on to develop symptoms with sars-cov-2 can infect others asymptomatic or presymptomatic heretofore combined into the single term of paucisymptomatic transmission of a respiratory virus requires shedding of viable virus in the oropharynx nasopharynx or other body fluids mounting evidence that sars-cov-2 displays high rates of viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract eg nasopharynx oropharynx even among paucisymptomatic individuals distinguishes it from sars-cov-1 in which replication occurs mainly in the lower respiratory tract 1820 and viral influenza in which individuals with asymptomatic disease have lower viral loads in the upper respiratory tract versus those without symptoms 21 22 data from the diamond princess cruise ship suggest that up to 18 of cases were asymptomatic despite detectable sars-cov-2 ribonucleic acid in the nasopharynx or oropharynx 23 a similar report in the morbidity and mortality weekly report mmwr 24 detailed clusters of cases in singapore from january 23 to march 16 2020 and estimated that more than 6 of transmissions occur from paucisymptomatic individuals finally after identification of a case of covid-19 in a hcw in a skilled nursing facility snf in washington state 76 residents of the snf were tested for sars-cov-2 and 48 63 had positive swabs with 27 56 being paucisymptomatic moreover sars-cov-2 viral loads were quantitatively similar in those with symptoms and those who were asymptomatic 11 with viral culture demonstrating viability even before symptoms two other studies besides the one from the washington state snf 11 have demonstrated similar quantitative nasopharynx and oropharynx sars-cov-2 viral loads among paucisymptomatic and symptomatic individuals with covid-19 25 26 analysis of presymptomatic and symptomatic patients demonstrates high viral loads and viable virus readily isolated in culture shortly before and after the onset of symptoms 27 a study detailing the clinical and virological characteristics of 5 patients in france showed that 2 patients had high viral loads of sars-cov-2 in nasopharyngeal secretions soon after symptom onset 28 lower respiratory tract specimens may have higher viral loads than those in upper respiratory samples during the phase of active pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome with sars-cov-2 29 however high viral loads of sars-cov-2 in upper respiratory tract samples among patients without symptoms suggest a high risk of transmissibility 30 modeling studies have also demonstrated that paucisymptomatic infections with sars-cov-2 could be responsible for a large proportion of transmissions 31 32 with early case reports and familial clusters also indicating asymptomatic transmission 3340 in sum the degree of transmissibility from asymptomatic individuals in sars-cov-2 is the most compelling argument for universal public masking the literally breathtaking pace of the covid-19 pandemic is reflected in the lack of a unified public health responses to curb transmission however recommendations have coalesced on the use of isolation facemasks eg surgical masks for hcws in the clinical workspace after an article in the new yorker on march 21 2020 by dr atul gawande 41 encouraging this protective measure for hcws in the united states based on experiences from singapore and hong kong the boston hospitals mandated this measure for hcws on march 22 2020 42 followed by hospitals around the country in quick succession universal cloth face masking for the public was recommended by the cdc on april 3 2020 but it has been actively debated in the white house 43 a systematic review of physical interventions to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses for the public showed that surgical masks are the most consistent and comprehensive measure to interrupt transmission because n95 masks can irritate the skin and thereby reduce compliance 16 44 universal public masking was adopted in singapore south korea hong kong mainland china thailand and taiwan 45 46 after their respective covid-19 outbreaks and may have contributed to their initial success rates to curbing transmission along with widespread testing isolation and quarantining contact tracing and border control measures asian countries were heavily impacted by sars-cov-1 8 which may have led to a more rapid institution of universal masking for sars-cov-2 47 in the early stages of the epidemic taiwan immediately increased its capacity to mass produce surgical isolation masks for hcws and the public 28 and they announced plans on april 1 2020 to donate 10 million masks to countries most severely impacted by the coronavirus a major argument against universal public masking in addition to other public health measures has been limited supplies of personal protective equipment including surgical masks in the face of a sudden pandemic for which hcws must be prioritized we cannot conflate what we think should be done and what can be done industries in the united states can repurpose to produce surgical masks in vast quantities for the public 48 as in taiwan 45 and such production will allow equal access to mask supplies across all strata of society the cdc has provided guidance on which cloth materials are the most effective for preventing the spread of respiratory droplets 12 49 although ensuring that equality to access is imperative and recommendations on how to prolong the life of disposable masks and reuse masks are widespread 50 another major concern is that the public will let their guard down with masking 2 this can be addressed with strong public health messaging performed in tandem with new policy the effects of the lockdown and shelter-in-place guidelines for most of the united states on the economy have been devastating taiwan with the most consistent supply of surgical isolation masks for its people including medical public and industrial sectors and with stringent social distancing guidelines and other public health measures has maintained control of its epidemic without mandating work and school closure when social distancing is not possible the taiwanese centers for disease control has mandated that members of the public wear face masks including on public transportation where fines may be incurred for noncompliance the country of taiwan remains one of the most controlled in terms of the covid-19 epidemic to date with 388 cases and 6 deaths as of april 12 2020 51 an eventual and cautious recommendation for a return to work in the united states with public masks for crowded indoor or outdoor spaces as one component of the updated guidelines could provide much-needed relief for the economy tips for how children can be encouraged to wear face masks are already emerging 52 in conclusion we strongly endorse universal public masking in the united states for crowded indoor or public spaces including supermarkets public gatherings and in close workplaces this recommendation does not replace our population-level public health approaches including social distancing in the short term but it does serve as an adjunct with the hope that we will be able to relax such measures as transmission slows  epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease-2019 in shiyan city china long liu xu lei xiao xiao jing yang jian li

to wuhan figure 1 as of midnight of february 11 2020 the confirmed covid-19 cases in the cities outside wuhan are migrate rate-dependent emerged figure 1 in shiyan city located in the southwest of hubei province and 440 km from wuhan city the migrant population was 186 about 93000 people which accounted for people who came back from wuhan in the period between january 10 and january 24 2020 figure 2a based on the incubation period of sars-cov-2 the epidemiological data of confirmed covid-19 cases that emerged in shiyan were collected from january 23 2020 the number of confirmed covid-19 cases onset in hubei province showed a rapid increase before february 4 2020 peaking at 3156 and then showed a gradually decreasing trend figure 2b the same trend of newly confirmed cases was also found in shiyan city with a peak of 44 cases that fluctuated between february 2 and february 7 2020 as of midnight of february 23 there were a total of 669 confirmed cases in shiyan and only two related deaths however 374 patients were still under treatment in hospital including 20 with severe illness and 15 with critically severe illness the overall case fatality rate cfr of covid-19 patients in hubei province was 382 from january 23 to february 11 2020 the 64 confirmed cases returning from wuhan were surveyed the 112 confirmed cases in local clusters without travel history to wuhan implied that second-generation patients appeared in shiyan through close contact these included 52 local cases that had clear contact history with the covid-19 patients from wuhan or local citizens figure 3a fifteen of them with no close contact with covid-19 patients and 45 local cases with unknown sources had been infected with the virus notably the onset of 12 cases were confirmed after close contact with 11 travelers from wuhan who were asymptomatic carriers and showed no signs of illness after returning from wuhan after nearly 1 month figure 3b another 12 cases caused four secondary infections in this period the transmission rate caused by asymptomatic carriers was 107 12112 among the 176 surveyed cases including wuhan travelers and local citizens 689 related close contacts were tracked figure 4 forty-seven patients transmitted the virus and caused 85 confirmed cases including 40 patients who transmitted the virus to 64 family members the infection rate in our surveyed data was 1234 85689 and the r0 was 181 8547 which is lower than the recent reports because of the family quarantine measures chen t m et al 2020 contact tracing of the 47 cases showed that 14 of them traveled back from wuhan 13 contacted covid-19 patients and nine came into contact with wuhan travelers and confirmed covid-19 cases in addition six patients had contact history with wuhan travelers and five showed unknown infection routes which included three patients that transmitted the virus to their family members and colleagues and another two that spread the virus to their colleagues or friends to better understand the clinical features of covid-19 cases we tracked up to february 23 2020 the clinical data on 53 patients 26 male and 27 female were collected in the department of infectious diseases of shiyan renmin hospital hubei province with laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection six 113 of these patients were 14 years old 12 226 were aged between 15 and 30 years 29 547 were aged between 31 and 59 years and six 113 were 60 years the median age was 38 years interquartile range 2847 years table 1 interestingly we noticed that 25 472 patients were co-infected with m pneumoniae table 5 who had a lower neutrophils percentage 5964  3119 vs 7028  2558 p  00264 and higher monocytes percentage 1818  1654 vs 9733  1615 p  00044 compared with m pneumoniae negative patients table 2 six 113 of the 53 covid-19 patients were co-infected with other common respiratory pathogens such as iav ibv and rsv respectively among the 53 covid-19 patients 26 490 had the following underlying diseases three 57 had hypertension one 8 had diabetes eight 151 had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease three 57 had cerebrovascular disease three 57 had renal disease and nine 170 had liver disease only six 113 of the 53 patients had history of exposure in wuhan twenty-two 604 of the 53 patients were associated with familial clusters the most common symptoms at illness onset were fever 46 868 cough 35 66 and expectoration 32 604 other symptoms at illness onset were myalgia or fatigue 17 321 hemoptysis 1 19 headache 14 264 and diarrhea 3 57 table 1 on admission the blood counts of 21 396 of the 53 patients showed leucopenia white blood cell count 4  109l and 22 415 showed lymphopenia lymphocyte count 10  109l table 3 the levels of c-reactive protein crp were elevated in 22 415 patients and the levels of aspartate aminotransferase ast were increased in 11 208 patients twenty-two 792 patients had normal serum levels of procalcitonin pct 01 ngml all patients had pneumonia and showed abnormalities on either chest ct or radiographs typical chest ct findings of infected patients on admission were bilateral or multiple lobular or subsegmental areas of consolidation or bilateral ground glass opacity figure 5 of the 53 patients only one patient age 40 years was transferred to an intensive care unit for acute respiratory distress syndrome and received mechanical ventilation all patients received antiviral treatment table 4 among the 53 covid-19 patients co-infected with m pneumoniae 25 2553 472 were given antibiotic levofloxacin treatment and 12 1253 226 were given systematic corticosteroid and -immunoglobulin treatment at the time of writing this paper all 53 100 patients were discharged and there were no deaths fitness for discharge was based on subsiding of fever for at least 3 days with improved evidence on chest radiography and viral clearance in samples from the lower respiratory tract in shiyan city the first laboratory-confirmed case of covid-19 was identified in january 23 2020 and the epidemic has experienced an increasing trend before february 2 the growth phase of new cases is consistent with most other regions outside wuhan in hubei province because ct-based diagnosis of covid-19 was considered a confirmatory criterion in hubei province diagnosis treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia trial version 6 revised who china office 2020 more than 10000 patients were treated in hospital on february 12 2020 lu j et al 2020 the growth trend in hubei province and shiyan city was lower than the expected growth curve because of the strict quarantine measures peng et al 2020 roosa et al 2020 during the chinese traditional new year most family members and relatives gather at home and share the festivities therefore cluster cases occurred mainly among family members and originated either from wuhan travelers or those that came into contacting with covid-19 patients the origin of the virus could not be confirmed in five patients and 12 patients had made contact with passengers traveling from wuhan who were asymptomatic carrier and not in the incubation period although asymptomatic and presymptomatic infection of sars-cov-2 has been reported recently most of them subsequently developed symptoms arons et al 2020 bai et al 2020 rothe et al 2020 there was no evidence that these 11 individuals from wuhan had an incubation period of more than 1 month and transferred the virus to their family members during this period currently published research basically reported that confirmed cases in the presymptomatic stage can result in transmission liu et al 2020 yu et al 2020 it is yet not clear the transmissibility and transmission rate by asymptomatic carriers therefore it is necessary to assess the transmissibility of asymptomatic carriers strengthening the management of asymptomatic patients and tracing the close contacts of asymptomatic individuals can close the loophole according to the statistics of clinical cases children seem to be less infected the infection is mainly concentrated in the age group of 3159 years children and youth have been less infected which may be due to other unknown reasons according to previous reports men are more likely to be infected with sars-cov-2 than women yang et al 2020 but our study found no significant difference in the infection rate of men and women most importantly 25 472 of the 53 covid-19 patients were co-infected with m pneumoniae common respiratory pathogens such as seasonal influenza viruses were not common in the 53 covid-19 patients because monocytes increased after m pneumoniae infection alone puljiz et al 2006 wang et al 2019 indicating the involvement of monocyte-related mechanisms in the pathogenesis of m pneumoniae co-infection in covid-19 patients this suggests that we should pay more attention to m pneumoniae co-infection for covid-19 patients during clinical testing and corresponding treatment the existence of underlying diseases may promote the generation of sars-cov-2 infection to a certain extent this is also one of the reasons for the higher mortality rate of the elderly covid-19 patients ji et al 2020 only a few patients had been to wuhan while most of the other patients acquired local infections this confirmed the strong infectivity of sars-cov-2 therefore controlling local clusters is key to prevent outbreaks from imported cases fever cough and expectoration are the main clinical symptoms of covid-19 however it is particularly interesting to note that 132 patients in our study showed no fever symptom despite being infected this suggests that the severity of sars-cov-2 infection could be graded by combining crp levels with the patients age lu h et al 2020 in this study we showed that 415 of patients had abnormally high crp levels 5 mgl on admission decreased leukocyte and lymphocyte counts indicated that the immune function of patients was compromised consistent with a previous report by xu et al 2020 from the perspective of clinical treatment antiviral treatment including antiviral traditional chinese medicine played a better therapeutic role in addition early detection of infection and symptomatic treatment were essential to reduce mortality however rt-pcr test results had a false-negative rate chan et al 2020a li z et al 2020 at present asymptomatic carriers have been identified guan et al 2020 and patients discharged from hospitals may still be carriers of the virus lan et al 2020 therefore it is very important to find more effective detection methods according to our clinical observation ct imaging can effectively detect sars-cov-2 infection however fever cough and other related symptoms cannot be used as absolute evidence of infection controlling and stopping the outbreak of a new pathogen that is effectively transmitted from person to person remains extremely challenging for most countries especially when the sars-cov-2 has become a global pandemic having spread to 114 countries who director-generals opening remarks at the media briefing on covid-19-11 march 2020 therefore vaccine research is crucial for effective treatment and control of viral transmission however animal experiments and clinical trials are time consuming and cannot produce immediate results china has heavily invested in medical resources to treat the covid-19 patients especially elderly patients with severe and critical illness strict intervention measures adopted by the government should be referenced in other regions with heavy outbreaks moreover high-quality epidemiological investigations can find close contacts and early asymptomatic infections reducing the potential risk of transmission by asymptomatic infection could lead to the stabilized epidemic all datasets presented in this study are included in the articlesupplementary material this study was approved by the shiyan renmin hospital of hubei

 patients 2 and 3 a husband and wife couple from zhejiang china were also confirmed to have the disease on january 25 and 27 similar to patient 1 the couple had no history of epidemiological contact according to a video from the district public security department on the afternoon of january 22 patient 2 and a confirmed individual were at the same clinic for 50 seconds where both of them did not wear masks

 sarscov2 possesses powerful pathogenicity and transmissibility being more infectious than sarscov and merscov
6
 encountering a confirmed patient and being close for 15 or 50 seconds is not the only route of infection though it is the most likely route in the above two cases moreover being infected within a very short exposure time is possible in the absence of masks
7
 the powerful infectivity of sarscov2 may be explained by the latest findings reported by wrapp d et al
8
 which showed that the sarscov2 s binds to angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors with a higher affinity than sarscov s another underlying reason was reported by zou l et al
9
 in that the shedding pattern of viral nucleic acid in patients infected with sarscov2 is similar to that in patients with influenza and appears to be different from that in patients infected with sarscov sarscov2 often causes cluster transmission especially within family clusters in some cities cases involving cluster transmission accounted for 50 to 80 of all confirmed cases of covid19
10
 humantohuman transmission of sarscov and merscov occurred mainly through nosocomial transmission and transmission between family members only occurred in 13 to 21 of mers cases and 22 to 39 of sars cases
11

 sarscov2 can be transmitted by droplets and contact a study in south korea showed that many environmental surfaces of patients with mers were contaminated by merscov and virus rna was detected from environmental surfaces within 5 days after the last positive pcr of patients respiratory samples
12
 guangzhou cdc also found sarscov2 in the house of a confirmed patient
13
 which serves as evidence of contact transmission moreover live viruses have been found in the feces of patients with covid19
14
 however the fecaloral transmission of the virus has not been shown studies have shown that sarscov may be detected in the feces of most sars patients
15
 and the virus within feces could survive at room temperature for at least 1 to 2 days
16
 it is possible but infrequent for sarscov to spread via the fecaloral route
17
 in patients with mers feces and urine samples also yielded viral rna
18
 given the evidence of fecal contamination of sarscov and merscov as well as their ability to survive in feces it is possible that sarscov2 may also be transmitted through the fecaloral route
19
 additionally in regard to the expression of ace2 in the intestine and kidney sarscov2 may infect these tissues and enter the feces allowing its potential spread via fecaloral route
20

 
the lancet also reminded doctors not to ignore sarscov2 transmission via ocular surfaces as infected droplets and bodily fluids may easily contaminate the human conjunctival epithelium
21
 guangfa wang a member of the national health commission of the peoples republic of china nhc expert panel on pneumonia was exposed to a fever clinic in wuhan with only his eyes unprotected he then demonstrated symptoms of conjunctivitis in his left lower eyelid 2 days before the onset of covid19
22

 on february 19 the nhc published the 6th edition of guideline on diagnosis and treatment of covid19 the 6th guideline for covid19
23
 this document asserted that the transmission of sarscov2 mainly occurs via large droplets and contact additionally the virus may spread in an unventilated environment with high levels of viral aerosols in addition researchers claimed the spread of sarscov2 could be characterized by superspreading events
24
 however there is no evidence of superspreading events in any medical institution that treats patients suffering from covid19
6
 and a study in south korea showed that for transmission of merscov nonisolated inhospital days was the only factor which tended to be higher in superspreaders than usualspreaders
25
 therefore whether there are superspreaders or not early isolation is necessary to reduce the size of the outbreak of sarscov2 over the past few days asymptomatic patients were found in many chinese cities table 1 outlines its summary on january 24 the lancet reported a familial cluster of sarscov2 infection five family members with a travel history to wuhan were confirmed to have covid19 after returning to shenzhen with their asymptomatic child presenting with no fever respiratory tract symptoms or diarrhoea but had groundglass lung opacities seen on radiography
26
 subsequently asymptomatic patients were discovered in many chinese cities with most of them having an epidemiological history asymptomatic infections may occur due to weakened immune responses and subclinical manifestations or because the virus is waiting for opportunities to reproduce and invade to understand its mechanism requires additional investigation of asymptomatic patients as well as blood tests pointing to signs of an immune response which can help detect asymptomatic or presymptomatic cases
27
 a study showed that during the outbreak of sarscov of all exposed health care workers 75 were asymptomatic sarspositive cases asymptomatic sars was associated with lower sars antibody titers and a higher use of masks compared to that of pneumonic sars
28
 another study showed that of 255 patients with laboratoryconfirmed merscov a total of 64 patients 251 were reported to be asymptomatic however 33 52 of the 64 patients were interviewed with 26 79 of them having reported at least one respiratory symptom
29
 this phenomenon indicates whether asymptomatic patients were actually infected without showing symptoms whether asymptomatic people can transmit sarscov2 to others is unclear the 6th guide for covid19 noted that asymptomatic patients may serve as a source of infection an article in nejm first reported a german to be confirmed with covid19 after contact with an asymptomatic chinese patient
30
 however it turned out that the chinese patient had a fever in germany and took antipyretics a recent study in nejm reported that a viral load detected in an asymptomatic patient was similar to that detected in symptomatic patients indicating the potential for transmission in asymptomatic patients
9
 table 1 indicates that these asymptomatic patients may infect others or develop symptoms later but the number of patients involved is small we remind readers to take this into account when interpreting the research results and conclusions as some of the above observations may be accidental another uncertainty is whether those who are asymptomatic can cause largescale infections a study in south korea showed that during the mers outbreak in korea an asymptomatic patient with mers was discovered and none of the 82 persons exposed to that patient without protection was infected
31
 most of the asymptomatic patients had close contact with confirmed patients hence they may be isolated in a timely manner when tracking close contacts moreover the number of asymptomatic patients was very small according to epidemiological data in mainland china only 12 of patients with covid19 are asymptomatic
6
 due to the above reasons such patients will generally not cause largescale transmissions of sarscov2
32

 patient 11 an infant born at the wuhan childrens hospital on february 2 was delivered by a mother who was confirmed to have covid19 the cord blood and placental tissue were collected immediately and tested negative for sarscov2 but nasopharyngeal swab samples collected 36 hours after birth were positive
33

 sarscov2 is a novel virus and shares a 790 nucleotide identity with the sequence of sarscov and a 518 identity with that of merscov
34
 therefore the risk of vertical transmission of covid19 may be similar to sarscov and merscov a study in hong kong investigated 12 pregnant women with sars and showed that all five newborn infants were negative for sars especially three of which who were delivered in the acute stage of maternal sars infection and faced serious risks of perinatal infection
35
 another article reported a pregnant woman with mers in which all laboratory results related to merscov in the newborn were negative as well as that of the cord blood and placenta
36

 infants may certainly be infected by covid19 however the latest research in jama reported nine infants under 1 year of age suffering from covid19 the youngest of which is only 56 days old
37
 currently no evidence exists that shows sarscov2 may be transmitted in the uterus
38
 here the newborn infant was negative for the disease in both cord blood and placenta but lacked pharyngeal swab specimens at birth the swabs positive for sarscov2 were collected 36 hours following the birth therefore the possibility of transmission by droplets and contact cannot be ignored recently the lancet reported nine pregnant women confirmed with covid19
39
 who all delivered by cesarean section neonatal throat swabs amniotic fluid cord blood and breastmilk samples from six of these patients were collected and all samples tested negative for sarscov2 this indicates that the risk of vertical transmission of sarscov2 is limited as no presence of virus particles in the products of conception or in the infants existed however limited by a small sample size more investigation and evidence is required to confirm this conclusion patient 12 a male from wuhan china was admitted to the beijing sinojapanese friendship hospital for severe influenza a on january 30 he had oropharyngeal swabs done with realtime rtpcr three times before admission where all tested negative for sarscov2 but positive for influenza a virus after admission he used an invasive ventilator to assist in his ventilation and was confirmed to be positive for sarscov2 via alveolar lavage test on february 5 a total of 23 staff were quarantined for 14 days as a result
40

 this case involves the diagnosis of covid19 in specific cases the diagnostic criteria of infectious diseases should be extended to prevent epidemics in the middle of january when the nhc visited wuhan patients with covid19 had been defined by historical criteria a a history of exposure to the southern china seafood market b symptoms of fever and c the full genome of the virus from respiratory or serum specimens were identical to sarscov2 sequences
41
 the diagnostic criteria were strict as only a few people are able to sequence the entire viral genome which resulted in many patients having diseases unable to receive a diagnosis
41
 therefore although primary hospitals noticed humantohuman virus transmissions evidence was still unclear because only 41 cases were confirmed in wuhan between january 5 and january 15
42
 which directly led to the delay of epidemic control until january 17 experts analyzed the epidemiological data of infected pneumonia cases and found that some cases had no history of exposure to the seafood market they adopted an optimized sarscov2 nucleic acid detection kit rtpcr to test specimens of patients with unexplained pneumonia and confirmed 17 covid19 cases after reconsidering the diagnostic criteria
43
 therefore the number of confirmed cases began to increase dramatically each day and the chinese government began to fight against sarscov2 
the 5th edition of guideline on diagnosis and treatment of covid19 the 5th guideline for covid19 published by nhc
44
 shows that patients satisfying the following criteria are considered to have covid19 a epidemiological history and b clinical features of i fever andor respiratory tract symptoms ii radiographic evidence iii low or normal whitecell count or low lymphocyte count in the early period patients possessing an epidemiological history consistent with any two clinical features are diagnosed as suspected cases suspected cases are confirmed using any of the following pathogenic detection criteria a positive for sarscov2 via respiratory or serum specimens examined with realtime rtpcr or b the full genome sequences of the virus from respiratory or serum specimens were identical to sarscov2 sequences nonetheless the pcr results for sarscov2 are related to the quality of the examined kit as well as to the novel coronaviruss characteristics sampling location sampling volume transportation and storage as well as laboratory test conditions and personnel operation sarscov2 interacts with the ace2 receptor a cellsurface protein mainly found on lung alveolar epithelial cells
45
 the alveolar lavage test is the best way to confirm sarscov2 however the detection of alveolar lavage fluid is mostly used in severe patients using an invasive ventilator sputum is considered the second choice though the coughs of many patients with covid19 are unproductive
46
 therefore pharyngeal swabs are the most common sampling method however they may occasionally cause missed diagnoses for smaller levels of sarscov2 residing in the pharynx in addition pcr detection takes up a lot of time hampering the control of infectious diseases therefore the revised version of the 5th edition added clinical confirmed standards for the hubei province
47
 here suspected cases are defined as patients having an epidemiological history with i and iii clinical features clinically confirmed cases are defined as suspected cases with ii as noted in table 2 after the revised diagnostic criteria was adopted the number of covid19 cases in hubei province increased by 14 840 on february 12 compared to february 11 data taken from the nhc after most patients were diagnosed the 6th guideline for covid19

23
 published by the nhc on february 19 canceled the diagnostic differences between hubei and other provinces at the same time patients without a clear epidemiological history were able to be diagnosed as suspected cases according to the three clinical characteristics mentioned above sarscov2 possesses powerful pathogenicity and transmissibility and deserves attention from all countries across the world it can be transmitted by asymptomatic patients but vertical transmission from mother to child remains to be confirmed clinical features epidemiological history and pathogen detection are important in the diagnosis of covid19 where making an accurate diagnosis in time is necessary to control the outbreak to solve any uncertainties regarding sarscov2 additional investigations concerning asymptomatic and pregnant patients are required  clinical outcomes in 55 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 who were asymptomatic at hospital admission in shenzhen china yanrong wang yingxia liu lei liu xianfeng wang nijuan luo ling li   this study was approved by the ethics committee of the third peoples hospital of shenzhen china on 23 february 2020 informed consent was obtained from all of the patients or their guardians cases were classified as follows 1 mild mild clinical symptoms without pneumonia seen at chest computed tomography 2 ordinary fever and other respiratory symptoms with pneumonia seen at imaging 3 severe respiratory distress hypoxia oxygen saturation 93 or abnormal results of blood gas analysis pao2  0 mm hg or paco2 50 mm hg and 4 critical respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation shock or other organ failure requiring intensive care unit monitoring and treatment we obtained data from medical records including all symptoms at onset physical examination findings all study subjects were asymptomatic at admission symptoms that developed during hospitalization were recorded laboratory and imaging data and personal history we included in the study asymptomatic patients who had laboratory-confirmed positive results for sars-cov-2 based on nucleic acid testing of pharyngeal swab samples 8 after the diagnosis of covid-19 in a family member and who were admitted to the third peoples hospital of shenzhen from 11 january 2020 to 29 february 2020 the exclusion criteria were suspected covid-19 with symptoms such as fever cough fatigue poor appetite diarrhea and headache at admission laboratory data include complete blood cell count c-reactive protein crp level erythrocyte sedimentation rate liver and renal function electrolyte levels coagulation test results and levels of procalcitonin interleukin 6 lactate dehydrogenase ldh and creatine kinase pharyngeal swab samples were collected for the sars-cov-2 test on the day of admission the collected samples stored at 2c8c were sent on ice to the center for disease control and prevention of shenzhen viral rna was extracted from pharyngeal swab samples using the qiaamp rna viral kit qiagen and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed using the primers and probes targeting the orf1ab and n genes of sars-cov-2 as recommended by the chinese center for disease control and prevention 9 virus clearance was defined as 2 consecutive negative nucleic acid test results at a sampling interval of 1 day all acquired data were cross-checked by 2 investigators to ensure that there was no duplicated information investigators were trained to use a standardized questionnaire to collect epidemiological information immediately after patients were admitted with face-to-face interviews with the patients or their guardians and relevant medical staff basic descriptive analyses were performed in all patients ibm spss 180 statistical software was used for statistical analyses a total of 55 asymptomatic case patients were identified with sars-cov-2 infection after the onset of illness in an infected family member these included 22 male and 33 female patients aged from 2 to 69 years their median age was 49 years and 309 were 3049 years old table 1 more than half of the patients belonged to the native population of hubei province ordinary covid-19 was the outcome in 709 of the asymptomatic case patients of the 55 patients only 7 had mild cough and 7 had low fever 380c 35 days later including 2 with both a 2-year-old boy had ordinary covid-19 diagnosed after being testing 3 times within 2 weeks despite being asymptomatic the 55 patients were admitted immediately and medically isolated the interval between hospitalization and illness onset was 17 days on admission all 55 patients underwent chest computed tomography ct which showed pneumonia in 37 chest ct findings were initially normal in 18 patients 327 16 experienced no symptoms during hospitalization two women 60 years old were admitted promptly after their infected family members and had normal chest ct findings on day 1 during the course of hospitalization they both had mild cough and low fever 5 days later along with hypoxia oxygen saturation 90 and restlessness repeated ct showed pneumonia figure 1 after informed consent was obtained lopinavir-ritonavir therapy was initiated in all 55 patients and continued for 7 days the 2 patients with hypoxia were also treated with intravenous immunoglobulin 10 gd and methylprednisolone 12 mgkgd therapy for 3 days and with a heated humidified high-flow nasal cannula for 5 days eventually they both recovered without complications none of the patients were admitted to the intensive care unit all the patients recovered and were discharged to home in all patients results of 2 consecutive nucleic acid tests of nasopharyngeal swab samples sampling interval 1 day were negative for sars-cov-2 after 421 days three sputum samples from patients with ordinary covid-19 were negative 35 days after nasopharyngeal swab testing a history of hypertension was present in 8 patients and a history of cholecystitis hypothyroidism chronic pharyngitis hepatitis b and asthma in 1 patient each epstein-barr virus was diagnosed serologically in 1 patient and mycoplasma pneumoniae in 3 neutropenia and lymphocyte counts below normal occurred in 11 patients each initial biochemical results showed elevated crp levels erythrocyte sedimentation rate and ldh levels in 10 20 and 13 patients respectively table 2 overall of the 55 patients admitted with asymptomatic sars-cov-2 infection in this study group 14 had mild 39 had ordinary and 2 had severe covid-19 during hospitalization age was significantly associated with asymptomatic occurrence asymptomatic cases occurred seldom among young people 1829 years old this was a novel discovery but one we should interpret with caution owing to the small number of patients in the current study we found that 36 of asymptomatic patients with sars-cov-2 infection might take a turn for the worse only 2 patients had typical symptoms both cough and fever 10 35 days after hospital admission family members with fatigue and dry cough and particularly those with fever were easily noticed but asymptomatic members were initially ignored many asymptomatic persons were actually a source of sars-cov-2 infection but were considered healthy before they underwent screening the risk of viral spread from asymptomatic patients with infection suggest that prompt screening of family members of infected persons is important it is evident that family cluster transmission of sars-cov-2 was one main mode of transmission 11 a previous study in nanjing found that people 15 years old were prone to be asymptomatic 12 we found that asymptomatic cases of infection occurred seldom in young people 1829 years old in shenzhen nucleic acid testing would therefore be crucial to screen for asymptomatic infections in this population a previous study indicated that crp and ldh levels may be predictors of disease severity 13 crp levels ldh levels and white blood cell counts were elevated occurred in 10 13 and 1 patient respectively eleven patients including the 2 with severe infection had leukopenia here we found no relationship between clinical type and laboratory results this should be further investigated in 3 patients sputum samples became negative 35 days later than nasopharyngeal swab samples to et al 14 reported that serial monitoring of saliva viral load generally showed a declining trend we therefore recommend that monitoring viral loads in sputum samples is crucial in late-stage covid-19 as previously recommended 15 however the current study has several limitations first the data are retrospectively analyzed so the possibility of recall bias cannot be ruled out second we collected most but not all laboratory data however shenzhen is an international city with adequate public health interventions and medications the enrolled patients were identified through systematic screening of the family members of patients with covid-19 all asymptomatic patients were admitted to the third peoples hospital of shenzhen the only designated hospital in shenzhen so the study population is representative of the whole city in conclusion we present here the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with asymptomatic sars-cov-2 infection in shenzhen in our study asymptomatic infection was seldom seen in young people the proportion with severe covid-19 was low and the proportion with ordinary covid-19 was high to better minimize the risk of sars-cov-2 infection preventive measures focusing on high-risk populations are recommended a negative sputum swab test was recommended to the isolation of the infection source  application of a portable instrument for rapid and

 coronaviruses belong to the family coronaviridae and are characterized by a positivesense singlestranded rna genome that was released via the community online resource virologicalorg on 10 january wuhanhu1 genbank accession number mn908947 after that four other genomes were deposited on 12 january in the viral sequence database of the global initiative on sharing all influenza data gisaid the genome sequence showed that the virus is closely related to the coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome sars agent of the 200203 outbreak of sars in humans this virus family includes a large number of viruses present in rhinolophid bats in both europe and asia these viruses are pathogen of animals such as birds and mammals in humans they typically induce mild respiratory infections generally observed in the common cold a workflow of the coronavirus primary screening has been shown in figure 1 a reliable diagnosis of the viral infection is one the most urgent priorities for public health management of the disease spread usually in acute respiratory infection rtpcr is traditionally employed to identify viruses in respiratory secretions a robust detection technology is usually based on realtime rtpcr because it is highly sensitive and specific although it requires infrastructure skilled personnel and at least 46 hours for analysis currently available techniques do not provide results before several hours or even days and the tests require a wellequipped laboratory and trained personnel indeed these methods are not efficient to rapidly screen a high number of individuals in places where thousands of people transit per hours these methods are effective in confirming the infections when symptoms are already present but they are completely inefficient to identify infections at asymptomatic stage the development of a means for a quick and simple detection of this virus in humans is a worldwide priority considering that infections have been observed in world areas such as africa where the scarce health assistance will not be able to control the spread indeed it is important to generate new ideas that will allow the development of new detection prototypes able to quickly identify infected humans and prevent the virus from spreading a large number of possible hostpathogen biomarkers transcripts mirnas proteins metabolites may be analyzed through different omic tools here we propose the application of a portable instrument based on the analysis of molecular responses at transcript level the proposed approach consists in the adaptation of an existing infield portable technology currently used for realtime detection of viral agents in plants for detection of sarscov2 in confined and contaminated environments for example airports buildings and boats it links translational genomics to technologies potentially enhancing the discovery of sarscov2specific biomarkers while bridging gaps in conventional human virus detection and molecular diagnostics methods an analysis at two complementary levels host transcriptional responses and viral nucleic acid presence may allow clarification of the pathogenetic mechanisms of the viral agent identifying strict and complex causeeffect relationships occurring in the hostpathogen interactions traditional approaches are based on pathogen dnarna and protein detection using respectively pcrbased or proteinbased methods in traditional laboratory instruments however this kind of method is not useful in the quest to reduce the spread of sarscov2 infections because a the virus is not uniformly distributed within human tissues and is therefore often missed when at low titers undetectable with current realtime pcr technologies b the virus has high incubation times 1430 days at asymptomatic conditions having the capability to be highly contagious at this stage c the analysis with traditional methods takes time for sample transport extraction and analysis 1624 hours at least reducing the speed of viral spread counteracting actions and d the need of skilled personnel to perform analysis the proposed strategy is focused on the analysis of human responses that are triggered during viral infection with specific emphasis on the immune responses that are upregulated rapidly after infection and are locally at the site of infection nose nostrils and also at a distance lungs and other organs biomarkers that are associated with such responses can be found both locally and at certain distance from nostrils at the earlystage event of the hostpathogen interaction a stress condition typically occurs such as a inflammatory response due to the activation of recognition mechanisms of pathogenassociated and pathogeninduced virulence factors these early asymptomatic responses are typically linked with changes in both host and the viral agent at transcriptional and the posttranscriptional levels with specific mrna mirna noncoding rna proteins and metabolites activated in response to the pathogen presence through the comparison of transcriptomic signatures under asymptomatic and symptomatic conditions genes associated with the beginning of disease symptoms can be identified the molecular processes precede symptoms appearance when human host activate more physiological responses leading to diseaseassociated phenotypic modifications and metabolic problems linked to pathogen virulence factors the human response itself may lead to detrimental effects exaggerating the direct pathogen action or inducing mutually negative actions prevention of sarscov2 disease spread may require a development of portable instruments for rapid easy and reliable detection of viral infections at a presymptomatic stage b development therapeutic methods for destruction of sarscov2 before irreversible negative effects on human health has occurred these approaches may focus on targeting of human immune system and c identification of pathways and bioactive compounds that can stimulate the innate immune responses indeed the proposed approach is to identify and analyze biomarkers modulated in either host or pathogen at early stages of infection when any eukaryotic host is subjected to stress an induced stress response occurs similarly to the host inflammatory response to pathogenassociated and pathogeninduced virulence factors
5
 if the induced stress response is enhanced tissue injury can happen causing to irreversible effects at asymptomatic stages because it is often too late to avoid tissue and organ damages once symptoms appear during the early stages of this condition the induction of immune stressrelated genes and pathways commonly associated with pathogen infection and physiological disorders occur and these genes are typically associated with general early state of stress response other differentially regulated genes at the presymptomatic stage are stress specific and may work as useful biomarkers for the early diagnosis of the host health conditions these responses include changes in the key metabolic pathways associated with key indicators of early stages of infection of known pathogens usually this stress condition usually anticipates the manifestation of symptoms associated with diseases for this reason a focus on the analysis of key genes transcripts proteins metabolites or pathways could be used to monitor the human health status these induced biological molecules may be used as biomarkers for both stress identification and recovery the identification of molecules that are early host responses associated in a reversible stress status using portable instruments is the first stage for asymptomatic diagnosis the biomarkers identification needs the analysis of large data sets through webbased applications that queries large public databases of information on transcripts proteins or metabolites modulated in specific biological conditions ie genevestigator here we propose the employment of an instrument that is already widely used for plant pathogens

 and could be easily adapted also for the detection of sarscov2 the idea is to use a portable dnabased detection devices not only targeting viral rna but also analyze a pool of early responsive host transcripts this transcriptional fingerprint would greatly enhance early asymptomatic detection of a viral such as sarscov2 having more than 14 days of asymptomatic stage this complementary approach on host and pathogen will overcome the limits of an approach aiming at only target the pathogen dna that is unreliable at asymptomatic stage especially in case of pathogen with systemic diffusion such as viruses a molecular analysis of early human responses may complement traditional methods based on the identification of the pathogen presence enhancing the detection of first infections at asymptomatic stage surely the expression analysis of a single gene of any host does not allow the specific diagnose of infections because there are no host genes strictly specific for a specific pathogen however a pool of responsive host genes might be employed as host biomarkers to quickly identify early alarm stress state better than aspecific methods currently used such the measurement of body temperature for fever detection a biomarker can be defined as a biological characteristic that can be analyzed and considered as an indicator of a particular physiological such as pathogenic processes or responses to a therapeutic intervention in omic sciences a biomarker profile includes a series of transcriptomic proteomic andor metabolomic features linked with a particular stress development of physiological condition combined these characteristics could become a biomarker of pathogenic condition assisting in diagnosis and therapy a systemsbased approach could gain insight into underlying biological regulatory network brn governing interactions between hosts and pathogens heterogeneous omic data sets could be integrated to define a biological regulatory network underlying early host and pathogen biomarkers for asymptomatic detection of the viral infections to assist the biomarkers discovery the vast amount of transcriptomic data available in public databases in response to human coronaviruses will allow a deep metaanalysis using previously customized bioinformatics pipelines ref 8 9 10 11 this work consists of reanalyzing raw data obtained by independent experiments using a normalization and standardization procedure included in a bioinformatics pipeline this work will provide differentially regulated genes from each study finding commonalities and differences in genes genet sets pathways and geneprotein networks to clarify molecular mechanisms in hostpathogen interactions
12

 the genome sequence of sarscov2 is closely related to that of sarscov like sarscov and merscov sarscov2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus
4
 
13
 having a genome size of 30 kilobases similarly with the other coronaviruses encoding for multiple structural and nonstructural proteins
14
 
15
 in addition sarscov2 seems to have similar cell entry mechanism and type of human cell receptor

16
 
17
 t cells respond well against the structural proteins that are most immunogenic compared to the nonstructural proteins
18
 among them the s and n proteins have showed to be the most dominant and longlasting by tcell responses
19
 indeed as possible targets for pathogen nucleic acid detection for bcube we may suggest the following proteins including spike s proteins envelope e proteins membrane m proteins and nucleocapsid n proteins no mutation in sarscov2 sequences as of february 6 2020 has been observed in comparison with the experimentally determined sarscovderived bcell epitopes both linear and discontinuous implying that these epitopes have the potential to elicit a crossreactiveeffective responses against sarscov2
20
 indeed as host response targets we may suggest to test ifn tnf il2 as suggested by previous data

21
 indeed s peptides showed the highest percentages of ifn producing cells proteomics may be also used to validate the discovery of transcriptional markers analyzing the same infection stages considered at transcript level a possible technique could be the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation itraq typically employed in quantitative proteomics using tandem mass spectrometry to analyze quantitative measurements of protein amount from different sources in a single experiment briefly once proteins are extracted from the same collected tissues nostril tissues they may be precipitated using proteoextracttm protein precipitation kit calbiochem dehydrated resuspended and digested with tripsin and generated peptides analyzed using a system composed by qexactive mass spectrometer an easylc and a nanospray ionization source data could be acquired using a datadependent msms method and raw data should be analyzed using xtandem visualized using scaffold proteome software and proteins identified using uniprot databases and crap database the use of proteomics should enable identification not only viral proteins but also host proteins modulated by early infection at the same way of transcriptomics a complement approach hostpathogen is required some of the identified pathogen virulence proteins may be selected for further validation through expression in model animals to validate their virulence phenotype synthetic virulence genes should be designed to insure higher in vivo expression through codons optimization ie using dnaworks software httpmcl1ncifcrfgovdnaworks signal peptides could be analyzed by signalp 40 server and nglycosylation sites could be predicted using netnglyc10 httpwwwcbsdtudkservicesnetnglyc this approach has been successful to determine more than 4500 proteins in plants including both host and pathogen

 considering the systemic presence of sarscov2 the identification of specific genes from peripheral blood and different tissues would be very helpful to discover tissuespecific host biomarkers the viral infection is typically perceived by the host before that the viral nucleic acid can be detected by traditional methods such as quantitative realtime pcr here we propose the use of the portable device such as bcube20 developed by hyris ltd the device is a miniaturized device that is able to perform both temperature cycles and isothermal analysis enabling a wide array of nucleic acid detection methods such as qpcr and isothermal amplifications figure 2 with a power consumption of maximum 60 w the instrument runs custom thermal cycling protocols and performs realtime pcr analyses the instrument sized 100  100  120 mm with a weight of 115 kg is certified to both european and north american standards thanks to a live sync to a central database it can be monitored and controlled remotely from any device or in mobile with a smartphone the analysis can be performed using customized cartridges to analyze in multiplex way up to 16 or 36 samples of 1025 l in one run on two detection channels famhex the key features of this system are the following

 the instrument has typically been used for the detection of plant viral infections directly in field the novelty is the possibility to use the detection principles and methodologies from the infield detection of plant virus in crops to quick and portable detection of a dangerous viral agent in humans such as sarscov2 the instrument analyzes mrna in 2 hours directly in the field without the need of laboratory infrastructures through the performance of a qrtpcr analysis gene expression could be conducted collecting samples from human nostrils with tools such as cotton swabs confirmation may be performed blood samples rna may be extracted from these collection instruments with a quick procedure using simplified extraction procedures the typical workflow for the use of the instrument for pathogen detection is shown in figure 4 results may be provided in approximately 2 hours at the moment the developed software and hardware are used to target the pathogen dna but a next step could be the analysis of host xfregulated genes discovered by metaanalysis works implementation and validation tests of the results obtained directly by the portable device could be conducted analyzing the same tissues with traditional laboratory equipment this work would verify the consistency of the field results delivered by the instrument the proposed instrument fits well when a quick easy reliable and inhouse early detection and confirmation is required to rapidly decontaminate environments and initiate quarantine of infected individuals the workflow for a secondary coronavirus screening using bcube is shown in figure 5
 the system is able to detect not only viruses but also specific bacteria proteins and dna molecules an increased or reduced concentration of which in a persons saliva blood and other tissues ie nostrils provide the diagnosis of the sarscov2 infections the most important aspect of this tool is the extreme ease of use and the automatic interpretation of the results the app has an intuitive interface and can guide the operator through every step of the setup and analysis initiation in the analysis is simple and the automatic result interpretation engine can assist the operator in determining the outcome the supplied power source works at both 110 v and 220 v and the power cord can be easily interchanged with the one compatible with the standard of your destination country realtime and remote control of the bcubes is allowed thanks to the connection to hyris bdata service the instrument is well suitable to work on boats and other quarantine environments for the possibility to have results in short time it also fits well in the airports after a quick scan of other symptoms ie fever in order to confirm the presence of the viral infections we certify that lorenzo colombo stefano lo priore isabella della noce and simone romano are employees of hyris ltd that produces the bcube instrument described in this article  on the role of governmental action and individual reaction on covid-19 dynamics in south africa a mathematical modelling study steady mushayabasa ethel ngarakana-gwasira t josiah mushanyu   in late december 2019 a novel strand of coronavirus sars-cov-2 was reported in wuhan a central and crowded city of china li et al 2020 subsequently the world health organization who has since officially termed this pandemic the corona virus disease 2019 covid-19 1 covid-19 is a rapidly spreading infectious disease and continues to cause several outbreaks in multiple world countries as of april 12 2020 0800 gmt2 covid-19 had resulted in 3146651 confirmed cases 218178 deaths 961833 recoveries in 213 nations areas and territories 2 the public panic in face of the ongoing covid-19 outbreak reminds us the history of the 1918 influenza pandemic which killed approximately 50100 million people worldwide 3 moreover its characteristics of mild symptoms in most cases and short serial interval ie 45 days are synonymous to that of the 1918 influenza rather than the two other coronaviruses severe acure respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 4 moreover since there is neither a vaccine nor treatment as of april 2020 to control the spread of the disease measures such as case isolation contact tracing and quarantine social distancing and hygiene measures-which were used to mitigate the 1918 influenza are currently being implemented considering the social and economic impact the disease has caused within the shortest period of time it is therefore prudent to evaluate the strength of the aforementioned intervention strategies to curb the spread of the disease various techniques and methods can be used to explore the impact of the current ongoing mitigation strategies there are various tools and techniques available which predict the dynamics of the disease transmission and also suggest suitable control interventions among them mathematical modeling analysis and simulation has been found to be a very successful guiding tool that could give a sound direction to policy makers and public health administration on how to effectively prevent and control disease and has been extensively used 5 with the aid of mathematical models one can be able to infer understand and proffer solutions to phenomena which are difficult to measure in the field since the outbreak of covid-19 a number of mathematical models have been proposed see for example 46 7 8 9 10 to mention but a few gilbert and co-workers developed a conceptual model for covid-19 with a goal to infer the preparedness and vulnerability of different nations in kucharski et al 12 a stochastic transmission model to assess the early transmission and control of covid-19 in wuhan was presented one of the key results from their study was that the decline in covid-19 cases late january 2020 was due to the introduction of travel control measures in lin et al 4 a general mathematical model for the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 outbreak in wuhan china with individual reaction and governmental action was presented although lin and co-workers did not fit their framework with data their work demonstrated the role of individual reaction and governmental action on transmission and control of covid-19 motivated by the work of lin and co-workers we proposed a mathematical model for transmission and control of covid-19 in south africa as in lin et al 4 the proposed framework incorporates individual reaction and governmental action however our framework is unique from that of lin et al 4 in that we incorporated six infectious classes latent stage symptomatic severe patients symptomatic mild patients asymptomatic patients and detected patients whereas in lin and co-workers had only three infectious compartments we argue that these additional classes clearly present the dynamics of covid-19 in south africa and the greater part of the world for example as more knowledge about covid-19 continues to emerge the role of asymptomatic patients on transmission and control of the disease has become one of the important topic zou et al 13 report that the viral load of asymptomatic patients was similar to symptomatic patients indicating a transmission potential of asymptomatic patients hence there is need to infer on the role asymptomatic patients play on covid-19 dynamics in this section we present the conceptual framework for modelling covid-19 outbreak in south africa we constructed an ordinary differential equations model that considers the human population subdivided into compartments based upon infection status furthermore the proposed frame work incorporates the effects of individual reaction as well as the government action precisely the model has been formulated based on the following assumptionsivital dynamics birth rate and natural mortality rate are not essential since we are interested on investigating the dynamics of the disease over a very short time frame the total human population at time t nt comprise of susceptible population st-these are individuals who are yet to contract the disease but can do upon exposure to the infection exposedlatently infected individuals et-these are individuals who have contracted the infection but are not yet infectious in other words they are incubating the disease undetected asymptomatic patients at-these are individuals who would have completed their incubation period and can now transmit the infection in general these individuals cannot be recognized if they are not confirmed by rt-pcr or other laboratory testing 14 the model also includes undetected clinically infected individuals and this population has been further subdivided into two different classes-mild patients imt and severe patients ist in a recent study by wu and mcgoogan 15 it was noted that approximately 81 of the detected covid-19 patients were of mild symptom and the remainder about 20 were severe in addition we have also included detected and quarantined patients both asymptomatic and symptomatic qt as well as the deceased and successfully recovered individuals and these are respectively denoted by dt and rt the population of removed individuals represents individuals who have successfully recovered from infection naturally or through treatment thus the total population is ntstetatimtistqtrtdt
iias in he et al 3 and lin et al 4 we assume that the publics perception regarding the number of confirmed cases and deceased influences the dynamics of the disease hence we have have captured this aspect by including an additional compartment to our framework and this compartment is denoted by pt iii susceptible individuals are assumed to acquire infection following effective contact with undetected asymptomatic patients at undetected symptomatic patients with mild symptoms imt undetected symptomatic patients with severe symptoms ist and detected patients qt since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease covid-19 in december 2019 one of the issues that has received major attention is the transmissibility of the coronavirus from asymptomatic patients to healthy individuals 1316 in recent study of yin and jin 16 no difference in the transmission rates of coronavirus between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients was observed our study is also unique from a number of recently published works in that we have assumed that detected patients can transmit the disease this assertion is based on several reports which have highlighted that healthcare workers hcws are being infected by covid-19 17 18 19 on 24 february 2020 during a press conference of the who-china joint mission on covid-19 national health commission of the peoples republic of china nhcprc reported that since the outbreak began in december 2019 till that day about 2055 healthcare workers communityhospital-acquired not to be defined had been confirmed infected with covid-19 with 22 11 deaths 17 as of april 24 2020 the spanish health ministry reported that 35 295 hcws were infected and this represented 20 of all registered cases of covid-19 in spain by that time 19 in addition a cross-sectional study conducted in 2 teaching hospitals in the netherlands between 12 march 12 2020 and 16 march 2020 revealed that 6 of hcws at these two institutions were infected with sars-cov2 18 thus the force of infection t which represents the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected is expressed as
1ttistatimtqqtntwhere the parameter q is a positive constant and accounts for differential infectivity of the detected and quarantine individuals in relation to the undetected patients since these individuals are quarantined and interact with a small susceptible population that mainly constitute of hcws we assume that 0q1 as suggested in the studies of 1316 we will assume no difference in transmission rate among all the undetected patients the parameter t models disease transmission rate and is mathematically expressed as2t011ptnt
 equation 2 incorporates the effects of both individuals reaction and governmental actions 0 is the baseline transmission rate  01 is the efficacy of governmental actions lockdown encouraging use of sanitizers face masks social distancing to reduce contacts among individuals a value of  close to one implies high efficacy and the reverse is true for values of  close to zero the term 1pn captures the effects of public perception of the risk to contract the disease based on severe cases reported here  is a parameter controlling the strength of the responseivsusceptible individuals who contract the disease progress to the exposedlatent stage where they will incubate the disease for an average period of 1 days during this period these individuals will not be capable of transmitting the disease a couple of recent studies on wuhan covid-19 dynamics suggest that the average median incubation period could be as short as 4 days 420vupon the completion of the incubation period we assume that a fraction f of the exposed individuals move to the asymptomatic stage and the remainder 1f become symptomatic prior studies suggests that of the individuals who become symptomatic more often there exists two classes mild patients and severe patients 415 in particular in a study on wuhan covid-19 dynamics by wu and mcgoogan 15 it was observed that approximately 81 of the cases were mild symptoms without pneumonia or only mild pneumonia 14 were severe cases with difficulty breathing and 5 were critical with respiratory failure septic shock andor multiple organ dysfunction or failure based on this assertion we assume that a proportion 1fp of exposed individuals progress to infectious stage with mild symptoms and the complementary proportion 1f1p will become severevia fraction 1p1 of infectious individuals with mild symptoms are assumed to successfully recover from infection after an average period of 1 days and the remainder p1 join the class q for severely and critically infected individuals it is assumed that a fraction p2 enter the class q after an average duration of 1 days and the remainder 1p2 succumb to disease-related death thus 1 and 1 represents the mean infectious period of mild and severe patients respectively some prior studies suggests a mean infectious period of 4 days 4viithrough rt-pcr or other laboratory testing asymptotic patients are assumed to be detected and quarantined at rate  furthermore we assume that after an average period of 1 days asymptomatic patients will begin to display clinical signs of the disease with a proportion  showing mild symptoms and the remainder 1 severe detected individuals are assumed to exit this class either through successful recovery at rate 1p3 or death at rate p3 1 represents the average period one stays in the quarantine stage and p3 denotes a proportion of the quarantined patients who will suffer disease-related deathviiithe publics perception of risk to covid-19 increases when the number of confirmed covid-19 cases increases as well as the increase in deaths for quarantined individuals it is assumed to decay naturally implying that the perception of risk diminishes over time in the absence of covid-19 severe and critical cases and deaths in the proposed model 1 models the mean duration of impact of covid-19 severe and critical cases and deaths on public perception
 based on the aforementioned assumptions we have the following system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations3sttstettstetatfetatimt1fpetatimtist1f1pet1atistqtp1imtp2istatqtrt1p1imt1p3qtdt1p2istp3qtptp1imtp2istatp3qtpt
 
fig 1
illustrates the transition of individuals from one epidemiological state to another the basic reproduction number often denoted by r0 is an important threshold parameter for epidemiological models it is defined as the expected number of number of secondary cases generated in a completely susceptible population by one infectious individual during hisher entire infectious period for models with forward bifurcation if this metric is less than unity it implies that the infection will die out in the community however if it is greater than unity then the disease persists although there are several ways of deriving this parameter the next-generation matrix technique 2122 is the most popular one can easily verify that in the absence of the disease model system 3 admits a trivial equilibrium point commonly known as the disease-free equilibrium and is given by sn
eaisimqrdp0 utilizing the notation in ref 21 the nonnegative matrix f that denotes the generation of new infection terms and the non-singular matrix vt that denotes the remaining transfer terms are respectively given at the disease-free equilibrium byf00101010q100000000000000000000
v0000f000fpfpf1p001000p1p2
 it follows that the spectral radius of model 3 which is the reproduction number of the model is given by4reffrarsrmrqwhere ra rs rm and rq represents the contribution of undetected asymptomatic patients undetected symptomatic patients with severe symptoms undetected symptomatic patients mild symptoms and quarantined patients respectively on the generation of secondary infections and they are defined as followsra01frs01f1p1rm01fprq0q1fp1pp1p1p21p1
 from the expression of the reproduction number reff we can note the followingiincreasing the strength of governmental action to high levels close to 100 will lead to a huge reduction in the magnitude of the reproduction number and the weak actions values of  close to zero will not be effective to reduce the magnitude of the basic reproduction numberiiin the absence of governmental actions p1p2q0 the number of secondary cases that will be generated by each infected individual will be higher compared to when actions are even weak the expression for the reproduction number in the absence of intervention strategies is given by
r00f2p1m
iiiwe can also observe that if quarantined individuals do not contribute to the generation of new infections that is qrq0 then the reproduction number will be less
 we present an application of our model to a case study of south africa we use the covid-19 data for south africa released and updated by the south african government authorities available on wwwworldometercom 23 the dataset has also been included in the appendix the data presented in the appendix starts from the 5th of march 2020 when south africa reported its first case of covid-19 case imported from italy one of the global hotspots of the pandemic however when fitting our model we considered the data ranging from 26 of march 2020 to 3 may 2020 when the lockdown started in south africa this was necessitated by the need to exclude the effects of imported cases furthermore we assume that by this date our framework will be able to capture the effects of local transmission since it was now the time of the lockdown overall the data in the appendix suggests that with increasing testing and screening of possible covid-19 infected individuals the reported detected cases continue to rise with time indicating the prevalence of covid-19 infection in south africa might be higher than the current reported cases moreover the data presented in the appendix reflects the number of confirmed covid-19 cases during the ongoing lockdowns and will be used to estimate our unknown model parameters not currently available in literature much information remains unknown regarding covid-19 infection and more work is being done by experts from across the multi-disciplinary facets of research to provide answers to some unknown information on covid-19 however much effort to unpack these underlying issues of this pandemic is being witnessed to date thus in this work we resort to curve fitting which is a process that allows us to quantitatively estimate the trend of the outcomes of this pandemic equations of approximating curves are fit to the raw field data however the fitting curves for any given set of data are not unique thus we choose a curve with the minimum possible deviation from all the data points involved we make use of the least squares curve fit routine lsqcurvefit in matlab with optimization to estimate our unknown model parameters estimated model parameters and their 95 confidence intervals are presented in table 1
 other parameters values which were drawn from literature are presented in table 2

fig 2
shows the trends in the cumulative covid-19 detected cases in south africa we observe from fig 2 that system 3 fits well with the data from table 3 see appendix estimated parameter values are shown in table 1 to explore the impact of individual reaction and governmental action on combating covid-19 disease in south africa we will simulate model 1 using parameter values in table 1 table 2 majority of these parameter values were adopted from the recently published literature on covid-19 and the remaining unknown parameters were estimated from data fitting estimated parameters are within plausible range of values so as to capture the current covid-19 transmission dynamics in south africa the total population of south africa in this study was assumed to be 58 million we perform numerical simulations considering the period when the lockdown was instituted in south africa on the 26th of march 2020 at that particular time we assume that there were certain individuals who remained undetected and suit to be classified in one of the following compartments asymptomatic mildly infected or severely infected also as reported by the south african government there were certain individuals who had successfully recovered from the disease we aim to intrinsically investigate the impact of asymptomatic infections on the general dynamics of covid-19 we determine to what extent the current 35 day lockdown in south africa has been by comparison with the scenario when there was no lockdown instituted 
fig 3
illustrates how the active cases were going to progress in the absence of lockdown as shown in the graph the number of cases were going to increase rapidly more or less in an exponential growth scenario in particular the number of cases could be around 100000 beginning of june however in fig 4
we can observe that in the presence of intervention strategies the number of infections may not exceed 18000 cases for the entire 450 day period 
fig 5
illustrates the expected number of active cases for different successive lockdown extensions after the initial 35 day lockdown we consider extensions of 14 day stages 21 day stages and 35 day stages we observe that a 14 day extension will result to approximately 15000 cases a 21 day extension will result to approximately 13000 and a 35 day extension will result to approximately 11000 cases by the 4th of june 2020 
fig 6
illustrates the dynamics of the disease in the absence and presence of intervention strategies over a 450 day period as we can observe the number of active cases in the absence of intervention strategies will reach a peak around mid-june whereas in the presence of intervention strategies the peak will be attained around the 23rd of august the results suggests that the presence of intervention strategies may be responsible for the delay in attaining the peak this may give policy makers ample time to prepare for effective disease management 
fig 7
indicates that as the detection rate modelled by  increases then the number of active cases decreases it is important to note that a value of  between 05 and 10 may not result in a significant change in the number of active cases thus we recommend that the detection level of 05 and above may lead to a remarkable decline in the number of active cases numerical illustration in fig 8
depicts the effects of different levels of exposed individuals who progress to asymptomatic and infectious stage as we can observe an increase in the number of these individuals have a significant impact on short-and long-term dynamics of the disease in particular for any value of f greater than 20 then the number of active cases may be greater than 10000 in 100 days however for any value of f less than 20 the number of active cases may not exceed 10000 for the entire 300 day period the present study aimed to investigate the situation of covid-19 in south africa in the presence and absence of mitigation measures a mathematical model that subdivides the total human population based on ones epidemiological status has been developed the epidemiological classes considered are susceptible exposedlatent asymptomatic infectious with mild symptoms infectious with severe and critical symptoms detected and quarantined recovered and deceased the proposed conceptual model has an additional compartment that captures the effects of public perception of risk of infection although we have noted that the presence of intervention strategies may reduce the number of infections per unit time there are optimal thresholds of intervention strategies that can lead to a significant reduction of cases for instance an initial 35 day lockdown followed by successive 14 day lockdowns with relaxation may not be as effective as an initial 35 day lockdown followed by successive 35 day lockdowns with relaxation furthermore we observed that a detection rate of at least 05 per day may lead to a significant reduction of the number of active cases in addition we also noted that in the absence of intervention strategies the peak number of cases could be attained around mid-june whereas in the presence of intervention strategies the peak will be attained around the 23rd of august hence we can deduce that the presence of intervention strategies may be responsible for the delay in attaining the peak thereby prompting policy makers ample time to prepare for various and effective ways of managing the disease the proposed framework could be of significant importance on understanding the transmission and control of covid-19 however we acknowledge that there are several aspects of the disease that are yet to be clearly unraveled for instance the duration one remains as an asypmtomatic infectious patient is still debatable in the event that additional information have been found it can be used to improve the framework the authors received no specific funding for this work all data have been included in the manuscript no personal information is used in this study thus not applicable the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper  common cold in team finland during 2018 winter olympic games pyeongchang epidemiology diagnosis including molecular point-of-care testing poct and treatment maarit valtonen matti waris tytti vuorinen erkki eerola antti hakanen j katja mjosund wilma grnroos olli heinonen j olli ruuskanen   elite athletes are predisposed to the common cold due to heavy physical and mental stress which may suppress both innate and adaptive immunity15 air travel human crowding housing with other athletes and competition all increase the susceptibility of an elite athlete to the common cold6 the winter olympic games take place during periods of low temperatures and its timing coincides with epidemics of many respiratory viruses the common cold has been said to be the most dreaded opponent at the winter olympic games and may ruin the athletes long-term goal of success7
 the common cold is a prevalent complex and heterogeneous illness8 more than 10 species of respiratory viruses exist and they contain hundreds of subspecies with different immunopathologies9 10 signs and symptoms of different viral infections overlap and it is not possible to identify the aetiological agent on clinical grounds alone11 12 antiviral treatment is only available for influenza but virus-specific preventive measures may reduce the transmission of illnesses13 14
 the aim of our prospective observational study was to investigate the occurrence and aetiology of the common cold in team finland during the 2018 winter olympic games we used recently developed molecular multiplexed poct for influenza a and b viruses and respiratory syncytial virus at the games site15 16 after the games we used laboratory-based pcr testing to detect 16 possible causative respiratory viruses this prospective observational study was carried out during the winter olympic games in pyeongchang south korea between 26 january and 28 february 2018 during the games the temperature and humidity measured by team finland varied between 17c and 8c and between 12 and 77 respectively monitoring of the common cold was provided to team finland members who stayed in the olympic village 45 athletes and 46 supportive staff members and the two hotels outside the village 22 staff members figure 1 the mean age of the athletes n45 was 27 sd 6 years and the mean age of the staff members n68 was 44 sd 9 thirteen athletes and 10 staff members were female the team members participated in the monitoring for the entire duration of their olympic trip starting from their departure from helsinki airport and finishing with their return to helsinki airport thus including two intercontinental flights with duration of 8 hours 50 min and 9 hours 50 min on their departure all team members were reported to be asymptomatic and healthy except one subject with nasal congestion the team members stayed in pyeongchang for a median length of 21 days with a range of 1032 days they lived in groups of 56 in 3-bedroom to 4-bedroom flats in a single block of 16 flats all team members were instructed to immediately report symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection to the chief physician mv who stayed in the same building at the onset of a symptom two nasal mucus specimens one from each nostril were collected at a depth of 34 cm using flocked nasal swabs 503cs01 copan flock technologies brescia italy one specimen was used immediately for poct and the other was refrigerated in a dry storage tube 553c copan flock technologies brescia italy in the teams medical room swabs were also taken from subjects exposed to a patient with the common cold specimens for poct were collected as part of the medical care of the team members all study-related activities were conducted according to good clinical practice which includes the provisions of the declaration of helsinki the common cold was defined as the acute onset of any of the following symptoms sore throat rhinorrhoea nasal congestion and cough8 in addition fever an axillary temperature 378c hoarseness and lethargy were recorded on a standardised form in the evening on a four-point severity scale 0absent 1mild 2moderate and 3severe17 the total symptom score for the first 5 days of illness was calculated a fast automated poct the cepheid xpert influenzarsv xpress assay was used according to the manufacturers instructions16 a nasal swab was suspended into 3 ml of universal transport medium utm copan italia brescia italy and 300 l of suspension was added into the assay cartridge which was then loaded into the cepheid genexpert ii instrument after a processing time of 30 min the test reading was recorded for laboratory testing stored specimens were suspended into 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline nucleic acids were extracted from 500 l aliquots of the suspended specimens with the magna pure 96 system using a magna pure 96 dna viral na lv 20 kit roche diagnostics mannheim germany with the pathogen universal 500 31 protocol and an elution volume of 50 l the extracted nucleic acids were stored at 70c between analyses allplex respiratory panels 14 seegene seoul south korea and the cfx96 bio-rad laboratories hercules california usa instrument were used in accordance with the manufacturers instructions to detect respiratory syncytial virus a and b adenovirus influenza a and b viruses rhinovirus parainfluenza type 14 viruses human coronavirus 229e oc43 and nl63 human bocavirus and human metapneumovirus using 8 l of each specimen per panel the allplex respiratory panel also detected the following bacteria streptococcus pneumoniae non-typeable haemophilus influenzae moraxella catarrhalis bordetella pertussis chlamydophila pneumoniae and mycoplasma pneumoniae a laboratory-designed triplex rt-pcr assay for influenza a ah1pdm09 and b viruses was performed as described earlier with the exception that nxtscript dna master roche diagnostics mannheim germany and mic pcr instrument bio molecular systems upper coomera qld queensland australia were used for the pcr step18 in addition respiratory syncytial virus rhinoviruses and enteroviruses were detected using a triplex rt-pcr assay as described earlier with the exception that sensifast probe no-rox kit bioline luckenwalde germany and mic pcr instrument were used for the pcr step19
 a virus cluster was defined as three detections of the same virus during the median length of 3 weeks this was considered an unusual aggregation event the difference between proportions was tested with a binomial standard normal deviation snd test and 95 cis were calculated accordingly forty-two out of 112 team members reported symptoms of respiratory infection during the study period of 1032

results were confirmed in the laboratory four athletes competed with mild symptoms of the common cold one athlete competed 5 days after the onset of an influenza b infection another competed 5 days after the onset of a respiratory syncytial virus a infection and two athletes competed five days after the onset of a metapneumovirus infection one subject reported nasal congestion when departing finland respiratory syncytial virus a was detected at the olympic village six days later the neighbouring team member in the aeroplane developed symptomatic respiratory syncytial virus a -infection the next respiratory syncytial virus a cases were identified consequently 10 16 and 17 days after the initial respiratory syncytial virus a detection one subject developed a febrile influenza b infection during the 9-hour outbound flight another subject on the same flight seated one row behind developed an influenza b infection 15 days later three more subjects were infected with the influenza b virus these cases were separate and were not known to be in contact with the earlier cases one subject developed nasal congestion during the 9-hour flight later detected to be a respiratory syncytial virus b infection the subject was seated in business class and was isolated for 4 days in the olympic village no other team member was infected with respiratory syncytial virus b one subject reported a sore throat and mild lethargy 6 days after the departure metapneumovirus was detected metapneumovirus was detected in team members consequently 8 13 15 and 18 days after the initial metapneumovirus detection rhinovirus was detected in two samples from asymptomatic individuals 3 days and 4 days after their departure from finland one subject later arrived in the village with a symptomatic rhinovirus infection one more subject developed nasal congestion in the village and one asymptomatic subject staying outside the village was predisposed to influenza b infection in

incidences of respiratory infections in elite athletes during the vancouver 2010 and the sochi 2014 olympic winter games respectively20 21 our observation 45 contrasts those observations the iocs reporting system may not be reliable because it is based on voluntary reporting by team physicians who may not be properly informed within the team at the onset of the games in our study the team physician informed all team members about the monitoring of the common cold she stayed in the same building as the team which allowed for daily encounters with the majority of team members even one symptom or mild symptoms were reported22 in agreement with our observations 48 of 44 norwegian cross-country skiers self-reported becoming ill during or 10 days immediately after the tour de ski23
 our study is the first to detect the aetiology of respiratory infections in elite athletes using molecular poct at a major event all available poct virus diagnoses positive and negative were later confirmed at a laboratory diagnostics had clinical implications in the treatment and prevention of influenza a and b infections in addition to early treatment with oseltamivir poct enabled effective post-contact oseltamivir prophylaxis for close contacts for example those living in the same accommodation or travelling on the same flight or in the same vehicle14 the isolation of infected team members was initiated after the onset of symptoms and continued for 34 days ie the most infectious period2427
 we detected the probable causative virus in 75 of the elite athletes with the common cold causality is supported by a 46 occurrence of respiratory viruses in asymptomatic adults28 29 only two earlier studies carried out in australia in warm climate conditions have investigated the viral aetiology of acute respiratory symptoms in summer sport elite athletes in one study the recovery rate was 29 and in the other it was 2730 31 these low detection rates led to the commonly cited conclusion that in the majority of cases the symptoms could be due to non-infectious airway inflammation our observations in winter sport athletes do not support that conclusion the virus recovery rate of 75 in elite athletes is as high as in other aetiological studies in adults9 10 a higher viral recovery rate in adults may not be obtained because pcr tests may detect only 5090 of serologically diagnosed respiratory virus infections13 32 the occurrence of respiratory infections tended to be more common in elite athletes than in other team members the difference may be explained by higher physical and psychological stress in elite athletes it is of interest that the severity of illness among the athletes did not differ from that among the staff table 1 before and during the winter games influenza and respiratory syncytial virus epidemics were occurring in finland and influenza and coronavirus epidemics were under way in south korea the prevailing virus epidemics obviously contributed to the transmission of the infections in three subjects the symptoms of the common coldone caused by influenza b virus and the others by respiratory syncytial virus a and bdeveloped during the 9-hour flight from helsinki to seoul two patients seemed to transmit the illness to another team member during the flight long-haul air travel is a well-known risk factor for the transmission of contagious diseases one person with influenza can transmit the infection to 510 people during an intercontinental flight33 two cases of coronavirus oc43 infection were most probably travelling during the incubation period of the infection 35 days and developed the illness within 23 days after arrival in the olympic village27 34 in addition the first cases of rhinovirus and metapneumovirus infections were detected during the first week suggesting that these infections also originated in finland34 in addition to direct or indirect contact and droplets respiratory viruses can spread via exhaled aerosols even while talking35 36 viruses may stay infectious on a surface for hours or days the most commonly detected coronavirus 229e stays infectious on common surfaces for at least 7 days37 interestingly it was recently shown that viruses can also spread through toilet flushing38 ultimately 7 clusters of different respiratory virus infections were recorded important factors in the transmission of the viruses were the housing with other athletes and the sport discipline table 1 competition venues may be a favourable environment for virus transmission rigorous hand washing the use of hand sanitisers enhanced disinfection and strict patient isolation were likely to prevent the spread of viruses within the team but were apparently not very effective figure 2 this is due to the multifactorial transmission mechanisms of viral infections39
 the number of subjects was small nasal swabs were planned to be taken from symptomatic subjects as part of normal healthcare the prevalence and clinical significance of asymptomatic infections eg most coronavirus and influenza infections are asymptomatic and prolonged virus shedding ie infectiousness remains unclear the poct diagnostics detected only three respiratory viruses16 the 2018 influenza and respiratory syncytial virus epidemics were prominent which may have increased our detection rate and affected the generalisability of the findings our study did not answer the question concerning the impact of a symptomatic or asymptomatic respiratory virus infection on an elite athletes performance molecular poct diagnostics proved clinically valuable the aetiology of the common cold was identified in the majority of cases the viruses were readily transmitted within the team we believe comprehensive viral poct is useful at major sporting events  high-resolution computed

was positive for covid-19 rt-pcr the initial hrct and blood routine test were both normal however 6 days after admission repeat hrct showed subpleural ggo in bilateral upper lobes fig 2 repeat covid-19 nucleic acid was still positive after 3 days of treatment with ribavirin and interferon covid-19 rt-pcr was finally negative and the follow-up ct scan showed complete resolution a 7-month-old girl was admitted to the hospital with dry cough for 2 days and fever for 1 day her mother was diagnosed with covid-19 6 days ago her body temperature was slightly elevated 378c the initial rt-pcr was negative but hrct showed ggo in the upper lobe of the right lung repeat rt-pcr was positive on the third day of hospitalization she was treated with interferon afterward the ggo was healed 5 days after admission but rt-pcr was still positive thirteen days after admission throat swab rt-pcr turned negative a 9-year-old male asymptomatic boy was admitted to the hospital because his father was confirmed with covid-19 infection his covid-19 rt-pcr was positive and hrct showed ggo in the right lower lobe fig 3 after 7 days of treatment with ribavirin and interferon both covid-19 rt-pcr and hrct turned negative a 13-year-old male asymptomatic boy was admitted to the hospital because his grandma was confirmed with covid-19 infection he was positive for initial covid-19 rt-pcr but negative for hrct three days later his covid-19 rt-pcr turned negative the clinical and hrct features of all the 5 previously mentioned cases are summarized in table 1 the 2019 novel coronavirus mainly affects mid-age and elderly people4 so little is known about the clinical and hrct characteristics of pediatric patients to the best of our knowledge the present study is the first report of the hrct and clinical features of pediatric patients with covid-19 in the english literature two patients case 1 and 3 in our study were symptomatic both of them had fever and dry cough and one of them had diarrhea in addition thus fever and dry cough are 2 core symptoms of pediatric patients which is in line with the adults4 however up to 60 of the patients case 2 4 and 5 in the present study were asymptomatic so the asymptomatic children with wuhan contact lived or traveled to wuhan or had close contact with any confirmed patients are recommended to do a covid-19 rt-pcr screening besides we noted that up to 667 asymptomatic patients case 2 and 4 had pulmonary ggo so asymptomatic pediatric patients may be positive for hrct and thus hrct is recommended in the screening of suspected pediatric patients we note that there are many differences between the radiological findings of adult and pediatric patients with covid-19 it is reported that up to 44 adult patients had all 5 lobes affected1 whereas only 1 patient case 2 in the present study affected bilaterally and 3 patients just affected 1 lobe the hrct manifestations of adult patients with covid-19 were reported to be very diverse13 most appeared as pure ggo ggo with consolidation interlobular septal thickening bronchiolar wall thickening and crazy paving pattern whereas rare manifestations included halo sign pleural effusion pericardial effusion and lymphadenopathy in our series of pediatric patients only ggo and consolidative ggo were found pan et al5 studied the time course of lung changes of adult covid-19 patients and concluded that lung lesions would gradually be absorbed in 2 weeks on the contrary most lesions in our study were fully resolved in a week furthermore song et al3 divided the adult patients with covid-19 to younger 50 years and elder group 50 years and found that elder group tended to have more areas of lung involvement and more consolidation taking their evidence together we speculate that the pediatric patients generally have milder ct findings than adults in conclusion we demonstrated 5 cases of pediatric patients with covid-19 and we had the following three findings 1 fever and dry cough are 2 core symptoms of pediatric patients besides asymptomatic children with wuhan contact are recommended to do a covid-19 rt-pcr screening 2 hrct is of great significance in the screening of suspected pediatric patients and 3 the pediatric patients generally have milder ct findings than adults the large sample studies are needed in the future  modeling return of the epidemic impact of population structure asymptomatic infection case importation and personal contacts corresponding author address xinhua yu  background proactive interventions have halted the pandemic of coronavirus infected disease in some regions however without reaching herd immunity the return of epidemic is possible we investigate the impact of population structure case importation asymptomatic cases and the number of contacts on a possible second wave of epidemic through mathematical modelling methods we built a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed seir model with parameters mirroring those of the covid-19 pandemic and reported simulated characteristics of epidemics for incidence hospitalizations and deaths under different scenarios a larger percent of old people leads to higher number of hospitalizations while a large percent of prior infection will effectively curb the epidemic the number of imported cases and the speed of importation have small impact on the epidemic progression however a higher percent of asymptomatic cases slows the epidemic down and reduces the number of hospitalizations and deaths at the epidemic peak finally reducing the number of contacts among young people alone has moderate effects on themselves but little effects on the old population however reducing the number of contacts among old people alone can mitigate the epidemic

the 2003 sars epidemic in which mainly symptomatic cases are infectious 4  asymptomatic infection of the sars-cov2 can transmit disease 5 6 7 8 9  studies have detected virus shedding in nasopharyngeal swap samples among asymptomatic cases 10  a few case reports have shown some cluster of cases initiated by asymptomatic cases 5 7 9  researchers have postulated that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases may play a significant role in sustaining the community transmission 6  second government leaders have been pressed to allow people to return to normal work and life to avoid economic recession after social activities are restored both international and domestic travel ban will be lifted imported symptomatic and asymptomatic cases may kindle a second wave of epidemic in the community 6  for example despite singapore has implemented possibly the most rigorous contact tracing personal protection and social distancing measures an unexpected surge of new cases has been observed with daily newly confirmed cases doubled from 142 in april 7 to 287 in april 8 and still 334 in april 14 httpswwwgovsgarticlecovid-19-cases-in-singapore as of this writing the source of this sudden increase is still under investigation from the health services perspective the number of severe cases who require medical care is the most important indicator of the burden of epidemic heath

model parameters satisfactorily table 2  also refer to supplemental table 1  starting with ten imported infectious persons and assuming 40 asymptomatic cases at the peak of epidemic the epidemic

well as summarized in table 3  the size of region and small percent change of self-quarantined susceptible do not change the epidemic progression except for the total number of cases a smaller percent of elderly slows down the epidemic while a much higher percent of elderly does not change the epidemic curve significantly as expected when over 60 people have prior infection the epidemic takes very long to reach the peak and results in substantial fewer cases the effects are similar in both young and old people supplemental table 2a  2b  both the percent and infectivity of asymptomatic cases

less infectivity of asymptomatic cases and results in significantly fewer hospitalizations and deaths on the other hand a higher infectivity of asymptomatic cases eg 100 of symptomatic cases results in a fast developing and narrow epidemic curve which reaches the peak within 60 days there are more hospitalizations and deaths at the epidemic peak compared with the default model both assumed 40 asymptomatic cases in addition a change of the percent of asymptomatic cases among old people leads to larger changes in hospitalizations and deaths than that of young people supplemental table 2a  2b  for example comparing 60 with 40 asymptomatic cases the total hospitalizations are reduced only by half among old people while it is a two third decrease among young people furthermore when the effects of the percent and infectivity of asymptomatic cases are combined for example in a low risk epidemic with 60 asymptomatic cases but with a lower 30 infectivity the epidemic reaches its peak slower for both young and old people with peak hospitalizations almost half of the default model 40 asymptomatic cases and 50 infectivity supplemental figure 3  this epidemic model is initiated by imported infectious persons may asymptomatic or presymptomatic cases a daily arrival of two infectious people speeds up the epidemic by 8 days compared with one case every two days in the default

epidemic peak are also postponed in both curves when both young and old people reduce contacts to 3 per day such as under the stay-at-home rule the epidemic curves on hospitalizations are significantly mitigated in both groups figure 2d  finally we consider two extreme scenarios 1 high risk scenario assuming one imported case per day continuously throughout the epidemic 30 asymptomatic cases at the epidemic peak and the same infectivity between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases 2 low risk scenario assuming one imported case every two days for twenty days 60 asymptomatic cases and asymptomatic cases have only 30 infectivity of symptomatic cases in both scenarios limiting contacts among old people alone still has significant impact on hospitalizations in both age all rights

3 and supplemental figure 7  we created a modified seir model and parameterized it with estimates from the current covid-19 epidemic our scenario analyses suggest that unless the population have reached herd immunity eg over 60 people are immune to the disease assuming a reproduction number of 26 28 29  a small number of imported cases within a short duration may rekindle the epidemic among the large susceptible pool despite young imported cases and only 3 contacts between young and old people infection can quickly transmit into old people interestingly our model demonstrates that reducing the number of contacts among old people alone can not only slowdown the epidemic but also reduce the magnitude of the epidemic among both young and old people this spillover effect implies that interventions targeting high risk groups such as elderly population can have a larger impact on the whole society without significantly disturbing the working life among young people our findings are consistent with that of prior simulation studies and real life experience in several asian countries 1 15 16 20 22 24  many countries have implemented more proactive interventions such as school closing and stay at home rules which have mitigated the epidemic in many regions one of the most effective strategies to curb an epidemic is to reduce personal interactions through social distancing

impact of epidemic among themselves but also changes the course of epidemic among young people despite they still remain very active old people often have weaker immune system and multiple underlying chronic conditions if infected with the virus they are more likely to be symptomatic and more infectious because their bodies are not able to eliminate virus effectively therefore during an epidemic such as covid-19 old people are more likely to be hospitalized and die from the complications of infection thus protecting old people not only decreases their risk of being infected but also reduces the burden of epidemic in the whole society with growing availability of detection kits during the covid-19 epidemic more asymptomatic or mild symptomatic cases are identified ultimately an optimal view is asymptomatic cases may account for 60 of infections however recent research and case reports have confirmed that asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic cases can shed enough quantify of virus to be infectious 5 6 7 8 10  furthermore if the infectivity of asymptomatic cases is similar to that of symptomatic cases a faster epidemic will occur despite more asymptomatic cases at the peak of epidemic there are also significantly more hospitalizations and deaths while may overwhelm the health care system with a lower infectivity 30 infectivity the epidemic reaches its peak later and results in half of hospitalizations at the peak compared with the default model supplemental figure 3  in addition a closely related issue is case importation 23  imported cases are often pre-symptomatic asymptomatic or with mild symptoms they seed of a second outbreak even with just a few cases therefore proactively identifying asymptomatic cases and isolating them thereafter will prevent the occurrence of an

emphasized population heterogeneity such as age structure in the model we included a self-quarantined group who will not infect other people if they are infected with the virus naturally these settings can be extended to represent other high risk or special groups with revised parameters in addition we separated hospitalization from other removed compartments to explicitly estimate the impact of an epidemic on hospitalizations furthermore we explored a few key determinants of epidemic explicitly leading to many insights on epidemic prevention strategies there are a few limitations in our study as inherent in all modeling studies simulation interpretations are heavily dependent on model assumptions and parameter estimations our epidemic model is a population model although we take account of population heterogeneity such as age in the current model our age group is overly broad a more detained age grouping scheme including children young adults middle age group and elderly may reflect the agespecific epidemic more realistically in addition we assume random mixing within and between the groups as a population model we cannot assess the impact of individual behaviors such as the way of reducing contacts social distancing and travelling furthermore it ignores clustering within the population such as senior group living community gatherings eg churches community centers worksites and schools these clusters are hotbeds for superspreading events which may lead to a sudden increase of new cases and overwhelm the healthcare system unexpectedly furthermore the quarantine compartment in the model is not contact tracing based modeling contact tracing based quarantine is more relevant to public health interventions 39  therefore the goal of our future research is to exploring the effect of these factors with stochastic simulations of individual behavior 22 40 and network analysis 41  additionally our all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission was not

finally out study only examines a small subset of scenarios during the epidemic multi-interventions are more effective in mitigating an epidemic but less sustainable in the long run after the initial epidemic ends society will return to normal and only one or two interventions such as social distancing may be practiced often partially thus one parameter analysis under various scenarios is important for evaluating the probability of a second epidemic in summary with a modified seir model we have demonstrated that simple intervention strategies such as reducing the number of contacts

joseph isler r lisa saiman   respiratory viruses in infants hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit nicu are associated with a variety of clinical presentations ranging from localized upper respiratory tract infection to disseminated disease to death 1 2 while asymptomatic carriage of respiratory viruses is well characterized in older children and adults 3 4 this entity is not as well described in infants in the nicu furthermore few recent studies have assessed the epidemiology of healthcare-associated respiratory viruses in the nicu population during the era of commercially available multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assays nor assessed the potential strategies to reduce acquisition and transmission the objectives of this study were to describe the epidemiology of respiratory viruses in the nicu as assessed by rt-pcr assays the clinical impact of respiratory viruses including the proportion of asymptomatic vs symptomatic infants and the infection prevention and control ipc strategies implemented to reduce transmission of respiratory viruses additionally we explored whether clinically asymptomatic infants had an increased frequency of subclinical oxygen desaturation events before and after a positive rt-pcr for a respiratory virus by using the advanced physiological monitoring system bedmasterex excel medical jupiter fl which records and stores all oxygen saturation data from infants pulse oximeters 5 this was a retrospective observational cohort study of infants hospitalized in our nicu from may 2012 to may 2017 the nicu is a regional perinatal center level iv facility that cares for both premature infants and full-term infants with complex congenital cardiac and non-cardiac anomalies the unit is located on two floors and consists of 58 beds including shared pods with 23 beds each a nine-bed step down open unit and four single rooms there were 5240 admissions during the 5-year study period included infants were those with healthcare-associated respiratory viruses detected after the incubation period for the relevant virus as compared to their date of nicu admission to avoid misclassification of hospital-associated infections attributed to our nicu we excluded infants who were transferred to our nicu and had respiratory viruses detected within the incubation period of the relevant virus as compared to their date of nicu transfer this study was approved by the institutional review board of columbia university irving medical center cuimc with a waiver of informed consent nasal turbinate samples were collected regardless of the mode of respiratory support diagnostic testing was performed using a multiplex rt-pcr assay filmarray biofire inc that was introduced in our facility in may 2012 without restrictions placed on its use the assay has been validated on samples from infants in the nicu 6 and the respiratory viral panel rvp detects 17 viruses adenovirus four coronavirus types 229e hku1 nl63 and oc43 human metapneumovirus rhinovirusenterovirus rvev influenza a ah1 ah3 and b parainfluenza types 14 and respiratory syncytial virus rsv as well as pertussis mycoplasma and chlamydophila 7 only qualitative results are provided viral load results are unavailable infants were classified as symptomatic or asymptomatic based on the review of the infants electronic medical records symptomatic infants were those with signs of a respiratory infection eg rhinorrhea fever cough andor those who had escalation of respiratory and or nutritional support as defined below asymptomatic infants did not have clinical signs of respiratory infection nor escalation of respiratory or nutritional support escalation of respiratory or nutritional support was assessed by comparing the maximum support during the 7 days prior vs the maximum support during the 7 days after detection of a respiratory virus escalation of respiratory support was defined as 1 an increase in supplemental oxygen by at least 10 for at least 12 h while maintaining the same mode of respiratory support 2 an increased amount of non-invasive support eg room air to nasal cannula nc or nc to continuous positive airways pressure cpap or newly initiated non-invasive positive pressure support 3 transition from non-invasive to invasive support eg cpap to synchronized intermittent mechanical ventilation simv andor 4 increased invasive support eg increase in mean airway pressure simv to high-rate intermittent mechanical ventilation to high-frequency oscillatory ventilation andor to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo escalation of nutritional support was defined as transitioning from 1 full oral feeds to 50 enteral tube feeds or 2 50 enteral feeds to only total parenteral nutrition tpn to further describe the study population we collected secondary diagnoses that occurred throughout the infants nicu stay including bronchopulmonary dysplasia bpd necrotizing enterocolitis nec severe retinopathy of prematurity rop severe intraventricular hemorrhage ivh and hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus pda bpd was defined as requiring supplemental oxygen 28 days and bpd severity was categorized based on the amount of respiratory support required at 36 weeks corrected gestational age or discharge whichever occurred first 8 nec was defined as modified bells staging criteria iia or higher 9 10 severe rop was defined as stage 3 or higher based on pediatric ophthalmology exam 11 severe ivh was defined as grade 3 or higher on any imaging done before day of life 28 12 hemodynamically significant pda was defined as lesions requiring medical andor surgical management transmission was identified if infants who were both geographically and temporally linked had the same virus detected geographic links were considered as the same pod andor infants in the neighboring rooms temporal links were considered those that occurred within the incubation period of the relevant virus transmission patterns were categorized as dyads n  2 infants clusters n  3 infants or outbreaks n  3 infants transmission events were defined as the number of infants who became infected as a result of transmission eg one transmission event in each dyad and two transmission events in each cluster throughout the study period rt-pcr testing was performed for symptomatic infants eg fever cough and increased secretions infants with a respiratory virus detected were placed on contact and droplet isolation personnel from the department of ipc interviewed the staff to determine if the affected infant had been exposed to ill family members or ill healthcare personnel hcp the duration of isolation was considered on a case-by-case basis but generally isolation continued for the duration of the relevant viral shedding period or the duration of illness whichever was greater two negative rt-pcr tests were required to discontinue isolation potentially exposed infants eg those sharing the pod with an affected infant were monitored for signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and tested if symptoms developed starting in january 2015 in response to an adenovirus outbreak rt-pcr testing was performed for all potentially exposed asymptomatic infants infants were considered exposed if they were geographically near a symptomatic virus-positive index case eg the same pod unexposed infants were not screened testing was performed at the time of potential exposure and at the end of the relevant incubation period for the virus of the index case potentially exposed infants were placed on contact and droplet isolation for the duration of the incubation period isolation for exposed infants was discontinued if rt-pcr testing was negative the infant remained asymptomatic and no additional geographically related cases were identified exposed asymptomatic infants with positive rt-pcr testing were managed as described above for symptomatic infants with positive rt-pcr testing hcp were instructed not to work while sick ill hcp were tested by workforce health  safety and obtained clearance to return to work 13 since the 20132014 influenza season hcp in new york state have been required to have an influenza vaccination or wear a surgical mask when in areas where patients are typically present 13 from may 2012 to november 2015 written educational material explained that ill visitors were prohibited from entering the nicu starting in december 2015 visitors younger than 12 years of age were prohibited from visiting the nicu year-round large signage was posted at the nicu entry detailing visitor restrictions for age or signs and symptoms of illness eg fever and cough formal screening of visitors was not performed at any time during the study data were collected from the electronic medical record and included demographic and clinical characteristics of infants including the indications for rvp testing respiratory and nutritional support provided in the 7 days before and after detection of a respiratory diagnosis as well as primary and secondary diagnoses all secondary diagnoses were collected throughout the nicu stay additionally we recorded whether the infants were fed with breast milk in the week before rvp testing and the percentage of maternal breast milk comprising the feeds if applicable to assess whether this might protect the infants from developing symptoms associated with respiratory viruses delayed surgery and delayed discharge associated with detection of a respiratory virus and 30-day crude mortality were also collected data for transmission events were derived from records maintained by the department of ipc that also maintained a list of exposed and tested infants as well as the indications for rvp testing data from the bedmasterex system were retrieved from the central network and used to corroborate infants as symptomatic vs asymptomatic bedmasterex system continuously records the high-resolution waveform data sampled at 240 hz from the bedside ge monitors 5 for this study we extracted oxygen saturation spo2 data as measured by pulse oximeter collected every minute a custom matlab algorithm was used for removing the artifact based on how a clinician would interpret the data at the bedside 14 waveforms that were inconsistent and irregular based on comparison of hourly trends of minute heart rate and spo2 were considered unlikely to translate into accurate and meaningful values for spo2 and were removed the remaining spo2 data retained for analysis 95 of raw data were summarized as the percentage of time every 24 h that an infants spo2 was 85 demographic and clinical characteristics of symptomatic and asymptomatic infants were summarized with frequencies means and medians and were compared using chi-square or fishers exact test as appropriate for categorical variables and two sample t tests and mannwhitney u tests for continuous variables the association of detection of respiratory viruses with changes in respiratory and nutritional support was categorized as unchanged increased or decreased support breastmilk exposure in the week before a positive rvp was dichotomized as 50 enteral feeds being maternal breast milk vs 50 and no maternal breastmilk exposure ie only formula fed or no enteral feeds vs any breastmilk exposure bedmasterex data for 7 days before and after positive rvp were available for 40 infants 30 symptomatic and ten asymptomatic infants the percentage of time these infants had spo2  85 considered a hypoxemic state for each of the 7 days before and after viral detection were calculated and compared using a mixed model for repeated-measures analysis of variance to account for the missing observations as well as two sample and paired t tests as appropriate infants with physiologic right to left cardiac shunts were excluded from this analysis due to different expectations for their normal spo2 range the incidence of respiratory virus transmission event rates per 1000 patient-days was also calculated and compared for the time periods before and after the selected interventions were implemented using poisson regression all statistical analyses were performed in sas 94 cary nc from may 2012 to may 2017 1494 rvps were sent from the nicu from 727 infants in all 83 infants experienced 86 episodes of healthcare-associated respiratory viruses this represented 16 of the overall nicu admissions one infant had two viruses detected from the same sample and three infants each had two unique episodes with different viruses detected thirteen infants had 15 17 asymptomatic episodes and 70 infants had 71 83 symptomatic episodes of viral detection one infant had both asymptomatic and symptomatic episodes thirteen additional infants transferred from other hospitals had a respiratory virus detected within the incubation period of the relevant virus eight rvev two coronavirus one rsv one influenza and one parainfluenza and were excluded from further analysis the demographic and clinical characteristics of symptomatic and asymptomatic infants with healthcare-associated respiratory viruses were similar table 1 there was no difference in the proportion of asymptomatic vs symptomatic infants who received any maternal breastmilk feeds in the week before a positive rvp 31 of asymptomatic infants and 34 of symptomatic p  100 additionally the proportion of asymptomatic vs symptomatic infants whose feeds comprised of 50 maternal breast milk in the week before a positive rvp was similar 29 vs 24 p  074 infants with healthcare-associated respiratory viruses had a median chronological age of 82 iqr 58158 days at viral detection table 2 the distribution of the types of viruses detected was similar in symptomatic and asymptomatic infants table 2 the most common viruses were rvev n  60 71 followed by adenovirus n  7 8 parainfluenza n  6 7 and coronavirus n  6 7 the relative proportion of rvev detection remained similar over time quarterly mean 65 range 5084 p  014 ten 67 of 15 asymptomatic episodes were associated with rvev two with adenovirus 14 and one each with coronavirus hk rsv and influenza the most common indications for viral diagnostic testing among symptomatic infants were suspected upper respiratory tract infections 67 increased respiratory support 29 andor cough 26 most symptomatic episodes were not managed with increased respiratory support 62 andor nutritional support 79 however 17 24 symptomatic episodes were associated with only escalations of respiratory support five 7 with only escalations of nutritional support and ten 14 with both the escalations in respiratory support included 1 three episodes associated with 10 increase in fio2 support while maintaining the same mode of respiratory support 2 11 with increased non-invasive support most common escalation from room air to cpap 3 seven with progression from non-invasive to invasive support all of which included mechanical ventilation and one with progression to ecmo and 4 six with increased invasive support the escalation in nutritional support included 1 three episodes associated with changing from full oral feeds to 50 enteral tube feeds and 2 12 changing from 50 enteral feeds to full tpn support the percentage of time the asymptomatic and symptomatic infants had spo2  85 during the 7 days before and after their positive rvp is shown in fig 1 during the 7 days before and after the detection of a respiratory virus the asymptomatic infants spent significantly less time with spo2  85 compared with the symptomatic infants mean daily range 1327 vs 4076 respectively p  003 fig 1 the daily percentage of time the asymptomatic infants spent with spo2  85 did not significantly change throughout the 7 days before and after the viral detection p  091 the daily percentage of time the symptomatic infants spent with spo2  85 did not significantly change throughout the 7 days before and after the viral detection p  023 four 5 symptomatic infants had delayed surgery three 4 had delayed discharge and one 1 was readmitted one day after nicu discharge with respiratory symptoms due to parainfluenza previously detected in his hospitalized twin six infants 7 died within 30 days of detection of a respiratory virus at the time of death mortality was considered attributable to a respiratory viral infection in two infants 2 one with parainfluenza and one with human metapneumovirus as ascertained by the nicu team andor supported by the autopsy findings ten episodes of viral detection were associated with ill family members and no ill hcp were identified six dyad transmission events four clusters and two outbreaks were identified fig 2a nine 75 of these 12 transmission events involved rvev adenovirus n  5 infants and rvev n  7 infants each caused an outbreak following the introduction of the ipc strategy in january 2015 to screen the exposed infants 82 infants were potentially exposed to 21 case infants and seven 9 of the 82 exposed infants were positive for a respiratory virus in all from january 2015 to may 2017 seven 15 of 48 episodes of viral detection were identified by screening the exposed infants since december 2015 only one transmission event a dyad of rvev in september 2016 occurred the remaining cases were sporadic transmission event incidence per 1000 patient-days is shown in fig 2b and decreased significantly from 027 per 1000 patient-days before children 12 years of age were prohibited from visiting the nicu to 003 per 1000 patient-days during the 16 months after children 12 years of age were prohibited from visiting the nicu p  0003 no transmission events were identified from the 13 transferred infants admitted to the nicu with respiratory viruses this was a single center observational study which limits its generalizability it was conducted in a nicu consisting of an open pod design with only four single rooms furthermore our nicu admits full-term infants with congenital anomalies as well as older infants for rop and bpd management these admission patterns help to elucidate the relatively older chronologic age of our study population the overall sample size was small and we could not demonstrate factors associated with being symptomatic vs asymptomatic including the distribution of different viruses the frequency of asymptomatic infants was likely underestimated because the practice for testing exposed infants was not conducted throughout the 5-year study period and we did not test unexposed asymptomatic infants it is also possible that unknown confounders or unexamined variables such as viral load or patterns of care by specific hcp may be responsible for the observed clinical courses of infants in this study we may have misclassified rvev transmission as the biofire rvp does not distinguish specific virus types nor were the viruses sequenced we also acknowledge that our strategy to discontinue transmission precautions if an infant has two negative tests does not consider intermittent viral shedding finally we did not measure the impact of culture change in the nicu following the adenovirus outbreak staff had increased awareness of the clinical impact of respiratory viruses resulting in increased responsibility and accountability among staff to not work while ill themselves and to ask peers with respiratory symptoms to be evaluated by whs in conclusion reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated respiratory viruses in the nicu population is an important patient safety goal infants in the nicu with respiratory viruses can exhibit a wide range of symptoms including being asymptomatic as demonstrated by both clinical and physiological data remarkably we found that most symptomatic infants did not receive escalation of respiratory or nutritional support while the evidence supporting effective infection prevention and control measures is still evolving we found that screening asymptomatic infants after exposure and prohibiting visitors less than 12 years of age from visiting the nicu were associated with a reduction in incidence and transmission events of respiratory viruses however multicenter investigations are needed to assess the generalizability of our findings to identify factors associated with asymptomatic infants and to determine the most cost-effective ipc strategies to reduce respiratory viruses in the nicu  forecasting covid-19 pandemic a data-driven analysis khondoker nabi nazmoon   the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has evolved as a global public health emergency affecting 212 countries and territories around the world as of may 12 2020 30 covid-19 is one kind of respiratory disease by the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 that was first spotted around late december 2019 in wuhan hubei province china 3 7 this novel virus started transmitting around the world rapidly and on 30 january who declared the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern pheic later who director-general announced covid-19 as a global pandemic as of may 11 2020 an outbreak of covid-19 has resulted in 4271689 confirmed cumulative cases with reported deaths of 287613 worldwide 30 in most of the countries infected patients are struggling to get the proper treatment due to highly transmissible and virulent nature of the virus nevertheless numerous covid-19 mitigation strategies has been adapted so far such as quarantine isolation promoting the wearing of face masks travel restrictions and lockdowns with a view to reducing community transmission of the disease in the absence of either established effective treatment or a vaccine the already fragile health care systems of different developed and developing countries can be overburdened due to the overwhelming surge of infections in in the coming months provided that the spread is not controlled this pandemic is giving an upsurge to multifarious noteworthy socio-economic and public health impacts and has highlighted the significance of detecting the evolution of the disease and prediction of disease future dynamics for designing infectious disease prevention and control strategies effective public health policies and economical activity guidelines different mathematical paradigms have always played a notable role in providing deeper understanding of the transmission mechanisms of a disease outbreak contributing considerable insights for controlling the disease outbreak one of the familiar models for human-to-human transmission which is reasonably predictive is susceptible-infectious-removed sir epidemic model proposed by kermack-mckendrick in 1927 10 14 after that the sir epidemic model has been extended to susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed seir model and many of its variants to explore the risk factors of a disease or predict the dynamics of a disease outbreak 9 11 13 10 12 14 it is really challenging in population based model to incorporate certain real-world complexities in fact analysis and prediction could go wrong in the absence of adequate historical real data on the other hand various agent-based often stochastic models where individuals interact on a network structure and get infected stochastically have been treated as useful tools for tracing fine-grained effects of heterogeneous intervention policies in diverse disease outbreaks 4 15 16 17 however accuracy of this approach can be a vital issue due to the time-varying nature of network-structure since the outbreak of the virus incorporating travel between major cities in china 3 proposed an seir-model incorporating a metapopulation structure for both reported and unreported infections it has been discovered in their studies that around 86 of all cases went undetected in wuhan before travel restrictions imposed on january 23 2020 according to their estimation on an individual basis around 55 asymptomatic spreaders were contagious who were responsible for 79 of new infected cases other studies 19 4 solidified the significance of incorporating asymptomatic carriers with a view to understanding covid-19 future dynamics appropriately later 10 estimated that around 63 cases went under-reported in italy by analyzing a modified sir-model 13 apply the sird model to chinese official statistics estimating parameters using linear regression and predict the covid-19 pandemic in hubei province by using these models and parameters nonetheless long-term forecasting is debatable while using a simple mathematical model 20 and 21 independently apply modified sird models in which parameters change overtime following specific function forms parameters govern these functions are estimated by minimizing the sum-of-square-error however using the sum-of-square method causes over-fitting and always favors a complex model therefore it is not suitable to access policy effectiveness moreover fitting the sird model in the early stage of infection is questionable as well in the light of above shortcomings of several established mathematical models a more refined deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations considering all possible interactions a susceptible-exposed-symptomatic infectious-asymptomatic infectious-quarantined-hospitalized-recovered-dead seidiuqhrd model has been proposed which can give more accurate and robust short-term as well as long-term predictions of covid-19 future dynamics this model could be considered as a generalization of seir which is based on the introduction of asymptomatic infectious state quarantined state in order to understand the effect of preventive actions and hospitalized isolated state based on similar studies performed over seir dynamical systems some assumptions are taken into account 9 13 10 as of may 11 it is evident that how the early stage mathematical model parameters have changed drastically as detection rate was really low until middle of february however the outbreak situation has improved comprehensively in several countries due to massive scale testing 31 we have considered the nominal values of the model parameters understanding the characteristics of the coronavirus infection quantitatively estimated in the literature or published by health organizations 3 9 19 2 in sequence a rigorous process of model calibration which is known as trust-region-reflective algorithm is applied to determine the best-fitted parameter values of the model our analysis was based on the publicly available data of the new confirmed daily cases reported for the future probable covid-19 hotspots which are russia brazil india and bangladesh from late january until may 09 2020 18 further we have validated our model for the united kingdom using same time frame based on the released data we attempted to estimate the mean values of the crucial epidemiological parameters for covid-19 such as the infectiousness factor for asymptotic carriers isolation period the estimation of the inflection point with probable date recovery period for both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals case-fatality ratio and mortality rate in those potential hotspots perfect data-driven and curve-fitting methods for the prediction of any disease outbreak have always been question of interest in epidemiological research trust-region-reflect algorithm is one of the robust least-square data-fitting techniques that can promote a fine relation between the model driving mechanisms and model responses this real-time data fitting approach could be efficient providing considerable insights on disease outbreak dynamics in different countries and designing worthwhile public health policies in curtailing the disease burden calibrating our model parameters by using the above algorithm we have provided probable forecasts for the newly evolving covid-19 hotspots this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the mathematical model is described and the background of choosing baseline parameter values for the model is discussed in section 3 and 4 the model has been analysed and model calibration technique has been discussed respectively in section 5 model prediction accuracy has been illustrated by representing a graphical comparison between model responses and real-time data in section 6 one of the robust global sensitivity analysis techniques is used to quantify the most influential mechanisms in our model this paper ends with some qualitative and quantitative observations and discussions in the study of 5 the average incubation period of covid-19 was calculate to be 51 days and similar model-based studies also justified the above finding 3 6 4 moreover within 115 days ie 1115day1 of infection the individuals who were exposed to the virus started developing symptoms 5 19 and 200 days was the mean duration of viral shedding observed in covid-19 survivors 7 the time duration from symptoms onset to recovery was estimated to be 247 days whereas from onset of symptoms to deaththe average mean duration was estimated to be 178 days 19 in previous modeling studies3 1 2 the novel coronavirus effective transmission rate  ranges from around 02515day1 which gradually follows a downward trend with time 6 in sequence we have considered this parameter as a time-varying parameter in our fits table 1
illustrates the list of baseline model parameters with brief description probable ranges presented on clinical studies and calibration and default base value selected for our study the recent epidemic data of five different countries which are russia brazil india bangladesh and the united kingdom is accumulated from authoritative and genuine sources which are center of disease control and prevention cdc and the covid tracking project testing and hospitalizations the data repository is handled by the johns hopkins university center for systems science and engineering jhu csse and supported by esri living atlas team and the johns hopkins university applied physics lab jhu apl the repository is publicly available and easy to compile 18 the disease-free equilibrium dfe of 1 can be obtained easily by setting seidiuqhrd0 therefore the dfe of 1 is e0s0e0id0iu0q0h0r0d000000
 using the next generation operator method 24 the local stability of the dfe is investigated according to the notation in 25 the associated non-negative matrix f represents new infection terms and the non-singular matrix v denotes remaining transfer termswhich can be described as followsf0000000andvk001kd02k0uuthe associated basic reproduction number denoted by r0 is then given by

system of differential equations together with a suitable set of initial conditions in this study trust-region-reflective trr algorithm has been used to determine the best-fitted parameters for our proposed model we have used lsqcurvefit function in matlab to calibrate our model the optimization process can be expressed as followsargminseidiuqhrdtimeidrd2where  is the set of parameters of dynamically calibrated model id r d is a set of the detected symptomatic infectious individuals recovered and disease induced death cases from the real-time data and r1r2k12qduhuh is the initial set of parameters of the proposed model and seidiuqhrd represents our proposed model the trr algorithm also necessitates an initial guess for each parameter which is described as trr input in the following section with much of europe now easing itself out of confinement russia could become the continents new covid-19 hotspot according to our analysis the model fitting and projection results for russia from early february to late august are shown in figure 2 and 3 we collected real data from february 01 to may 08 2020 to calibrate the model parameters as we can see the results from the proposed model match the real data very well based on the proposed model we want to project that from figure 3 the number of daily detected symptomatic infectious cases in russia will reach the peak at may 27 with about 15774k cases as time progresses our estimated daily projected mean error drops to 10 for the cumulative cases and daily new cases which represents the robustness of the model forecasting the basic reproduction number is 4234 as of may 08 which lies in prior established findings 27 for covid-19 26 the number of cumulative infected cases is projected to reach 970k around august 30 and the estimated total death cases will reach to about 35k in the end to date russias official death toll of 1827 is relatively low because not all deaths of people who have contracted the virus are being counted as covid-19 deaths table 2 illustrates the key features used to calibrate this scenario which are compatible with the previous clinical studies and relevant literature the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic headed toward latin america later than other continents on feb 25 2020 the first infected case was documented but now brazil has surpassed the records in latin america in terms of deaths and new infected cases 155939 cases and 10627 deaths as of may 9 this is probably an underestimated scenario in comparison to real severity in brazil our analysis projects that brazil is developing as one of the worlds next coronavirus hotspots the model fitting and projection results for brazil from late february to late august are shown in figure 4 and 5 we took real data from february 25 to may 08 to calibrate the model parameters as we can see the results from the proposed model fit the real data very well based on the proposed model we project that from figure 5 the number of daily detected symptomatic infectious cases in brazil seem reaching the peak around june 11 with about 26449k cases the basic reproduction number is estimated about 53467 as of may 11 which is in between the observed basic reproduction number for covid-19 estimated about 2-7 for covid-19 26 this crucial epidemiological parameter could blow up because of scant diagnostics and impermanent non-pharmaceutical interventions the case-fatality rate is hovering around 93 as of may 11 which is necessary to assess how much community transmission has occurred and its burden according to our projection this ratio could be doubled within two months the number of cumulative infected cases is projected to reach 1800k around august 30 if current trend is held and the estimated total death cases will reach to about 108k in the end table 3 illustrates the key features used to calibrate this scenario which are compatible with the previous clinical studies and relevant literature some people might think about the possibilities of the presence of a less virulent strain of the virus in india along with the possibility that its hot weather could diminish the contagion nevertheless our mathematical analysis suggests that india could become the new covid-19 hotspot in south asia according to our projection india could continue seeing spikes in the number of cases as it time progresses despite of following lockdown and other disease mitigation measures the first case of the covid-19 pandemic in india was reported on 30 january 2020 originating from china but now india has the most cases and deaths in south asia 62808 cases and 2101 deaths as of may 9 and these are probably substantial underestimates figure 6 and 7 illustrate covid-19 disease modeling and prediction for india from late january to late august we took real-time data from january 30 to may 8 to calibrate the model parameters as we can see our proposed model match well for the historical real data based on our prediction from figure 7 the number of daily detected symptomatic infectious cases in india seem reaching the peak around june 15 with about 9504k cases the basic reproduction number is 5218 as of may 11 which lies between the studied observations 26 this estimation may be considered as an overestimation of this critical parameter notwithstanding this is owing to the infectiousness factor of the asymptomatic spreaders minimally or reasonably symptomatic infectious and the asymptomatic spreaders should be quarantined to avoid the transmission of the virus with the critically symptomatic patients isolated in proper health care settings by carrying out massive scale contract tracing risky individuals could be identified by means of their exposure the number of cumulative infected cases is projected to reach 730k around august 30 if current pattern is held and the estimated total death cases will reach to about 438k in the end table 4 illustrates the key features used to calibrate this scenario which are compatible with the previous clinical studies and relevant literature interestingly we have found in our analysis that indias case-fatality rate is at 35 and the countrys recovery rate is at 33 which commensurate with real reported statistics precisely our analysis indicates that the united kingdom could face risk of a second wave of coronavirus infections as the united kingsom gradually eases a nationwide lockdown according to 30 by 11 may there had been 223060 confirmed cases and 32065 deaths overall a rate of 465 deaths per million population the outbreak in london has the highest number and highest rate of infections while england and wales are the uk countries with the highest recorded death rate per capita recently the prime minister of the uk has expressed his plan to unveil a coronavirus warning system as an intervention strategy while he was planning to ease the lockdown gradually in the uk for the uk the modeling and projection results from january 31 to august 31 are shown in figure 8 and 9 as we can see from figure 9 the number of daily detected symptomatic infectious cases reached the peak around april 10 since then the curve has been maintaining a plateau which is a really unusual scenario this phenomenon has closely been captured by our proposed model this case study was really important for the validation of our model in fact this guarantees the fact that this model is capable of providing more precise and vigorous short-term predictions of covid-19 dynamics according to our calculation the basic reproduction number is around 4649 as of may 09 which lies in the prior studies of covid-19 13 26 the number cumulative infected cases is projected to reach 618k around august 30 and the estimated total death cases will reach to about 6348k in the above mentioned period importantly as of may 11 we have found in our analysis that the uks case-fatality rate is at 172 which is the worst among our five studied cases this could exacerbate as time progresses in the absence of proven effective therapy or a vaccine in addition our study suggests that relaxing social distancing too soon could result in thousands of additional death in the uk table 5 illustrates the key features used to calibrate this scenario which are compatible with the previous clinical studies and relevant literature for bangladesh the calibration and projection results from early march to late august of are shown in figure 10 and figure 11 on 22 march with an aim to curtail the spread of the novel coronavirus in the wake of four deaths and at least 39 infections bangladesh government deployed a nationwide lockdown effective from 26 march 2020 notice that there are some jumps in the number of confirmed daily new infected cases data from 16 april to 20 april due to the increase of limited testing system from 2000 samples to 2700 samples per day 32 bangladesh is still struggling around 6700 samples per day 32 to design a massive scale testing program as of may 11 2020 despite the fact as we can see from figure 10 our proposed model fits well for the historical real-time data as time progresses the estimated error declines and is hovering around 10 for the cumulative cases and daily new cases according to our calculated daily projected mean error the estimated case-fatality rate in bangladesh is at 27 which is kind of satisfactory however without massive scale testing this rate could rise sharply incoming days moreover the countrys estimated recovery rate is at 24 which again complements the real statistics precisely importantly without an aggressive level mass-testing program it is impossible to portray the real outbreak scenario in bangladesh table 6 illustrates the key features used to calibrate this scenario which are compatible with the previous clinical studies and relevant literature on 4 may bangladesh authorities intended to open up more factories shopping malls and logistics operations as they could diminish the economic impact of a coronavirus lockdown which they extended to may 16 33 this ease of lockdown could worsen the ongoing community transmission drastically as we can see form figure 11 the daily detected symptomatic infected cases confirmed will reach the peak about 2209 around june 11 2020 and then start to de-escalate however the probable peak time could occur in no time due to easing the coronavirus lockdown too quickly and this could bring a second wave of infections in the outbreak after post-peak period the effective reproduction number is around 35 as of may 11 which again lies in prior established ranges 13 26 our estimation is reasonably high which due to the fact that we have considered the infectiousness factor of the asymptomatic carriers massive level testing is highly required and recommended to identify the asymptomatic spreaders quickly unlike other mitigation strategies like reporting contacts putting on face masks and maintaining physical distancing a massive test-and-isolate approach could control the disease burden of covid-19 otherwise this basic reproduction number could increase upto 57 within 20 days and inhabitants of bangladesh could see a disease catastrophe in near future in near future owing to various changing factors such as mitigation measures and mass people awareness such estimation and projection could differ significantly prcc analysis which is a global sensitivity analysis method that calculates the partial rank correlation coefficient for the model inputs sampled by latin hypercube sampling method and outputs 27 28 29 the prcc method assumes a monotonic relationship between the model input parameters and the model outputs the calculated prcc values are between -1 and 1 and they are comparable among different model inputs quantitative relationship between the model input and model response can be determined by calculating the prcc values a positive prcc value depicts that the model output can be increased by increasing the respective model input parameter or vice versa in addition a negative prcc value indicates a negative correlation between the model input and output the magnitude of the prcc sensitivity measures the significance of the model input in contributing to the model output as our proposed epidemic model contains a moderate number of empirical parameters uncertainty analysis can give considerable insights regarding the quantitative relationship between model responses and model input parameters however it is really challenging for complex models to determine the relationship with sufficient accuracy importantly we have got startling yet realistic results from our sensitivity analysis as we can see from figure

 we found nearly the same qualitative and significant quantitative relationship between the number of symptomatic infectious individuals one of the crucial model responses and three parameters which are rate of getting quarantined of susceptible individuals q transition rate from exposed to infectious or quarantined  which can also be referred as the inverse of the average incubation period of covid-19 and recovery rate of undetected asymptomatic undetected infectious carriers for our proposed model in case of russia from figure 12a recovery rate of undetected asymptomatic carriers u is the most negatively influential parameter when the number of detected infectious individuals is our selected model response the prcc index is found to be 0585 in addition rate of entering into home-quarantine or self-quarantine of susceptible individuals q and the fraction of wrongly quarantined people who become susceptible after certain latent period r
1 are the other two influential empirical features with prcc indexes are 05672 and 0567 respectively in case of brazil rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined of susceptible individuals q the fraction of quarantined people who become susceptible due to avoiding home-quarantine r
1 and the inverse of the covid-19 mean latent period are the most influential parameter on the symptomatic infectious population size idt the corresponding prcc indices are 062 053 and 0499 the figure 12b qualitatively elucidates that a high quarantine rate of the susceptible individuals can curtail the number of symptomatic infected individuals in broader view high efficacy of home or self-quarantine and a lower unlockdown rate could flatten the idt curve in brazil in case of the india rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined of susceptible individuals q and the inverse of the covid-19 incubation period are the most influential parameter on the symptomatic infectious population size idt and the corresponding prcc indexes are 064 and 062 both the parameters are negatively sensitive to the size of detected infected individuals which is illustrated in the figure 12c this elucidates that a higher quarantine rate of the susceptible individuals can reduce the number of symptomatic infected individuals therefore it is obvious that early unlockdown in india could worsen the outbreak situation in the blink of an eye in case of the uk rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined of susceptible individuals q and the inverse of the covid-19 incubation period are the most influential parameter on the symptomatic infectious population size idt and the corresponding prcc indices are 058 and 0499 both the parameters are negatively sensitive to the size of detected infected individuals which is illustrated in the figure 12d this elucidates that a higher quarantine rate of the susceptible individuals can curtail the number of symptomatic infected individuals nevertheless early easing lockdown measures could bring a second wave of infection in the uk in no time for bangladesh it has been found in our analysis home-quarantine rate is the most negatively sensitive parameter on the size of symptomatic infectious individuals and the corresponding prcc index is 068 which is the highest among our five studied cases the result in figure 12e elucidates that if the people in bangladesh start breaking social distancing restrictions extensively then it would be difficult to control the disease outbreak there as of may 11 when bangladesh is seeing continuous spikes in covid-19 infections every day the government has announced an easing of movement for all on a limited scale with a view to reviving the countrys economy moreover the length of the inverse of the latent period is the another negatively sensitive parameter with prcc index lying at 043 we have proposed a methodology for the calibration of the key epidemiological parameters as well as forecasting of the outbreak dynamics of covid-19 pandemic in russia brazil india bangladesh and the uk while considering publicly available data from late january 2020 to early may 2020 with an introduction of an real-time differential seidiuqhrd epidemic model which can give more accurate realistic and precise short-term predictions baseline parameter ranges are chosen from the recent clinical studies and relevant literature concerning the covid-19 infection trust-region-reflective algorithm which is one of the robust least-squares fitting techniques has been deployed to calibrate the proposed model parameters numerical results on the recent covid-19 data from russia brazil india bangladesh and the uk have been analyzed with an aim to determine probable peak dates and sizes for the above mentioned countries based on the projection as of may 11 2020 russia will reach the peak in terms of daily infected cases and death cases around end of may brazil and india will reach the peak in terms of daily symptomatic infectious cases and death cases around beginning of june in addition the united kingdom might face a second wave of infection provided that lockdown is lifted quickly global sensitivity analysis results depict that home-quarantine or self-quarantine is the most effective measure for controlling the transmission and spread of the novel coronavirus infection to fade out the pandemic it is compulsory to identify potential carriers and asymptomatic infectious spreaders through and massive scale testing scheme and without sufficient level of evidence of controlled low transmission rate of covid-19 in any certain territory we cannot afford lifting up physical distancing measures the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper  epidemiology of viral respiratory tract infections in an outpatient haematology facility magorzata mikulska valerio del bono nemo gandolfo simone dini alida dominietto carmen di grazia stefania bregante riccardo varaldo andrea orsi filippo ansaldi andrea bacigalupo claudio viscoli   viral respiratory tract infections vrti are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hematologic malignancies particularly in allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation hsct recipients 13 in immunocompromised patients vrti are usually more severe with an increased risk of progression from upper to lower respiratory tract infections and more frequent presence of bacterial or fungal co-pathogens than in immunocompetent patients 47 moreover long-term sequelae of vrti such as restrictive or obstructive airway disease have been reported 8 9 during the last decade rapid and highly sensitive molecular tests have been developed and made available with the most recent multiplex polymerase chain reaction pcr platform that can detect multiple viral pathogens 1012 based on data from observational studies it is believed that most vrti in patients with haematological malignancies present with fever andor upper respiratory tract symptoms while less is known about the asymptomatic circulation of respiratory viruses even though prolonged viral shedding has been observed 4 1220 for influenza infection the management strategy based on the presence of influenza-like illness syndrome ili has been successfully used in epidemiological and treatment studies in immunocompetent patients for hsct recipients who are at an increased risk of developing severe influenza complications post-exposure and general chemoprophylaxis during an influenza season have been recommended 2123 nevertheless the efficacy and impact of these strategies particularly when compared to early diagnosis and treatment remain unknown the aims of this study were to prospectively evaluate the incidence morbidity and severity of vrti in outpatients of an hsct unit during the influenza season of 2011 additionally the clinical usefulness of the presence of an ili for diagnosing and treating vrti and the possible occurrence of nosocomial transmission or microepidemics were evaluated a 3-month prospective study during the seasonal influenza outbreak ie from 1 january 2011 to 31 march 2011 included all adult outpatients seen at least once a month in the hsct unit most of the subjects were allogeneic hsct recipients while the other patients either received an autologous hsct or chemotherapy for haematological diseases the following data were recorded demographics type of the underlying disease and the date and type of hsct including conditioning regimen informed consent was obtained in accordance with the declaration of helsinki both the asymptomatic and symptomatic for vrti patients underwent clinical evaluation at every visit to the outpatient unit and were invited to contact their physician if any new symptoms developed additionally influenza vaccination status of the patient and household contacts was noted pharyngeal swabs which are specimens considered suitable and easily collected by recent who recommendations were collected for viral testing at the first visit and then only in case of new vrti symptoms 24 additional swabs were obtained in patients with vrti in order to document the resolution of the infection of prolonged viral shedding but were not included in the analysis bronchoalveolar lavage bal fluid and other clinical respiratory specimens were collected when clinically indicated the distribution of influenza cases ie the beginning the peak and the end of epidemic in this cohort was compared to data available for italy reported weekly by the italian network for influenza surveillance of superior health institute ili syndrome was defined as the presence of fever plus at least one of the following symptoms cough sore throat rhinorrhoea andor systemic symptoms as headache asthenia malaise and arthromyalgia in the absence of other documented causes vrti was considered as detection of a respiratory virus from the upper or lower respiratory tract 25 similar to the european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc definition in haematology patients a confirmed case of viral respiratory tract infectious disease was defined as new onset of symptoms and at least one of the following cough coryza sore throat and shortness of breath and the clinicians judgment that the illness is due to an infection 25 a repeated detection of the same virus in a patient was considered as the same infection episode and only the first positive swab was considered co-infection was defined as simultaneous detection of more than one virus while separate infection episodes were diagnosed if a new virus was detected at the onset of new respiratory symptoms asymptomatic infection was defined as detectable virus in the patients upper respiratory tract sample without symptoms of respiratory illness upper vrti was defined as a respiratory viral isolation from a pharyngeal swab and included both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections upper vrti symptoms included sore throat cough rhinorrhoea or nasal congestion lower vrti was defined as a clinically and radiologically confirmed pneumonia with detection of virus from the lower respiratory tract bal fluid a direct contact for a period of at least 1 h with a patient with an upper or lower vrti was regarded as an exposition to vrti case molecular assay was performed by the regional reference laboratory operating from monday to friday all specimens were transported in universal transport medium copan italia spa brescia italy collected and subjected to rna extraction according to the manufacturers instructions viral rna was extracted by spin columns qiaamp viral rna mini kit qiagen valencia ca usa converted to random hexamer-primed cdna by the revertaid system fermentas york uk and then stored at 20 c until use each cdna preparation was subjected to the seeplex rv12 ace detection pcr kit procedure seegene seoul south korea the multiplex pcr assay allowed the simultaneous detection of 12 respiratory viruses influenza ab human adenovirus respiratory syncytial virus rsv ab human metapneumovirus virus human parainfluenza virus 123 human rhinovirus ab human coronavirus 229enl63oc43hku1 samples positive only for the m gene of flu a by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr were typed using the real-time rt-pcr-based kit established by the cdc specific for detecting and characterizing ah1n1p given the higher sensitivity of the cdc rt-pcr system than the seeplex kit for detecting ah1n1p and influenza a viruses in general throughout this paper all results pertaining to influenza a virus should be considered to have been obtained by the former method a small number of influenza a virus positive samples were untypeable because of low viral loads the performance of this multiplex assay has been determined elsewhere 26 at the outpatient unit all patients visitors and healthcare workers are required to use a surgical mask and to wash their hands before and after all patient contact routinely the outpatients received intravenous treatment in three-patient or five-patient rooms in order to reduce the possibility of nosocomial transmission and to facilitate the evaluation of potential microepidemics the patients were always placed in the same room unless vrti was detected patients with vrti were placed in individual rooms until they were asymptomatic and if feasible negative for respiratory viruses yearly influenza vaccination of patients hospital staff and family members was recommended 21 27 the differences between the groups were assessed by means of the chi-square test for heterogeneity or fishers exact test when appropriate all p values are two-sided a p value of 005 was considered to be statistically significant the analyses were performed using the spss version 130 statistical package spss inc chicago il usa a total of 193 patients were screened and 264 pharyngeal swabs were performed among them 136 patients had 1 swab performed 45 had 2 11 had 3 and 1 had 5 fifty-six percent of patients were male and the majority 68  132 out of 193 received hsct 127 allogeneic and 7 autologous at a median of 306 days before entry in the study range 307712 days in particular 26  35 out of 132 received transplant within 90 days 14  18 out of 132 within 90180 days and 60  79 out of 132 within 180 days or more among 264 pharyngeal swabs 162 61  came from symptomatic patients and 102 39  from asymptomatic patients a total of 58 22  swabs positive for 61 viruses were recovered in case of symptoms the virological documentation of infection was significantly more frequent 30  49 out of 162 of swabs performed during symptoms were positive compared to 9  9 out of 102 of swabs in asymptomatic subjects p  00001 the main viruses detected were influenza 20 out of 58 samples 34  rsv 21 out of 58 36  and rhinovirus 12 out of 58 21  and influenza and rsv infections were significantly more frequent in symptomatic subjects table 1 the symptoms of vrti were divided into three main categories and the rate of positive virological results was as follows ili 38  25 out of 65 fever only 30  9 out of 30 and upper vrti symptoms 22  15 out of 67 fig 1 the classical ili presentation was significantly more frequently associated with virologically documented infection as compared with the upper vrti symptoms group 38 vs 22  p  004 considering the ecdc definition it was less specific than ili with 30  of patients 40 out of 132 fulfilling the criteria of a viral respiratory tract infectious disease having a microbiologically confirmed infection

 in case of influenza 11 out of 20 patients presented with ili 55  4 with fever only 20  3 with upper vrti symptoms 15  and 2 10  were asymptomatic both patients had been vaccinated when evaluating the predictive value of ili for the diagnosis of influenza in symptomatic patients during the epidemic season only 17  11 out of 65 of cases presenting with ili had influenza the other 14 patients with ili and vrti had rsv 9 patients 14  rhinovirus 4 patients 6  and coronavirus 1 patient 15  infection while in 40 other patients with ili 615  no virus was detected thus the sensitivity of ili for influenza in our population was 55  95  confidence interval 95  ci 3277 specificity was 69  95  ci 6176 and positive predictive value ppv was 17  95  ci 828 among hsct recipients the predictive value of ili for influenza was 15  7 out of 46 cases presenting with ili six patients had pneumonia thus bal was performed and four viruses were detected co-pathogens are reported in table 2 one influenza a two rsv and one coronavirus in two cases influenza and rsv progression from upper to lower respiratory tract infection was diagnosed progression rate for influenza 1 out of 20 progression rate for rsv 1 out of 19 these three patients with influenza and rsv pneumonia were successfully treated with oseltamivir and ribavirin respectively the other two patients were diagnosed with pneumonia due to other pathogens
 weekly incidence of all vrti was 311 per 100 patient-weeks of influenza was 113 per 100 patient-weeks and of rsv was 107 per 100 patient-weeks the analysis of weekly distribution of diagnosed vrti documented that the peak activity for the main two viruses influenza and rsv was detected in the same period the circulation of influenza virus in this cohort was detected later detection from weeks 2 to 10 with peak activity in weeks 6 and 7 as compared to the general population detection from week 50 of 2010 to week 9 of 2011 with peak activity from weeks 2 to 6 a similar delayed circulation was detected for rsv in the study population in weeks 212 with peak activity in weeks 6 to 8 while in the general population from week 50 of 2010 to week 10 of 2011 a total of 58 vrti with identification of 61 viruses occurred in 55 out of 193 outpatients incidence 28  the incidence of influenza and rsv infections was 10  20 out of 193 and 11  21 out of 193 respectively the incidence of vrti was similar in hsct recipients 40 out of 132 30  than in patients with haematological malignancies and no transplant 15 out of 61 25  p  049 three hsct recipients developed a second episode of vrti 1 parainfluenza and 27 days later rsv 2 influenza and 21 days later coronavirus and 3 coronavirus and 44 days later rhinovirus the distribution of different vrti is reported in fig 2 patients characteristics and outcome in four groups of vrti are outlined in table 2 in particular approximately half of the patients with either of the following infections influenza rsv and rhinovirus presented with ili syndrome 11 out of 20 55  9 out of 19 47  and 5 out of 12 42  respectively
 the standard prevention measures that included facial masks and hand hygiene were applied to all the patients with vrti for influenza infection the possibility of giving pharmacological prophylaxis with oseltamivir was evaluated for all the contacts of patients with a documented influenza infection among 20 influenza infections 19 were treated with the full dose of oseltamivir and 1 patient was not treated because the positive result was available after 72 h and the patient was asymptomatic vaccinated with no previous allogeneic hsct and well-controlled underlying disease overall 56 contacts of 20 cases were identified among outpatients 6 were symptomatic and received oseltamivir treatment pending the results of viral testing whereas 50 were asymptomatic among them 19 received oseltamivir prophylaxis within 72 h of exposure to a contact patient while the remaining 31 patients were closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of influenza infection but no prophylaxis was given the decision to withhold prophylaxis was based on either the fact that over 72 h elapsed between contact and notification or low risk of severe infection no lymphopenia none of 56 contacts developed microbiologically documented influenza infection despite the high number of patients exposed to influenza no nosocomial outbreak was detected a cluster of influenza infection was observed in week 7 five patients in 4 days but the identified types of viruses were different three type a h3n2 one type a h1n1 and one type b and there was no evidence of any nosocomial contact with a patient infected with type a h3n2 4 days before transmission from healthcare workers or visitors could not be assessed as no swabs were performed among them but no healthcare worker attending the outpatients unit had respiratory symptoms or fever during the study period and visitors do not have access to outpatient therapy rooms rsv peak activity was observed from weeks 6 to 8 seven infections the equal circulation of the a four and b three subtypes and no contact between the patients involved make unlikely patient-to-patient transmission and large epidemic outbreak overall 45 23  patients were vaccinated with the seasonal strains while among 148 non-vaccinated patients 52 35  reported that all or some household contacts had been vaccinated there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of influenza between vaccinated 11  5 out of 45 and non-vaccinated patients 10  15 out of 148 p  079 and between patients with 13  7 out of 52 and without vaccinated household contacts 86  8 out of 96 p  039 among 5 vaccinated patients 3 allogeneic hsct recipients and 2 with no transplant 2 had an asymptomatic infection while 2 had classic ili and 1 had fever only as compared to 15 non-vaccinated patients all of whom were symptomatic in particular with ili 9 out of 15 60  in the group of hsct recipients vaccination rate was 0  0 out of 53 within 6 months after transplant and 34  27 out of 79 among those over 6 months from transplant among seven autologous transplant recipients one was vaccinated and none developed influenza the incidence of influenza was 11  6 out of 53 among patient with 6 months from transplant 7  2 out of 28 among those 6 months from transplant and vaccinated and 8  4 out of 52 among those 6 months from transplant and not vaccinated this prospective study confirms that vrti are a very common cause of morbidity affecting during the observation period of 3 months almost one third of outpatients in an hsct unit asymptomatic vrti was not infrequent 9  but none of them developed a clinically significant disease symptoms of influenza rsv and rhinovirus infection were similar and classic symptoms have low ppv for influenza 17  thus rapid and reliable diagnosis is crucial fortunately no large outbreak was detected and low rate of progression from upper to lower respiratory tract infection and no vrti-related mortality were observed the presence of any symptom was significantly associated with a confirmed vrti but in this population classic ili had low ppv for any vrti 38  including influenza 17  similar results were reported in another prospective observational study where 25  of patients had a vrti and respiratory viruses were detected more frequently in the presence of symptoms but symptoms in case of influenza and other vrti were similar 20 ecdc definition adapted for the haematology population was even less specific than ili in immunocompetent individuals ili presentation is considered rather specific for influenza during the epidemic season in fact in generally healthy older adolescents and adults living in areas with confirmed influenza virus circulation estimates of ppv a simple clinical definition of influenza acute onset of cough and fever have been reported to be approximately 8090  and empirical anti-influenza treatment was recommended in such conditions 2831 however even in an immunocompetent population the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of influenza on the basis of symptoms alone is being questioned reported incidence of ili in patients with influenza 4451  and is now considered limited because symptoms from illness caused by other pathogens can overlap considerably with influenza 29 in immunocompromised patients the association between ili and influenza is even less pronounced as systemic symptoms such as fever or myalgia are frequently lacking 32 therefore considering the co-circulation of influenza rsv and rhinoviruses in the same period and the similar clinical presentation of these infections early use of rapid molecular testing to identify a specific virus instead of universal empirical treatment with anti-influenza drugs in patients with ili should be pursued initiating antiviral treatment at the onset of symptoms and then discontinuing it after diagnostic tests result negative for influenza is another feasible management strategy for influenza vaccination from 6 months after transplant is recommended for hsct recipients 21 27 in this study the incidence of influenza was similar in vaccinated and non-vaccinated patients however the only two patients with asymptomatic influenza infection had been vaccinated suggesting that active immunization might significantly attenuate the course of infection even if it is not prevented the role of chemoprophylaxis of influenza during the peak season remains controversial even though it is universally recommended in case of nosocomial outbreaks and for the first 2 weeks after vaccination in case of community or nosocomial outbreak 21 27 however in this population of immunocompromised patients of whom 25  was vaccinated the incidence of influenza during the epidemic season was only 10  such a low incidence might be a result of a strict isolation policy with daily use of surgical masks and particular attention to hand hygiene together with a virus-specific attack rate that may vary annually additionally a low progression rate to lower respiratory tract infection and low mortality in all vrti was observed approximately 5  possibly due to a rapid diagnosis and an early start of an antiviral therapyusually 2448 h after the onset of symptoms therefore in a population with low incidence and mortality and in consideration of the possibility of acquiring resistance to antivirals as reported during the 2009 h1n1 epidemics 33 34 an early diagnosis and post-exposure prophylaxis for close contacts seem preferable to a general chemoprophylactic strategy molecular assays are particularly convenient for the diagnosis of vrti in immunocompromised patients because they are rapid sensitive and may detect multiple pathogens although there are always some viruses not included in the assay 26 however they may also detect viral genetic material from a resolved or subclinical infection and the optimal management of these cases remains unclear in this cohort nine asymptomatic subjects had vrti and isolation measures were applied in all cases but only one patient was treated for influenza it has been reported that in asymptomatic patients lower quantities of virus might be present 20 35 and transmission might be improbable as demonstrated by on observation that no transmission to household contacts occurred in asymptomatic immunocompetent subjects with rhinovirus 36 also in this study asymptomatic patients did not subsequently develop any clinical symptoms the strengths of this study include a prospective standardized diagnostic approach for all the outpatients regardless of respiratory symptoms and the use of a very sensitive diagnostic method the limitations are a single-centre experience and a short observation period which did not include the last weeks of 2010 when some infections could occur thus data on the incidence cannot be extrapolated to other populations or seasons additionally the sensitivity of detection of respiratory viruses may vary for oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal specimens 37 although nasopharyngeal aspirates may be the most sensitive especially for conventional diagnostic methods less invasive specimen collection techniques are also acceptable given the very high sensitivity of new molecular diagnostic methods 37 while recent guidelines recommend combined intranasal sampling using flocked swabs and the pharyngeal swabs in one virus transport medium 25 finally other centres with different management strategies for outpatients including different contact prevention measures might experience different rates of nosocomial transmission or morbidity in conclusion vrti are frequent in patients with haematological malignancies and may occur both in the presence of classic symptoms and in those with fever only there was a significant overlapping in both symptoms and circulation period for influenza rsv and rhinovirus thus empirical treatment of influenza in the presence of ili might be reserved for severely ill patients rapid virological diagnosis and treatment only in case of a documented infection have been found feasible and successful in this setting of high-risk haematology outpatients  children infected with sars-cov-2 from family clusters dan sun feng zhu cheng wang jing wu jie liu xue chen zhisheng liu zubo wu xiaoxia lu jiehui ma hua peng han xiao   within family clusters that had sars-cov-2 infection children had mild or even asymptomatic illness over 1600000 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection have been confirmed globally and had resulted in up to 99000 deaths by april 10 2020 in early january 2020 the outbreak rapidly escalated with hundreds of cases now confirmed within household clusters 1 like influenza viruses sars-cov-2 spreads primarily via respiratory droplets and causes infection by invading mucosa of the eyes nose or mouth 2 the underlying health status of the patient has been found to play a critical role in overall susceptibility in the sars-cov-2 outbreak 3 indeed novel coronavirus pneumonia infection within adult patients has been shown to cause rapid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and septic shock commonly followed by multiple organ failure according to the china centers for disease control and prevention cdc report there have also been rare severe or fatal cases in sars-cov-2-infected children 4 in nine initial cases of hospitalized infants the infants were vulnerable to the novel coronavirus but had mild illnesses 5 however with a relatively small sample size and a limited pediatric age group many critical issues for the formulation of measures to quarantine and treat children infected with sars-cov-2 still remain unclear therefore in this research a retrospective case study was conducted on 74 children in family clusters with confirmed covid-19 infection in wuhan childrens hospital the study provides the first delineation of the characteristics of children with covid-19 infection in family clusters and meets the need to give much medical attention to covid-19-infected children under the current viral crisis a retrospective case study was performed in one hospital designated for children with covid-19 infection wuhan childrens hospital this study was approved by the ethics committee of wuhan childrens hospital of tongji medical college huazhong university of science and technology the requirement for informed patient consent was waived by the ethics committee due to it being a retrospective case study and the emergency nature of the covid-19 infection outbreak all the hospitalized covid-9-infected children were identified between january 28 2020 and march 3 2020 the children diagnosed with covid-19 through laboratory confirmation of sars-cov-2 infection by real-time polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were enrolled in this study during hospitalization nasopharyngeal and anal swabs were collected and tested for sars-cov-2 rna through reverse real-time polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr as described previously 6 the diagnostic criteria for covid-19 were based on the recommendations in the diagnosis and treatment protocol for the novel coronavirus pneumonia issued by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china infection was defined as the occurrence of at least one positive rt-pcr test result clinical data were retrospectively retrieved from the medical records the date of disease onset was defined as the day when a symptom was first noticed information on the symptoms laboratory chest ct and treatment during the hospital were also collected ards was defined according to the berlin definition 7 for descriptive analysis continuous variables were presented as mean  sd or as median with interquartile range iqr whenever appropriate categorical variables were presented as a number and percentage the shapiro-wilk test was used to test the normality of data distribution the kaplan-meier method was used on time-to-event data to estimate the median time and its corresponding 95 confidence interval ci all statistical analysis was performed using ibm spss statistics for windows version 260 the demographic and epidemic characteristics of the 74 covid-19-infected children with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection are shown in table 1 there were 38 male patients and 36 female patients aged between 2 months and 153 years the median age was 58 years and 36 487 of the patients were over 6 years old while 26 351 of the patients were younger than 3 years old fourteen 189 of the children had a medical history of at least one previous condition ie asthma gastrointestinal ulcer epilepsy hepatolenticular degeneration or acute lymphocytic leukemia seven 95 of the covid-19-infected children had previously been infected with other respiratory diseases out of the 74 patients two children came from the same family while the others came from different families twenty-nine 392 families had 3 patients and 25 338 families had 2 patients in these infected family members in nearly 35 467 grandfathers and in 32 427 grandmothers were infected first in the family while in only 21 284 were fathers and in 15 203 were mothers infected first they were all infected before the children the mean time between the first positive rt-pcr finding and the initial suspected child case in the family was 142  61 days twenty-two of the 74 297 patients had no earlier symptoms but they were hospitalized because they had had previous contact with infected relatives within their families or they were hospitalized for other reasons and were later diagnosed with covid-19 through rt-pcr positive tests in these asymptomatic patients 3 of the 22 136 children

features of sars-cov-2 in children on initial presentation included fever 514 cough 554 sputum 298 and diarrhea 135 poor appetite fatigue vomiting abdominal pain and myalgia were present but on rare occasions in addition 22 297 infected children had neither symptoms nor laboratory indications nor ct evidence for lesions these asymptomatic patients only showed sars-cov-2 rna positive there were no differences between the children with symptoms and asymptomatic children in terms of median age sex ratio or the status of comorbidities table 1 the laboratory indices and microbiologic findings on

children patchy consolidation found in 14 189 and interstitial abnormalities found in 8 108 more positive findings were present in chest ct from children with symptoms in comparison to asymptomatic children table 1 all of the children had at least one positive result in the rt-pcr test for viral rna performed on nasopharyngeal swabs upon their admission to the hospital based on the respiratory and digestive symptoms and typical manifestations of viral pneumonia in chest ct the children were divided into four groups figure 1c forty patients 541 presented symptoms with typical positive ct results for viral pneumonia infection seventeen patients 230 presented symptoms with an absence of the typical positive ct results for viral pneumonia infection indicating upper respiratory tract infection or gastrointestinal infection of covid-19 five 67 of the patients did not present any respiratory or digestive symptoms but ct scan proved the presence of viral pneumonia infection seventeen 23 children were classified as asymptomatic carriers with neither symptoms nor typical positive ct results for viral pneumonia infection the infected children were under medical observation and quarantine all of them received inhaled interferon with 24 gkg in 2 ml sterile water nebulization two times per day for 57 days by march 3 2020 the body temperature returned to normal and symptoms

illness rt-pcr test results for viral rna from anal swabs were available from 46 patients 622 the anal swabs and nasopharyngeal swabs were taken and tested co-currently for each patient figure 2 shows the temporal pattern in the percentage of negative rt-pcr results for the nasopharyngeal or anal swabs of the 46 patients who had both their nasopharyngeal and anal swabs tested the median time for nucleic acid tests to turn negative was 90 days iqr of 70130 for nasopharyngeal swabs and 100 days iqr of 70170 for anal swabs the nasopharyngeal nucleic acid tests of 913 of children turned negative within 28 days from admission time in comparison fewer anal swab nucleic acid tests 652 turned negative than did nasopharyngeal swab tests in 28 days hr 1718 95 ci 10402839 p  00346 figure 1 additionally the median time for nucleic acid tests to turn negative was 90 days iqr of 70130 for nasopharyngeal swabs and 100 days iqr of 70170 for anal swabs we described the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 74 children patients with confirmed covid-19 infection by family cluster most children with covid-19 infection were toddlers and schoolchildren without any gender susceptibility the average internal time between the diagnosis of the children with a positive nucleic acid test and the initial case in their families was 142  61 days in most cases it was a grandparent that was infected before the child cough fever and sputum occurred in most of the patients compared to nasopharyngeal swab which turned negative after a median time of 90 iqr of 70130 days it took a median time of 100 iqr of 70170 days for anal swab to turn negative these mismatched results indicate that the body took longer to clear the virus from the digestive tract than from the respiratory tract regular lymphocytes and neutrophils normal kidney and heart function fewer severe cases and a lower fatality rate were observed in the children apart from the typical ct images half of the negative ct scans were from children with covid-19 infection that presented some clinical symptoms furthermore 297 of the children were asymptomatic carriers with positive sars-cov-2 nucleic acid testing results due to previous exposure to covid-19-infected family members this indicated that asymptomatic children with covid-19 infection can be significant transmitters of the virus and can increase the number of cases of infection since the large-scale outbreak of the covid-19 virus infection in wuhan cases in the initial clusters reported that wild animals were the likely source and an animal-to-human route was probably the main mode of transmission for those initially reported cases 8 recently nine sars-cov-2-infected infants were identified by dr zhang and it was found that family clustering occurred for all of the infected infants 9 similarly in our cohort covid-19 in all of the 74 children was attributed to the family cluster 10 sars-cov-2 was transmitted to these children by infected adult relatives such as parents or grandparents by close exposure incredibly one family had seven covid-19 patients they were passively screened for sars-cov-2 nucleic acid due to exposure to an infected relative or sought medical treatment for other reasons just as the transmission pattern of mers-cov involves transmission within families 11 sars-cov-2 was also transmitted in family clusters in our present study all of the child patients had been infected by a family member it was mostly a grandfather or grandmother that was infected first in the family these data indicated that elderly relatives were still an important source of infection of sars-cov-2 in family clusters in china traditionally family groups in china are large with children living with their parents and grandparents however niccol et al reported that 55 of child patients were exposed to sars-cov-2 from unknown sources or from sources outside the childs family in italy 12 the longest interval between the diagnosis of a child via positive nucleic acid test and the initial case in his or her family was over 1 month 42 days furthermore 297 of children had no symptoms or signs which might lead to a delay in medical treatment which might cause transmission to more people in the present study most of the covid-19-infected children were younger than 3 years and older than 6 years similar to sars and mers cases there is a lot of variability in the clinical presentation including mild or asymptomatic cases that may never be presented to healthcare services 4 13 compared with adult cases most of the children with covid-19 exhibited mild or moderate symptoms the main clinic signs of covid-19 in children are fever and cough however child patients manifested sputum instead of the adult dry cough 14 table 1 in addition a few child patients suffered from diarrhea which was uncommon in adults diarrhea was also reported to be associated with middle east respiratory syndrome coronary virus mers-cov infection 15 16 this suggests the possibility of direct viral involvement of the alimentary canals compared to adults with covid-19 in whom the virus mainly acted to reduce lymphocytes none of the children with covid-19 had lymphopenia table 2 these might indicate a lack of an over-activated immune response in children with covid-19 in contrast adults infected by sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov or mers-cov were reported to have increased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines which were associated with pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage in patients 17 18 this difference might explain the mild symptoms in children with covid-19 recently toubiana reported that sars-cov-2 infected children and adolescents might related to the ongoing outbreak of kawasaki-like multisystem inflammatory syndrome among children and adolescents in the paris area however we did not find that the patients manifested the same clinical signs as kawasaki disease 19 children are susceptible to general respiratory diseases in our present study none of the covid-19-positive children were co-infected with other bacteria or ab flu while few patients were co-infected with cytomegalovirus or eb virus 378 of the children with covid-19 were co-infected with mycoplasma mp especially patients over 6 years old mp pneumoniae is one of the most common causes of childhood community-acquired pneumonia 9 our data showed mp igm positive results which indicates recent infection with mp it is not possible to determine which infected came first mp or sars-cov-2 or whether mp-infected children might be more susceptible to sars-cov-2 of the 74 covid-19-infected children 541 of patients had positive ct images which was lower than for covid-19-infected adult patients in whom there are 75 positive chest ct findings 20 compared to the group without symptoms more patients showed positive ct in the group with symptoms this indicated that lung injury accompanied the symptoms in children typical ct manifestations of the viral pneumonia are mainly multifocal ground-glass changes the manifestations of lung ct scans in adult patients were bilateral subpleural ground-glass opacities with air bronchograms ill-defined margins and a slight predominance in the right lower lobe 21 partly similar to adult patients lung injure entexisted in unilateral lung and a single lung lobe in child patients in adults covid-19 pneumonia manifests with chest ct imaging abnormalities even in asymptomatic patients infected with sars-cov-2 however 230 of covid-19-positive children were classified as asymptomatic carriers who had neither symptoms nor radiological findings this accords with a publication that reported that 209 of adult patients have isolated sars-cov-2 infection before or without the development of viral pneumonia however ct might not always be necessary but could be performed upon clinical suspicion and lung ultrasound can be a useful tool 22 23 furthermore there were significant differences in laboratory results between the asymptomatic group and symptomatic group compared to the patients without symptoms there were higher levels of ldh alt ast and cr in the patients with symptoms these data indicate that the patients suffered mild organ damage particularly of the heart liver and kidney most child cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware that they were exposed 14 these findings indicate that not all children with covid-19 suffer lung damage and also advocate for shifting the focus in sars-cov-2 screening to children once a family member is confirmed to have covid-19 sars-cov-2-positive detection from nasopharyngeal swabs by pcr is the basis for diagnosis of covid-19 in our present study in contrast to negative results from nasopharyngeal swab 34 of anal swabs continued to show positive simultaneously diarrhea was also presented in children covid-19 studies have demonstrated that patients with a positive stool test did not experience gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms 24 sars-cov-2 infection through transmission through stool should then be considered and a fecal-oral route could be a potential transmission pathway therefore we should strengthen stool management and be alert to fecal-oral spread when caring for children the study indicates that asymptomatic children within a family cluster are potentially a little-known source of covid-19 and this warrants an urgent reassessment of the transmission dynamics of the current outbreak moreover pediatric experts have suggested that imaging should not be used routinely for child patients with covid-19 who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms 22 25 to really understand the real burden of pediatric covid-19 particularly in children exposed to adults with covid-19 serologic studies of these children might be important 26 it is also recommended that both nasopharyngeal and anal swabs should be confirmed negative as a standard for release such a situation makes the control and management efforts for the spread and transmission of the viral infection much more challenging hence increasing the chances of infection via transmission a situation that could be the reason for the spread of covid-19 infection to other parts of the world therefore there is still a need for much effort on early identification and timely treatment especially of asymptomatic cases in children as this is crucial in fighting the pandemic not only in china

asymptomatic infection chinese authorities have implemented new intervention measures----national large-scale nucleic acid testing this article summarizes the population who needs the nucleic acid testing analyzes the current data of daily covid-19 tests per thousand people concludes the timeline of coronavirus testing and suggests what needs to be done to facilitate the government large-scale screening measures in light of the new situation and problems of the epidemic at home and abroad further control measure-----national large-scale nucleic acid testing 1 was taken from april 22 2020 on to prevent the epidemic from rebounding in china despite the orderly resumption of production and restoration of economics there were imported covid-19 infections 2  asymptomatic infection 3 4  clusters of cases and cross-infections in hospitals 5  therefore large-scale nucleic acid  testing as the first and crucial step in the four early measures plays a key role to achieve great control effect four early measure early detection early report early isolation early treatment an important means for the prevention and control of infectious diseases has been adopted since the very beginning of the coronavirus outbreak the improvement of detection capacity needs to be accelerated and nucleic acid testing should be carried out to contain the progress of the epidemic on a regular basis restraining the alarming spread of the outbreak from the very first step nucleic acid testing enables a rapid response to the covid-19 outbreak by identifying suspected cases confirming releasement of recovered patients screening close contacts and high-risk groups the diagnostic criteria of covid-19 are defined as suspected cases with one of the following 6  1 positive nucleic acid results by rt-pcr 2 highly homologous sequencing of virus gene to sars-cov-2 3 positive serum igm and igg results and the incubation lasts 1 to 14 days therefore the quarantine requisite involves a period of 14 days isolation observation at home isolation medical observation at home or centralized isolation medical observation the large-scale nucleic acid testing should cover targeted population units and venues where people gather amid work and production resumption especially the population who are at high risks based on the data released by chinese authorities 7 8  the key populations include this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved 1 confirmed covid-19 cases and close contacts 2 imported cases and close contacts 3 asymptomatic cases and close contacts 4 patients with fever 5 patients in need of hospitalization 6 personnel returning from business trip especially from regions of high risks 7 personnel returning to school or work 8 staff of medical institutions port quarantine inspection public security and judicial supervision social welfare and pension institutions maternal and child service institutions and other key places for some key places and areas the measure covers everyone such as the whole populations nucleic acid testing in wuhan city starting from may 15 2020 compared to some drive-through screening center 9  the testing in china is officially organized and taken in designated hospitals and institutions with sample collected by professional healthcare personnel and examined in specialized laboratory furthermore chinese authorities declared to speed up the improvement of rapid detection capability especially to promote the production of nucleic acid rapid detection equipment with results in shortened time and no need for laboratory 10  it must be ensured that all confirmed and suspected cases asymptomatic cases and close contacts are traced to block the channels of the spread of the virus and fill the loopholes in covid-19 prevention great importance should be attached to prevent clustered epidemics especially hospital infections this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved 1 make sure of adequate supply of nucleic acid testing kits with the covid-19 pandemic continuing to ravage the world fears of a massive demand for coronavirus test kits ignited a major concern worldwide including countries such as the us italy iran and so on 11  especially at the early stage globally the number of daily covid-19 tests per thousand people has gradually increasing as for china the nucleic acid detection capacity has reached 15 million per day by the end of may 17 2020 and will be further improved 12  the timeline of coronavirus testing figure 1  showed that the authorities had invested a lot on the testing and the detection capacity had been greatly improved however with the decision of national large-scale nucleic testing further improved detection capability will be required therefore sustained and steady growth of testing kits should be ensured to meet the demand 2 keep a close watch on imported cases and asymptomatic patients after three months stringent measures against the virus china has entered into the phase of mitigation however it is still faced with the high risk of rebounding due to not only the imported cases but also asymptomatic patients studies 13 14 have indicated that asymptomatic patients are infectious and can potentially transmit covid-19 which deserves close attention and proper handling based on the daily reports from the national health commission of the peoples republic of china from april 1 2020 to april 25 2020 the number of imported cases and asymptomatic cases exceeded that of local cases by a great deal 15  figure 2  up to april 25 2020 there were a total of 694 imported confirmed cases and 1000 asymptomatic cases with covid-19 including 151 this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved asymptomatic imported cases imported cases and asymptomatic patients as two groups of the key targeted populations accounted for a big proportion of the whole infected cases the current interventions for them and their close contacts are 14 days of centralized quarantine and observation with the releasing requirement of two consecutive negative nucleic acid tests for more thorough inspection of the targeted populations improved mechanism of joint regional defense and deepened international cooperation at borders or customs will be demanded to facilitate the pandemic control management during the period of large scale nucleic acid testing as hard as it is the active cooperation of the whole society has been witnessed which guarantes the positive invention effect however the pandemic keeps in a dynamic and rapidly evolving stage so there is still a long way to go in the battle against the covid-19 where constant vigilance is needed   estimation of the basic reproduction number average incubation time asymptomatic infection rate and case fatality rate for covid19 metaanalysis and sensitivity analysis wenqing he grace yi y yayuan zhu   since the first case of the coronavirus

 on 11 march 2020 the world health organization who declared covid19 to be a pandemic the swift spread of the virus is largely attributed to its stealthy transmissions for which infected patients may be asymptomatic or exhibit only flulike symptoms in the early stage undetected transmissions present a remarkable challenge for the containment of the virus and pose an appalling threat to the public health to understand the drastically negative impacts of covid19 on the public health it is urgent to investigate key features pertinent to the disease how severe is the transmission how long is the incubation time of the disease on average how many infections are asymptomatic and ultimately what is the case fatality rate to evaluate the severity of the virus spread it is useful to estimate the basic reproduction number denoted r
0 defined as the average number of cases generated by an infected individual in a population where everyone is susceptible to infection if the basic reproduction number r
0 is larger than 1 the outbreak is regarded as selfsustaining unless control measures are implemented to mitigate the transmission
2
 defined as the time from the moment of exposure to the virus until signs and symptoms of covid19 appear the incubation time of a covid19 infected patient provides a useful measure for the disease development knowing the average incubation time of the covid19 patients is important for disease surveillance to determine how deadly the covid19 is it is fundamental to evaluate the case fatality rate which is calculated as the ratio of the number of deaths from covid19 to the number of infected cases since the outbreak of the disease a large body of research on covid19 has been done and many articles have been published in scientific journals or shared on platforms such as biorxir and medrxir simulations of the epidemic have been published under various assumptions to delineate hidden transmissions of the virus
2
 while estimates of those important quantities have been reported in the literature those results are quite different and vary considerably from study to study there has been a lack of consensus of those estimates because of serious concerns on the heterogeneity among the studies different studies have been carried out on different patients under different conditions and different authors may make different model assumptions interpreting the available findings must be coupled with the associated features of the studies moreover covid19 data contain substantial errors in that the number of confirmed cases is considerably underreported which is attributed to two primary reasons insufficient test kits do not allow every potential patient with covid19like symptoms to be tested and there has been a good portion of asymptomatic covid19 carriers who would never be tested and counted as confirmed cases it is useful to understand the asymptomatic infection rate defined as the ratio of the number of asymptomatic infections to the number of all infected cases to address these issues we carry out a metaanalysis to synthesize the reported estimates of the basic reproduction number the average incubation time and the case fatality rate as well as the asymptomatic rate in a rigorous way by factoring out the variabilities associated with the relevant studies to accommodate the effects of missing asymptomatic infections on calculating the case fatality rate we further perform a sensitivity analysis for the estimation of the case fatality rate our study provides a comprehensive evaluation of key measures of covid19 by taking into account of the heterogeneity and measurement error effects which are intrinsically associated with covid19 data our results offer sensible estimates of the clinical features of covid19 to enhance the understanding of the disease the third author yz conducted a literature screening for the articles published between 24 january 2020 and 31 march 2020 by using online databases including pubmed web of science google scholar and the official websites of core scientific and biomedical journals including science nature the lancet the new england journal of medicine and the journal of american medical association as well as some preprint platforms such as biorxiv and medrxir with search terms specified as covid19 sarscov2 2019ncov and novel coronavirus fortythree articles were found with the theme on the basic reproduction number the incubation period the percentage of asymptomatic cases and the case fatality rate among those articles 20 articles described in table 1 were identified by the first author wh to be included in the analysis together with serra

 the reported 95 cis were asymmetric which we suspect were caused by employing a transformation such as the exponential transformation to the initial cis for the reparameterized effective size for example some authors may apply the logarithm to reparameterize the basic reproduction number or the average incubation time before performing the analysis using the inverse transformation we convert the reported asymmetric cis and work out the associated standard deviations which are used in determining the weights for the metaanalysis as shown in the top panel of figures 1 2 3 4 estimates of the basic reproduction number the mean incubation time the asymptomatic infection rate and the case fatality rate are quite different from study to study to obtain synthetic results we perform a metaanalysis to aggregate the information from multiple studies with the same estimand or effect size of interest yet different features including the differences in the data collection the sample size and the conditions suppose k studies report an estimate and the associate standard deviation for an effect size of interest for the ith study with i  1  k let y
i denote the effect size of interest and let 
i
2 represent its associated variance estimate in our analysis here y
i is taken as the basic reproduction number the average incubation time the asymptomatic infection rate and the case fatality rate respectively we calculate a weighted average of the results from those k studies under either the fixed effect model or the random effects model

26

 the top panel of figure 1 shows the results for the basic production number reported in the seven studies the i
2 index for those studies is 978 suggesting that the random effect model should be considered in conducting the metaanalysis this result agrees with the perception that the basic reproduction number is timedependent and varies from place to place the bottom panel of figure 1 includes the metaanalysis results the meta estimate of the basic reproduction number is 315 suggesting that a virus carrier may infect at least three individuals on average if preventive measures such as social distancing or quarantine are not applied to the public this estimate is obtained from the data before 29 february 2020 where most data are collected from wuhan city or other places in china as more studies on the basic reproduction number become available for different places at different time periods we can apply the same metaanalysis procedure to estimate the basic reproduction number to reflect its changes with the implementation of various measures to curb the virus spread in different regions to estimate the average of the incubation time for infections we study the results reported in the five articles summarized in the top panel of figure 2 the i
2 index is 28 showing that the fixed effect model is suitable when conducting the metaanalysis while the incubation time differs from patient to patient varying between 1 and 14 days as reported by european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc
27
 it is feasible to take their average time to be a fixed quantity the bottom panel of figure 2 reports the metaanalysis results for the average incubation time of covid19 it shows that the mean incubation time is 508 days with 95 cis being about 477 to 539 days this estimated average incubation time is about 2 days shorter than the mean incubation time of 7 days announced by ecdc
27
 we point out that our estimate is obtained by combining the information from those studies before 24 february 2020 with study subjects in wuhan city or other places in china in the top panel of figure 3 we display the estimates of the asymptomatic infection rate reported by

21
 
23
 it is clear that those studies provided very different estimates of the asymptomatic infection rate varying from 179 to 783 such a heterogeneity of the studies is confirmed by the i
2 index which is 98 thus we take the random effects model when conducting the metaanalysis we report the results at the bottom panel of figure 3 our analysis suggests that the combined asymptomatic infection rate is 46 with the 95 ci ranging from 184 to 736 this estimate is derived from the information up to 2 april 2020 reported by the six studies which include worldwide individuals finally we are interested in estimating the case fatality rate which measures how deadly covid19 is for the infected people the metaanalysis results derived from seven studies available in the literature shown in the top panel of figure 4 are reported at the bottom panel of figure 4 where we assume the random effect models because the i
2 index is 995 the estimated case fatality rate is 334 slightly smaller than 34 the estimate reported on 3 march 2020 by the who
28
 the 95 ci suggests that the average case fatality rate can be as small as 218 and as large as 449 these results are obtained from the data up to 21 march 2020 which contain five studies with subjects in china and two studies with worldwide subjects we comment that the true average case fatality rate is expected to be smaller than the estimate here because the reported estimates of the case fatality rate in the literature were merely calculated as the ratio of the number of deaths from covid19 to the number of reported confirmed infected cases where the number of reported confirmed infected cases is typically underreported due to limited testing capacity and the exclusion of asymptomatic infections to better understand what the true case fatality rate may be we further conduct two sensitivity studies in the first study we repeat the metaanalysis of the case fatality rate in section 35 by further including the results calculated from the data of the princess diamond cruise
29
 this analysis is driven by the consideration that the case fatality rate derived from the cohort of the cruise passengers is highly likely to be accurate because the number of confirmed cases from the cruise is very likely to be close to the true number of infections the bottom of figure 5 reports the metaanalysis results obtained from the random effects model with the inclusion of the results for the data of the princess diamond cruise the weights of other seven studies become smaller than those in figure 4 as shown by the size of the squares in figures 4 and 5 and the estimate of the case fatality rate becomes smaller the case fatality rate is estimated as 272 with the 95 ci 129416 in our second sensitivity analysis we revise the results in figure 4 by incorporating the information of asymptomatic cases to see the adjustment we let d represent the number of deaths caused from covid19 let c
r denote the number of reported infected cases of covid19 let c
a stand for the number of the sarscov2 carriers who are asymptomatic and let c be the total number of infected cases with the virus let r
a  c
ac be the ratio of asymptomatic infections to the true number of infections let p
r  dc
r be the reported case fatality rate and let p
t  dc be the true case fatality rate if we assume that c  c

3pt1rapr
 estimates of the case fatality rate that have been reported in the current literature are merely directed to p
r rather than p
t to sensibly estimate the true case fatality we use equation 3 to adjust the reported results of the seven studies listed at the top panel of figure 4 specifically we may multiply the factor 1  r
a with an estimate for the reported rate p
r as well as its standard deviation for each study and then run a metaanalysis however the exact value of the asymptomatic infection rate is unavailable and we only have its estimates from various studies displayed at the top panel of figure 3 to assess how the uncertainty of not knowing the true value of r
a we use two ways to set a value for r
a to modify the reported fatality rates for the studies listed at the top panel of figure 4 for running a new metaanalysis first taking r
a as one of seven reported estimates listed at the top panel of figure 3 we modify the reported results provided by each study listed at the top panel of figure 4 using equation 3 and report the metaanalysis results at the top panels of figure 6 in the second analysis we take r
a as the synthesized estimate reported in figure 3 that is r
a is set as 46 and then run the metaanalysis for these adjusted case fatality rates under the random effects model we report the results at the bottom panel of figure 6 which shows that the estimate of the case fatality rate is 18 with the 95 ci ranging from 118 to 243 we carry out a metaanalysis and sensitivity study for estimating the basic reproduction number the average incubation time the asymptomatic infection rate and the case fatality rate for covid19 examining the published results between 24 january 2020 and 31 march 2020 together with two studies found on 2 april 2020 our study aggregates different results reported in the literature and provides synthetic estimates by addressing the heterogeneity present in different studies conducted at different times for different regions our study shows that the basic reproduction number is estimated to be 315 with the 95 ci 241390 and the average incubation time is 508 days with the 95 ci ranging from 477 days to 539 days the asymptomatic infection rate is estimated to be 46 with the 95 ci 18487360 while multiple studies reported estimates of the case fatality rate those estimates are typically higher than the true case fatality rate under the same conditions which is attributed to the fact that a good portion of asymptomatic infections are not counted when estimating the case fatality rate our sensitivity study addresses this important issue and makes an adjustment to provide a sensible estimate of the case fatality rate compared with the estimated 334 case fatality rate obtained from the metaanalysis our sensitivity study estimates the case fatality rate to be 18 with 95 ci 118243 where asymptomatic infections are accounted for our studies reveal sensible estimates for the important quantities of covid19 by accommodating discrepancy effects associated with different studies such as the variability of the data collected from different populations at different time periods with the evolution of the pandemic the basic production number can greatly reduce as a result of the implementation of active measures to mitigate the virus spread the estimation of the case fatality rate may be closer to the true case fatality rate because of the increase of the test capacity more infected cases may be detected so the reported number of infections would be closer to the true number of covid19 carriers our results are useful in enhancing the knowledge of covid19 though we focus on evaluating the basic reproduction number the average incubation time the asymptomatic infection rate and the case fatality rate other features such as the time from symptom onset to hospitalization or to death and the morbidity rate of the disease are also important and they are worth being estimated in a sensible way the present investigations have limitations not all published results for the four measures are included in our study we do not include those manuscripts which reported merely a point estimate without the associated standard deviation or a 95 ci because they do not allow us to decide a proper weight for the inclusion of the result while reporting a single estimate of the average incubation time and the case fatality rate gives us an easy way to assess the impact of covid19 such measures marginalize the effects from the associated factors such as the disease severity the patients medical conditions and age with more studies available for categorizing the case fatality rate or the incubation time it is useful to apply the metaanalysis to estimate those measures by stratifying the population based on the demographic and clinical characteristics when data at the individual level are available better estimates of key features for covid19 can be obtained and the pandemic trend can be more reasonably projected using statistical regression models finally we emphasize that care should be taken when interpreting the estimates from the metaanalysis and the sensitivity analyses here a meaningful interpretation should be coupled with the associated features of the individual studies such as the time window the study subjects the study design and different measures of controlling the virus spread by different countries the authors declare that there are no conflict of interests wh identified the articles that were screened by the third author extracted

diagnosis mizumoto et al 39 estimated that the 179 of cases on the diamond princess cruise ship were asymptomatic 40 case during the outbreak in february 2020 mizumoto et al 2020  however the 41 transmissibility of asymptomatic case is unclear and the positive rt-pct results only imply 42 the potential infectivity it is important to study the pattern of viral shedding and live virus 43 isolation wlfel et al studied 9 hospitalized cases and found that live virus was isolated from 44 throat and lung-derived samples between 3 and 8 days after symptom onset wlfel et al 45 2020  when the rna concentration is above 10 6 copies per ml or equivalent ct-value lower 46 than 24 but not from stool samples despite of high virus rna concentration above the 47 threshold high rna concentration yields high probability of live virus isolation this dose-48 response association highlights a patients rt-pcr level should be higher than a threshold 49 to be effectively infectious however the mean infectious period  1  of a symptomatic case may be longer than that of 102 an asymptomatic case hypothetically therefore the combined effects of  and  1 probably 103 lead to a higher reproduction number in the symptomatic group 104 105 additionally chen et al chen et al 2020 showed that asymptomatic cases are more likely 106 to produce asymptomatic cases relatively speaking since the 6 secondary cases from 107 asymptomatic primary cases consist 3 asymptomatic cases 50 whereas 19 out of 126 108 15 are asymptomatic from symptomatic primary cases the odds ratio or is estimated 109 in summary we conclude that the relatively transmissibility of asymptomatic case could be 127 significantly smaller than that of the symptomatic cases the main contribution of chen et al 128 2020 is that they raise the alarm of the existence of the transmissibility of the asymptomatic 129 cases we remark that how efficient of the transmissibility of asymptomatic cases comparing 130 to symptomatic cases warrants more study 131 132 133 here we showed that the conclusion may depend on how we interpret the data 287 288 we also reported the asymptomatic case ratio in hong kong over time due to a large number 289 of young imported case 290 291 to the best of our knowledge this is the first time the relative transmissibility of 292 asymptomatic covid-19 cases is quantified 293 294 295

and immunoglobulin g igg antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 may be a more reliable approach to detect true infected population particularly in asymptomatic persons few studies focus on the diagnosis of covid-19 patients using serological tests to detect and assess asymptomatic infections of covid-19 among people in wuhan the epicenter of the covid-19 pandemic in china and provide evidence for planning adequate public health measures we collected and analyzed the clinical data in the wuhan general hospital mandatory for 16-to 64-year-old asymptomatic people this retrospective study estimated the seroprevalence of igm and igg and compared the epidemiological characteristics of asymptomatic sars-cov-2-infected population methods demographical and radiological data were collected from the wuhan general hospital between march 26 and april 28 2020 serological tests for igm and igg antibodies against sars-cov-2 were conducted with a colloidal gold method nucleic acid sequences of viruses were detected with rt-pcr statistical analyses were carried out using spss 200 software all rights reserved no reuse allowed without

cases had either igg positivity or igm positivity 353 95 ci 326-380 after standardizing for the genders and ages in the population of wuhan the overall standardized seroprevalence of igg was 333 95 ci 307-359 and the standardized seroprevalence of igg was 301 95 ci 269-333 among males and 366 95  ci 323-409 among females the standardized seroprevalence of igg was higher in women than in men with a significant difference  2  20603 p  001 by a detection method adjustment the seroprevalence of igg was 157 95 ci 139-175 in all medical records of which males were 196 95 ci 164-228 and females were 119 95 ci 099-139 the assay-adjusted seroprevalence of igg was higher in women than in men and the difference was significant  2  58710 p  001 the differences were significant for the seroprevalence of igg among people who went back to work in different categories of workplace  2  19844 p  001 the differences in seroprevalence for igg positivity or igm positivity among people who went back to work in different urban and rural areas was also significant  2  45110 p  001 calculated as igg andor igm antibody positivity the number of new infections was reduced by 64 8 from march 26 to april 28 2020 based on the census population aged 16-64 years in wuhan in 2017 we estimated that 172340 95 ci 157112 asymptomatic people aged 16-64 years were infected with sars-cov-2 in wuhan between march 25 and april 28 2020 this estimate was 34-times higher than the officially reported 50333 infections on april 28 the seropositivity rate in wuhan indicated that rt-pcr-confirmed patients only represented a small part of the total number of cases seropositivity progressively decreased in the wuhan population from march 26 to april 28 2020 comparable to japan and denmark but well below the level reported in new york iran italy and germany the prevalence of asymptomatic infection was higher in women than in men among people who went back to work in wuhan the low seroprevalence suggests that most of the population remains susceptible to covid-19  the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 covid- 19  which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was reported on december 8 2019 in wuhan hubei province 1 2 the chinese public health clinical and scientific communities promptly responded in timely recognition of the new virus and shared the viral gene sequence to the world 3 4 the world health organization who termed the disease covid-19 in january 2020 2 the pandemic is the third coronavirus outbreak in the last 20 years with severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome by mers-cov 5 as of may 17 2020 covid-19 infections occurred globally at more than 4657000 human cases and resulted in more than 312000 human deaths according to the johns hopkins university 6 the clinical symptoms of sars-cov-2 infection vary from mild to the onset of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome many patients can be asymptomatic greatly increasing the uncertainty of diagnosis 7 a timely and accurate diagnosis of covid-19 is crucial for limiting further spread of the virus particularly in people who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic who can be responsible for community transmissions 8 as wuhan accepted the timely prevention strategies of lockdown and curbing population flow it controlled the spread of the pandemic effectively nonetheless there is still a risk of a second outbreak therefore knowing the situation of sars-cov-2 infection in the general population is necessary this knowledge has a meaning for the control and prevention of covid-19 and epidemiological investigations the determination of postdisease immunity and the use of future vaccine strategies quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-qpcr analysis for sars-cov-2 is the gold standard for covid-19 diagnosis 9 10 it is time-consuming and requires special equipment with skilled laboratory technicians and has the weakness that easily leads to false negatives for sars-cov-2 9 10 11 we know sars-cov-2-specific antibodies appear around 3-10 days after infection with igm appearing first and igg following around 14 days after infection 12 even after the symptoms of infection disappear igg can still show seropositivity 13 therefore sars-cov-2 serological assays are a good supplementary method for nucleic acid detection 14 additionally serological assays allow studying the immune responses to sars-cov-2 in a dynamic qualitative and quantitative manner in addition serological antibody assays can determine the precise rate of infection in an affected area or a certain population estimate the cumulative incidence and infection fatality rate and provide parameters for epidemiological models to assess the possible impact of specific interventions thus guiding public health decision-making furthermore serological assays can be used to elucidate the geographic spread of the virus and identify subgroups of individuals who are more vulnerable to infection last the degree of protection of antibodies against sars-cov-2 infection or reinfection can be determined by serological assays 1516 therefore testing for antibodies specific to sars-cov-2 protein could be an alternative method for rapid laboratory diagnosis with high sensitivity 12 who recommends monitoring changes of seroprevalence over time which is crucial at the beginning of an epidemic to anticipate and plan an adequate public health response 9 at present relatively few domestic and foreign reports exist on the diagnosis of patients with covid-19 using serological tests thus we conducted a retrospective study analyzing 18391 medical all rights reserved no reuse allowed without

was adjusted by age and gender and then for assay sensitivity and specificity which was comparable to the studies in japan and denmark but lower than preliminary findings for iran of 22 new york city of around 14 italy of 10 and germany of 14 24 25 26 27 all these studies indicated that the number of asymptomatic infections was much higher than the number of confirmed cases reported based on pcr

detection of asymptomatic infections data from a detailed surveillance study from the chinese center for disease control and prevention indicates that 80 of confirmed cases were mild and a number of patients can remain asymptomatic with very low symptomatology 28 thus epidemiological studies of asymptomatic infections should receive sufficient attention some studies find an average level of igg

number of residents in each district in wuhan on march 25 and april 28 we estimated an average incidence rate per 100000 people of 298 95 ci 297-299 during this period incidence rates were higher in the jianghan and wuchang districts at 809 95 ci 802-815 and 725 95 ci 720-729 per 100000 people respectively which were the same as our regional distribution analyses attachment 2 our study found significant differences in igg seroprevalence among people going back to work by types of jobs with the highest seroprevalence in volunteer medical examinees who came for tests without a mandate from their job supervisors these self-motivated individuals had close contacts with covid-19 patients and therefore had a higher risk of infection other individuals with high igg seroprevalence were easy to identify due to the nature of their jobs they undertook substantial voluntary work in response to government calls during the covid-19 pandemic to assist in for instance administering in the local residential communities transporting covid-19 patients and screening the general population for epidemic incidence thus they faced a greater chance of contacting infected people during their work and were more likely to be infected even with personal protection this study had a few limitations first this study had selection bias since the analyzed medical records were based on examinees directed by their work units most of the examinees came from governmentowned institutions and agencies instead of private businesses therefore the sample was incompletely randomized and insufficiently representative compromising the assessment accuracy of the prevalence of asymptomatic infections in wuhan second as the examinees were only from the back-to-work population people under age 16 and over age 64 were not covered in analyses therefore we could not estimate covid-19 in these two groups our study provides information to herd immunity investigation to help design targeted strategies

kazuo imai sakiko tabata mayu ikeda sakiko noguchi yutaro kitagawa masaru matuoka kazuyasu miyoshi norihito tarumoto jun sakai toshimitsu ito shigefumi maesaki kaku tamura takuya maeda   the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov2 epidemic which causes the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 was first reported in december 2019 in wuhan china 1 and it has since been declared a pandemic by the world health organization the ongoing outbreak is a global threat to human health quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-qpcr analysis for sars-cov2 is considered the gold standard for diagnosing covid-19 rt-qpcr has been used to analyze specimens from the upper and lower respiratory tracts for clinical diagnosis during outbreaks of other diseases but it has not been performed widely in the clinical setting because it requires special equipment a time-consuming protocol and highly skilled laboratory technicians in addition because rt-qpcr requires samples from the upper and lower respiratory tracts the process of collecting samples and extracting rna increases the risk of exposure to viral droplets therefore an alternative diagnostic test to rt-qpcr is desirable for the clinical management of covid-19 in studies conducted in china chest computed tomography ct scans were widely utilized as a diagnostic tool for covid-19 2 3 4 lung involvement can be detected in patients with covid-19 on a ct scan in advance of the symptoms typical for pneumonia 5 and a positive result on rt-qpcr 67 the common radiological characteristics of covid-19 pneumonia on chest ct have a diagnostic sensitivity of 73 93  and a specificity of 24 100  in distinguishing covid-19 from other forms of viral pneumonia 28 an immunochromatographic ic assay for igm and igg antibodies against the virus is widely accepted as a point-of-care test because it is an easy-to-perform rapid and high-throughput method for diagnosing viral infections recently several commercial ic assays that detect igmigg antibodies against sars-cov2 have become available for use in the clinical setting however their clinical usefulness has yet to be thoroughly evaluated here we describe the clinical performance of an ic assay in comparison with that of chest ct patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 who were referred to the self-defense forces central hospital and saitama medical university hospital in japan from february 11 to march 31 2020 were enrolled in this study all patients were examined by rt-qpcr for sars-cov2 using pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs collected at public health institutes or hospitals in accordance with the nationally recommended method in japan 9 chest ct was performed on the day of admission serum specimens were collected on the day of admission and during hospitalization clinical information was collected from the medical records the ct findings were evaluated by a radiologist to determine the specific features caused by covid-19 2 to evaluate the analytical specificity of the ic assay we used serum samples collected from patients at saitama medical university hospital japan from april to october 2019 before sars-cov2 was first reported in china clinical information was collected from the medical records and all serum samples were stored at 80 c before use in the ic assay asymptomatic cases were defined as patients with no history of clinical signs or symptoms symptomatic cases were defined as patients showing the clinical symptoms of covid-19 fever cough nasal discharge diarrhea malaise dyspnea tachypnea peripheral capillary oxygen saturation 93  and need for oxygen therapy the day of onset was defined as the first day of symptoms caused by covid-19 in the symptomatic patients or the day of the first positive rt-qpcr result for upper respiratory specimens in the asymptomatic patients igmigg antibody tests for sars-cov2 were performed using the one step novel coronavirus covid-19 igmigg antibody test artron burnaby canada according to the manufacturers instructions in brief 10 l serum was added to the sample port of the ic assay and was incubated for 2030 s subsequently 2 drops of sample buffer were added to the same sample port and the results were interpreted after a 1520 min incubation the presence of only the control line indicates a negative result the presence of both the control line and the igm or igg antibody line indicates a positive result for igm or igg antibody respectively the study design and protocol were reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of the japan self-defense forces central hospital approval no 01-011 and saitama medical university hospital approval nos 19136 and 20001 igm and igg antibodies for sars-cov2 could be detected by the ic assay in total 139 serum samples were collected from 112 patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 and were used as positive controls for the ic assay in this study the medium period from onset to serum collection was 6 days interquartile range iqr 313 days the results of the ic assay for serum specimens are shown in table 1
 the serum samples were subdivided into three groups according to sample collection times within 1 week n  90 12 weeks n  25 and 2 weeks after onset n  24 igm antibody was detected in 60 432  of the 139 serum samples collected and igg antibody was detected in 20 144  specimens all igg antibody-positive samples were also positive for igm antibody in the ic assay thus the sensitivity of the ic assay was calculated to be 432  for all serum specimens igm antibody was detected in 278  2590 of specimens collected within 1 week of onset 480  1225 collected within 12 weeks and 958  2324 collected 2 weeks after onset the corresponding detection rates for igg antibody were 33  390 specimens 80  225 specimens and 625  1525 specimens in ic assays of the 48 non-covid-19 serum specimens collected before the emergence of sars-cov2 infection 1 specimen from a patient with sjogrens syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis showed a false-positive result for igm antibody thus the specificity of the ic assay was calculated to be 980  clinical background of the 112 patients hospitalized due to covid-19 in this study are shown in table 2
 thirty-eight 339  patients who had no covid-19 symptoms were classified as asymptomatic and the remaining 74 661  were classified as symptomatic briefly patients were aged 2093 years median 67 years iqr 4574 years and 64 571  were men all asymptomatic patients were diagnosed with covid-19 by rt-qpcr while under quarantine in japan of the 38 asymptomatic patients median time from the first rt-qpcrpositive day to admission was 5 days iqr 36 days of the 74 symptomatic patients median time from onset to admission was 5 days iqr 27 days 
table 3
shows the results of the ic assay and chest ct for the patients on admission when using serum samples taken from the 38 asymptomatic patients igm antibody was detected in 15 395  patients on admission and none of the patients were positive for igg antibody chest ct showed abnormal lung findings consistent with the radiographic features of covid-19 in 22 579  asymptomatic patients on admission when the combination of ic assay and chest ct findings was used for diagnosis in the asymptomatic patients the sensitivity was 684  of the 74 symptomatic patients igm antibody was detected in 22 297  patients and igg antibody in 7 95  patients all igg antibody-positive patients were also positive for igm antibody the sensitivity of the ic assay was 170  953 within 1 week 333  412 within 12 weeks and 1000  99 within 2 weeks after onset of the 74 symptomatic patients chest ct detected the radiographical patterns of covid-19 in 55 743  patients on admission the corresponding sensitivity of chest ct was 733  3953 patients 667  812 and 889  89 when the combination of ic assay and chest ct was used for diagnosis in symptomatic covid-19 patients the corresponding sensitivity was 811  4353 patients 750  912 and 100  99 here we presented the analytical results of a commercial ic assay and findings of chest ct scans for patients with covid-19 although the ic assay showed high sensitivity for samples collected 2 weeks after symptom onset it was less sensitive for patients who developed symptomatic covid-19 within 1 week chest ct showed higher sensitivity than the ic assay for the diagnosis of covid-19 but it did not show the specific radiological features of covid-19 in 183  of symptomatic patients nevertheless the combination of ic assay and chest ct slightly increased the diagnostic sensitivity for covid-19 based on previous enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa results for igm and igg antibodies only 383  of patients were positive for igm antibody within the first week after onset the detection of igm and igg antibodies increased rapidly from day 15 after onset igm  943  and igg  798  10 our ic assay results support these previous findings that seroconversion mainly occurred 2 weeks after onset 10 the clinical usefulness of serological tests for covid-19 remains controversial due to the time lag between the onset of symptoms and the appearance of igm and igg antibodies in serum in china and the united states the sensitivity and specificity of serological tests for samples initially collected from hospitalized patients were 383 854  and 100  10 11 12 for elisa and 184 887  and 906 917  for ic assay 1314 respectively this contradiction probably reflects differences in the timing of sampling because the clinical setting varies in each country in the clinical setting patients are usually diagnosed with covid-19 within 2 weeks because they develop dyspnea and pneumonia at a median of 8 days iqr 50130 days after symptom onset 1 in this study the median time from onset to hospitalization was 5 days iqr 27 days which is shorter than in previous studies median 715 days 10 11 12 13 14 additionally only 297  of patients were diagnosed using ic assay alone supporting the cassaniti et als conclusion that the sensitivity of ic assays remains insufficient for their use as a clinical diagnostic tool 14 therefore unfortunately the ic assay alone cannot replace rt-qpcr as an acute diagnostic protocol for covid-19 at least in the clinical setting in japan however the ic assay can be used for epidemiological studies of the seroprevalence of igm and igg antibodies against sars-cov2 previous studies have shown that the sensitivity of ct among symptomatic patients was high 73 97  although specificity differed widely 24 100  781516 the clinical performance of ct may vary according to differences in patient populations disease severity and accessibility to chest ct scans in each country in the present study chest ct showed higher sensitivity than the ic assay but sensitivity was only 733  among the symptomatic patients who tested positive for sars-cov2 according to rt-qpcr bernheim et al reported that the sensitivity of chest ct was low 44  in the acute phase 02 days after onset but high 91  in the intermediate phase 35 days 16 the low sensitivity of chest ct may reflect the short period of time between symptom onset to hospitalization in the symptomatic patients examined in this study the diagnostic sensitivity was improved by combining the ic assay and chest ct 813  in the present study we did not evaluate the specificity of chest ct but taking the high specificity of the ic assay into consideration combining the ic assay and chest ct was considered to improve the diagnostic specificity as well when rt-qpcr is not available or practical the combination may be useful for diagnosing covid-19 the identification of asymptomatic patients with covid-19 is important to prevent nosocomial infection the average incubation period of covid-19 is 52 days 17 but ranges from 0 to 24 days 15 it has also been reported that patients hospitalized with other diseases who did not show respiratory symptoms developed symptomatic covid-19 and they spread sars-cov2 to other patients and medical workers 18 also the transmission of sars-cov2 from patients without respiratory symptoms has been reported in several countries 19 20 21 in the present study chest ct showed higher sensitivity than the ic assay 579  vs 395  respectively but it is not practical to perform chest ct for all hospitalized patients because of radiation exposure risk and limited medical resources 22 although the ic assay alone may not be useful as a screening test for asymptomatic covid-19 due to its low sensitivity it may contribute to the prevention of nosocomial infection a major limitation of this study was the low number of patients in addition only one commercial ic kit was evaluated the commercial ic assay verified to have the best performance in the clinical setting should be chosen for further studies multicenter multi-national prospective studies are warranted to determine the usefulness of ic assays and chest ct for diagnosing covid-19 the sensitivity of the ic assay was low during the early phase in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients therefore ic assay alone is not recommended for initial diagnostic testing for covid-19 when rt-qpcr cannot be used the combination of chest ct and ic assay may be useful for diagnosing covid-19 this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the

displays a summary of all detections from the 200 asymptomatic hcps during the summer and summer months of the 100 hcps tested during the winter months 47 were positive for at least 1 bacterial or viral organism thirty-four 723 of the 47 subjects were detected with at least 1 bacterial pathogen 11 234 tested positive for at least 1 virus and 2 43 were codetected with a viral and bacterial agent of the 34 subjects that tested positive for at least 1 bacterium the most prevalent species included 19 559 detections for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa 10 294 detections for moraxella catarrhalis and 6 176 positive results for methicillin-susceptible s aureus in 10 909 of the 11 subjects that tested positive for a single virus human coronavirus hcov was detected during the summer 41 of the 100 hcps were positive for at least 1 pathogen thirty-seven 902 of the 41 subjects were positive for at least 1 bacterium and 4 98 had a viral detection the predominant bacterial species detected in the 37 positive hcps included 19 514 cases of mrsa 11 297 incidences of s aureus and 8 216 occurrences of klebsiella pneumoniae the 4 viral species identified in the hcps included 2 500 detections for coxsackievirus-echovirus 1 250 detection for influenza a h1n1-2009 and 1 250 detection for rhinovirus 
figure 2
displays a summary of the respiratory pathogen detection percentage partitioned by profession and season in the winter residents represented the subset of hcps with the largest frequency of colonization because 26 605 of the 43 were positive for at least 1 bacterial or nonbacterial pathogen however the highest proportion of viruses was seen in nurses because 7 212 of the 33 tested were detected with coronavirus in the summer as in winter residents had the highest frequency of detection because 14 438 of the 32 tested were positive for at least 1 pathogen nurses exhibited a slightly lower level of colonization because 19 463 of the 41 had at least 1 pathogen detection 
figure 3
characterizes all of the hcps in both seasons that had a codetection for 2 genetic targets a larger number of subjects exhibited codetections during the winter because 12 255 of the 47 subjects were detected with 2 genetic targets of the 19 positive detections for mrsa 4 211 were positive for the panton-valentine leukocidin pvl cytotoxin gene which represented the highest frequency of simultaneously detected genetic targets eight 308 of the 26 residents had 1 detection in the summer 1 resident had 3 bacterial detections whereas no hcps in the winter exhibited 2 detections 
supplemental figures s1 and s2 display the detection percentage aggregated by sex and season and age groups and season respectively men had a marginally higher frequency of detection because 16 516 of 31 in the winter and 19 528 of 36 in the summer had at least 1 pathogen detection in the winter the 30-40 years age bracket had the highest percentage of detection because 16 552 of the 29 hcps tested were positive for at least 1 bacterium or virus in the summer 19 528 of 36 subjects in the 20-30 years age bracket had the largest percentage of pathogen detection 
figure 2 and supplemental figures s1 and s2 present data as a percentage of positive detection out of total tests given to a specific profession sex or age during each season supplemental tables s1-s3 display the number of positive detections and number of tests given during the winter hcov was detected in 11 of the 100 asymptomatic hcps one study reported results comparable with the 11 hcov detection frequency found in hcps at huntsville hospital6 ho et al screened 217 frontline hcps for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov during the 2003 outbreak in taiwan and found that 25 115 were colonized with sars-cov6 the nosocomial spread of sars-cov in large hospitals was a major epidemic feature during early stages of the outbreak but this problem was resolved after hospitals isolated all symptomatic patients and asymptomatic hcps detected with sars-cov7 all 11 detections for hcov at huntsville hospital also came from frontline asymptomatic hcps predominantly nurses observations from this study and the ho et al study suggest that coronavirus could possibly be spread from infected patients to frontline hcps through close contact or via contaminated droplets but further studies are needed to substantiate this hypothesis 
m catarrhalis exhibited seasonal variation because 11 hcps tested in the winter were positive but all subjects were negative in the summer the presence of m catarrhalis was unexpected because colonization usually only occurs in children and only 3 of healthy adults are colonized8 the high winter detection frequency of m catarrhalis observed could be a result of the temperature-dependent characteristics of the organism at lower temperatures the speed of transcription and abundance of mrna transcripts increases m catarrhalis grows and divides at a more rapid rate and the organisms pathogenic behavior has a higher probability of being activated9 10
m catarrhalis can live commensally for extended periods therefore the incubation time of this organism is not well defined however m catarrhalis can become pathogenic in subjects with compromised immune systems or in subjects that have experienced nasopharyngeal stress such as patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease11 as a result it may be valuable to determine which hcps are colonized with m catarrhalis and determine whether there is a correlation with infection rates in at-risk patients12
 
s aureus and mrsa were frequently detected in both winter and summer the high prevalence of healthy subjects colonized with s aureus and mrsa has been well described13 commonly s aureus and mrsa act as commensals of the upper respiratory tract but if a patient is immunocompromised a potentially fatal infection can develop as a result many hospitals implement s aureus and mrsa infection reduction protocols and use active surveillance programs to decolonize patients before admission or surgery14
s aureus and mrsa also attack the lower respiratory tract where organisms are often parasitic and cause bacterial pneumonia15 in this study 4 hcps in the winter and 1 hcp in the summer were colonized by pvl-positive mrsa pvl is a potent cytotoxin produced by s aureus that causes necrotizing pneumonia with a high mortality rate16 many hospitals have already implemented decolonization procedures for patients colonized with s aureus and mrsa but future studies could support the decolonization of asymptomatic hcps 
k pneumoniae was the only organism that demonstrated a substantially higher frequency of colonization in the summer summer detection was anticipated because the prevalence of k pneumoniae infections especially bloodstream infections increases during the summer17 18 the seasonal variation in k pneumoniae colonization is not well understood it has been reported that higher rates of k pneumoniae colonization are primarily related to the use of antibiotics here only 1 143 of the 7 hcps that were colonized with k pneumoniae recently received antibiotics19
k pneumoniae can be easily and rapidly transmitted to immunocompromised patients from the hands of contaminated hcps5 similar to pvl-positive s aureus and mrsa k pneumoniae can also infect to the lower respiratory tract causing abnormalities such as bulging interlobar fissures cavitary abscesses and necrotizing pneumonia20 21 as a result detecting and decolonizing the carriers of k pneumoniae could have a positive impact on reducing high-risk transmission and hospital-acquired infections during the summer particularly in patients with comorbidities there are only a small number of studies reporting the detection frequency of viruses particularly in asymptomatic adults which makes it difficult to compare our results with other findings five different viruses including adenovirus coronavirus rhinovirus coxsackievirus-echovirus and pandemic influenza a h1n1-09 were detected at least once in either or both seasons there are few studies that investigate the effects of viral colonization or coinfections in the upper respiratory tract previous reports show that the prevalence of viral pathogens may increase bacterial colonization and risk of infection in the nasopharynx22 in addition 1 study proposed a colonization-competition model for rna viruses and predicted that low-virulence strains initially colonize human cells and then competitive high-virulence strains prime the nasopharynx for infection23 multiplex polymerase chain reaction technology can help add to these models and better define the unknown mechanisms of colonization and infection of viral pathogens one property of tem-pcr is that it amplifies dna or rna of both viable and nonviable organisms presumably many of the hcps in this study had respiratory diseases long before this study and could be conveying nucleic acid remnants that were detected by tem-pcr the 4-week clearance period as previously described in the methods section was intended to reduce the likelihood of this possible false detection however the half-life of nucleic acid fragments in this setting is not known it is almost certain that rna remnants degrade more quickly than dna24 in the winter a larger proportion of hcps had prior respiratory symptoms which may have been responsible for the higher frequency of pathogens detected in this season further testing methods such as culture would need to be conducted to discriminate between nucleic acid remnants and viable microorganisms it is also possible that the high sensitivity of multiplex polymerase chain reaction detected recent invader cells that would later cause disease in the hcp however for the purposes of this study we do not discriminate between long-standing colonies and recent invader cells because both scenarios can plausibly spread pathogens to at-risk patients this study examined a moderately sized sample and the proportions of professions sexes and ages varied during each season in addition medical students physicians and residents worked in diverse sections of the hospital but nurses only worked in either the intensive care unit or the general population a larger proportion of nurses tested during both seasons worked in the intensive care unit 26 788 in the winter 29 617 in the summer which could have been the reason for moderately high pathogen detection frequency in this subset information was unavailable to determine the proportion of time each hcp treated patients while wearing a mask not wearing masks would increase the likelihood of transmission from patient to hcp and vice versa even though this study focuses on hcp colonization the identification and management of all possible pathogen reservoirs such as health care surfaces equipment and colonized visitors are also important for preventing the spread of infection in a clinical setting5
 nevertheless the utilization of a sensitive and specific multiplexing nucleic acid assay is valuable because the assay detects multiple viral and bacterial pathogens simultaneously in asymptomatic subjects colonization of viral pathogens needs substantially greater understanding and defining the unknown colonization and infection potential of these upper respiratory organisms is important this preliminary observational study explores the prevalence of colonization of various pathogens at 2 different points in the year and if validated with larger follow-up studies this information could be ultimately relevant in the clinic determining correlations between levels of hcp colonization and at-risk patient infection rates could assist in defining novel transmission pathways in turn hospital protocols could be altered so that colonized hcps and at-risk patient interactions could be managed threat of transmission could be minimized and infection control protocols could be optimized  a review of asymptomatic and subclinical middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections rebecca grant mamunur malik rahman amgad elkholy maria van kerkhove d   
hcwhealth-care workermers-covmiddle east respiratory syndrome coronaviruspcrpolymerase chain reactionwhoworld health organization
 since 2012 the epidemiology of cases of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov infection reported to the world health organization who has been characterized largely by recurrent zoonotic spillover from the known animal reservoirdromedary camelsand human-to-human transmission in health-care settings 1 outbreaks in health-care settings on occasion have resulted in large outbreaks 29 of the 2260 cases including 803 deaths reported to who 83 of cases have been reported in the kingdom of saudi arabia 10 the clinical presentation of mers-cov infection ranges from asymptomatic to severe respiratory illness with approximately 355 of cases resulting in death 1 the role of asymptomatic or subclinical infections in human-to-human transmission of mers-cov is not well understood but there is evidence that laboratory-confirmed mers-cov infection in patients who are reported as asymptomatic may be transmitted to other individuals 11 for many novel infectious pathogens surveillance initially focuses on individuals with disease who seek care at health-care facilities which undoubtedly underestimates the true prevalence of infection because it will not account for mild or asymptomatic infections not requiring medical care detailed outbreak investigations often include laboratory testing of close contacts and of health-care workers hcws regardless of symptoms and specialized serological investigations will include individuals thought to be at higher risk of infection such as hcws or those with occupational exposure to animal reservoirs estimates of the true prevalence of infection of high-risk pathogens are important to understand the populations required for vaccine candidates or specific therapeutic treatments as and when they become available in addition the role of subclinical or asymptomatic infection is critical in understanding chains of transmission missed by surveillance systems for mers-cov asymptomatic infection has been reported to who but the possibility of transmission prior to symptom onset is critical for recommending effective infection prevention and control measures and for reducing secondary mers-cov transmission the role of asymptomatic infections in transmission of other respiratory viruses has been investigated previously highly pathogenic avian influenza h5n1 rna for example has been detected by polymerase chain reaction pcr from asymptomatic family contacts of ill patients suggesting the possibility for onward transmission even in the absence of symptoms 1215 for severe acute respiratory syndrome cov limited transmission to close contacts before symptom onset or hospitalization has been found in transmission-risk studies outside health-care settings whereas human-to-human transmission within health-care settings was higher likely due to higher viral load in hospitalized patients and more frequent exposure to the virus among hcws 1618 here we have reviewed available evidence of the extent of subclinical and asymptomatic infection of mers-cov stratified by evaluating studies in which infection within and outside of health-care settings has been measured and the potential role of onward human-to-human transmission from asymptomatic cases we conducted a literature search in pubmed and embase databases for observational epidemiologic studies of laboratory-confirmed mers-cov infection using the following search terms mers-cov or mers and seroprevalence or prevalence or serological or infection or asymptomatic additional studies were identified through consultation with the who mers technical network and in the bibliography of a related recently published review 19 publications in english dated before november 15 2019 were considered with no additional restrictions on year of publication we assessed the titles and abstracts of identified studies to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the study we stratified our analyses to evaluate subclinical andor asymptomatic infection identified inside and outside health-care facilities for descriptive analysis of who case-based data we used the ggplot2 in r version 3420 r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria for mers-cov infections studied outside health-care settings we included studies in which evidence of mers-cov infection was reported using molecular andor serological methods in either individuals with occupational exposure to dromedary camels familial occupational or social contacts of patients with confirmed mers outside of health-care settings the general population or through national mers surveillance records when published eligible studies included reporting of the number of individuals tested and the number with molecular or serological evidence of mers-cov infection to evaluate mers-cov infections studied within health-care settings we included studies in which the authors reported evidence of mers-cov infection using molecular andor serological methods among hcw and among non-hcw contacts eg family contacts of confirmed mers cases treated in health care settings for each eligible study we extracted information on the year of publication the year biological samples were collected the country in which the study was conducted the number of individuals tested characteristics of the individuals tested and the total number of confirmed mers-cov infections by molecular or serological assay asymptomatic mers-cov infection was considered a laboratory-confirmed infection with no reported symptoms at the time of sampling in addition we evaluated the symptomatic profile and place of reporting among laboratory-confirmed mers-cov infections reported to who from september 2012 to november 27 2018 within who databases cases are classified as primary cases if they were reported as such by the reporting member state if direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels or dromedary products was reported in the case andor the exposures were under investigation without known contact with a patient with probable or confirmed mers cases were classified as secondary cases due to human-to-human transmission if the patient reported recent direct contact with a patient known to have mers-cov infection andor were identified as a household occupational or hcw contact of a patient known to have mers-cov infection we found 4 studies that documented the duration of viral shedding from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals 5558 among asymptomatic pcr-positive mers-cov infections positive reverse transcriptase rt-pcr results were reported from the day of initial testing for as long as 2842 days 5558 we found 1 study in which molecular and serological evidence of possible secondary transmission from asymptomatic individuals was reported 11 the study was conducted as part of an investigation of 12 household contacts in whom upper respiratory tract samples from 7 were pcr positive and an additional 5 samples were seropositive using recombinant immunofluorescence or plaque reduction neutralization test 11 eleven of these 12 individuals reported no symptoms at the time of sampling this information combined with epidemiologic data indicated these people could have been involved in asymptomatic transmission within households we found 9 studies that described molecular evidence of mers-cov infection among asymptomatic individuals in health-care settings 7 32 42 43 45 46 50 51 53 infectivity of an asymptomatic hcw infected with mers-cov was investigated in 1 study but no evidence was found of secondary transmission to 82 hcws with contact to the hcw with mers-cov infection 44 in this review we found 43 studies in which molecular andor serological evidence of mers-cov infection was reported outside of health-care settings the evidence of mers-cov infection has largely been focused on individuals with occupational exposure to dromedaries the results to date are heterogenous and although attempts have been made to evaluate mers-cov genetic diversity 59 60 the differences in seroprevalence results to date likely reflect differences in the selection and characteristics of dromedary herds and humans tested the available evidence of the mers-cov epidemiologic and genetic characteristics does not suggest there are differences in the viruss ability to infect humans evidence supports that individuals with occupational exposure to dromedaries have higher rates of seroprevalence compared with household contacts of patients with confirmed mers-cov infection likely reflecting more intense unprotected exposures to mers-cov through dromedary secretions 61 that these individuals have subclinical infection and do not develop disease is likely because those with occupational exposure tend to be younger and healthier without underlying high-risk conditions such as hypertension diabetes and renal failure variations in the seroprevalence rates by study are also likely due to variations in methodologies including the timing of sample collection serologic assays used and interpretation of assay results although the majority of human mers-cov infections have been reported to who from countries in the arabian peninsula particularly kingdom of saudi arabia there is increasing evidence of infection in dromedary camels in herds throughout africa and south asia 62 additional serological and molecular epidemiology studies at the dromedary-human interface using a standardized approach and consistent methodology in the arabian peninsula and in africa and south asia are needed to further understand this observed heterogeneitythat is whether the observed differences in evidence of infection outside health-care settings may be attributable to genetic variation of the virus across different geographic regions andor to factors and behaviors in human populations in these regions which may change the susceptibility to infection who is currently supporting studies underway in several countries in the middle east africa and south asia in which the extent of infection in occupationally exposed persons is being evaluated  the results of such studies can contribute to better understanding the geographic reach of mers-cov in dromedaries and humans within health-care settings the detection of asymptomatic pcr-positive infection has been reported to who from affected member states and also documented in 10 published studies although onward transmission was not investigated in those studies the researchers did capture evidence of rna shedding which suggests human-to-human transmission is possible from individuals with no signs or symptoms of infection this is supported by evidence documenting duration of viral shedding beyond 3 weeks in patients with subclinical mers-cov infection 5558 at the same time the evidence for acute asymptomatic mers-cov infection described in this review does not represent the full extent of subclinical infection asymptomatic contacts clear the virus more quickly than do symptomatic patients 58 and antibody titers in the former are likely to be lower if they seroconvert at all than in infected patients exhibiting symptoms 63 timely and repeated biological specimen collection is needed to capture viral shedding and antibody kinetics of symptomatic and asymptomatic contacts 11 this can be achieved if all high-risk contacts of patients with confirmed mers-cov infection are identified during an outbreak and then tested using molecular and serologic laboratory assays regardless of whether the individual exhibits symptoms in outbreak settings without the inclusion of testing of all contacts the identification of chains of transmission may be incomplete indeed the latest who surveillance guidelines recommend that all contacts of patients with laboratory-confirmed mers outside of health care facilities should be placed under active surveillance for 14 days after the last exposure to the confirmed case and that any contacts with symptoms of respiratory illness should be tested for mers-cov infection 64 if feasible we recommend that follow-up should include molecular testing regardless of the development of symptoms in addition studies conducted of high-risk workers which have typically only included serologic testing should also include molecular testing of upper respiratory samples in an attempt to capture viral carriage despite these limitations in our current knowledge the findings of our review reinforce the evidence that hcws are more likely to be at risk of mers-cov infection due to close unprotected contact with patients with mers patients prior to their diagnosis particularly when aerosolizing procedures are performed because hcws tend to be younger and healthier than patients in whom severe mers develops hcws have fewer symptoms if any and present a silent risk of human-to-human transmission to others among hcw contacts detailed studies of viral shedding and immune response of asymptomatic pcr-positive mers-cov infections are urgently needed and should be conducted when outbreaks occur and enhanced surveillance is put in place by government and hospital officials surveillance and testing for mers-cov have improved substantially since the virus was first discovered in 2012 in affected countries visual respiratory triage systems before a patient enters the emergency department have been introduced some emergency departments in affected countries have been restructured for enhanced triage of patients with respiratory symptoms trainings specific to infection prevention and control of respiratory pathogens have been introduced and reintroduced in high-risk areas and hospitals with high turnover of hcws and audits of hospitals for compliance to specific infection prevention and control measures are regularly performed 6 in addition the systematic testing of hcws extending beyond nurses and doctors to include reception staff cleaners technicians and so forth regardless of the development of symptoms as required by the latest infection prevention and control guidelines for hcws by who and kingdom of saudi arabia for example has detected subclinical and asymptomatic infections that likely would have gone undetected in past outbreaks asymptomatic infections may have played a role in extensive secondary transmission in health-care settings before the latest guidelines were introduced and the impact of such policies may be reflected in the lower peaks on the global mers-cov epidemic curve since 2016 without this level of contact follow-up in community settings the extent of asymptomatic infections in the community will remain unknown screening of hcws with exposure to patients infected with mers-cov may be feasible for preventing human-to-human transmission in health-care settings and appears to be effective in kingdom of saudi arabia and other affected countries in which this infection prevention and control measure has been introduced screening of non-hcw contacts in health-care settings should also be encouraged outside health-care settings the feasibility of screening may be reduced particularly given the difficulty in detecting asymptomatic infections therefore transmission of mers-cov outside health-care settings should be expected to continue until zoonotic spillover from dromedaries can be interrupted  risk estimation of the sars-cov-2 acute respiratory disease outbreak outside china soyoung kim sunhwa choi youngsuk ko moran ki eunok jung   a novel coronavirus  the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2  emerged in wuhan hubei province china in late december 2019 on january 30 2020 the world health organization who declared a public health emergency of international concern pheic 1 and on january 31 2020 the number of coronavirus disease covid-19 cases exceeded that of sars with a reported 8096 people infected worldwide 2 as of february 6 2020 there were 28018 confirmed cases including 563 deaths of covid-19 reported in china moreover 325 confirmed cases of sars-cov-2 infection have been reported from outside china across 27 countries including japan thailand singapore south korea hong kong australia germany the united states taiwan macau and vietnam 3 the who confirmed the possibility of human-to-human transmission therefore the epidemiological link such as close contact tracing of exportedimported covid-19 patients is among the most important features for the prevention and control of the covid-19 outbreak in most of the developed countries such as the united states europe japan and south korea there is a well-established infectious disease prevention and quarantine policy even in the early stages of disease spread however the international travels of sars-cov-2-infected patients have threatened public health in other countries furthermore it is worthwhile to measure the potential risk of sars-cov-2 transmission outside china when the quarantining of symptomatic infected individuals is delayed in this study we used stochastic simulations to estimate the expected number of covid-19 patients and epidemic duration in various scenarios of quarantine and reduction in the transmission rate the potential size of the epidemic outside of china especially in developed countries with a well-established public health infrastructure is estimated by assuming similar transmission probabilities in the early disease stages as that in hubei province as well as by considering the potential impact of various social and personal nonpharmaceutical interventions data were obtained from the 2019-ncov global cases by the johns hopkins center for systems science and engineering 4 and novel coronavirus 2019-ncov situation reports issued by the who 5 last retrieved on february 7 2020 all reported data were from confirmed covid-19 cases we constructed a dynamic model of sars-cov-2 transmission on the basis of a deterministic compartment model the population was classified into six classes susceptible s exposed e symptomatic infectious i asymptomatic infectious a quarantined q and removed individuals r susceptible individuals are exposed to the sars-cov-2 on close contact with infectious individuals or respiratory droplets that are generated when a patient coughs 6 after the incubation period the exposed individuals develop either symptomatic or asymptomatic infections asymptomatic individuals recover after the infectious period however symptomatic individuals who are infected are quarantined and patients who are quarantined will recover or die figure 1 describes a schematic diagram of the transmission dynamics of sars-cov-2
 the transmission dynamics of sars-cov-2 acute respiratory disease are described by six ordinary differential equations odes as follows

				begindocument mathbfmathcalr enddocumentr is less than 1 the number of cases continues to decrease and the disease will die out using this property we can identify an intervention strategy which can reduce the reproductive number to less than 1 the transmission rate was estimated from the number of cases that was confirmed per day in hubei province from january 11 to february 6 2020 and then best-fitted to the model by using the least squares method all confirmed cases were assumed to be quarantined and incapable of spreading the disease our model was programmed in matlab 2018b the least squares fitting optimization tool lsqcurvefit was used to estimate the best-fitted transmission rate for uncertainty analysis the transmission rate was estimated by using the data generated from the poisson distributions with the mean equal to the observed data mean standard deviation and 95 confidence intervals ci were calculated from 1000 sample datasets in addition we conducted a sensitivity analysis by varying the parameters over a range of possible values to establish which of the parameters had the greatest effect on the reproductive number stochastic simulation was implemented to estimate the risk of an covid-19 outbreak in a country outside china due to the arrival of an exposed individual according to the various scenarios of transmission reduction and the duration from symptom onset to quarantine we calculated the average number of local transmission cases the probability of an outbreak and the epidemic duration the gillespie algorithm which is an affordable method to observe individual random events was adapted as the stochastic simulation method 10 table 2 lists the possible individual level events in stochastic simulation and their propensities which emerge from the mathematical model in the gillespie algorithm the probability of the event occurrence is proportional to its propensity whereas the time interval between a prior and posterior event is proportional to the sum of every propensity in the prior event
 the rate of transmission in hubei province is estimated to be 08238 95 ci 0809508382 and the reproductive number was calculated as 41192 95 ci 4047341912 figure 2 presents the data-fitted results from december 29 2019 to february 6 2020 the red circles indicate the daily reported data of confirmed cases in hubei province and the black curve represents the best-fitted model curve our model initially comprised four symptomatic infectious individuals 7 furthermore confirmed cases reported from january 11 2020 were used for data-fitting
 the covid-19 outbreak in wuhan has spread in china as well as to other countries the risk of outbreak is investigated as the entry of an exposed individual to a country outside of china we assumed there would be a lower rate of transmission and shorter duration from symptom onset to quarantine outside china for the purpose of this research we considered ten reductions in transmission from 0 to 90 at 10 intervals and three durations from symptom onset to quarantine 24 36 and 48 h we investigated 30 different scenarios based on changes in the quarantine rate and transmission reduction among those 30 scenarios 9 selected scenarios are listed in table 1 including the number of individuals with local transmissions the epidemic duration the maximum prevalence and the probability of the estimated total cases from 2000 realizations table 3 lists the results for three reductions in transmission 0 30 and 60 we defined prevalence as the total number of exposed infectious quarantined hosts and the epidemic duration as the interval from symptom onset of the index case to quarantine onset of the last case every result except for probabilities is presented as the mean lower bound 25th percentile and upper bound 975th percentile values of the trials respectively the results from the simulation of other cases of reduction in the rate of transmission are provided in the supplementary table
 we found a high deviation in the number of local transmission cases of infection maximum prevalence among the trials as the upper bound was approximately more than five times larger than the mean in every scenario figure 3 depicts the probability  of a certain number of local transmission cases being exceeded in relation to the reduction in the rate of transmission and duration from symptom onset to quarantine when quarantine can be instituted within 24 h the probability that the number of local transmission cases exceed 40 is 32 scenario with a 0 reduction in the rate of transmission
 we aimed to present an initial perception of the transmission dynamics of sars-cov-2 in hubei province china and to enable a quantification of the potential risk of sars-cov-2 transmission outside china especially when an infected patient from china arrives in developed countries we used confirmed data from the clusters of covid-19 cases that occurred from january 11 to february 6 2020 in hubei province china many researchers have warned the possibility of outbreak outside of china thompson calculated the potential transmission when the patients arrived in other countries 11 the risk of outbreak according to the imported cases the connectivity of the country with china and the efficacy of control measures is estimated 12 in addition studies have been conducted on the impact of international travel and border control measures on the spread outside china global spread 13 14 in this study we used mathematical modeling and stochastic simulation to estimate the reproductive number and analyze interventional measures the reproductive number for sars-cov-2 transmission dynamics is estimated approximately as 4 which is significantly higher compared to that of the previous sars epidemic in china 15 this implies that human-to-human transmission is significant in hubei province unless additional interventional strategies are implemented there will be a significant increase in the daily incidence of new cases however several control policies are being implemented in china such as public education on disease prevention and environmental hygiene it is possible that the transmission rate and reproductive number have been decreased such that the number of new cases will be less than the number in the model prediction the reproductive number derived in this work facilitates the evaluation of control measures such as quarantine or transmission-intervention strategy to reduce the reproductive number to less than 1 with a single intervention measure we need to either reduce the rate of transmission by more than 7572 or shorten the duration from infection to quarantine to less than 291 h from january 31 2020 onward a real-time confirmatory procedure has been instituted whereby the time to laboratory confirmation can be reduced to 6 h 16 moreover a rapid diagnosis test kit has been provisionally approved and this new diagnostic method has become available since february 7 2020 which could possibly enable faster diagnosis and quarantine 17 if two strategies are implemented simultaneously the requirement for each intervention strategy will be reduced when compared to the requirement for a single-intervention strategy for example if the rate of transmission is reduced by 10 the quarantine from symptom onset needs to be implemented within 3237 h in this study we assumed that the probability of transmission from exposed individuals was zero because of insufficient epidemiological evidence that could be applied in the model however if we assume that exposed individuals have a 20 rate of transmission compared to symptomatic individuals the reproductive number would be reduced to 34796 furthermore our model assumes that quarantined individuals would not transmit the disease ignoring this assumption would result in a higher reproductive number this study was conducted with an aim to understand the requirements of sufficient preparedness to counter the spread of sars-cov-2 infection outside china thus we assumed the highest rate of transmission moreover a stochastic simulation was conducted to measure the probability of an outbreak and its size when a person with infection exposure from china enters another country if a symptomatic infectious individual is quarantined within 24 h of symptom onset we can expect four cases of local transmission to occur the epidemic duration would be approximately 17 days under the same rate of transmission as in hubei province therefore the number of individuals with local transmission would be significantly decreased if patients are isolated within 24 h of symptom onset the who has warned of the possibility of global spread to other countries and public health authorities in these countries are expected to develop preparedness strategies such as thorough campaigns for enhancing personal hygiene screening the national borders and quarantine of individuals with suspected infection or exposure to respond to disease spread in south korea the first case of covid-19 was reported on january 20 2020 and a total of 24 confirmed cases who are mostly individuals who returned from the chinese city of wuhan have been reported as of february 7 2020 among these cases nine were identified as local transmissions human-to-human transmission arising from contact with patients from china or with a secondary infection-transmitted person in south korea 18 given that the average duration from symptom onset to quarantine is approximately 24 h in south korea the rate of transmission is considered to be approximately 50 lower than that in hubei province in the united states one case of local transmission has been identified from among 11 confirmed cases with the sars-cov-2 infection 19 the local transmission of infected case per import case is 111 and this implies that the rate of transmission is reduced by approximately 90 compared to that in the hubei province if a patient can be quarantined within 24 h after symptom onset results from our risk estimation of the covid-19 outbreak outside china accentuate the importance of quarantine control such as through specific guidelines with regard to visitors who have traveled from china the results of our stochastic simulation emphasize that rapid quarantine before the rate of community transmission increases is crucial to prevent a covid-19 outbreak outside of china even if the rate of transmission is assumed to be similar to that in hubei province the probability of no local transmission is approximately 549 with the implementation of a 24-h quarantine strategy in addition there is only a 7 chance of seeing more than 20 cases of local transmission thus quarantine is implicated as a significantly important measure to minimize community transmission this study has some limitations first our model was developed with limited confirmed data from the hubei province of china given that the outbreak has not ended the model dynamics could change as new confirmed cases are added second more detailed patient information particularly the dates of symptom onset and exposure were unavailable at the time of analysis third this study was conducted on the basis of data from confirmed covid-19 patients with symptomatic onset who underwent testing however some cases of asymptomatic infection have been identified 20 21 and given the availability of options for assessment at present it is difficult to explicitly estimate the possibility of transmission or the number of asymptomatic infections based on the observational empirical data nonetheless even a model with limited data such as the one in this study can allow an early assessment of the transmission dynamics of the sars-cov-2 epidemic in the hubei province china this study describes an outbreak of the sars-cov-2 that originated in the hubei province and estimates the reproductive number the epidemic has spread significantly due to failures in early diagnosis and rapid quarantine in view of the difficulty in controlling this outbreak our results lead us to strongly recommend that an infected person be quarantined as soon as possible after diagnosis to reduce the possibility of sars-cov-2 transmission outside china  coronavirus disease-2019 is fever an adequate screening for the returning travelers george bwire m linda paulo s   to the editor since the outbreak of coronavirus on december 31 2019 in wuhan hubei province peoples republic of china the number of cases from china that have been imported into other countries is increasing and the epidemiological map is changing rapidly 1 in this regard world health organization who on thursday 30 january 2020 announced a coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern pheic to curb the spread of covid-19 who has implemented several public health measures including rapid identification diagnosis and management of the cases identification and follow-up of contacts infection prevention and control in health care settings implementation of health measures for travelers awareness rising in the population and risk communication 2 additionally countries are taking measures to prevent the importation of covid-19 ie on january 31 2020 the president of the usa signed a presidential proclamation on suspension of entry as immigrants and non-immigrants of persons who pose a risk of transmitting covid-19 3 other measures implemented elsewhere include quarantine of travelers coming from risk countries and symptoms-based screening at points of entry 4 which were also employed during ebola outbreaks in support of this approach who reported that temperature screening at entry detected the majority of exported cases during the current outbreak with the covid-19 5 however 4 people in germany were infected with coronavirus-2019 through contact with an asymptomatic patient 6 although there is a claim that the patient from china who transmitted the virus when shehe was attending the business meeting in germany was symptomatic 7 but evidence is still clear that the other 2 patients who never came into contact with the chinese patient contracted the virus from an asymptomatic german patient who attended the meeting with a chinese patient this added to the ongoing debates about virus transmission where some of the scientists believe that asymptomatic patients are transmitting the infection who says people who cough or sneeze are more likely to spread the virusbut even if they do asymptomatic transmission likely plays a minor role in the epidemic overall additionally evidence from germany reported that 2 out of 114 travelers 18 from wuhan china who had passed the symptoms-based screening tested positive for covid-19 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr 8 more interestingly japanese citizens evacuated from the source of a covid-19 outbreak that have been diagnosed with the infection after initially testing negative a man in his 50s who returned from the chinese city of wuhan on the first japanese evacuation flight on january 29 2020 previously twice tested negative for the virus however a third test 12 days later found the manwho has been isolated in his hotel room since his return was infected in addition to that the number of people in diamond princess testing positive for covid-19 keep on increasing since it arrived off japan 9 a case from the uk reports on the british businessman who is linked to 11 coronavirus cases that a suspect was advised to attend an isolated room at hospital despite showing no symptoms and later tested positive for covid-19 10 national health service has advised any individual experiencing symptoms even if mild after traveling from mainland china thailand japan republic of korea hong kong taiwan singapore malaysia or macau to stay indoors in africa egypt is the first country to confirm covid-19 infection and the countrys health ministry says the affected person is a non-egypt citizen foreigner who presented with no serious symptoms 11 the second covid-19 case in africa has been reported to occur in algeria from a foreigner coming from the northern part of italy who arrived in the country on feb 17 2020 northern italy home to many algerians has been the center of an outbreak of the coronavirus with more than 280 cases and 11 deaths 12 from latin america brazil is the first country to confirm the case of covid-19 in a 61-year-old who had visited italy 13 lastly a published study on clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with covid-19 in wuhan china documented that fever was present in 986 136138 of hospitalized patients whereas 2 non-intensive care unit patients 14 did not present with fever 14 in this regard body temperature might not be an adequate screening as it can potentially miss travelers incubating the disease or travelers concealing fever during travel and contribute to the importation of the virus to the countries of destination therefore travel restrictions to and from high risk areas 1 andor 14-day quarantine 15 of people coming from high risk areas are recommended to prevent possible importation of covid-19 currently rt-pcr is a reliable test in detecting both symptomatic and asymptomatic covid-19 6 8 lastly in previous experience from other viral outbreaks ie dengue virus 16 and ebola 17 fever screening especially at airport had a positive effect on partially blocking importation of cases kuan et al 16 reported that airport fever screening was successful in identifying 45 244542 95 confidence interval 331578 of imported dengue cases with fever  identification and management of asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 in china jianhui peng dongwei su ziwei zhang mingke wang   we read with interest the recent article by yu et al which reported asymptomatic transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 covid19
1
 asymptomatic carriers of covid19 who have no clinical symptoms but test positive for the virus that causes covid19 virus sarscov2 in respiratory specimens or other specimens have attracted the attention of scientists all over the world
2
 
3
 covid19 transmission through asymptomatic carriers has been a huge challenge for covid19 prevention and control
1
 there are two types of asymptomatic carriers those who never develop symptoms and those who are detected during the incubation period presymptomatic detection prior to symptom onset
3
 here we discussed the identification and management of asymptomatic carriers of covid19 in china so far asymptomatic carriers of covid19 may be found by the following ways
3
 first close contacts of confirmed cases of covid19 may be identified as asymptomatic carriers during their medical observation period second asymptomatic carriers have been found in the investigation of cluster outbreaks of covid19 by active detection third asymptomatic infectors can be detected when tracing the potential infection sources of covid19 patients fourth asymptomatic carriers may be detected in the screening populations with a history of travel or living in epidemic areas of covid19 fifth asymptomatic carriers could be detected during epidemiological investigations and opportunistic screening previous studies have reported asymptomatic transmission to family members
4
 
5
 and described an example of asymptomatic transmission during the incubation period
6
 asymptomatic carriers can shed similar amounts of virus to symptomatic patients
7

 since april 1 2020 the number of asymptomatic infectors has been reported online by national health commission of the peoples republic of china on a daily basis and the following management measures were required to be carried out to minimize the risk of their transmission in china
3
 first persons detected as asymptomatic infectors would be isolated for 14 days which may prevent them from becoming contagion sources those can be lifted from isolation by negative nucleic acid tests on two consecutive samples at least 24 hours apart
3
 second epidemiological investigation of asymptomatic infectors would be strengthened and strict disinfection would be implement in their living places such as homes medical institutions isolation wards transport tools and medical observation places third since early detection of asymptomatic carriers is critical to contain their transmission current screening methods also need to be strengthened nucleic acid screening is practical and quick for the population however due to specimen collection testing methods product stability falsenegative results have been frequently reported which will hamper case detection and disease control
8
 therefore multiple screening and monitoring of nucleic acid combining with antigens and antibodies in blood and other body fluids are recommended
8

 at present persons who are significant epidemiological associations with covid19 patients eg close contacts will be put under 14day centralized medical observation in china
3
 as the epidemic enters a new stage in order to consolidate the previous antiepidemic achievements and prevent the epidemic from rebounding we should further strengthen the monitoring of asymptomatic carriers and some special populations who may play a greater role in the spread of covid19 including frontline medical staff disease control personnel street epidemic prevention and control point staff and delivery personnel since asymptomatic carriers have no clinical symptoms they are difficult to identify diagnose and isolate this can lead to loopholes in prevention and control measures resulting in increased difficulty in controlling the spread of covid19
9
 the public health education should be strengthened and formation of good hygiene habits is important in particular awareness of selfprotection selfsupervision and administration and preservice training of above special populations are critical to reducing the spread of asymptomatic infections in future further definition of highrisk populations and development of effective screening strategies and programs will support rapid identification and management of asymptomatic carrier transmission of covid19
9
 further study is needed on asymptomatic carriers including their frequency relative to symptomatic infections their disease course and factors associated with having an asymptomatic rather than symptomatic infection
8
 since there can be a gray area between asymptomatic and symptomatic infections we also need to improve the detection of infections with very mild subclinical disease who may not seek medical attention but may also be responsible for transmission in the community with so many scientific questions to be addressed in asymptomatic carriers of covid19 canceling public gatherings implementing strong socialdistancing measures washing your hands and wearing a mask may be the best way to stop the virus from spreading in conclusion asymptomatic carriers of covid19 can be contagious identification and management of these asymptomatic infectors has been strengthened in china these measures may also help other countries to combat the covid19 epidemic the authors declare that they have no competing interests

winter season a el kholy a n mostafa a a ali a m soliman m s el-sherbini a r ismail i n el basha r magdy i n el rifai d hamed h   respiratory tract infection is a major cause of hospitalization in children most such infections are of viral origin but viral infection is often hard to distinguish from bacterial infection 1 pathogen-specific clinical symptoms are often lacking 1 specific diagnosis therefore relies almost entirely on laboratory investigation 2 treatment with antibiotics induces the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria 3 and has a negligible effect on most acute respiratory infections aris which are generally of viral origin 4 nevertheless antibiotics are frequently prescribed due to a lack of clinically valid diagnostic tests verifying a viral etiology 5 sensitive methods such as quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction qpcr analyses on nasopharyngeal samples for a number of viruses have been introduced in hospitals as a sensitive diagnostic tool among children with respiratory tract infection 6 investigations using specific pcr for individual viruses monoplex pcr are too time consuming and elaborate for the laboratory and are usually used to detect influenza and respiratory syncytial virus rsv when the viruses targeted by monoplex pcr are negative no specific etiology is identified to help clinical management of the patient and epidemiological monitoring of infections multiplex pcr methods on the other hand enable testing for many pathogens in parallel in a single analysis and are therefore increasingly gaining importance 1 viral testing was done by real-time multiplex pcr using anyplex ii rv16 detection v11 cat no rv7g01y supplied by seegene operated on a cfx96 real-time pcr detection system bio-rad which simultaneously

comparison between groups was done using the chi-square test for qualitative variables and the mannwhitney u-test was used for quantitative variables that were not normally distributed a p-value  005 was considered significant the nucleic acids of more than one virus were detected in 83 patients 469  dual detections were observed in 64 362  triple detections in 17 96  and quadruple detections in 2 11  of 177 samples the frequency of co-detection with each of the studied viruses among the patients is shown in table 2 important combinations included rsv with other viruses in 45 patients rhinovirus was mostly detected in association with other viruses 64 out of 78 patients positive for hrv bocavirus was detected in 16 patients it was the only virus detected in three of them while it was detected in association with another virus in 13 patients a large proportion of the patients had received antibiotic therapy prior to hospital admission 121 patients 684  and almost all the patients received antibiotic therapy during hospital admission 169 patients 955  seventy-eight patients required icu admission of whom 28 358  had co-infection with multiple viruses as follows 24 had co-infection with two viruses three had co-infection with three viruses and one patient had co-infection with four viruses twenty-one of the patients who were admitted to the icu had rsv in association with other viruses 14 of whom had co-infection of rsv and rhinovirus among the 40 healthy asymptomatic children who were included as a control group no virus was detected in 12 of them while a viral pathogen was detected in 28 controls the only viruses that were detected among the control group were adv hbov hev hcov-oc43 and hrv either as a single detection or as a co-detection table 3 a dual detection of these viruses was present in six controls while triple detections of these viruses were present in four controls the frequency of detection of these viruses among the patients and the controls is shown in fig 2

 the following viruses were not detected at all among the control group either alone or as a co-detection with other viruses rsv hmpv flu a flu b hpiv-1-2-3-4 hcov-nl63 hcov-229e multiplex pcr detected a single pathogen in 531  dual detections in 362  triple detections in 96  and quadruple detections in 11  of 177 samples similarly for children aged 18 years the percentages of single virus multiple viruses and no virus detected by the multiplex reverse transcriptase pcr method were 63  14  and 23  respectively in the study by zimmerman et al 16 these findings are comparable to previous reports 10 11 in view of the fact that respiratory tract infections in children occur in close succession during the winter season it can be assumed that infections actually overlap this may provide an explanation for the fact that viral nucleic acids of different viruses in one specimen are found virtually only in childrenfor example in 8  of all specimens analyzed by bierbaum et al 17 and 469  of the samples in our study co-detections were reported more commonly than single infections in children than older adults 65 years p  001 16 co-infection of rsv with other respiratory viruses is common and can increase the severity of the disease 18 in the current study co-infection with rsv was present in 529  of the patients who tested positive for rsv this may have increased the severity of the disease resulting in hospital admission moreover 269  of the patients who were admitted to the icu had rsv in association with other viruses for a long time it was assumed that symptomatic infection with respiratory tract viruses was regularly shown by the confirmation of viral nucleic acids in respiratory secretions however in recent years there have been increasing indications that this is not necessarily the case 19 data are available from only a few casecontrol studies that examined to what extent specific respiratory viruses cause disease 9 2023 in the current study adv hbov hrv hev and hcov-oc43 were not only detected in patients admitted with sari but were also detected in asymptomatic children the clinical importance of bocaviruses remains the subject of controversy bocavirus dna can be confirmed in the respiratory tract of asymptomatic children a high concentration of these viruses in respiratory specimens seems to be associated with symptoms 19 only quantitative monoplex pcr or multiplex pcr can provide information about virus concentration bocavirus was detected by pcr in nasopharyngeal swabs samples of children suffering from acute respiratory tract infection in saudi arabia 24 in our study hbov was detected among symptomatic children admitted with sari as well as in asymptomatic children six different human pathogenic coronavirus species hcov are known to date 1 as a rule they cause benign disorders of the upper respiratory tract 25 however after the sars severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003 with the sars cov hcov-nl63 was described in 2004 and hcovhku1 in 2005 21 the middle eastern respiratory syndrome mers is caused by mers-cov 26 human corona viruses hcov-nl63 hcov-oc43 hcov-229e were detected in seven patients admitted with sari however hcov-oc43 was also detected in six asymptomatic children adenovirus was the third most frequently detected virus in our study population adenovirus dna is also often found in the respiratory secretions of asymptomatic children 1 and was detected among patients as well as asymptomatic children in our study hrvs are frequently found in asymptomatic children 27 but are also detected in patients with symptoms ranging from mild common colds 28 to serious lower respiratory tract disease 29 since the development of molecular assays for the detection of hrvs the detection rate of hrv in patients with respiratory infections has increased to up to 50  30 hrv was only second to rsv in frequency of detection by multiplex pcr in swab samples of children admitted with sari in our study however hrv was also detected in 440 controls hrvs are frequently detected in asymptomatic children making it difficult to interpret the clinical significance of a positive pcr finding 9 moreover hrvs could be detected until 25 weeks after the onset of symptoms 31 in spite of these facts rhedin et al 9 reported that their data indicate that 39  95  confidence interval ci 1 to 62 of acute respiratory infections in their population could be attributed to hrv the potentially important rate of excreters of viral nucleic acids of specific pathogens that are not directly associated with the acute illness presents a problem to date quantitative conclusions are not reliably established neither for monoplex pcr nor for multiplex pcr 1 rhedin et al showed that the nucleic acids of rsv hmpv and parainfluenza virus can be confirmed almost exclusively in symptomatic children and very rarely in asymptomatic children their results indicate that a qpcr finding of rsv hmpv or piv is likely to be causative of disease in children with acute respiratory infection and that detection of several other viruses such as hbov hrv adv hcov and hev must be interpreted with caution due to the high detection rates among healthy children 9 the detection of adv hbov hrv hcov-oc43 and hev among asymptomatic children in the current study and the absence of rsv hmpv flu a flu b hpiv-1-2-3-4 hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e in these children support these findings whereas the detection of some viruses such as influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus rsv is clearly predictive for respiratory disease 3234 the clinical significance upon the detection of several other viruses needs further investigation the interpretation of a viral detection is complicated by the fact that infections with multiple viruses are common in children with acute respiratory infection and that many viruses have lately been reported to be found also in asymptomatic children 20 most respiratory tract infections in children are of viral origin especially during the winter season which in egypt is from november to february almost all the patients in our study received antibiotic therapy during hospital admission the identification of specific viral pathogens will limit the unnecessary use of antibiotics and will facilitate giving specific antiviral therapy when indicated eg neuraminidase inhibitors in confirmed influenza virus infection better understanding of how to interpret viral findings by the use of new technologies is important to improve management decisions which in turn will ameliorate patient outcomes and reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics this study confirms the high rate of detection of viral nucleic acids by multiplex pcr among hospitalized children admitted with severe acute respiratory infection as well as the high rate of detection of multiple viruses adenovirus hbov hrv hev and hcov-oc43 were also detected in asymptomatic controls resulting in challenges in clinical interpretation further studies are required to provide quantitative conclusions that will facilitate clinical interpretation and application of the results in the clinical setting  covid-19 in newborns and infantslow risk of severe disease silver lining or dark cloud munmun rawat praveen chandrasekharan mark hicar d satyan lakshminrusimha   prior to the past two decades the four circulating species of coronaviruses associated with human disease were known to be a significant cause of the common cold and other mild uris more severe lower respiratory infections lris were associated with the recent zoonotic crossovers of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov identified in 2002 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov identified in 2012 
a notable feature of the 2003 global sars outbreak was the relative paucity of infections among children in a published review of case series the authors noted the absence of mortality in children and adolescents in particular children under 13 years of age had milder disease no mortality and only mild residual changes in exercise tolerance and pulmonary function at 6 months after resolution of illness
6
it was suggested that prior exposure to other respiratory viruses making their immune systems more resilient and inability to mount a mature immune response during the immune dysregulation phase of sars and thus less organ damage was associated with low morbidity and mortality in children
7
 
as of november 2019 world health organization who reported a total of 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of mers including 858 associated deaths casefatality rate 344 globally a review of pediatric cases through april 2016 revealed only 31 pediatric cases representing roughly 1 of cases known at the time only 18 were symptomatic and there was one death reported in a child with cystic fibrosis the authors postulated a variety of explanations for lower case numbers in children including lower exposure rates less symptomatic cases and the presence of yet to be identified factors
8
 
like sars-cov and coronavirus nl63 recent evidence indicates that entry of sars-cov-2 into cells requires the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 protein
9
ace2 receptors are expressed in human airway epithelia as well as lung parenchyma of note undifferentiated cells expressing little ace2 were found to be poorly infected with sars-cov while well-differentiated cells expressing more ace2 were readily infected
10
ace2 is less mature in young children and thus may not function properly as a receptor for sars-cov-2
11
in addition the intracellular response induced by ace2 in the alveolar epithelial cells of children may be lower than that of adults ace2 are more abundant on cells of the lower respiratory tract
12
which is typically the site of severe covid-19 disease consistent with this observation recent data indicate that children experience more sars-cov-2 infections in the upper respiratory tract than the lower respiratory tract
13
 
sars-cov-2 virus proteins orf1ab orf10 and orf3a have been shown to attack the heme on the 1- chain of hemoglobin to dissociate the iron to form porphyrin

this attack not only reduces hemoglobin leading to hypoxia but also inhibits the normal metabolic pathway of heme liu and li suggest that this mechanism moreover interferes with the normal heme anabolic pathway in the human body causing disease newborn infants have up to 80 fetal hemoglobin made of alpha and gamma chain which may be protective against the coronavirus
15
however this explanation does not explain the low incidence of severe disease in older children
 
acquired immunity with other viruses including other coronaviruses may be protective to the pediatric population a study investigating the presence of short-lived relative cross-protection conferred by specific prior viral infections against subsequent febrile respiratory illness showed that adenovirus-positive participants tended to be protected against subsequent infection with adenovirus coronavirus enterovirus rhinovirus and influenza virus
16
on an average children up to 6 years old can have 8 to 12 uris per year in comparison to adolescents and adults who average 2 to 4 uris per year
17
severity of sars-cov-2 infection in infants with more likelihood of hospitalization as compared with toddlers and young children
2
may be explained by the fact that infants humoral immunity is initially dependent on maternal immunoglobulins
 
a cytokine storm or systemic inflammatory response syndrome is an overproduction of immune cells and their activating compounds associated with a surge of activated immune cells into the lungs resulting in inflammation and fluid buildup that can lead to respiratory distress and can be contaminated by a secondary bacterial pneumonia this increases the risk of mortality in patients
18
this response is underdeveloped in children
19
and could explain the recently published cdc data where only 54 pediatric cases had cough as compared with 80 in adults
20
shortness of breath was also much lower in children compared with adults 13 vs 43
1
clinical observations in wuhan china have confirmed that the absolute number of peripheral blood lymphocytes in adult patients progressively declines during the inflammatory response to sars-cov-2 which could help the virus to proliferate and spread the white blood cell count and the absolute number of lymphocytes in pediatric cases were found to be generally normal which may be related to the incomplete development of natural immunity
2
 
the use of convalescent serum containing neutralizing antibodies has been used previously in sars-cov and mers and was recently reported in a small cohort for sars-cov-2
21
however several studies imply certain antibody responses may contributed to pathology
22
in a sars-cov macaque model antibodies against the spike protein were shown to contribute to lung injury in the feline infectious peritonitis virus antibodies against the spike protein contributed to enhancement of infection
23
higher neutralizing antibody titers against even sars-cov-2 have been correlated with lymphopenia and elevated c-reactive protein however this may simply represent increased immune stimulation from more severe illness
24
because of differences in infectious history children may use more favorable immunoglobulin isotypes or have improved antibody focused targeting to sars-cov-2
 
day et al showed that t-cells are especially important in clearing viruses from mice infected with sars-cov
25
another study in mice also stressed the importance of cd4 helper t-cells which stimulate b-cells to make antibodies against pathogens in controlling sars-cov infection
26
in children the young immune system and its efficient t-cells may potentially perform a superior job of responding to sars-cov-2 t-cell subsets also undergo dynamic changes between younger children and adolescents particularly with declining t regulatory cells and increasing memory cells
27
 
the incubation period of covid-19 has been reported in the range of 0 to 24 days
28
studies have shown asymptomatic and presymptomatic carrier transmission of the disease
29
30
in the united states 27 of the pediatric cases that tested positive were asymptomatic while only 7 of adults were asymptomatic as stated by cdc an observational cohort study in zhejiang china reported 28 asymptomatic carriers among exposed children as well
31
another study in shenzhen china validated that children are at similar risk of infection as the general population and less likely to have severe symptoms
32
these asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic children may play a major role in the spread of sars-cov-2 in the community and hence social distancing may be crucial to reduce the rate at which the pandemic spreads across the world cdc recommends limiting a childs contact with older adults and people with chronic medical conditions
 coronavirus leaves young children and neonates with minimal or no symptoms a silver lining this continued mystery may point to vital clues regarding both viral function and optimal immune system targeting the milder and more often asymptomatic childhood presentations of sars-cov-2 may contribute to increased transmission of the virus to vulnerable adults a black cloud studies in this area can help the researchers to develop prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat this deadly disease  clinical characteristics of children with covid-19 carmen tung ho lok peter oligbu olakunle ojubolamo muhammad pervaiz godwin oligbu   in december 2019 the infection caused by 2019 novel coronavirus covid-19 was first described as pneumonia of unknown cause in wuhan situated in the hubei province of china 1 since then there has been a rapid increase in the number of cases over the past months on 12th march 2020 there were over 100000 confirmed cases and almost 4300 deaths worldwide as a result the world health organisation who announced that the outbreak of covid-19 should be regarded as a pandemic 2 this is not surprising given that the world is now a global village and there is limited preparation for such a pandemic 3 this virus is air borne and thus transmitted via respiratory droplets and direct contact common symptoms reported so far include dry cough fever and myalgia 1 many countries worldwide have taken precautionary measures such as raising awareness to frequently sanitise hands advising those with minor symptoms to self-isolate and to introduce travel restrictions and social distancing 4 despite these measures the spread of the virus remains uncontrolled recent studies indicate that the mean incubation period of covid-19 is 3 to 5 days but this could range from 0 to 24 days 56 the case fatality rate following covid-19 has been estimated to be as high as 72 7 this may not have considered the asymptomatic individuals and virtually all were reported in adults and the elderly information on the prevalence of covid-19 in children is very scanty due to very few cases reported in children 8 it is uncertain as to why there are few paediatric cases considering that children have developing immune systems and thus should be more vulnerable to the virus however as the virus continues to spread the number of cases in children has been rising significantly 9 in general the clinical presentation has been less severe in paediatric cases when compared to adult cases and the reason for this difference is unknown 8 in addition pregnant mothers were also advised to stay indoors as the long-term and short-term consequences of the virus on the foetus and whether there can be mother-to-child vertical transmission is unknown due to the dearth of evidence and information on covid-19 who has encouraged more research particularly those involving children and pregnant women to provide a better understanding and overview of the clinical characteristics and natural history of the illness 8 therefore this review of all published literature involving children summarises findings from other studies to increase understanding of the clinical presentation management and outcomes of covid-19 in this particular group of patients it is hoped that the findings of this review will provide clinicians with a robust evidence base to investigate and manage children suspected with covid-19 a search strategy was designed to identify studies reporting covid-19 in children in this review any patient under the age of 18 will be considered as a child we searched medline embase and the cochrane library from 01 june 2019 to 18 march 2020 the medical subject headings mesh terms used included coronavirus covid-19 2019-ncov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 child paediatric pediatric infant baby newborn children and sars-cov-2 these mesh terms were used in different combinations the primary search strategy was covid-19 all fields or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 all fields or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 all fields or 2019-ncov all fields or sars-cov-2 all fields or 2019ncov all fields or wuhan all fields and coronavirus mesh terms or coronavirus all fieldsand infant newborn mesh terms or infant all fields and newborn all fields or newborn infant all fields or baby all fields or infant mesh terms or infant all fields in addition reference lists of selected papers were screened to retrieve relevant studies inclusion criteria required the study to report covid-19 in a child under the age of 18 years old this was because in the uk health care system the cut-off age for admission to paediatric wards is below 18 years in most hospitals covid-19 was diagnosed by positive results from identification of 2019-ncov nucleic acid using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assay from nasal or pharyngeal swab specimens or blood samples alternatively genetic sequencing of virus genes from respiratory tract or blood samples that are highly homologous with 2019-ncov was another valid method for diagnosis studies were excluded if they were laboratory experimental or animal studies letters to the editor case reports and commentaries were also excluded due to reasons including high probability of bias and low level of evidence two independent reviewers ch and go screened the title and abstract of papers identified by the electronic searches evaluating inclusion and exclusion criteria for all papers articles that met the inclusion criteria were retrieved and reviewed independently for eligibility two reviewers ch and go independently reviewed the methodological quality of included studies comparability of case and controls and outcomes discrepancies were resolved by discussion with a third author po the specific variables extracted from the publications included study design country age of participants year of study method of data collection method of diagnosis of covid-19 whether other causes of respiratory illness such as the influenza and adenovirus were excluded clinical presentation laboratory results other abnormal test results duration of illness management and presence of any previous medical issues and outcomes the study quality assessment for reporting systematic reviews was done according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma statement 10 figure 1 all studies included in the review were summarised using descriptive analyses to provide an overview of the information on covid-19 in children in terms of clinical presentations management complications and outcome we identified 303 potential studies during the initial search of which 10 were duplicates of the remaining 293 studies 277 studies were excluded on the basis of title and abstracts and a further 8 articles did not meet the inclusion criteria figure 1 for example guan et al had paediatric cases however the data were not separated by age group 6 and consequently data regarding only paediatric cases could not be obtained therefore eight studies were eligible for inclusion in the final analysis 91117 of the included studies all were case series and these were all published in the year of 2020 all identified cases were patients diagnosed and treated in china the study by dong et al included 2143 patients however 1412 659 of the patients were suspected cases and therefore were not confirmed by laboratory results 9 in addition the suspected cases had more severe symptoms and subsequently the authors are of the opinion that these cases may have been caused by alternative respiratory conditions thus only the remaining 731 confirmed cases were included in this study this study by dong et al did not explicitly describe the clinical characteristics of the confirmed paediatric cases however this study provided valuable information on demographics asymptomatic carriage diagnostic methods and outcome of cases a summary of the demographics of the study subjects method of diagnosis management and outcome is presented in tables 1 2 and 3 there was a total of 820 paediatric cases of covid-19 with a mean age of 7 years and 3 months range of 1 day to 17 years this average does not include the ages for the patients from the study by xia et al and dong et al as they only provided the median age which was 2125 and 10 years respectively out of the 820 patients 466 568 were male and 354 432 were female all cases except the cases from dong et al were confirmed using nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens to identify the covid-19 ribonucleic acid rna by the rt-pcr assay the cases from dong et al were confirmed using genetic sequencing of virus genes from respiratory tract or blood samples that were highly homologous with 2019-ncov table 1 asymptomatic cases represented 143 n  117 of the total number of cases identified and thus the remaining 857 n  703 experienced symptoms excluding information from the study by dong et al increases the asymptomatic carrier rate to 258 n  2382 data on clinical presentation was unavailable from the study by dong et al thus detailed clinical presentations were only available in 7 studies n  89 of which fever was the most reported symptom in 539 n  48 of cases most studies did not specify the peak and the duration of fever the second most common symptom was cough in 393 n  35 of cases although majority of the studies did not specify whether the patients experienced a dry or productive cough in the study by wang et al the proportion of patients with dry cough 571 n  814 was larger than for those with productive cough 429 n  614 rhinorrhoea or pharyngeal congestion was reported in 135 n  12 of cases diarrhoea in 79 n  7 and sore throats in 90 n  8 of cases other symptoms such as headache or dizziness 34 n  3 and fatigue 45 n  4 were rarely reported table 3 interestingly hu et al described a rash in a 14-year-old female patient the rash was described as most likely due to a reaction to an infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin or a side effect to the medications prescribed lopinavirritonavir and darunavircobicistat only xia et al reported underlying illnesses in three patients two had previous history of atrial septal defect surgery and one had epilepsy from previous viral encephalitis laboratory results were reported in 101 n  83 of cases white blood cell counts wbc was normal in 687 n  57 of cases and the remaining 181 n  15 and 133 n  11 had low and elevated wbcs respectively some studies also reported the levels of c-reactive protein crp this was elevated in 299 n  2067 of cases most studies included a computed tomography ct scan except for the studies by dong et al and cai et al which mainly used chest x-rays in 573 n  51 of cases the radiological findings were abnormal as there were 4 abnormal chest x-rays and 47 abnormal ct scans two studies did not describe the lesion or report the location of the lesion in the remaining six studies the lesions were described and they generally reported to have occurred in the lower zones of the lungs and appeared to be ground-glass opacities table 2 all patients including those who were asymptomatic were admitted into hospital and mainly required symptomatic and supportive treatment antiviral therapy n  52 antibiotics n  12 and interferon atomization n  6 were also other treatments used alternative medicines n  10 such as those from traditional chinese herbal medicine was also used by wang et al and li et al such as lianhuaqingwen granules and oral yiqi yangyin decoctions wang et al described one patient with no treatment but still recovered fully from their fever and any previous respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms feng et al did not specify the outcome of their patients and dong et al described a 14-year-old who died but did not specify whether they were a suspected or confirmed case of covid-19 all other cases from the remaining 6 studies survived with no reported mortality data regarding contact history was provided in all studies except the study by dong et al and 652 n  5889 reported to have had physical contact with another confirmed patient recent travel was also reported in 112 n  10 of cases excluding cases from dong et al where they had been to wuhan the epicentre of the outbreak or other epidemic areas such as hubei a detailed review of all published articles on covid-19 identified a very low rate in children accounting for 2 80900 cases reported in china as of 12th march 2020 18 similar findings were observed in europe with 1 in children less than 10 years old and 4 in 10 to 19 years had laboratory-confirmed cases for covid-19 19 one in seven confirmed cases in children were asymptomatic with fever and cough being the commonest presentation in symptomatic cases radiological investigations were abnormal in more than half of cases all cases in children recovered with no reported fatality despite covid-19 being the cause of the pandemic in 2020 and thus affecting a large population worldwide very few studies have been published in children to understand the pathophysiology management and outcome in this cohort this is not surprising since the first case was only reported in december 2019 and researchers and clinicians are currently heavily occupied with clinical tasks to treat this cohort of patients currently most studies on covid-19 are in adults and the elderly 8 possible explanations for this could include reduced exposure of children to those infected in the community travellers and clinical areas other reasons may be that children have a relatively immature immunity to viruses and consequently may respond to covid-19 differently to adults recent experimental studies have concluded that like the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov the novel coronavirus 2019 2019-ncov uses the same receptor angiotensin converting enzyme ii ace-ii 2021 it is therefore possible that the activity or function of ace-ii in children is not up to the same standard as in adults it can also be argued that it is too early to accurately make any reasonable conclusions and in the future there may be a sudden increase in paediatric cases it is important to emphasise that there is a high number of asymptomatic cases as this review have found asymptomatic cases in one in every seven confirmed case furthermore there is a lot of stigma on any individual who report to have minor symptoms regardless of the cause of their illness consequently the proportion of asymptomatic cases of covid-19 may be higher as some are unaware or are afraid to contact healthcare services in addition there may be fewer children being tested for covid-19 as from what the current literature suggests there are more silent and asymptomatic cases in this group of patients 9 therefore more studies are needed to investigate the epidemiology of covid-19 and the causes of any age-related differences if they exist this review found that almost two-third of cases had a physical contact with a confirmed case of covid-19 suggesting that the mode of transmission for this virus is person-to-person for example chan et al reported a chinese family who had travelled from wuhan and subsequently five out of six members were infected another family member who did not travel to wuhan but had been in contact with this family was infected with covid-19 22 however the mode of spread and incubation period was not reported by many studies cai et al obtained data concerning the period between symptom onset and exposure to index case and the median incubation period was 7 days across 8 paediatric patients 13 a population-level observational study analysed 33 adult patients from wuhan and the estimated median incubation period was 45 days 23 similarly lauer et al collected data from 181 confirmed cases and the median incubation period was 51 days this also demonstrated that 975 of patients who do experience symptoms will show symptoms by 115 days from the time of exposure 24 although relatively similar the difference in the incubation periods between the paediatric and adult cases could be related to the severity of disease for example in another similar outbreak which occurred in 2003 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome sars the association between incubation period and severity of disease was analysed it was observed that the severe cases tended to have a significantly shorter incubation period 25 transmission patterns of the disease caused by covid-19 were comparable with the pattern seen with sars-cov 26 consequently given that this review mainly focused on covid-19 cases in children who are currently believed to experience less severe symptoms than adults and the elderly 9 the longer incubation period compared to other studies may be accounted for by the milder form of disease in children however further studies should specify the incubation period to validate these finding symptoms associated with covid-19 have so far been non-specific the most common symptom was fever followed by cough in this review this is consistent with the data from huang et al which only included adult and elderly patients as this showed that fever and cough was a symptom in 98 n  40 and 76 n  31 respectively of all patients included in their study 27 the higher prevalence of fever found in their study when compared to cases in children may reflect the increased severity of disease in adult patients however irrespective of the incubation period the current who guidance recommends laboratory investigations to ascertain cases due to covid-19 this involves collecting specimens from the upper respiratory tract including the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal regions for all suspected cases of covid-19 regardless of age laboratory investigations should include using rt-pcr and bacterial cultures 8 all studies except for dong et al where some patients were diagnosed using genetic sequencing confirmed diagnosis using investigations that aligned with the who guidance the diagnostic test for covid-19 is the rt-pcr in this review only confirmed cases were included the report from yang et al revealed that the sputum and nasal swabs have the potential to achieve a positive rate of 889 and 733 respectively during the first 14 days after illness onset 28 as a result false negatives are possible which will not only reduce the reported incidence of cases but also be detrimental in contact tracing and containing the spread of this virus other investigations used by studies included in this review are ct scans and chest x-rays 91117 ct scans provide a higher resolution and therefore may be preferred over x-rays in comparison x-rays would be preferred in critically ill patients where only bedside investigations are possible given the high resolution of ct this has become the image of choice in severe cases this may be particularly useful in children as ct scans would provide a clearer image of small lesions which are more common in children due to milder forms of disease present than x-rays however clinicians should weigh the benefit of the radiation involved in ct scans against trying to make a radiological diagnosis in a growing child the radiological finding of ground-glass opacities in the lower zones of the lungs was the most frequent findings in this review the halo sign which is represented by a ground-glass opacity surrounded by a pulmonary nodule or mass is a relatively rare in adults 29 however xia et al found this in 50 n  20 of the paediatric patients 16 in another study with only adult patients only 39 n  2 of patients had absence of ground-glass opacities and consolidations whereas this review estimates this to be 426 n  38 in children when using the studies that provided this data this further provides evidence that adults and children present differently and the explanations for these differences need to be explored further in future studies the significance of blood inflammatory markers remains controversial particularly in children we observed that over two-third 687 n  57 of cases had a normal wbc and a normal crp in 701 n  4767 of cases whereas in another study by huang et al which only involved adult patients 45 n  18 of cases had normal wbcs with 25 n  10 and 30 n  12 having low and elevated wbcs respectively 27 however in contrary elevation of procalcitonin was reported in 80 of cases involving children in another study suggesting that a possible co-infection with bacteria might be common compared with adults with covid-19 16 these children may therefore benefit from additional antimicrobial cover more covid-19 related deaths have been reported in the adult population than in children 27 possible explanations for this could be the impaired immunity in the elderly patients and the increased prevalence of co-morbidities such as cancer diabetes and cardiovascular diseases in the adult and elderly as a result adult and elderly patients are more prone to end organ damage and systemic failures following covid-19 27 in addition adult patients are more likely to smoke cigarettes which has been found to be associated with increased risks of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 30 consequently ards was a complication in 29 n  12 of all adult patients in one study 27 this risk is not clearly understood thus future studies should focus on age and sex related factors contributing to the outcomes following covid-19 treatment of symptomatic cases have been rather challenging current who recommendation for all patients with mild symptoms include antipyretics and self-isolation at the patients home in this review despite some cases being asymptomatic all were hospitalised this method was adopted primarily to reduce further transmission in the population and not due to clinical effects of covid-19 for severe cases including those that experience shock and ards should be hospitalised and respiratory and cardiovascular support should be provided 8 given that there are no specific treatments for covid-19 due to the lack of current evidence various combinations of treatments were trailed this ranged from probiotics 14 antiviral therapy to interferon atomisation 15 whether this made a difference to the outcome of these cases is yet to be determined a prospective and randomised-controlled trials are warranted to develop a specific and detailed treatment guideline for clinicians this is a review of covid-19 cases involving children however there are limitations to this study the first case of covid-19 was reported in china in december 2019 and subsequently in other countries as a result most studies reporting cases of covid-19 were from china thus a regional bias may be unavoidable further studies are needed to understand if there are differences in presentations and clinical features between children from different countries a second limitation is that some studies were written in chinese and therefore needed interpretation as a result the accuracy of interpretation may be questioned in addition the study by dong et al is a nationwide time limited epidemiological study of all the paediatric patients in china from 16th january to 8th february 2020 consequentially there is a chance that few of the patients are duplicated and reported in another study included in this review however as the data is non-identifiable it is difficult to eliminate the duplicate studies it is also important to note that given the novelty of covid-19 there has been few studies that were eligible to be included in this review consequently all studies were case series which is known to provide a lower level of evidence when compared to other study designs nevertheless this review further highlights important findings in the cases of covid-19 reported in children given that one in seven of all cases were asymptomatic means that contact tracing and testing all physical contacts will help reduce the spread of this novel virus until a vaccine is available reporting cases and especially those that are outside of china will be required to monitor the trend of the pandemic the current available data suggests that children are disproportionately affected by covid-19 and are more likely to run a milder course following this infection with covid-19 compared to adults this study also identified a need for standardised international reporting of covid-19 cases in children to better understand the trend and possible complications associated with this virus in addition given that no treatment has been identified prospective and randomised-controlled trials would be beneficial to provide robust evidence for development of a treatment strategy to reduce current morbidity in children  a study on infectivity of asymptomatic sars-cov-2 carriers ming gao lihui yang xuefu chen yiyu deng shifang yang hanyi xu zixing chen xinglin gao   the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 since early december 2019 has spread to many countries recently and sparked world pandemic via mass gathering 1 2 3 as of march 24 2020 there have been 334981 confirmed cases and 14652 deaths globally 4 it has been proved that the pathogen of covid-19 is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which has high homology with sars-cov 5 similar to sars-cov the dominant sars-cov-2 transmission mode is human-to-human transmission 6 differently the reproductive number r0 the expected number of secondary cases produced by a single infected person in a susceptible population is estimated between two and three which is higher than sars 67 furthermore the transmission of sars occurs during the symptomatic period 8 for covid-19 numerous asymptomatic infections were found among close contacts of confirmed patients like the report on diamond princess 9 however the epidemiological significance of asymptomatic infections is unclear until now recent studies indicated that transmission of covid-19 could also occur from these individuals with no symptoms 1011 however for now whether asymptomatic sars-cov-2 carriers are contagious still remain controversial here we report a case of an asymptomatic sars-cov-2 carrier with nosocomial infection and describe the clinical characteristics of 455 contacts our purpose is to analyze the infectivity of asymptomatic carriers case presentation case a was a 22-year-old female patient who had a medical history of congenital heart disease chd presented to the emergency room of guangdong provincial peoples hospital guangzhou guangdong province china on january 13 2020 she complained of shortness of breath for 16 years and the symptom worsened for one month the accompanied symptom was chest distress without cough sputum production and fever apart from chd she had no other diseases and had no smoking habit her temperature was normal and laboratory measurements showed no apparent abnormalities table 1
 echocardiography displayed atrial septal defect and severe pulmonary hypertension the diagnosis was congenital heart disease atrial septal defect and pulmonary hypertension case a was mainly given to oxygen therapy diuretic treatment plus pharmacotherapy of pulmonary hypertension on january 16 as case as condition improved and vital signs became stable she was transferred to emergency department observation unit edou owing to the spring festival and covid-19 outbreak she had been hospitalized in edou along with her brother until february 11 before admission she underwent a serious of examinations according to hospital-formulated guidance during epidemic period nevertheless the patients nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for sars-cov-2 by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr she was immediately admitted to quarantine ward in infectious department case a and her brother both denied visiting wuhan the epidemic area in china and any contact with covid-19 patients they wore masks all the time except at meals and drinking how she became infected was unknown notably in isolation the patient had never fever sore throat myalgia or other symptoms associated with virus infection 12 shortness of breath and chest distress without further aggravation than before were thought to be caused by chd laboratory measurements reflected that white blood cells lymphocytes c-reactive protein and procalcitonin were within a normal range table 1 upon admission chest computed tomography ct scan showed non- covid-19 imaging feature fig 1

than once chest ct scan ct abnormalities were reported in 686 the most common manifestations were inflammatory change 343 and pleural effusion 457 the interstitial change was detected less pulmonary edema and nodule were seen in persons with heart failure and lung cancer respectively of particular concern all ct findings were non-viral infection discussed professionally by radiologists normal ct image was found in 11 of 35 patients 314 according to evaluation from physicians there were 19 infected patients 543 of these 19 patients 15 429 had pneumonia which was bacterial 371 followed by pendulous 29 and aspiration 29 mediastina inflammatory and abdominal infection arose from two patients with fistula other two patients had suffered from infection due to protopathy on admission above infected patients were administered for empirical antibiotic treatment four 114 patients needed emergency surgery for their condition the rest of them 343 were received to heteropathy it totally took 14 days from the last contact with case a to the end of medical observation as of feb 26 2020 none of 35 patients was diagnosed with sars-cov-2 infection among whom eight 229 were discharged from the hospital while 25 714 were transferred to the specialized department for further treatments the remaining two individuals both died for severe heart failure judged by the clinical expert panel during the period of quarantine in total 196 family members were enrolled the situation on wearing masks was the same as that in patients local cdc took charge of following up 172 among them who were ruled out sars-cov-2 infection after 14-days medical isolation as far as we know the rest of the escorts were placed in designated locations by gcdc for quarantine of these 24 escorts 11 were male and 13 were female they aged from 24 to 86 years old and the median age was 475 years old interquartile range 340 to 570 the median contact time was five days interquartile range 10 to 110 regarding examinations at least two nucleic acid tests were negative all the attendants except a family member had no respiratory symptoms in the time of quarantine details as below a 37-year-old woman who had stayed in edou february 7 for 10 h as relative developed slight fever the highest temperature was 375 c dry cough and sore throat after six days february 13 then she was presented to our hospital immediately according to the investigation she had worn a mask during the hospital visit and had a history of recurrent acute tonsillitis after admission her ct images and laboratory measurements were normal additionally she experienced four sars-cov-2 nucleic acid tests successively all of which were negative the case was given empirical antibiotic treatment since admission and her symptoms disappeared afterwards based on clinical symptoms as well as auxiliary examination results she received a diagnosis of acute tonsillitis finally on fberuray 25 she recovered and was discharged from the hospital to ensure safety 224 hospital staffs who had come into contact with case a were screened as is clearly shown in table 3
 their identities were mainly composed of doctors 59 263 and nurses 101 451 others coexisted in the same room with case a for work such as security guards cleaners transportation personnel etc of these 224 staffs 103 were male and 121 were female with ages ranging 2160 years old the median age was 35 years old interquartile range 280 to 420 most of them were emergency workers so that they had long exposure to confirmed case oppositely some doctors in other departments had a brief stay approximately one to 2 h because of emergency consultation it is noteworthy that all personnel working in ed must take medical protection  namely using n95 mask putting on isolation gown and wearing goggle no respiratory symptoms were observed either existing or emerging blood test results revealed normal leukocyte count in 871 and lymphocyte count in 965 lymphocyte counts were decreased in three staffs 13 without leukopenia 40  109 cellsl a pregnant nurse failed to accept a ct scan a minority of hospital staffs 52 233 found abnormalities in ct where pulmonary nodule fibrosis focus and emphysema were seen all hospital staffs were tested twice for sars-cov-2 nucleic acid and the results were negative which was identical with the two groups mentioned above in contrast to them none of 224 hospital staffs required medical observation in this study we recorded in detail the hospitalized situation diagnostic procedure inspection results treatment plans and clinical outcome of an asymptomatic sars-cov-2 carrier who was laboratory confirmation by rt-pcr assay but without related symptoms and imaging changes in concert with previous reports 1214 also we analyzed epidemiological and clinical data from 455 contacts who had been exposed to the asymptomatic patient all the 455 contacts were excluded from sars-cov-2 infection of the 231 quarantined people 196 family members and 35 patients 229 were removed from medical observation successfully and two died for severe heart failure new or existing respiratory symptoms were almost appeared in patients which were considered to be associated with their original disease or complications a family member complaining of fever was diagnosed as acute tonsillitis ultimately unlike covid-19 normal blood count was found in most contacts 1215 all ct images showed no sign of covid-19 infection unquestionably all cases tested negative for sars-cov-2 nucleic acid this fact illustrated that there had been no cases of infection in a relatively dense space since the outbreak our hospital has taken a series of effective prevention and control measures which made a considerable effect on preventing the spread in this case above all medical staffs abide by the principle of graded protection strictly for patients and attendants each patient can only be accompanied by one attendant and both need to wear personal protective equipment ppe nevertheless there is still a risk of transmission of covid-19 under stringent measures primarily shortages of ppe were common in the early stages medical resources were supplied to healthcare workers priorly due to these factors patients and attendants can only wear one mask for a long time resulting in its ineffective besides we noticed that some patients and relatives wore ppe incorrectly due to the lack of adequate training which was also possible for hospital staffs last but not least it is unavoidable to take off mask while eating or drinking which provides an opportunity to spread the virus considering all the mentioned factors we suggest that there are more important reasons for achieving zero infection as is well-known person-to-person transmission through respiratory droplets is the main route of covid-19 transmission 6 earlier research revealed that the viral load of respiratory tract samples in an asymptomatic patient was similar to that in the symptomatic patients 11 however a single sample is difficult to be representative in the light of zero infection for this case we venture to guess that the viral load of respiratory tract samples in the asymptomatic patient might not be high moreover although pathogenic nucleic acids can be detected in respiratory tract samples from asymptomatic carriers the opportunity of transmission is less than that in symptomatic patient owing to the absence of the way expelling pathogen via cough and sneezing based on the foregoing discussion we conclude that the infectivity of some asymptomatic sars-cov-2 carriers might be weak this finding implicates that there is not needful to worry unduly for asymptomatic or mild patients during the ongoing covid-19 pandemic furthermore excessive virus nucleic acid detection is unnecessary which can relieve the pressure on public health resources under the development of epidemic circumstance more and more public concerns on the increasing number of asymptomatic or mild patients hid in the community however combined with our results and the defense measures currently completed we hope such worries are misplaced and we also believe the world will win this battle certainly the limitation of our study is that there is only one case and lack of detailed information on family members quarantined locally large-scale multicenter studies are needed to verify our conclusion however both asymptomatic carrier and 455 contacts were admitted to and treated in designated places hence the study results are representative to some extent infectivity of some asymptomatic sars-cov-2 carriers might be weak effective prevention and control measures are helpful to prevent covid-19 spread of asymptomatic carriers the result of this study may alleviate parts of the public concern about asymptomatic infected people this work was supported by the

2 infection are they a critical booby-trap fatma amer abdelaziz   
dear editor
 i believe that in egypt the first phase of the coronavirus disease covid-19 pandemic
was characterized by symptomless covert carriers covert carriers are individuals who
test positive for the virus on laboratory testing but are symptomless and can shed the
virus numerous researchers assume that there is an unobserved pool of these carriers
because in many cases severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2
infections could not be related to contact with persons with infection or to travel to
epidemic areas recent studies have revealed that some populations may have up to 50 of
covert carriers
1
 the sequence of events leading up to the current full-blown epidemic may
provide some explanation on this aspect on february 14 2020 the first case of
sars-cov-2 infection was confirmed in egypt in a chinese national
2
 he was diagnosed on arrival in cairo his lengthy stay in a confined place the
plane provided a good opportunity for virus shedding the time required to travel from
china to cairo is nearly 15 hours considering the additional time taken to arrive at
the testing area the person had sufficient time for transmitting the virus to the
surroundings at that time sars-cov-2 testing of all contacts showed negative results  on february 28 four foreigners who had travelled to egypt were reported to be infected
two french nationals one canadian national and one taiwanese national
3
 at that time not a single case of sars-cov-2 infection had been recorded in
egypt which raises many inquiries the next incident which added to the dilemma was
provided by the egyptian cruise ship ms a sara in late february and early march nearly
18 americans were reported to have sars-cov-2 infection after their voyage to luxor 
investigations revealed that 12 of the crew members were positive for sars-cov-2 and
that the index case involved a taiwanese-american female tourist
4
 who had traveled on the ship between late january and early february she
apparently passed on the virus to the crewmembers none of the 12 crew members positive
for sars-cov-2 showed any symptoms at that time no cases of sars-cov-2 infection had
been officially reported by the egyptian health authorities  on march 6 three overt cases involving egyptian nationals were recorded by march 9 59
covid-19 cases had been announced
4
 this indicates that with the initiation of exposure on february 14
2
 nearly 1 month passed until the appearance of obvious cases this appears to be
a long duration in a country of 100 million people furthermore all patients who tested
positive for sars-cov-2 earlier
3
 had neither signs nor symptoms a convincing explanation for this
epidemiological puzzle is that the sars-cov-2 caused covertasymptomatic infection in
patients over this period as reported by researchers from the united states of
america
1
 asymptomatic patients play a major role in the transmission of sars-cov-2 after march 6 overt and symptomatic cases have continued to appear postulated sequences
involved in the sars-cov-2 outbreak over time among egyptians are shown in figure 1 by may 6 a total of 7201 cases have been
confirmed a thorough analysis of data carried out on a scientific basis and guided by
the most recent publications resulted in the following important preliminary
conclusions in addition to research on the important role of covert carriers in the
initiation of the pandemic more research is needed on the type of patient-virus
interactions encountered among egyptians theoretically this interaction can be
attributed to host andor viral factors host factors are related to angiotensin
converting enzyme 2 ace2 ace2 is known as the key human target for the attachment of
the viral spike s protein which is followed by entry of sars-cov-2 into cells with
subsequent viral multiplication
5
 since the expression level and pattern of ace2 vary
6



7
 various forms and degrees of disease may be expected  

 viral factors that may be implicated in patient-virus interactions include a possible
change in viral characteristics due to selective pressure which may be either biotic or
abiotic
8
 another significant factor is virus mutation
9
 very recently it has been assumed that there are three distinct mutants of
sars-cov-2
10
 which raises the possibility of other mutants in other geographic locations
with differences in the type of clinical infections and outcomes very recently
researchers from england
11
 discovered at least 12 strains of coronavirus in the united kingdom uk one of
which has only ever been found in the uk this indicates that this virus mutated on
british soil  the magnitude of asymptomatic individuals with sars-cov-2 infection or other infections
represent a critical medical problem a recent article has shown an increase in the
proportion of asymptomatic carriers of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
sars-cov from 0 to 286
12
  contrary to the generally acknowledged notion that early on in the course of any
outbreak the detection of severe cases is followed by that of less severe cases
paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic it appears that sars-cov-2 transmission started in
egypt with asymptomatic carriers perhaps other outbreaks worldwide also started in a
similar manner it is possible that people were not ill enough to seek medical help or
to undergo appropriate testing however after the infection of more than 3 million
people and the continuous spread of covid-19 worldwide a new approach is urgently
needed that expands covid-19 testing to include asymptomatic persons in prioritized
settings
1
 further investigation is required to determine whether all of the above assumptions are
true or false and whether they are applicable to various geographic locations and
different ethnic groups indeed it is crucial to understand the natural history of
coronavirus outbreaks in different geographic locations so as to allow policy makers to
plan sound prevention strategies adjust the length bias for the effective
implementation of surveillance programs and to predict prognosis and evaluate
interventions moreover intensive research at a molecular level is required to
characterize the subtypes of sars-cov-2 prevalent in egypt  the clinical and demographical profile of coronavirus illness the tale of tablighi jamaat and zaireen in quarantine  isolation center at sukkur and hyderabad ikram ujjan din bikha devrajani ram akbar ghanghro ali syed shah zulfiquar   coronavirus illness or generally known as covid-19 is the updates on each and every second since it began from wuhan china which is announced as a pandemic disease by world health organization said to be brought about by another strain of the infection1 the illness is said to spread through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose of a contaminated individual especially when heshe sniffles or coughs2 in spite of the fact that the human coronaviruses have been perceived now for a long time the absence of invulnerability to the recognized new strain there is a huge segment of the population vulnerable to it furthermore the most recent pattern of the exponential increment in the tainted individuals with a precarious ascent of 6917 within three days from 21st march 2020 to 23rd march 2020 and in light of the absence of preventive immunization there has been a high fearful situation amongst the local public34 the disease severity has varied from self-restricting influenza like illness to fulminant pneumonia respiratory embarrassment and mortality there are variations in the death rates and these assessments are quickly changing as more information is opening up and in process5 as per who coronavirus disease covid-19 situation report  106 released on may 6 2020 total confirmed cases of covid19 globally are 3 517 345 and total deaths were 243 401 6 a much lower mortality of 14 has been accounted for exploration of data of 1099 patients with research center affirmed covid-19 from 552 clinics in mainland china7 since the start of the coronavirus pandemic there has been an extended use of spreads and sanitizers realizing exhaustion of resources in the market an inadequacy of individual guarded apparatus endangers prosperity workers around the globe8 the non availability of appropriate protective measures like ppes proper n95 masks and other protective measures is a matter of concern among hospital workforcethe problem is acute in a country like pakistan which is a thickly populated without a strong and well established health infrastructure9 public has been advised through mass media against mass gatherings of all sort including sports schools and religious nature to heck the spread of this deadly virus in spite of these endeavors numerous individuals overlook the significance of social isolation because of public attitude10-12 the development of sars-cov-2 has once again exposed the weaknesses of global health systems preparedness capacity to react to an irresistible danger the rate of transmission of contaminations across universal borders and the insufficiency of proper arrangement to counter the risingreappearing irresistible infection threat13-15 taking into account that the confirmed cases the comprehension of epidemiological attributes of this contamination is advancing every day the infection is spreading to various parts of the globe presented either with symptomatic or critically ill or remain asymptomatic this audit can provide important data to future research and may bolster government dynamics on systems to handle this public health emergency at the national and international level the descriptive case seriesstudy explored the data of the suspected and diagnosed confirmed case of covid-2019 during late march-2020 to mid of april-2020 reported by diagnostic research laboratory liaquat university of medical and health sciences lumhs jamshoro of patient who belonged to various parts of the country in general and province sindh in particular the population were divided in two parts ie tablighi jamaat and zaireen the former group were kept in isolation center at hyderabad and had history of contact exposure since they had started their religious journey from raiwind  have hyderabad visit as an religious meeting  gatherings while the latter group was kept in isolation center at sukkur and had history to visit religious place pilgrims at iran and came through taftan border to the sindh province the peoples of tablighi jamaat group belonged to various cities of pakistan while the zaireen group were from various cities of sindh province all the cases regardless of age and gender presented either as asymptomatic critical illness or having non-specific symptoms as fever flu cough sore throat and shortness of breath were then screened for covid-19 by real time pcr after taking informed consent from the point that a person is tested a sample has been taken after all aseptic measure by trained technician under the supervision of health care provider and then transported carefully to a diagnostic  research laboratory lumhs and analyzed through the rna extraction done by abbott rt auto extraction system by using extraction kits of abbott labs and detection was done on abi thermal cycle by haploid bio system by using sansure detection kits the study was conducted after the approval of ethical review committee lumhs and the data was collected on pre-designed proforma and analyzed in spss-22 to manipulate the frequencies  percentages and mean  sd of categorical as well as numerical variables during the study period total 920 patients were explored and screened for corona virus infection the mean  sd for age yrs of overall population was 5783884 the demographical and clinical profile of study population sukkur and hyderabad quarantine  isolation centers is presented in table i and ii the majority of cases of both centers were asymptomatic 90 symptomatic 7 and

obstructive lung disease and cerebrovascular accident whereas no mortality was observed at sukkur isolation center covid-19 pneumonia broke out in wuhan on january 30th 2020 and the pneumonia scourge brought about by a novel coronavirus was declared an emergency worldwide by the who16 the wellspring of the contamination was a novel coronavirus sars cov2 until now respiratory beads and direct contact have been recognized as the primary transmissions routes17 vaporized and gut related transmission has still to be confirmed the incubation duration of the disease is commonly 3-7 days however no longer than 14 days because of its solid infectivity profile early diagnosis and treatment are critical in any case human intervened spread can seriously imperil general population in intense respiratory disease rt-pcr is routinely used to identify causative infections from respiratory emissions19 the current study depicts the foundation of a symptomatic work process for existence of a developing infection without physical sources of viral genomic nucleic acid powerful examine configuration was empowered by the ability of researchers from china to share genome data before formal distribution just as the accessibility of expansive succession information20 the relative straightforwardness with which tests could be performed for this infection rather than sars-cov in 2003 demonstrates the gigantic aggregate estimation of elucidating investigations of illness nature and viral genome decent variety21 real time rt-pcr test is generally recommended in virology on account of a general population emergency capable demonstrative research facilities can depend on this hearty innovation to build up new symptomatic tests inside their standard administrations before pre-formulated assays become accessible22 notwithstanding data on reagents oligo-nucleotides and positive controls research facilities working under quality control programs need to depend on documentation of specialized capability of the assay plan just as information from clinical assessment tests23 this laboratory limit bolsters quick general public health exploration well as empowers destinations to enlist patients during rapid laboratory diagnosis in the study by mizumoto k et al24 of the 634 diagnosed cases a total of 306 and 328 were observed to be symptomatic and asymptomatic and soon after detection of infections both groups were transported to get the medical facilities at hospitals indeed the asymptomatic individuals are useful quantity to determine the true burden of disease  can better interpret the transmission burden as evidence highlights that the fraction of sars-cov-2 positive individuals are mostly asymptomatic25 iu diagnostic testing reviewing manuscript

of data manuscript editing supervision of the study  children in coronaviruses wonderland what clinicians need to know giuseppe lassandro valentina palladino anna amoruso viviana palmieri valeria giovanna russo paola giordano   human coronaviruses hcovs are a large group of viruses that commonly causes mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses but can lead to more severe and diffusive diseases a variety of signs and symptoms may be present and infections can range in severity from the common cold and sore throat to more serious laryngeal or tracheal infections bronchitis and pneumonia coronaviruses are known to circulate in many different animal species such as mammals and birds that can represent intermediate hosts and animal reservoirs for human infections coronaviruses belonging to the family coronaviridae are enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna ribonucleic acid viruses so-called for their corona- or crown-like surface projections they are further classified into four genera alpha- and betacoronavirus typical in bats rodents civets and humans delta- and gammacoronavirus mainly detected in birds their typical sizes range from 80 to 120 nm the genome encodes for two nonstructural replicase polyproteins and four or five structural proteins including the spike s envelope e membrane m nucleocapsid n and sometimes a hemagglutinin-esterase protein he the he protein binds to specific receptors and guides membrane fusion the s protein is responsible for cell entry the m and e proteins mediate viral assembly process the inner n protein develops ribonucleoprotein complexes binding to viral rna15 to date seven coronaviruses affect humans in 1960s hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 were firstly reported67 hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 were discovered subsequently in 2004 and 2005 respectively89 additionally three hcovs responsible for outbreaks involving high case fatality rates have been detected in humans in the last two decades the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov the middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov and the new coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 table 1 hcov-oc43 hcov-hku1 sars mers and covid-19 belong to beta coronaviruses while hcov-229e hcov-nl63 belong to alphacoronaviruses1012 hcovs can infect all age groups generally children appear to be less susceptible to coronavirus infections with milder symptoms and a more favorable clinical course than the adult population in addition coronavirus infections in children often have peculiar clinical features that differentiate them from those of adults available data on pediatric coronavirus infections are scattered in the literature the purpose of this review is to provide to clinicians a complete and updated panel useful to recognize and characterize the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations of coronavirus infections in the pediatric age before sars and mers epidemics and the recent covid-19 pandemic coronaviruses used to be considered commonly responsible for mild respiratory diseases as the common cold generally their median incubation period is three days respiratory droplets are the usual route of transmission hand contamination and transferal from surfaces and objects are also implicated13 children under the age of 3 years or with cardiac disease appear most frequently affected1416 the most common symptoms are rhinorrhea sore throat fever and dry cough but there is increasing evidence that coronaviruses are also important causes of more severe respiratory diseases including bronchitis bronchiolitis asthma exacerbations and pneumonia in children17 about the detection frequency the most common strains in alternate seasons are hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e followed by hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku118 common circulating hcovs can be isolated from 5 to 13 of children hospitalized for acute respiratory tract infections1922 frequently respiratory pediatric coronavirus infections are associated with multiple infections caused by other common viruses but the clinical significance of these coinfections is unclear coinfections between coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus human metapneumovirus adenovirus and influenza or parainfluenza viruses have been reported in up to 40 of cases2330 especially in younger children the virus most frequently associated with human coronaviruses infections is a respiratory syncytial virus rsv probably because of a season overlapping3132 among the respiratory infections caused by coronaviruses in children a strong association between hcov-nl63 and croup is also highlighted33 whereas hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 appear associated with bronchiolitis and wheezing3435 although the possible pathogenic role of coronaviruses in pediatric respiratory infections has been hypothesized and this has not yet been confirmed in several studies a similar prevalence in the detection of hcovs in patients with respiratory symptoms compared to healthy children has been found3639 moreover patients with other underlying medical conditions or immunocompromised appear more susceptible to developing severe infections than healthy patients4043 additionally human coronaviruses are responsible for other common childhood diseases such as acute otitis media4447 asthma exacerbations48 and conjunctivitis8 they have also been involved in nosocomial infections especially in the neonatal intensive care units nicu gagneur et al in a prospective study determined the incidence of hcov-related respiratory infections in newborns hospitalized in a nicu among 64 neonates seven positive nasal samples for hcovs 11 were detected all children were symptomatic oxygen and ventilatory support were frequently needed49 sizun et al evaluated the clinical role of coronaviruses respiratory infections in premature newborns all premature infants infected had severe respiratory symptoms including bradycardia apnea and hypoxemia while chest x-ray revealed diffuse infiltrates50 it has also been shown that coronavirus infections are not only responsible for respiratory symptoms but can also affect other organs and systems in children several studies have also reported that respiratory symptoms caused by coronavirus infection may be associated with central nervous system cns involvement hcovs have an intrinsic capacity to affect neurons and diffuse centrifugally from cns via the transneuronal route5152 among neurological symptoms febrile seizures convulsions loss of consciousness encephalomyelitis and encephalitis have been reported5355 primarily in 1980 the viral genome was detected post-mortem in the cerebrospinal fluid of two patients with multiple sclerosis ms56 subsequently the hcovs neuroinvasion capacity was confirmed in a large panel of human brain autopsy samples affected by ms and other neurological diseases57 in 2004 yeah et al reported a case of a child with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in which the genome of hcov-oc43 in cerebrospinal fluid was detected55 in 2016 li et al demonstrated the presence of anti-cov igm immunoglobulin m in 22 12 of 183 children with acute encephalitis58 in 2017 a prospective study on 192 children with febrile seizures demonstrated that coronaviruses were frequently detected59 additionally hcovs have been implicated as possible causes of many gastrointestinal disorders in children and gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported in several studies in more than 50 of pediatric patients286061 firstly hcovs could be associated with neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis62 furthermore diarrhea vomiting or other gastrointestinal symptoms have been associated with coronavirus infections6365 besides the demonstrated finding in respiratory swabs all hcovs can also be detected in stool samples of patients affected by gastroenteritis6066 moreover most of the hcovs found were coinfections with well-known gastroenteric viruses including norovirus and rotavirus hcovs may also be found occasionally in healthy childrens stool samples67 although hcovs have always been associated with respiratory symptoms these findings suggest that other systems may also be involved in children the absence of serious symptoms may not be coupled with serological negativity therefore these viruses should be considered in the differential diagnoses of most of the common diseases of childhood the 20022004 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak was a viral respiratory illness caused by sars-cov the outbreak firstly emerged in the southern chinese province of guangdong in november 2002 and68 then spread to 29 countries with 8096 people infected and 774 died69 the sars global outbreak was contained in july 2003 since 2004 there have not been any known cases of sars reported anywhere in the world70 probably civet cats or bats could be the initial step of the transmission to humans humans to humans infection occurs by respiratory droplets or direct contact healthcare or household contacts are critical routes of transmission7172 sars-cov infection cases were classified by the world health organization who into suspected probable and confirmed table 273 the median incubation period ranges between 211 days sars causes atypical pneumonia which may progress to respiratory failure symptoms include fever malaise myalgia headache diarrhea and rigors adults are more likely to develop severe illness characterized by dyspnea lymphopenia acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and a fatal clinical course in 10 of cases the exact number of children affected by sars worldwide is unknown however children appear to be less susceptible to sars with a lower incidence of the disease and no reported mortality the majority of children had documented exposure to adults with sars usually a family member most infected children had previously attended school but the spread of the infection in the school environment has not been demonstrated and this could probably be linked to lower infectiousness of the virus among children7475 children have less severe symptoms than adults and they rarely need intensive care however subclinical and asymptomatic infections appear uncommon most children reported worldwide were healthy previously and underlying conditions were infrequently reported7577 usually children require hospitalization after 34 days the onset of symptoms fever 90100 dry cough 4380 sore throat 530 rhinorrhea 3360 malaise and myalgia 1040 headache 1440 are common dyspnea tachypnea and febrile seizures are infrequent aspecific gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain appetite lack vomiting and diarrhea have been reported physical examination at presentation is negative in the majority of children and chest auscultation does not reveal significant findings moreover sometimes crackles or signs of lung consolidation can be detected as well as the clinical examination laboratory findings are not specific in children with sars and can be confused with those of other respiratory infections typical of childhood commonly lymphopenia the elevation of transaminases lactic dehydrogenase and creatine phosphokinase are detected other hematological abnormalities such as leukopenia thrombocytopenia the elevation of d-dimer levels and mildly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin times are also observed7880 circulating interleukin il-1 levels might be increased resulting in caspase-1-dependent pathway activation responsible for an exaggerated and persistent inflammatory response and the consequent respiratory failure in severe cases81 in children radiological findings are nonspecific and similar to other viral respiratory abnormalities commonly the chest x-ray shows ground-glass opacity or focal consolidation linear atelectasis and peribronchial thickening have also been reported computed tomography ct shows more extensive airspace consolidation and ground-glass attenuation than chest x-ray but it is performed in selective cases in pediatric age788082 usually the clinical course is less severe in children compared to adults and few patients require oxygen supplementation and assisted ventilation but preterm newborns children younger than one year and older than 12 years of age have more severe symptoms and are likely to develop respiratory distress7880 in pediatric age sars infection commonly has a biphasic pattern the first stage of the disease is characterized by virus replication and clinically by the onset of symptoms the second phase is characterized by pulmonary involvement which is typically less severe in children than in adults most children will become afebrile within seven days and they usually do not progress to respiratory distress the adult third phase that is only reported in a minimal number of cases commonly among teenagers8384 in pregnant women sars infection is associated with a high incidence of spontaneous miscarriage prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation iugr the increased morbidities during pregnancy are likely to be due to the hypoxic state and circulatory insufficiency that worsen placental blood flow and cause miscarriage or iugr significantly among pregnant women mortality is 2585 however perinatal sars infections have not been documented in none infants born from pregnant women affected real-time pcr rt-pcr assays and viral cultures conducted on neonatal blood body secretions and amniotic fluid were positive for sars in infants no congenital malformations have been reported however in premature newborns severe gastrointestinal complications such as jejunal perforation and necrotizing enterocolitis have been described86 however it is not known if these neonatal morbidities are related to prematurity or if maternal infection is a factor that increases their incidence it is unclear why children develop a less serious disease than adults recurrent viral respiratory infections typical of the pediatric age could be helpful to the immune system in promptly recognizing and defeating new viral pathogens furthermore the immaturity of the immune system could be protective because the inflammatory cascade that causes respiratory failure in adults is more difficult to activate additionally children generally have fewer comorbidities than adults children recovered quickly from sars li et al assessed the radiological and clinical outcomes of forty-seven children with sars after 6 months from diagnosis all children were asymptomatic while mild pulmonary abnormalities including ground-glass opacities and air trappings were found at ct in sixteen patients87 although clinical and laboratory findings of sars are aspecific in children certain features can be useful to distinguish sars from other respiratory viral infections children with sars have a lower incidence of rhinorrhea and productive cough and higher incidence of monocytopenia than children with influenza88 additionally serum lactate dehydrogenase in the presence of a low neutrophil count and low serum creatine phosphokinase could be suggestive of sars infection89 sars infections in children appear to be a relatively mild and aspecific disease and the diagnosis should be accompanied by laboratory assessment although infants and teenagers are more likely to have a worse clinical course usually all pediatric patients recover entirely without significant long-term sequelae the middle east respiratory syndrome mers is a viral respiratory infection caused by the mers-coronavirus mers-cov the first identified case occurred in 2012 in saudi arabia1190 subsequently a total of 2494 confirmed cases of mers including 858 associated deaths with a casefatality rate of 34 were reported globally the majority of these cases were reported from arabian peninsula and in the middle east91 currently mers is an extremely rare disease in the last year mers was signaled only in saudi arabia92 mers-cov is a zoonotic virus dromedary camels are the primary reservoir hosts humans are infected through contact with infected dromedary camels animal products or humans especially among close contact between family members and health care workers mers-cov infection cases were classified by the who into suspected probable and confirmed table 393 usually the mean incubation period ranges from 2 to 15 days clinical severity of the disease varies from asymptomatic to fatal forms and the impact of asymptomatic spread is unclear the infection can cause severe pneumonia which may progress to ards respiratory failure and death particularly in older people immunocompromised patients and those with chronic diseases common symptoms include fever cough and shortness of breath gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea vomiting abdominal pain pericarditis septic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation have been reported9497 children appear to be less susceptible to mers-cov infection and pediatric cases described in the literature are rare with a low proportion 014 of infected children98102 fagbo et al demonstrated in a study conducted on 2235 hospitalized children with respiratory infections that all patients tested were harmful to mers-cov102 khuri-bulos et al confirmed the low incidence of mers-cov infection in childhood in a prospective study conducted in children 2 years of age hospitalized with acute respiratory symptoms andor fever among these none of 474 children tested resulted positive for mers-cov 103 in pediatric age few cases of mers cov infection have been described most of the children were asymptomatic and positive during routine screening of mers-cov al-tawfiq et al reported a total of 31 pediatric mers-cov cases with a mean age of 10 years overall 42 were asymptomatic while in symptomatic cases fever and mild respiratory symptoms were common104 subsequently alfaraj et al reported a total of 7 pediatric mers-cov cases with a mean age of 8 years in this case series common symptoms were fever 57 cough 14 shortness of breath 14 and gastrointestinal symptoms 28 two 286 patients had abnormal chest radiographic findings with bilateral infiltration one 143 required ventilatory support and two 286 required supplemental oxygen99 four with underlying conditions cystic fibrosis nephrotic syndrome craniopharyngioma and a right ventricular tumor had a fatal outcome these children developed a critical form of mers infection complicated by respiratory and multiorgan failure frequently clinical examination revealed bilateral rhonchi and crackles while chest x-ray showed diffuse bilateral infiltrates ground-glass opacification and pleural effusion105109 thrombocytopenia leukopenia increased creatinine and prolonged prothrombin time were the only laboratory findings reported in literature99105106 mers-cov in children is less frequent than adults and appears to be associated with low mortality unless the patients have underlying comorbidities few cases of mers-cov have been reported during pregnancy a pregnant woman aged 39 years had a stillbirth at approximately five months of gestation110 and another woman gave birth to a healthy term baby but she died after delivery107 in conclusion although mers-cov represents a clinical concern for the adult population with a high fatality rate it remains a sporadic disease in childhood clinicians should learn to recognize and suspect mers-cov infection as the symptoms and signs are nonspecific based on epidemiological criteria to avoid the spread of the disease in patients at higher risk of worse clinical course the outbreak of covid-19 infection coronavirus disease 2019 previously 2019-ncov began in wuhan hubei china in december 2019 which then spread rapidly to other provinces of china and around the world111 on january 30 2020 the who declared the outbreak of a public health emergency of international concern and on march 11 2020 a pandemic112 as of june 5 2020 188 other countries and regions with more than 6669358 confirmed cases are declared among the confirmed cases 2904828 are recovered and 393205 died113 recent genetic analysis suggests the covid-19 emerged from an animal source the full genome sequences showed high homology between covid-19 bat coronavirus and pangolin coronavirus but further genetic study is required moreover according to current evidence the principal route of transmission of covid-19 is from human to human114115 covid-19 spread between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes droplet transmission occurs when there is close contact with a person with respiratory symptoms such as coughing or sneezing who may spread potentially infectious droplets transmission may also occur by direct contact with infected persons and indirect contact with infected surfaces or objects covid-19 can persist on inanimate objects for days but can be efficiently inactivated by common disinfectants airborne transmission may be possible when a high risk of aerosolization procedures are performed such as endotracheal intubation and bronchoscopy the virus is also detected in stool specimens and consequently the feco-oral transmission is also hypothesized116119 the high transmissibility of covid-19 may be explained by its demonstrated presence in the upper respiratory tract of asymptomatic or presymptomatic subjects with viral loads comparable to those detected from symptomatic patients the real proportion of asymptomatic cases is unclear ranging from 1 to 78 in different studies transmission from asymptomatic patients infected with covid-19 most likely contributed to the rapid and extensive spread of pandemic but further studies are needed to more accurately estimate the proportion of genuinely asymptomatic cases and their risk of transmission120126 covid-19 has been reported among all age groups the median incubation period of covid-19 infection is 4-5 days with a range up to 24 days119127 covid-19 infection case is classified by the who into suspected probable and confirmed table 4128 clinical severity of the infection varies ranging from asymptomatic forms to critical diseases common symptoms are fever dry cough malaise lethargy shortness of breath sore throat and myalgia headache conjunctivitis productive cough and diarrhea are also described mild forms present as a common cold and severe cases may worsen in pneumonia that may evolve to ards shock and multiple organ dysfunction more severe clinical pictures are associated with stronger immune response and with the production of proinflammatory cytokines including il-2 il-7 il-10 and tumor necrosis factor- tnf- adverse outcomes are common in elderly patients and those with underlying diseases the need for intensive care admission is in 2530 of patients the fatality rate is estimated to range between 2 and 3129133 about 2 of covid-19 confirmed cases are children124134135 generally children appear to be less likely to develop a severe form of covid-19 infection and commonly they have a mild clinical course with a good prognosis few children may evolve into lower respiratory infections probable reasons include having an immune system still immature healthier respiratory tract and less underlying conditions than adults136 most of them have an infected contact history with family members moreover children especially those with asymptomatic or milder form may represent significant spreaders pediatric patients appear to be likely as adults to become infected but are less likely to develop symptoms however future studies are needed to understand the role of children in the transmission of the virus137139 current researches show that the median age of infection in pediatric cases is 67 years in symptomatic cases symptoms are typical of acute respiratory infections and frequently included fever 59 and cough 46 which may be accompanied by nasal congestion runny nose conjunctivitis pharyngitis wheezing myalgia and expectoration few children have an atypical presentation with gastrointestinal manifestations including nausea vomiting and diarrhea low oxygen saturation of less than 92 dyspnea cyanosis and poor feeding are less common than adults among infants symptoms such as irritability reduced response and poor feeding could be the main signs of infection family clustering occurred for all infected infants rarely infants require intensive care or mechanical ventilation or have any severe complications common symptoms of pediatric age are summarized in figure 1 the majority of children recovers 12 weeks after the onset of the disease regarding biochemical results leukopenia and lymphopenia are frequent in children elevation of transaminases myoglobin muscle enzymes and d-dimers might be seen in severe cases140146 dong et al reported that 94 of 2143 pediatric patients affected by covid-19 developed an asymptomatic mild or moderate form of infection a severe disease characterized by dyspnea central cyanosis and oxygen saturation of less than 92 was reported in 5 of cases a critical disease characterized by ards and multiple organs failure was reported in less than 1 of cases141 the prevalence of severe and critical disease appears higher in younger children particularly in children aged 1-year-old and in children with underlying diseases to date death was an uncommon event reported in one 10-month-old infant with intussusception and multiorgan failure and in one 14-year-old boy145147 other systemic symptoms appear to be related to the infection but their link has not yet been demonstrated since the outbreak of the pandemic a large number of rashes urticaria and vasculitis affecting hands and feet of healthy children and adolescents have been reported as well as itching burning difficulty in joint movements and pain142 recently the relationship between covid-19 infection and the development of cardiac diseases in children has been hypothesized belhadjer et al have reported a large number of febrile children resulted positive for covid-19 admitted in intensive care units for acute heart failure associated with a multisystem inflammatory state in most of the children clinical features appeared similar to those of kawasaki syndrome lasting fever cutaneous rash lymphadenopathy persistent activation of systemic inflammation and positive response to intravenous immunoglobulin148 similar clinical features have subsequently been reported in children with covid-19 positive serology149150 as in covid-19 infection kawasaki syndrome is triggered by proinflammatory cascade activated primarily by innate immunity response however further studies are needed to establish the real pathogenetic relationship between emerging covid-19 and kawasaki-like syndromes151 dufort et al 152 have recently reported the emergence of a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children in new york state coincidental with widespread sars-cov-2 transmission which can better clarify the relationship between kawasaki disease and covid-19 among 191 children admitted to the new york hospitals for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children mis-c 95 patients had a laboratory-confirmed acute or recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection this hyperinflammatory syndrome manifested with dermatologic mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal features associated with cardiac dysfunction of these 95 patients a total of 36 patients 37 received a diagnosis of kawasakis disease or atypical or incomplete kawasakis disease 7 of the 9 patients with coronary-artery aneurysms also received a diagnosis of kawasakis disease152 covid-19 infection may also trigger the onset of other immune-mediated diseases such as immune thrombocytopenia153156 evans syndrome157 and autoimmune hemolytic anemia158 among radiological findings ground-glass opacity mono or bilateral infiltrates mesh shadows and tiny nodules are frequently detected in severe cases radiological alterations are diffused presenting as a white lung however radiologic evidence of pneumonia might be absent in 1520 of children139140 159163 in selected cases lung ultrasound might be useful in the managing and follow-up of covid-19 infection this radiological technique can precociously identify abnormalities including small pleural effusion and subpleural consolidation and appear more available then x-ray and ct164165 clinical examination appears mostly negative for pulmonary signs and in rare cases rales and thoracic retractions have been reported161 whether pregnant women and children born to affected mothers are more likely to have a worse outcome is currently unclear maternal-infant vertical transmission has not been documented amniotic fluid cord blood neonatal throat swab and breastmilk samples from newborns delivered by infected women were tested for covid-19 and all samples tested negative166 data on the maternal and perinatal outcomes of pregnant women infected with covid-19 is limited most pregnant women with covid-19 present with fever and coughing severe and critical maternal symptomatology have also been reported but no women died the most common adverse pregnancy outcome is preterm birth occurring in 41 of cases while the rate of perinatal death is 7 including one case of stillbirth and one neonatal death there is no data on miscarriage for covid-19 occurring during the first trimester in more than a third of cases fetal distress and frequent admission neonatal intensive care units have been reported166167 rarely cases of covid-19 positivity in newborns have been reported common symptoms are fever cough lethargy and vomiting milk mottled skin and moderate respiratory distress presented with tachycardia tachypnoea subcostal retractions and low oxygen saturation are also described in newborn babies169173 although it can be severe in some cases compared with sars-cov and mers-cov covid-19 causes less severe disease in children a recent meta-analysis shows that children infected with covid-19 have less fever than that other epidemic hcovs174 despite the rapid worldwide spread of covid-19 infection additional data are needed to define the severity of the disease in children the severity of the symptoms and the mortality rate will be better assessed in the future differential diagnosis with common viral respiratory infections of childhood such as influenza virus adenovirus respiratory syncytial virus and metapneumovirus should be considered in the diagnosis of suspected cases epidemiological and clinical criteria must be assessed7393138 rt-pcr represents the gold standard to confirm the diagnosis of hcovs infections performed on samples of respiratory secretions175181 the viral load is higher in lower respiratory tract secretion samples than in upper respiratory tract samples therefore suspected cases resulted in firstly negative could be re-tested with a second swab better if with a low respiratory sampling is performed as proved for sars and mers infection182183 currently few data have been published about the sensitivity and specificity of rt-pcr nasopharyngeal swabs for covid-19 in vitro analyses suggest that the rt-pcr test is highly specific and sensitive184 in vivo sensitivity is estimated to be higher than 70 but seems to be lower for mild cases while specificity is close to 100185186 accuracy of rt-pcr swabs in clinical practice differs depending on the site and quality of the sample taking swabs from children may be more difficult given the intrusive nature of the procedure and further reduce the specificity and sensitivity of the test rt-pcr of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid appears the most accurate technique of virologic confirmation but it may not always be easily collected in all patients especially in pediatric age although a negative test cannot currently rule out the disease further studies are needed to define the exact specificity and sensitivity of rt-pcr nasopharyngeal swabs187188 moreover rt-pcr appears to be useful in virus detection on stool samples116 to date serology is not considered a diagnostic method although most patients with covid-19 appear positive for immunoglobulin-g igg within 19 days while igm reaches a peak 2022 days after symptom onset the serological response is not useful for early individuation of positive patients189 additionally numerous cross-reactions occur between covid-19 and common hcovs190 and protective immunity against covid-19 is not proved despite its potential role in supporting rt-pcr in the diagnosis of covid-19 the clinical and immunological meaning of serology is still unclear191 the spread of the infection can be prevented if children and family members were educated about proper hygienic practices and infection control measures including regular hand washing cover the mouth with napkin or towel when coughing or sneezing avoid crowded places and contact with sick people children with hcovs should receive early supportive therapy and continuous monitoring additional oxygen caloric and hydro electrolytic support should be performed if necessary frequent checks of oxygen saturation and hematological urinary and biochemical parameters including liver kidney myocardial enzymes and coagulation parameters should be analyzed finally blood gas analysis and radiological diagnostics of the chest should be done when necessary this strategy could be useful in the prevention of ards multiorgan failure and other nosocomial infections possibly treated if bacterial with appropriate antibiotics in critical cases mechanical ventilation with endotracheal intubation and other more invasive interventions such as blood purification and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation emco should be adopted additionally the use of antiviral drugs in children with severe hcovs infections may help to reduce viral load and the duration of symptoms however their safety and real effectiveness have not yet been proven interferon alfa and beta corticosteroids lopinavirritonavir and ribavirin were used in the treatment of sars-cov and mers- cov in adults and children75 76 78 192 however ribavirin can cause hemolytic anemia and liver dysfunction as well as corticosteroids increase the risk of iatrogenic immune immunosuppression193 to date there is no evidence regarding the management and treatment of covid-19 infection in children in addition to supportive therapy the use of nebulized interferon-alpha-2b and oral lopinavirritonavir together with corticosteroids for complications and hydroxychloroquine or intravenous immunoglobulin for severe cases have been suggested145 194 recently a position paper of the italian society of pediatric infectious disease on the treatment of children with covid-19 infection has been published195 in asymptomatic or mild cases only antipyretic therapy is recommended in severe or critical cases the use of hydroxychloroquine  azithromycin or lopinavirritonavir must be considered immunomodulating therapy with methylprednisolone or tocilizumab or anakinra must be considered in case of the simultaneous presence of ards or progressive deterioration of respiratory function the elevation of proinflammatory biomarkers and an interval of at least seven days from symptoms onset supportive therapy should include antipyretic therapy inhalation therapy with topical steroids andor bronchodilators and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis therapy196203 discharge from the hospital is recommended when the patient is without fever for almost three days respiratory symptoms have improved and rt-pcr samples are negative195 most cases of hcovs infection in children have clinically mild symptoms and a relatively short time to resolution children seem to have a better prognosis compared to adults and death is a sporadic event however some children such as infants adolescents or those with underlying diseases may be more at-risk categories and require greater caution from clinicians learning to recognize pediatric clinical presentations often indefinite or similar to other typical infections of this age allows clinicians to perform a correct and early diagnosis and prevent the spread of infections in the general population furthermore the psychological and social impact of the pandemic outbreak should be considered especially in the pediatric age moreover we think it is necessary to implement innovative clinical tools such as narrative medicine to recognize the burden of disease in children and caregivers201204  pathogenesis of covid-19 from the perspective of the damage-response framework liise-anne pirofski arturo casadevall thomas morrison e danielle garsin a   in late 2019 a new disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 emerged in china that is now known as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 as of the time of this writing almost seven million cases have been reported globally in a pandemic that will potentially affect billions despite being recognized only 6 months ago clinical information is rapidly becoming available covid-19 is most severe in older individuals and those with preexisting conditions in contrast for most children covid-19 appears to be mild or asymptomatic although it is still early in the pandemic and much information is preliminary there are sufficient data available to analyze the clinical manifestations and possible pathogenesis of covid-19 in the context of the damage-response framework drf the drf represents a theory of microbial pathogenesis first proposed in 1999 which views host damage as the relevant outcome of host-microbe interactions and posits that host damage stems from microbial traits or the host immune response or both 1 in the drf the relationship between host damage and the immune response is represented by a simple upright parabola whereby host damage is plotted on the y axis as a function of the immune response ranging from weak on the left to strong on the right 2 the drf has been useful in advancing understanding of infectious diseases 1 and providing insight into infectious diseases that occur in the setting of weak or strong immune responses such as candidiasis and cryptococcosis 35 the drf has also informed our understanding of host susceptibility to infectious diseases 6 and can be a valuable tool for teaching microbial pathogenesis and infectious diseases 7 according to the drf clinical signs and symptoms manifest themselves when host damage reaches a threshold that impairs homeostasis in covid-19 clinical symptoms range from a mild upper respiratory tract-like illness to a life-threatening acute respiratory syndrome 8 in the latter oxygenation is compromised by pulmonary inflammation a reflection of host damage coronaviruses damage infected cells and trigger the production of proinflammatory cytokines which elicit inflammation that damages host cells and tissues locally and at a distance any inflammatory response in the lungs has the potential to cripple their primary function of gas exchange the pulmonary failure associated with severe cases of covid-19 is the result of lung damage caused by inflammation of the airways 9 although neurological mechanisms and thromboembolism are also contributing factors 10 11 while virus is likely to be present in the lungs lung damage from sars-cov-2 is most likely due to both viral and host factors although their relative contributions are currently unknown the emergence of covid-19 was preceded by two other outbreaks of coronaviruses in 2003 and 2012 caused by sars-cov-1 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov respectively these two viruses have been studied extensively in recent years until comparable information from studies of sars-cov-2 is available the experience with sars-cov-1 and mers-cov provides the most important clues to the pathogenesis of the severe coronavirus-related disease caused by covid-19 like covid-19 severe disease in both sars and mers involved respiratory failure analysis of viral burden in those with the most severe disease showed that their viral titers were declining 12 this is consistent with the concept that an overexuberant immune response contributed to lung damage experiments in animal models showed that highly human-pathogenic coronaviruses such as the agents of sars and mers exhibit rapid viral replication in the lungs that triggers a proinflammatory cytokine response that in turn elicits an inflammatory cell infiltrate that damages the lung 13 hence for sars and mers lung damage that affected pulmonary function and host survival had a strong component of immune-mediated damage although only a few immunocompromised patients have been reported in the sars and mers literature two cases suggest that the disease may have been milder in those with impaired immunity perhaps supporting the idea that lung damage follows a strong immune response a patient with aids was reported to have a mild case of sars a fact attributed to the weakened condition of the immune system of the patient having resulted in a lack of severe disease 14 an early case report describing sars-cov-2 infection in persons with hiv infection did not compare the severity of the disease to that seen in hiv-uninfected persons 15 notably a bone marrow transplant recipient on immunosuppressive therapy suffered only mild sars after infection with sars-cov-1 16 these reports support the idea that exuberant inflammation may be the primary driver of lung damage in patients with covid-19 while this concept requires further investigation as there are currently no data on the course of covid-19 in immunocompromised patients it is consistent with findings in fatal cases during the h1n1 pandemic in which inflammatory damage in the lungs occurred in the absence of significant viral particles 17 on the other hand older age and low lymphocyte counts as well as elevated levels of inflammatory markers were associated with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with covid-19 in wuhan china 18 although the relationships among immune suppression the inflammatory response and lung damage in covid-19 remain to be unraveled the link between elevated inflammatory markers and respiratory failure has led to the use of immunosuppressive agents ranging from corticosteroids to inhibitors of cytokines such as interleukin-6 il-6 and other inflammatory mediators 19 the rapidly evolving clinical picture of covid-19 presents a series of observations that include the followingprevalence and severity of the disease increase with agemany if not most infections are asymptomatic or produce only mild diseaseasymptomatic infected individuals can transmit sars-cov-2 implying viral sheddingindividuals with cardiovascular disease diabetes obesity diabetes and pulmonary disease have higher mortalitycovid-19 disease is less severe and may be asymptomatic in children but a small minority develop a multisystem inflammatory syndrome with similarities to kawasakis diseasesudden deterioration with progressive pulmonary failure can occur in younger individualsthe incidence and severity of disease are higher in men than in womendeath is usually the result of anoxia due to pulmonary failure although there is increasing evidence of dysfunction in other organs including heart kidneys and tissues affected by dysregulated coagulation and thrombosis
 the drf framework posits that host damage can occur in the setting of either a weak or a strong immune response an important caveat when considering the strength of the immune response and disease in the context of the drf is that strong immune responses are not necessarily protective if they damage tissue by inducing exuberant inflammatory responses irrespective of whether they clear the microbe thus considering host damage as a function of immune response is a conceptual approach that provides a roadmap for incorporation of viral load and host inflammation into an understanding of the clinical manifestations and pathogenesis of covid-19 the observation that many sars-cov-2 infections are asymptomatic or result in mild disease implies that the immune response in such individuals controls the virus without eliciting damage that translates into clinical manifestations in contrast the manifestations of covid-19 that occur in aged persons andor those with pulmonary cardiac and endocrine conditions are likely to reflect a different immune response that may result in a degree of damage that increases disease severity the immune response of those with comorbidity conditions may be weaker and less effective in clearing virus aging is known to be associated with weaker immunity 6 similarly pulmonary disease cardiac disease and endocrine disease are each associated with organ andor tissue damage that can impair local immune responses and increase the likelihood of viral dissemination and progressive disease men are also known to be more vulnerable to many infectious diseases than women due to stronger immune responses in women 20 hence weaker immune responses might explain the observation that covid-19 is more severe in the aged the chronically ill and men the relative rarity of symptomatic covid-19 disease in children infected with sars-cov-2 21 is striking a report from china revealed that 79 of children either were asymptomatic or had mild disease 22 and in italy only 12 of children seen in emergency departments with positive tests for sars-cov-2 were ill 23 the mean age of these children was 33 years this is notable since young children are often more susceptible than adults to respiratory viruses that cause pneumonia such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus the increased susceptibility of infants and young children to infectious diseases is often attributed to their having immature immune systems as exemplified by their inability to mount antibody responses to polysaccharides before age 2 however mers was often asymptomatic in children except those who were immunocompromised 24 similarly children were found to be susceptible to but less likely to have severe disease with sars-cov-1 25 thus the immune response of children to these betacoronaviruses may differ from that of adults it has been hypothesized that one factor contributing to the relative paucity of severe disease in children may be a higher percentage of cd4 t cells 26 this is consistent with the idea that the immune systems of children may contain sars-cov-2 more efficiently leading to less damage however a study in wuhan found that infants and younger children were more likely to have severe disease than older children 22 suggesting that age-related differences in the immune response may play an important role in containment of sars-cov-2 it is also possible that children have a different distribution of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 the receptor for sars-cov-2 27 another possibility is that childrens immune systems do not react with a degree of intensity that causes tissue damage because they have not experienced multiple infections with other endemic human coronaviruses if this is the case the more severe disease observed in older individuals could reflect exuberant immune responses fueled by immunological memory of prior coronavirus infections however some children infected with sars-cov-2 develop an inflammatory vasculitis known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children mis-c with features resembling those associated with kawasakis disease 28 although this syndrome has been described only recently and little is known about its pathogenesis the clinical findings are those of a severe vasculitis triggered by inflammation which again implicates strong immune responses in another facet of covid-19 disease the finding that most sars-cov-2 infections are asymptomatic and that asymptomatic individuals can transmit the virus to others has important implications for the pathogenesis of this disease the issue of asymptomatic transmission of other respiratory microbes remains a subject of intense study 29 30 the presence of high levels of sars-cov-2 in the upper respiratory tract is believed to explain the efficiency of asymptomatic transmission 31 transmission by persons without symptoms means that sars-cov-2 replicates to a level sufficient to be acquired by another person without damaging host tissues sufficiently to trigger clinical signs and symptoms this also implies that for some individuals repeated cycles of viral replication do not translate into damage that results in symptoms notably sars-cov-2 antibody levels were lower in hospitalized patients with less-severe disease suggesting that there is more to learn about relationships among viral load the immune response and disease manifestations 32 the main clinical manifestation of severe covid-19 is pulmonary deterioration this often occurs in individuals with high levels of proinflammatory cytokines in whom a cytokine storm is believed to drive disease pathogenesis in support of this hypothesis patients with more-severe covid-19 had higher serum levels of il-2r il-6 il-10 and tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf- than patients with milder disease 33 however they also had lymphopenia suggesting the presence of cytokine storm may reflect a failure of cellular immunity to contain the virus the association of cytokine storm with severe disease and mortality has led to the use of various immunosuppressive agents in patients with elevated inflammatory markers 34 although it is too early to assume that the association of elevated inflammatory markers with severe covid-19 implies causation clinical deterioration in the setting of a strong proinflammatory response is consistent with host damage from an overexuberant immune response in summary covid-19 is more severe in people who are likely to have impaired immunity such as the aged andor those with comorbidity conditions 35 this supports the concept that in such individuals weak or impaired immune responses may predispose to the development of disease consistent with this hypothesis are data associating lymphopenia and low t cell levels 36 with severe disease and the observation that the prevalence of disease is lower in women who mount stronger immune responses than men in contrast the association of high levels of proinflammatory mediators and cytokine storm with disease severity 37 histologic findings of inflammation an inflammatory prothrombotic state and an absence of viral inclusions in some postmortem reports 3840 suggest that the immune response is itself a major contributor to host damage in covid-19 in this paradigm the asymptomatic to less-severe responses of younger people without comorbidities and of children may reflect a balanced immune response that clears virus without inducing inflammatory damage the drf provides the ideal paradigm to delve deeper into the pathogenesis of covid-19 by placing its different clinical manifestations on the axes of a parabola to account for their occurrence as a function of host susceptibility and the immune response fig 1 in this schema individuals are categorized into three groups group i consists of individuals with comorbid conditions that may impair the immune response the response of these individuals is located on the left side of the parabola indicating they may develop higher viral burdens and may be at greater risk for progression to severe disease due to an inability to contain the virus in the nasopharynx in some such individuals unchecked viral proliferation may trigger an excessive inflammatory response that further damages the lungs and progresses to pulmonary failure this would indicate a transition to group iii see below in some progressive disease is also characterized by hematological dyscrasia coagulation abnormalities and multiorgan failure which may stem from immune dysregulation in contrast those who do not progress to pulmonary failure may be able to mount an effective response that eventually contains the virus leading to recovery group i also includes immunologically intact individuals who acquired a large inoculum that overwhelmed local defenses resulting in a de facto weak immune response group ii consists of individuals who are infected with sars-cov-2 and remain asymptomatic or manifest only mild disease for such individuals the immune response contains the viral inoculum and subsequent viral replication occurs without leading to a degree of damage that alters homeostasis these individuals have mild or no symptoms of covid-19 although they may transmit virus to others this group also includes children most of whom exhibit mild to no disease manifestations and possibly some pregnant women who may also be asymptomatic 41 group iii consists of individuals from group i whose decompensated disease outcome is the result of an excessive immune response as well as individuals who mount an excessive initial inflammatory response to infection resulting in cytokine storm pulmonary failure progressive organ damage and death the mode of infection for sars-cov-2 is generally accepted to be introduction through the respiratory tract diagnosis is made by pcr detection of viral nucleic acids in the upper respiratory airways usually the nasopharynx at this time definitive statements about the relationships between nasopharyngeal virus pneumonia and disease are difficult to make because the pcr test may be associated with false-negative results 42 with this caveat we note that asymptomatic group i individuals may be positive for nasopharyngeal virus 43 44 those in groups ii and iii manifest clinical signs and symptoms of disease that range from cough to respiratory failure at this time the temporal relationship between nasopharyngeal infection and pneumonia is not well understood but it is clear that in some individuals upper airway infection precedes pneumonia while in others there is radiographic evidence of pneumonia with negative nasopharyngeal pcr test results 45 the relationship between nasopharyngeal virus and pneumonia may vary depending on the site of initial infection infection from large droplets that settle in upper airways or fomites could lead to initial nasopharyngeal infection that subsequently spreads to the lungs on the other hand infection from small droplets that reach alveoli would produce lung-first infection that could subsequently reach the upper airways the relationship between the initial infection site in lung or nasopharyngeal sites and outcomes in groups i to iii is unknown as progression to disease would depend on rates of viral replication and the nature of the immune response another way to apply the drf to covid-19 is to consider host damage as a function of time using this approach we can organize the outcome of host-virus interaction into discrete states associated with known outcomes of sars-cov-2 infection fig 2 the drf defines four states to describe the outcome of host-microbe interaction commensalism colonization persistence latency chronicity and disease 2 46 the states of colonization and commensalism are the same when the amount of damage from the host-microbe interaction is nil latency is a recognized state that follows infection with some viruses although colonization is not a term commonly used to describe viral infections use of the term in this context helps us to define the outcome of host-virus interaction and to characterize host damage as a function of time for sars-cov-2 we can think of the time that the virus is replicating in the nasopharynx of an infected individual as representing a state of colonization during that period the amount of damage that the host experiences is below the threshold that translates into symptoms thus the person is asymptomatic and yet is able to transmit virus ie is in a contagious state this is the reason that the cdc recommended that all persons wear masks in public 47 namely to lessen the chance that an asymptomatic person would transmit the virus to others colonization can elicit an immune response that leads to sars-cov-2 elimination and resolution of infection or a response that leads to progressive host damage and disease disease leads to death when host damage is irreparable and compromises vital organ function at this time we do not know if there is a chronic persistent state that would correspond to the state of latency an important tenet of the drf is that strong immune responses do not necessarily represent effective immune responses in fact they can be deleterious to the host by mediating inflammatory damage if they eradicate the microbe or if they fail to do so to make this point for covid-19 we consider parallels between pneumocystis pneumonia pcp in patients with hiv-aids and in patients with comorbidities and covid-19 for both covid-19 and pcp severe disease is accompanied by exuberant pulmonary inflammation that impairs gas exchange and is life-threatening in pcp severely immunocompromised individuals develop a progressive pneumonia associated with hypoxia pulmonary failure and death as alveolar inflammation compromises oxygenation addition of corticosteroid therapy significantly improves survival of hiv-infected persons with hypoxia due to pcp 48 initially the use of corticosteroids in pcp was frowned upon because it involved giving an immunosuppressive drug to patients with profound immunosuppression today the beneficial use of corticosteroids in pcp is a standard of care per the following schema hiv-associated immune impairment  replication of pneumocystis spp in the lungs  increase in levels of fungal antigens  florid immune response  pneumonia  impaired oxygenation we propose that a similar sequence of events may occur in severe covid-19 in those with preexisting cardiovascular and pulmonary disease and the aged except that there is an increased viral burden instead of an increased fungal burden like the intense inflammation seen in cases of hiv-associated pcp the extensive lung inflammation in patients with covid-19 who have conditions associated with impaired immunity may seem paradoxical however it is worth noting that impaired immunity includes dysregulated immune responses that are often characterized by chronic andor inappropriate inflammation hence as noted above individuals in group i include those who mount a weak andor inadequate response to sars-cov-2 infection that leads to immune responses that result in transition to the type of damage seen in individuals in group iii as indicated by the line in fig 1 another disease with a clinical course that has some parallels to covid-19 is pneumococcal pneumonia in the preantibiotic era descriptions of this disease noted progressive symptoms with a crisis at 7 to 8 days that was associated with the appearance of serum antibody and agglutinins that was temporally associated with defervescence and recovery 49 50 in contrast an inability to mount an effective antibody response was associated with extrapulmonary dissemination and a systemic inflammatory syndrome that often led to death the clinical course of covid-19 may also have a turning point after an initial phase of fever and cough that is followed by either clinical improvement or deterioration that can progress to pulmonary failure the mediators andor correlates of this turning point in covid-19 are not currently known the turning point of covid-19 has parallels to sars1 as well as to 2009 pandemic h1n1 in those diseases the immune system either eliminated the virus without triggering damage resulting in an asymptomatic state or triggered inflammation and damage resulting in respiratory failure severe covid-19 and other pulmonary infectious diseases such as pneumocystis infection pneumococcal disease and influenza h1n1 virus and sars1 virus pneumonia are each notable for clinical manifestations that are largely driven by inflammatory damage despite being caused by a fungus bacterium and viruses respectively and for pneumocystis infection pneumococcus disease and influenza the availability of effective antimicrobial therapy these parallels highlight the ability of the drf to deconstruct microbial pathogenesis in a way that illuminates the role of the host in mediating damage that translates into clinical manifestations hence for covid-19 like the other pulmonary diseases the inflammatory response makes a critical contribution to host damage and avoidance or abrogation of this damage should be an important component of therapeutic strategies considering the pathogenesis of covid-19 through the lens of the drf provides a roadmap for therapeutic approaches to this disease the therapeutic goal is to reduce host damage which would reduce the prevalence and severity of disease and translate into reduced mortality currently there are no validated therapies for covid-19 but many are under development and investigation therapeutic approaches can be broadly placed into three groups depending on whether the primary goal is to target the virus or the host immune response or both with the important caveat that antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects are interdependent such that a strategy that targets one is likely to also affect the other i antiviral the ability of small molecules that interfere with hiv herpesvirus and hepatitis virus replication to treat diseases caused by these viruses established the principle that drugs that target the virus can be effective in viral diseases today numerous compounds are under investigation that target viral replication and there is confidence that effective antiviral compounds against sars-cov-2 will be developed from the viewpoint of the drf these drugs function by reducing viral burden which can reduce virus-mediated tissue damage and avert or reduce the development of organ-damaging inflammatory responses one such drug is remdesivir an antiviral agent that received emergency authorization for use in covid-19 51 although the effect of remdesivir on sars-cov-2 viral load in patients has not been published it ameliorated disease in mers coronavirus-infected macaques by inhibiting viral replication 52 and was recently shown to reduce lung viral loads in macaques 66 ii immunomodulator this class of agents modifies the course of disease by affecting the immune response and moving the individuals immune response to either the right or the left along the x axis of the drf parabola fig 3 given what we know about the pathogenesis of covid-19 immune modulators that enhance the immune response would be contraindicated although one can imagine potential usefulness in individuals at the extreme left of the parabola if they are unable to mount an effective antiviral response in this regard we note that although interferons are critical for an effective immune response against coronaviruses their therapeutic role in experimental and clinical disease is uncertain and could be detrimental 53 possibly because we currently cannot identify the group of patients on the left of the parabola who would benefit from this intervention on the other hand there are ongoing clinical trials with anti-inflammatory drugs targeted to various inflammatory mediators such as il-6 including tocilizumab and high-dose intravenous gamma globulin 54 the idea behind the use of these agents is to inhibit the development of damage mediated by the host inflammatory response targeting inflammation proved successful for pneumocystis pneumonia some studies support the use of corticosteroids in bacterial pneumonia and there is anecdotal evidence for the efficacy of immune modulators such as statins in viral pneumonias 55 56 steroids are used widely for covid-19 and a press release from a large randomized clinical trial recovery reported that they reduced mortality in patients requiring oxygen supplementation httpswwwrecoverytrialnetfilesrecoverydexamethasonestatement160620v2finalpdf from the viewpoint of the drf immune modulating agents such as corticosteroids reduce inflammatory damage and shift the curve to the left fig 3 although immune modulating agents do not target the virus directly the hope is that by reducing host damage the host will gain time to mount effective antiviral responses that lead to viral elimination and recovery however given the cascade of inflammation that may extend to complement and noncytokinenonchemokine mediators the use of two or more types of immune modulator might be necessary to harness and extinguish sars-cov-2-mediated immune dysregulation the concern about the use of steroids and other agents that suppress the immune response in covid-19 is that they may inhibit antiviral activity andor increase the likelihood of superinfection with bacteria and fungi clinicians must be vigilant and aware of the latter the ability to identify those patients who would most benefit from moving to the left on the drf parabola would help clinicians administer such agents with more confidence iii specific immunoglobulins the only compounds that reliably target both the virus and the immune response are specific immunoglobulins as they have both virus-specific neutralizing and protean effects on the immune response ranging from activation of fc receptors and complement to enabling antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity there is an extensive body of evidence supporting the efficacy of convalescent plasma to treat viral pneumonias that dates back to the 1918 epidemic although most reports case series and uncontrolled studies have been favorable 5759 the approach has not been tested in large randomized controlled trials we have proposed that this approach be considered and tested 60 61 and there is some evidence for its usefulness against covid-19 6265 analysis of covid-19 patients in the context of the drf suggests that the optimal therapeutic approach should depend on where their immune response lies on the parabola although all patients with covid-19 may benefit from antiviral agents that target sars-cov-2 optimal therapy is likely to also require agents that reduce host damage by modulating the immune response and moving the patients position to the left along the x axis treatment with immune modulating drugs may be important for those individuals with either insufficient or overexuberant immune responses that result in severe damage and disease the drf suggests a way to identify patients for clinical trials of investigational therapies particularly for agents that affect the immune response clearly individuals with covid-19 in groups i and iii are likely to respond differently to immune modulating drugs even when presenting with similar clinical conditions 7 as we gain a greater understanding of the way in which the clinical manifestations of covid-19 reflect viral factors and the host immune response it will be possible to develop algorithms that place affected individuals on the parabola to guide and optimize approaches to therapy the drf makes it possible to assemble the diverse manifestations of covid-19 into one synthesis that explains the pathogenesis and clinical outcomes of this disease as a function of the host immune response the drf also provides a schema to design therapy based on anticipated effects on disease pathogenesis and host response and how they affect the position of the patient on the x axis of the drf parabola the drf is flexible and will be able to accommodate new information as we learn more about covid-19 for example between the date when this paper was first submitted for publication and its revision mis-c which the drf places on the right side of the parabola and the promise of corticosteroids in patients requiring supplemental oxygen were described most importantly placing covid-19 in the context of the drf can stimulate new thought concerning the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 as a function of the host immune response this provides a dynamic approach to research and therapy of this complex disease based on consideration of how to move patients immune responses from a state of disease to one of health  middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease is rare in children an update from saudi arabia jaffar al-tawfiq a rana kattan f ziad memish a   middle east respiratory syndrome-coronavirus mers-cov was first isolated in 2012 from a patient in the kingdom of saudi arabia ksa1 as more cases were reported the case fatality rate changed to 40 from 602-5 in addition initially there was a predominance of males later this ratio decreased26 mers-cov is characterized by three different patterns of disease sporadic cases intra-familial transmission7-9 and health care associated infection2310-16 despite the increased number overtime and the multiple health care associated outbreaks17 the number of pediatric cases remained low during the study period18 the initial description of 47 cases included only a 14-year-old child4 the first pediatric case was a 2-year-old child reported from jeddah ksa on june 28 201319 later an additional three asymptomatic children were reported4 the largest report of childhood mers-cov cases included eleven of which two patients were symptomatic and nine were asymptomatic18 the exact reason for this low prevalence of the disease in children is not known in this study we summarize the reported mers-cov cases and the associated clinical presentation and the outcome relevant data were placed into an excel sheet and analyzed accordingly descriptive analytic statistics were used in the final analysis as deemed necessary including mean and standard deviation when applicable and frequency the statistical review of the study was performed by a biomedical statistician statistical review is performed before the submission of the manuscript from june 2012 to april 19 2016 there were a total of 31 pediatric mers-cov cases as shown in table 1 of all the cases thirteen 13 or 42 were asymptomatic and there were 17 males 10 females and 4 unreported a male to female ratio of 171 the mean age of patients was 98  54 075-17 years twenty-five cases 806 were reported from ksa the other patients were in jordan united arab emirates and the republic of korea table 1 the most common source of the infection was household contact 10 of 15 with reported source and 5 patients acquired the infection within a health care facility about one half of the cases were reported in 2014 and 29 were reported in 2013 and 226 in 2015 table 2 screening of pediatric patients for mers-cov infection using real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction showed that only 9 out of 552 16 were positive in ksa23 however serologic testing of pediatric patients admitted with lower respiratory tract infection in jordan and saudi arabia revealed no positive tests2425 table 3 the effect of mers-cov infection on the fetus was described in eight cases26-29 as summarized in table 4 the mean age of the mothers was 3225  34 years and the mean gestational age was 284  63 wk death of the fetus was observed in 3 375 of the 8 fetuses despite the total number of mers cases increasing especially in ksa the number of pediatric cases remained low during the study period initially the testing in ksa was directed towards hospitalized patients with severe pneumonia in 2015 the saudi ministry of health added a specific case definition for mers-cov infection in children30 the definition includes those  14 years meets the adult case definition and has either a history of exposure to a confirmed or suspected mers-cov in the proceeding 14 d or a history of contact with camels or camel products in the proceeding 14 d30 the case definition also includes children with unexplained severe pneumonia30 the 2015 change in the case definition does not account for the low rate of childhood mers-cov infection as 33 of the cases were reported in 2014 before the case definition was changed one of the reasons for an increased number of cases in 2014 during the jeddah outbreak was increased testing of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients11 the pattern of mers-cov pediatric cases was similar to the 2003 sars outbreak children were less affected than adults and children less than 2 years of age had milder disease31 in the largest screening of contacts the rate of mers-cov positive children 16 9616 compared to 22 994440 in adults p  02323 thus in this study utilizing mers-cov pcr the positivity rate did not differ in children and adults in adults with mers-cov infections three patterns of transmissions were observed sporadic primary cases presumed to be due to animal exposure mainly camels household contacts or health care associated infections32 in ksa the majority 45 of cases were health care-associated infections 38 were primary cases and 13 were household contacts32 in contrast in the majority of pediatric cases that reported source of acquisition 667 of the 15 with reported source the disease was acquired through household contact this pattern indicates a low exposure of children to animals and a higher rate of health care associated infections in adult wards the male to female ratio 281 and 331 was initially high34 this apparent male predominance could be explained by the nature of hospital outbreaks2 eventually the male to female ratio was reduced to 131 to 18156 consistent with these studies the male to female ratio in children with mers-cov was 171 and may indicate similar exposure of children to index cases in the household settings and differential host factors possible explanations for the lower number of pediatric cases compared to adults include differential testing of adult patients and milder diseases in children although serologic testing of pediatric patients in ksa and jordan did not reveal any positive cases2425 in the largest sero-epidemiologic survey in ksa the study did not include children and thus it is difficult to establish the rate of sero-positivity in children31 the mers-cov infection rate in children remains low and possible explanations include a milder disease in children asymptomatic infection or the presence of yet to be identified factors the development of a shorter duration of mers in children is another possible explanation if this is the case it may limit the development of a positive serology in one study delayed antibody responses as measured with the neutralization test was associated with severe diseases33 the longevity of antibodies in mers-cov cases might be limited as was the case with sars3334 the only study of serology among children was done among hospitalized pediatric cases who presented with lower respiratory tract infections25 there is no systematic screening of exposed children using serologic testing this limited the interpretation of available serologic studies little data also exist regarding the effect and the likelihood of mers-cov in pregnancy eight cases were reported262729 the outcome was favorable in the majority of cases the exact prevalence of mers-cov antibodies and exposure of pregnant women to mers-cov is not known in conclusion the number of mers-cov infections in pediatric patients remains low possible explanations include low exposure presence of asymptomatic mildly symptomatic patients or the presence of yet to be identified factors the immune system predisposing to severe disease and to fatal outcome remains unknown an exploration of the virus-host interaction may add to the understanding of the low prevalence in this age group middle east respiratory syndrome-coronavirus mers-cov was first isolated in 2012 from a patient in the kingdom of saudi arabia ksa despite the increased number of mers-cov cases overtime the number of pediatric cases remained low the exact reason for this low prevalence of the disease in children is not known the aim of this study is to summarize the reported mers-cov cases and the associated clinical presentation and the outcome the first pediatric case was a two-year-old child reported from jeddah ksa on june 28 2013 later an additional three asymptomatic children were reported the largest report of childhood mers-cov cases included eleven including nine asymptomatic cases the number of mers-cov infections in pediatric patients remains low possible explanations include low exposure presence of asymptomatic mildly symptomatic patients or the presence of yet to be identified factors the immune system predisposing to severe disease and to fatal outcome remains unknown an exploration of the virus-host interaction may add to the understanding of the low prevalence in this age group despite the low number of pediatric mers-cov cases it is important to continue to monitor the development of this disease in this age group and to understand the risk factors mers-cov is a new emerging virus that was first isolated in 2012 this complication of all known pediatric cases is a useful contribution to the medical literature and knowing it is possible but rare is important  a review of coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 tanu singhal   the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov or the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 sars-cov-2 as it is now called is rapidly spreading from its origin in wuhan city of hubei province of china to the rest of the world 1 till 05032020 around 96000 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and 3300 deaths have been reported 2 india has reported 29 cases till date fortunately so far children have been infrequently affected with no deaths but the future course of this virus is unknown this article gives a birds eye view about this new virus since knowledge about this virus is rapidly evolving readers are urged to update themselves regularly coronaviruses are enveloped positive sense rna viruses ranging from 60 nm to 140 nm in diameter with spike like projections on its surface giving it a crown like appearance under the electron microscope hence the name coronavirus 3 four corona viruses namely hku1 nl63 229e and oc43 have been in circulation in humans and generally cause mild respiratory disease there have been two events in the past two decades wherein crossover of animal betacorona viruses to humans has resulted in severe disease the first such instance was in 20022003 when a new coronavirus of the  genera and with origin in bats crossed over to humans via the intermediary host of palm civet cats in the guangdong province of china this virus designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus affected 8422 people mostly in china and hong kong and caused 916 deaths mortality rate 11 before being contained 4 almost a decade later in 2012 the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov also of bat origin emerged in saudi arabia with dromedary camels as the intermediate host and affected 2494 people and caused 858 deaths fatality rate 34 5 in december 2019 adults in wuhan capital city of hubei province and a major transportation hub of china started presenting to local hospitals with severe pneumonia of unknown cause many of the initial cases had a common exposure to the huanan wholesale seafood market that also traded live animals the surveillance system put into place after the sars outbreak was activated and respiratory samples of patients were sent to reference labs for etiologic investigations on december 31st 2019 china notified the outbreak to the world health organization and on 1st january the huanan sea food market was closed on 7th january the virus was identified as a coronavirus that had 95 homology with the bat coronavirus and  70 similarity with the sars- cov environmental samples from the huanan sea food market also tested positive signifying that the virus originated from there 7 the number of cases started increasing exponentially some of which did not have exposure to the live animal market suggestive of the fact that human-to-human transmission was occurring 8 the first fatal case was reported on 11th jan 2020 the massive migration of chinese during the chinese new year fuelled the epidemic cases in other provinces of china other countries thailand japan and south korea in quick succession were reported in people who were returning from wuhan transmission to healthcare workers caring for patients was described on 20th jan 2020 by 23rd january the 11 million population of wuhan was placed under lock down with restrictions of entry and exit from the region soon this lock down was extended to other cities of hubei province cases of covid-19 in countries outside china were reported in those with no history of travel to china suggesting that local human-to-human transmission was occurring in these countries 9 airports in different countries including india put in screening mechanisms to detect symptomatic people returning from china and placed them in isolation and testing them for covid-19 soon it was apparent that the infection could be transmitted from asymptomatic people and also before onset of symptoms therefore countries including india who evacuated their citizens from wuhan through special flights or had travellers returning from china placed all people symptomatic or otherwise in isolation for 14 d and tested them for the virus cases continued to increase exponentially and modelling studies reported an epidemic doubling time of 18 d 10 in fact on the 12th of february china changed its definition of confirmed cases to include patients with negative pending molecular tests but with clinical radiologic and epidemiologic features of covid-19 leading to an increase in cases by 15000 in a single day 6 as of 05032020 96000 cases worldwide 80000 in china and 87 other countries and 1 international conveyance 696 in the cruise ship diamond princess parked off the coast of japan have been reported 2 it is important to note that while the number of new cases has reduced in china lately they have increased exponentially in other countries including south korea italy and iran of those infected 20 are in critical condition 25 have recovered and 3310 3013 in china and 297 in other countries have died 2 india which had reported only 3 cases till 232020 has also seen a sudden spurt in cases by 532020 29 cases had been reported mostly in delhi jaipur and agra in italian tourists and their contacts one case was reported in an indian who traveled back from vienna and exposed a large number of school children in a birthday party at a city hotel many of the contacts of these cases have been quarantined  these numbers are possibly an underestimate of the infected and dead due to limitations of surveillance and testing though the sars-cov-2 originated from bats the intermediary animal through which it crossed over to humans is uncertain pangolins and snakes are the current suspects all ages are susceptible infection is transmitted through large droplets generated during coughing and sneezing by symptomatic patients but can also occur from asymptomatic people and before onset of symptoms 9 studies have shown higher viral loads in the nasal cavity as compared to the throat with no difference in viral burden between symptomatic and asymptomatic people 12 patients can be infectious for as long as the symptoms last and even on clinical recovery some people may act as super spreaders a uk citizen who attended a conference in singapore infected 11 other people while staying in a resort in the french alps and upon return to the uk 6 these infected droplets can spread 12 m and deposit on surfaces the virus can remain viable on surfaces for days in favourable atmospheric conditions but are destroyed in less than a minute by common disinfectants like sodium hypochlorite hydrogen peroxide etc 13 infection is acquired either by inhalation of these droplets or touching surfaces contaminated by them and then touching the nose mouth and eyes the virus is also present in the stool and contamination of the water supply and subsequent transmission via aerosolizationfeco oral route is also hypothesized 6 as per current information transplacental transmission from pregnant women to their fetus has not been described 14 however neonatal disease due to post natal transmission is described 14 the incubation period varies from 2 to 14 d median 5 d studies have identified angiotensin receptor 2 ace2 as the receptor through which the virus enters the respiratory mucosa 11 the basic case reproduction rate bcr is estimated to range from 2 to 647 in various modelling studies 11 in comparison the bcr of sars was 2 and 13 for pandemic flu h1n1 2009 2 the clinical features of covid-19 are varied ranging from asymptomatic state to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi organ dysfunction the common clinical features include fever not in all cough sore throat headache fatigue headache myalgia and breathlessness conjunctivitis has also been described thus they are indistinguishable from other respiratory infections in a subset of patients by the end of the first week the disease can progress to pneumonia respiratory failure and death this progression is associated with extreme rise in inflammatory cytokines including il2 il7 il10 gcsf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf 15 the median time from onset of symptoms to dyspnea was 5 d hospitalization 7 d and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 8 d the need for intensive care admission was in 2530 of affected patients in published series complications witnessed included acute lung injury ards shock and acute kidney injury recovery started in the 2nd or 3rd wk the median duration of hospital stay in those who recovered was 10 d adverse outcomes and death are more common in the elderly and those with underlying co-morbidities 5075 of fatal cases fatality rate in hospitalized adult patients ranged from 4 to 11 the overall case fatality rate is estimated to range between 2 and 3 2 interestingly disease in patients outside hubei province has been reported to be milder than those from wuhan 17 similarly the severity and case fatality rate in patients outside china has been reported to be milder 6 this may either be due to selection bias wherein the cases reporting from wuhan included only the severe cases or due to predisposition of the asian population to the virus due to higher expression of ace2 receptors on the respiratory mucosa 11 disease in neonates infants and children has been also reported to be significantly milder than their adult counterparts in a series of 34 children admitted to a hospital in shenzhen china between january 19th and february 7th there were 14 males and 20 females the median age was 8 y 11 mo and in 28 children the infection was linked to a family member and 26 children had history of travelresidence to hubei province in china all the patients were either asymptomatic 9 or had mild disease no severe or critical cases were seen the most common symptoms were fever 50 and cough 38 all patients recovered with symptomatic therapy and there were no deaths one case of severe pneumonia and multiorgan dysfunction in a child has also been reported 19 similarly the neonatal cases that have been reported have been mild 20 a suspect case is defined as one with fever sore throat and cough who has history of travel to china or other areas of persistent local transmission or contact with patients with similar travel history or those with confirmed covid-19 infection however cases may be asymptomatic or even without fever a confirmed case is a suspect case with a positive molecular test specific diagnosis is by specific molecular tests on respiratory samples throat swab nasopharyngeal swab sputum endotracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage virus may also be detected in the stool and in severe cases the blood it must be remembered that the multiplex pcr panels currently available do not include the covid-19 commercial tests are also not available at present in a suspect case in india the appropriate sample has to be sent to designated reference labs in india or the national institute of virology in pune as the epidemic progresses commercial tests will become available other laboratory investigations are usually non specific the white cell count is usually normal or low there may be lymphopenia a lymphocyte count 1000 has been associated with severe disease the platelet count is usually normal or mildly low the crp and esr are generally elevated but procalcitonin levels are usually normal a high procalcitonin level may indicate a bacterial co-infection the altast prothrombin time creatinine d-dimer cpk and ldh may be elevated and high levels are associated with severe disease the chest x-ray cxr usually shows bilateral infiltrates but may be normal in early disease the ct is more sensitive and specific ct imaging generally shows infiltrates ground glass opacities and sub segmental consolidation it is also abnormal in asymptomatic patients patients with no clinical evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement in fact abnormal ct scans have been used to diagnose covid-19 in suspect cases with negative molecular diagnosis many of these patients had positive molecular tests on repeat testing 22 the differential diagnosis includes all types of respiratory viral infections influenza parainfluenza respiratory syncytial virus rsv adenovirus human metapneumovirus non covid-19 coronavirus atypical organisms mycoplasma chlamydia and bacterial infections it is not possible to differentiate covid-19 from these infections clinically or through routine lab tests therefore travel history becomes important however as the epidemic spreads the travel history will become irrelevant treatment is essentially supportive and symptomatic the first step is to ensure adequate isolation discussed later to prevent transmission to other contacts patients and healthcare workers mild illness should be managed at home with counseling about danger signs the usual principles are maintaining hydration and nutrition and controlling fever and cough routine use of antibiotics and antivirals such as oseltamivir should be avoided in confirmed cases in hypoxic patients provision of oxygen through nasal prongs face mask high flow nasal cannula hfnc or non-invasive ventilation is indicated mechanical ventilation and even extra corporeal membrane oxygen support may be needed renal replacement therapy may be needed in some antibiotics and antifungals are required if co-infections are suspected or proven the role of corticosteroids is unproven while current international consensus and who advocate against their use chinese guidelines do recommend short term therapy with low-to-moderate dose corticosteroids in covid-19 ards 24 25 detailed guidelines for critical care management for covid-19 have been published by the who 26 there is as of now no approved treatment for covid-19 antiviral drugs such as ribavirin lopinavir-ritonavir have been used based on the experience with sars and mers in a historical control study in patients with sars patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir with ribavirin had better outcomes as compared to those given ribavirin alone 15 in the case series of 99 hospitalized patients with covid-19 infection from wuhan oxygen was given to 76 non-invasive ventilation in 13 mechanical ventilation in 4 extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo in 3 continuous renal replacement therapy crrt in 9 antibiotics in 71 antifungals in 15 glucocorticoids in 19 and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in 27 15 antiviral therapy consisting of oseltamivir ganciclovir and lopinavir-ritonavir was given to 75 of the patients the duration of non-invasive ventilation was 422 d median 9 d and mechanical ventilation for 320 d median 17 d in the case series of children discussed earlier all children recovered with basic treatment and did not need intensive care 17 there is anecdotal experience with use of remdeswir a broad spectrum anti rna drug developed for ebola in management of covid-19 27 more evidence is needed before these drugs are recommended other drugs proposed for therapy are arbidol an antiviral drug available in russia and china intravenous immunoglobulin interferons chloroquine and plasma of patients recovered from covid-19 21 28 29 additionally recommendations about using traditional chinese herbs find place in the chinese guidelines 21 since at this time there are no approved treatments for this infection prevention is crucial several properties of this virus make prevention difficult namely non-specific features of the disease the infectivity even before onset of symptoms in the incubation period transmission from asymptomatic people long incubation period tropism for mucosal surfaces such as the conjunctiva prolonged duration of the illness and transmission even after clinical recovery isolation of confirmed or suspected cases with mild illness at home is recommended the ventilation at home should be good with sunlight to allow for destruction of virus patients should be asked to wear a simple surgical mask and practice cough hygiene caregivers should be asked to wear a surgical mask when in the same room as patient and use hand hygiene every 1520 min the greatest risk in covid-19 is transmission to healthcare workers in the sars outbreak of 2002 21 of those affected were healthcare workers 31 till date almost 1500 healthcare workers in china have been infected with 6 deaths the doctor who first warned about the virus has died too it is important to protect healthcare workers to ensure continuity of care and to prevent transmission of infection to other patients while covid-19 transmits as a droplet pathogen and is placed in category b of infectious agents highly pathogenic h5n1 and sars by the china national health commission infection control measures recommended are those for category a agents cholera plague patients should be placed in separate rooms or cohorted together negative pressure rooms are not generally needed the rooms and surfaces and equipment should undergo regular decontamination preferably with sodium hypochlorite healthcare workers should be provided with fit tested n95 respirators and protective suits and goggles airborne transmission precautions should be taken during aerosol generating procedures such as intubation suction and tracheostomies all contacts including healthcare workers should be monitored for development of symptoms of covid-19 patients can be discharged from isolation once they are afebrile for atleast 3 d and have two consecutive negative molecular tests at 1 d sampling interval this recommendation is different from pandemic flu where patients were asked to resume workschool once afebrile for 24 h or by day 7 of illness negative molecular tests were not a prerequisite for discharge at the community level people should be asked to avoid crowded areas and postpone non-essential travel to places with ongoing transmission they should be asked to practice cough hygiene by coughing in sleeve tissue rather than hands and practice hand hygiene frequently every 1520 min patients with respiratory symptoms should be asked to use surgical masks the use of mask by healthy people in public places has not shown to protect against respiratory viral infections and is currently not recommended by who however in china the public has been asked to wear masks in public and especially in crowded places and large scale gatherings are prohibited entertainment parks etc china is also considering introducing legislation to prohibit selling and trading of wild animals 32 the international response has been dramatic initially there were massive travel restrictions to china and people returning from china evacuated from china are being evaluated for clinical symptoms isolated and tested for covid-19 for 2 wks even if asymptomatic however now with rapid world wide spread of the virus these travel restrictions have extended to other countries whether these efforts will lead to slowing of viral spread is not known a candidate vaccine is under development at the time of writing this article the risk of coronavirus in india is extremely low but that may change in the next few weeks hence the following is recommendedhealthcare providers should take travel history of all patients with respiratory symptoms and any international travel in the past 2 wks as well as contact with sick people who have travelled internationallythey should set up a system of triage of patients with respiratory illness in the outpatient department and give them a simple surgical mask to wear they should use surgical masks themselves while examining such patients and practice hand hygiene frequentlysuspected cases should be referred to government designated centres for isolation and testing in mumbai at this time it is kasturba hospital commercial kits for testing are not yet available in indiapatients admitted with severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome should be evaluated for travel history and placed under contact and droplet isolation regular decontamination of surfaces should be done they should be tested for etiology using multiplex pcr panels if logistics permit and if no pathogen is identified refer the samples for testing for sars-cov-2all clinicians should keep themselves updated about recent developments including global spread of the diseasenon-essential international travel should be avoided at this timepeople should stop spreading myths and false information about the disease and try to allay panic and anxiety of the public this new virus outbreak has challenged the economic medical and public health infrastructure of china and to some extent of other countries especially its neighbours time alone will tell how the virus will impact our lives here in india more so future outbreaks of viruses and pathogens of zoonotic origin are likely to continue therefore apart from curbing this outbreak efforts should be made to devise comprehensive measures to prevent future outbreaks of zoonotic origin  predicting covid-19 spread and public health needs to contain the pandemic in west-africa beaugard taboe hmaho kolawol salako valre calistus ngonghala n romain kaka gll  the novel coronavirus pandemic is causing devastating demographic social and economic damage globally understanding current patterns of the pandemic spread and forecasting its long-term trajectory is essential in guiding policies aimed at curtailing the pandemic this is particularly important in regions with weak economies and fragile health care systems such as west-africa we formulate and use a deterministic compartmental model to i assess the current patterns of covid-19 spread in west-africa ii evaluate the impact of currently implemented control measures and iii predict the future course of the pandemic with and without currently implemented and additional control measures in west-africa an analytical expression for the threshold level of control measures involving a reduction in the effective contact rate required to eliminate the pandemic is computed considering currently applied health control measures numerical simulations of the model using baseline parameter values estimated from west-african covid-19 data project a 60 reduction in the daily number of cases when the epidemic attains its peak more reduction in the number of cases will be achieved if additional public health control measures that result in a reduction in the effective contact rate are implemented we found out that disease elimination is difficult when more asymptomatic individuals contribute in transmission or are not identified and isolated in a timely manner however maintaining a baseline level of asymptomatic isolation and a low transmission rate will lead to a significant reduction in the number of daily cases when the pandemic peaks for example at the baseline level of asymptomatic isolation at least a 53 reduction in the transmission rate is required for disease elimination while disease elimination is also possible if asymptomatic individuals are identified and isolated within 2 days after the incubation period combining two or more measures is better for disease control eg if asymptomatic humans are contact traced or identified and isolated in less than 3 days then only about a 31 reduction in the disease transmission rate is required for disease elimination furthermore we showed that the currently implemented measures caused the time-dependent effective reproduction number to reduce by approximately 37 from february 28 to august 24 2020 we conclude that covid-19 elimination requires more control measures than what is currently being applied in west-africa and that mass testing and contact tracing in order to identify and isolate asymptomatic individuals early is very important in curtailing the burden of the pandemic  a new strain of coronavirus sars-cov-2 that emerged from wuhan china is the cause of the covid-19 pandemic that is currently ravaging the world 1 2 3  as of may 12 2020  about 4 337 602 confirmed covid-19 infections and 292 451 deaths were reported worldwide 4 5 6 7  although the pandemic originated from china most of the reported cases are now from the united states of america approximately 1 408 636 infections and 83 425 deaths the epicenter of the pandemic is expected to shift to sub-saharan africa which as of may 12 2020 had reported about 46 976 confirmed cases and 1 111 deaths of these about 19 750 confirmed cases and 428 deaths were from west-africa the first confirmed west-african case was in nigeria on february 27 2020 ie approximately two months after the first case was officially announced in china 1  the highest burden of the disease in west-africa on may 12 2020 is in ghanawith about 4 700 cases and 22 deaths and nigeria with about 4641 cases and 150 deaths 8  a multilayered-risk assessment based on nine risk factors identified nigeria as the west-african country with the highest covid-19 risk 9  martinez-alvarez et al 10 projected that some west-african countries eg burkina faso and senegal might experience sharp increases in the number of covid-19 cases that are similar to those observed in european countries in march and april 2020 humans can acquire the novel coronavirus when they come into contact with contaminated surfaces or from droplets released by infectious symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals 11  mild to moderate infection symptoms of the disease include fever cough sore throat nasal congestion malaise headache muscle pain and shortness of breath or tachypnea in children in severe cases fever is associated with severe dyspnea respiratory distress and tachypnea 12  currently there is no vaccine or widely accepted drug for covid-19 therefore governments and individuals are forced to rely on public health preventive measures such as basic hygiene travel or movement restrictions social-distancing wearing masks etc current control measures being implemented in west-africa include regular hand washing with hydroalkolic solutions quarantine of suspected cases isolation of confirmed cases social distancing eg travel restrictions school closures and banning gatherings involving more than 10 people contact tracing and testing and treating identified cases additionally wearing of masks in public was recently recommended as another control measure in many countries in this region unfortunately it is difficult to implement these basic public health measures effectively in some west-african countries due to wide-spread poverty and poor investment in health care staff equipment and infrastructure for example in many west-african countries less than five hospital beds and less than two medical doctors are allocated to every group of 10 000 inhabitants 13  furthermore the annual per capita spending on health for about half of the countries in the region is less than us50 ie about 50 times below the average per capita health spending in countries like italy and spain-two european countries with high covid-19 burden 14  as a result of poor investment in health care and health care systems the region has been an epidemic hotspot for emerging and neglected tropical diseases including the ebola virus ebov lassa virus lasv and buruli ulcers in recent years 15 16  with such inadequate healthcare systems and personnel in the region the impact of covid-19 might be catastrophic to compound matters some countries in west-africa are still not well prepared to tackle this pandemic despite the observed devastating impacts and trend of the pandemic in the us and europe 10  there is therefore the need to exploit every existing tool andor develop new tools that can be useful in guiding public 2 health decision-making in the fight against the pandemic this includes developing and using new qualitative and quantitative methods such as mathematical models there has been an influx of mathematical models to assess the impact of covid-19 and to guide public health response in different cities countries and regions of the world see for example 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27  few of these mathematical model frameworks have focused on the covid-19 pandemic situation in west-africa as a whole among these few models some have focused only on one or two countries eg nigeria and ghana while others have used used basic regression or exponential growth models 25 26 to analyze and predict disease trends martinez-alvarez et al 10 used a simple graph-plot based comparative analysis of observed covid-19 data for the first 23 days of the pandemic to examine the future trajectory of the epidemic in six west-african countries burkina faso senegal nigeria cte divoire ghana and the gambia this far only one study has considered the entire region of west-africa 27  in this study a co-variate-based instrumental variable regression framework was used to predict the number of disease cases 28 million by june 30 2020 and to assess the epidemiological socio-economic and health system readiness of the region to the pandemic in this study we develop a new susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered seir-type mathematical model for covid-19 in west-africa and use it to i study the current transmission pattern of covid-19 ii evaluate the impact of currently implemented public health control measures such contact tracing social distancing and use of face masks on covid-19 transmission and iii predict the future course of the pandemic with and without currently implemented and additional control measures in west-africa in addition to incorporating various basic public health control measures in our model it accounts for asymptomatic infectious individuals -a class of individuals that render disease control more difficult since they do not exhibit clinical disease symptoms although they contribute to disease transmission 21  to our knowledge this is the first study that has used an explicit seir-type compartmental mathematical model together with data for the west-african pandemic period from february 28 2020 to april 23 2020 to understand the spread of the covid-19 pandemic in the region assess the impact of current control measures and discuss possible further control measures that might be required to better control the pandemic in the region we develop a deterministic seir-type model framework where the entire population of west-africa is subdivided in four categories susceptible s exposed e infectious asymptomatic i a  infectious symptomatic i s  infectious at treatment or isolation centres i c  and recovered r the model accounts for public health control measures that lead to a reduction in the force of infection  such as social distancing and face mask use following the approach in ngonghala et al 17 we model the force of infection as 1   a i a   s i s   c i c s  e  i a  i s  r where  k k  a s c is the disease transmission rate by individuals in the i k class and 0    1 is the percentage reduction in disease transmission due to public health control measures such as social distancing and face masks use note that   0 implies that no public health control measure leading to a reduction in disease transmission is applied and that   1 implies that implemented public health control measures are efficient enough to stop disease transmission after the average incubation period

after the outbreak in the region since mass testing in the region only started around april 24 2020 and since many countries in the region are not carrying out mass testing yet we avoid using data collected after april 23 in our study therefore the data considered for this analysis spans the period from february 28 2020 ie one day after the first case through to april 23 2020 before mass testing started ie 39 days after the start of control measures this allowed us to assess the dynamics of the disease before the start of control measures ie the worst case scenario and for the entire period with control measures by estimating model parameters for the first 17 days of the outbreak when no control measures were put in place and then for the entire period of data collection feb 28-apr 23 in west-africa the reported confirmed cases are infectious symptomatic individuals who have been tested at a treatment center or infectious asymptomatic individuals who have been contact-traced and then tested at a treatment centre hence we assume that confirmed disease cases correspond to individuals in the i c class ie isolated infectious individuals at isolation or treatment centers we use the cumulative number of cases in west-africa downloaded from the global rise of education website 8 to fit our model and estimate some of the key parameters presented in table   1  the fitting was done using a nonlinear least squares procedure and involved finding the best set of parameter values that minimized the sum of the square differences between the observed number of daily cases in west-africa and the predicted cumulative number of cases from our model we repeated this procedure 5000 times to approximate the distribution of each of the parameters by a normal distribution and obtain the mean value with a 95 confidence interval the goodness of fit of our model assessed using the root mean squared error rmse was 225 and 7062 respectively for the fits

complemented with any other measure but such identification and isolation must occur in a timely manner eg within 1 day ie  a  1 fig 5 b  on the other hand disease elimination is also possible if more exposed humans develop symptoms at the end of the incubation period and asymptomatic humans are detected and isolated in a timely manner for example if only 78 of humans fail to develop symptoms at the end of the incubation period then asymptomatic humans must be identified and isolated within 3 days for disease elimination to be possible fig 5 e  thus disease control is more difficult if it takes long to contact trace and isolate asymptomatic humans our results also show that timely isolation of symptomatic cases is important in reducing the disease burden in west-africa although disease elimination is only possible if isolation of infectious symptomatic cases is complemented with another control measure fig 5 c d  in particular if symptomatic humans are identified and isolated within 3 days ie  s  039 then a 43 reduction in the disease transmission rate is required for disease elimination while if it takes a long time to isolate symptomatic infectious individuals eg within 10 days a 51 reduction on the disease transmission rate is required to contain the pandemic in west-africa fig 5 c  when isolation of symptomatic infectious disease cases is complemented with identification and isolation of asymptomatic infectious cases disease elimination is only possible through timely identification and isolation of asymptomatic cases fig 5 d  thus identifying and isolating

the course of the disease and in assessing the impacts of basic public health control measures 17 18 19 23  in this study we develop a mathematical model to inform the covid-19 trend and possible course of control measures in west-africa the model is trained with covid-19 data from west-african countries for the period from february 28 2020 to april 23 2020 and used to compute the reproduction

slow compared to other parts of world this low transmission in the region can be attributed to a number of factors eg the pandemic might still be in the early stage since the statistics for west-africa within the first seven weeks of the pandemic 3 661 cases and 79 deaths are similar to those of france and higher than those of the us 1 025 cases and 28 deaths when these countries were within the same outbreak time-frame also the low transmission could be due to the fact that there is limited movement of individuals within 12  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made

under-reporting of cases as was the case in peru 40  this is supported by the growing number of asymptomatic infectious individuals observed in our study de leo et al observed a similar trend in mexico where over 90 of the infectious population was asymptomatic 21  in the absence of sufficient test kits in many west-african countries and with the limitations in health care facilities and personnel identifying cases is difficult 41  irrespective of the current trend the covid-19 pandemic is still a more serious health problem in west-africa compared to previous outbreaks like the 2014 ebola outbreak 150  r c  160 42 43 or the lassa fever outbreak in nigeria 129  r c  137 44  although most countries in west-africa started implementing basic control measures since march 17 2020 our simulation results indicate that improvements are necessary to effectively control or eliminate the pandemic from the region because there is currently no safe and effective vaccine or drugs against the novel coronavirus basic public health control measures have been used to curtail the pandemic in many parts of the world including west-africa these measures include contact tracing isolation and measures that lead to a reduction in disease transmission eg mask use and social or physical distancing 17  in the absence of such measures the worst case scenario prediction for west-africa from our model is over 2 million confirmed covid-19 cases by mid may 2020 when the epidemic peaks this projection is within the range 517 489 -15 056 314 in 27 for the same west-african region although the peak in the latter study was predicted to occur in june 2020 the higher upper limit in 27 might be linked to the fact that the authors used linear models and considered the rate of infection between the first and second weeks of the epidemic in countries in which the number of cases might have been overestimated we found out that basic public health control measures especially those associated with a reduction in the disease transmission rate such as social distancing and mask use have a significant effect on reducing the burden of the disease eg at baseline values control measures reduce the number of cases when the epidemic peaks by about 60 and the disease transmission rate by about 25 also improving control measures such about an estimated 45 reduction in the disease transmission is attained reduces the number of confirmed cases when the epidemic attains its peak approximately 92 such interventions are useful in reducing ensuring that the already limited and fragile health care systems are not overwhelmed by the covid-19 burden 19  our results suggest that early identification and isolation of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious individuals is an important step towards curtailing the burden of the pandemic in particular identifying and isolating asymptomatic individuals early enough eg within 1-2 days after the end of the incubation period can result in disease elimination even without any other control measure the same is not true with identifying and isolating symptomatic individuals or when it takes a longer time to identify and isolate infectious asymptomatic individuals in this case the measure must be complemented with another measure that involves a reduction in the disease transmission rate in order to eliminate the disease asymptomatic infectious individuals can be identified through contact-tracing and testing however since mass testing in most west-african countries only started during the last week of april the primary way in which asymptomatic individuals were identified in west-africa during the study period was through manual contact tracing and then testing the contacts suspected to have the virus one way in which contact tracing has been used successfully to identify and isolate both pre-symptomatic and 13  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted

infectious individuals is through mobile phone applications see for example ferretti et al 45  we showed that a higher reduction in the disease transmission rate eg through social distancing or using masks will be required to eliminate the disease if a higher proportion of exposed humans do not develop clinical disease symptoms after the incubation period these results highlight the importance of early identification and of disease cases and are consistent with the results of previous studies on ebola virus and lassa fever virus in west-africa 43 46  the results are also consistent with those of a study by hellewell et al 47  who used simulated data to illustrate that contact tracing and isolation is highly effective in controlling the pandemic and can lead to disease elimination within 3 months although contact tracing is already being implemented in west-africa the measure is not very effective due to the lack of resources and the high community transmission in the region for example as of april 8 2020 about 4 in every 5 reported cases in the region resulted from community transmission 5  therefore increased compliance with measures like social distancing and mask use is very important for the region since the disease can be transmitted from one human to the other through droplets from infected individuals that can travel though a few meters in air 23 48  using masks and social distancing are very important in the fight against the pandemic masks play a dual role-they prevent acquisition of the virus by infected individuals and also prevent infectious individuals from spreading the virus 17  both using masks and social distancing are ongoing in many west-african countries however the effectiveness of these measures in reducing the spread of the virus is linked to the extent to which they are applied the compliance level by public and how long they will last 17 21  our analyses show covid-19 can be eliminated in west-africa through social distancing and using masks if 45 of the population complies with the measures this is consistent with recent results in 17 23 49  where strict compliance with social distancing and mask use can lead to disease elimination some west-african countries eg benin have implemented measures involving isolating some densely populated portions of the country especially overcrowded urban areas with dilapidated sanitary facilities and limited basic amenities like clean water 28  this has a positive effect on reducing the spread of the virus finally our study suggests that mass application of control measures coupled with appropriate testing and timely isolation of asymptomatic humans will go a long way in keeping disease numbers low however with the fragile economic conditions and health care systems in the region interventions like complete lock-down as observed in most european countries for a couple of months can be more catastrophic than the disease itself therefore the choice of interventions by public policy makers in the region should aim at balancing the prevention of the epidemic with the need for maintaining livelihoods and social cohesion our study confirms the fact that the novel coronavirus covid-19 is highly contagious and that infectious humans who do not show clinical disease symptoms asymptomatic or unreported cases contribute significantly in disease transmission this study also indicates that early identification of these unreported cases through contact tracing or mass testing and then isolating individuals who test positive plays a significant role in diminishing the burden of covid-19 in west-africa furthermore this study suggests that social distancing measures such as stay-at-home orders closing educational institutions  cc-by-nc-nd 40

significantly with the possibility of disease-elimination if about one in every two people in west-africa respect these control measures to enhance the study shows that implementing more than one measure at the same time is better for disease control and that under current control measures the disease might not be disappearing from the region any time soon unless there are improvements in these control measures we conclude that mass-testing contact tracing and isolation of confirmed disease cases as well as improvements to the other existing basic public health measures eg social distancing and mask use in the region are required to better manage or eliminate the pandemic also due to uncertainties and various disparities between the economies and health care systems of countries within the region we conclude that country-level studies are necessary and will provide more insights into disease dynamics and control in the region  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it

medrxiv preprint  covid-19 in pregnant women and babies what pediatricians need to know hj rozycki s kotecha   in late 2019 a respiratory infection began to spread amongst residents in the city of wuhan china it was quickly attributed to a previously unknown coronavirus which was given the name novel sars-cov-2 the clinical disease was subsequently named covid-19 and as of this writing late may 2020 has affected over 57 million people in virtually every country and region in the world accounting for over three hundred and sixty thousand deaths initial epidemiological reports indicate that those over 65 years of age andor who have pre-existing conditions are at increased risk for covid-19 these risk factors including asthma and other chronic lung diseases diabetes morbid obesity significant cardiovascular disease or immune compromise 1 some have included pregnancy as a risk factor for covid-19 2 the purpose of this review is to describe the current information available at the time of writing regarding the potential and known effects of this novel sars-cov-2 in pregnant women their fetuses and their newborns to help inform neonatologists who might be called upon to counsel expectant mothers and to care for their babies like all information about this disease this is a rapidly developing field after initial case reports enough data and experience have rapidly accumulated to inform their clinical care however it is very important to note that virtually all reports to date are based on selective often anecdotal case accrual primarily using only hospitalized patients or those sick enough to seek hospital care there are limited data at present about the prevalence of affected individuals in the population as a whole which may differ from current estimates as the estimated number of asymptomatic individuals may be as high as 52 3 it is likely therefore that any estimate rates or proportions will be lower than what is currently reported it must also be noted that while the need and benefit for rapid dissemination of medical information has been very beneficial during this pandemic the careful peer review process has of necessity been placed on hold for example by rapid releases of pre-prints it is therefore likely that some of our current understanding may later change as further data are more carefully scrutinized sars-cov-2 closely resembles the original coronavirus species which caused the sars epidemic of 2002-03 with 79 gene sequence homology 4 that epidemic affected nearly 8500 individuals with an overall case fatality rate estimated to be 9 5 in a case series from hong kong of a dozen pregnant women there was a 25 mortality rate along with three first trimester miscarriages and two of the infants were growth restricted 6 as a result some authors suggested that pregnancy was a significant risk factor for sars morbidity and mortality this was true during the last world-wide pandemic spanish flu of 1918-19 7 as well as during the 1957 h2n2 influenza season where half the women between 18 and 49 who died did so from influenza 8 for these historical precedents there are possible biological factors that might explain the amplified the risk of coronavirus infection during pregnancy diabetes is more common during pregnancy there is relative immunosuppression of the th1 response making pregnant women more susceptible to viral infections 9 and expression of the ace2 membrane protein the receptor for both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 is relatively increased during pregnancy 10 with rapid publication several series of covid-19 infection in pregnancy cases have now been published table 1
presents data from fifteen studies that included more than 3 subjects 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 these include 511 subjects 825 diagnosed by sars-cov-2 rt-pcr the others by current clinical criteria the vast majority presented with symptoms and were then diagnosed meaning that those who are asymptomatic or who have mild disease are most likely under-represented this therefore might be best viewed as a current snapshot of the most significantly affected pregnant women as shown in table 1 a small proportion were in the first or second trimester 10 and 20 subjects respectively there were eight spontaneous miscarriages and seven elective terminations due to concerns about the potential effects of sars-cov-2 on the fetus in pregnancies beyond 23 weeks gestational age one report from iran noted that five out of nine had intrauterine fetal demise 14 but this has not been replicated in any other published studies to date more than two thirds 681 of the births were by caesarian section most probably reflecting the fact that these reports preferentially included symptomatic mothers to understand sars-cov-2 and pregnancy in a more comprehensive manner it will be important to acquire more data from asymptomatic and mildly affected mothers estimates of asymptomatic rates in pregnant women are preliminary and quite variable one study from new york reported that in the first five days of universal testing for women presenting to the labor and delivery unit 12 women were lab-test positive but were asymptomatic 27 of note 8 of them 67 developed intrapartum or post-partum fever it was not possible to differentiate the cause of the fever between clinical chorioamnionitis or covid-19 but other reports also suggest that fever occurs after delivery in affected mothers in another larger series from new york 33 of 215 screened women were positive 153 28 however only four 19 of the whole screened population or 121 of the positive group were symptomatic although three 14 91 respectively of the asymptomatic patients did develop fever peri-natally or post-natally another study from new york screening asymptomatic women scheduled to deliver during the first two weeks of april also had a 15 positive rate 24155 29 in contrast of 635 pregnant women admitted to northwestern hospital in chicago only 23 36 were positive including ten who were asymptomatic 30 this is similar to the experience in richmond virginia where 6 of 177 34 patients undergoing general screening upon presentation to the labor and delivery unit were positive virginia has approximately the same population as new york city but only one fifth the number of confirmed cases 31 these observations probably reflect how the prevalence of sars-cov-2 colonization in pregnant women is likely to reflect that of the general population the risk benefit analysis for administration of antenatal corticosteroids in mothers with covid-19 for the benefit of the neonate should they be born prematurely is not very clear 32 there are no systematic data available as yet for this infection so recommendations are primarily based on our experience with other viruses especially pneumonia due to influenza virus where corticosteroid use was associated with a higher mortality rate and higher rates of icu admission 33 these considerations have led to the recommendation that treatment decisions be individualized based on the risk to and condition of the mother and the potential benefit to the infant an asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic mother at 24  26 weeks gestation is a very different scenario compared to a mother who is in the intensive care unit icu on a ventilator at more than 34 weeks gestational age many viruses including rubella cytomegalovirus varicella zoster and zika are well known to be teratogenic to the fetus these include rubella cytomegalovirus varicella zoster and zika coronaviruses are associated with 20 of upper respiratory tract infections involving the four main sub-types but none of these are of specific concern during pregnancy 34 there were two cases of intrauterine growth restriction in babies born during the 2002-03 sars outbreak although the underlying etiology was not investigated 6 in the other human coronavirus epidemic middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov there was no reported evidence for teratogenicity among the 12 pregnant patients 35 similarly up to mid-may 2020 there have not been any reports of congenital abnormalities in infants born to mothers with covid-19 or who are positive for sars-cov-2 whilst these data are encouraging additional data accumulation is urgently required to confirm these observations as shown in table 1 322 offspring of covid-19 mothers were tested after birth and 10 were noted to be positive 31 it is not possible however to know when and by which route prenatal perinatal like herpes simplex or postnatal the virus passed to the neonate as few samples were reported to have been obtained immediately after birth or was sampling done serially in addition it is not clear if the infants who tested positive were separated from their mothers beginning immediately after birth so it is not possible to determine if these were cases of postnatally acquired virus on the other hand an initial case report from china described elevated igg and igm against sars-cov-2 drawn at 2 hours of age born to a mother with covid-19 however the baby had 5 negative rt-pcr nasopharyngeal tests 36 in another study of six infants born to covid-19 mothers who had blood and nasopharyngeal samples obtained at birth 37 two had elevations in their igg and igm antibodies against sars-cov-2 although neither had viral rna detected these results taken together raise the possibility that the fetus responds with an immune response to virus at some point prior to delivery but they need to be confirmed by larger more systematic studies using validated serological assays are required to establish the true nature of the associations between sars-cov-2 and neonatal infections 38 overall children are a small minority of diagnosed covid - 19 cases the incidence in south korea among children as of may 16 2020 was 34 cases100000 one eighth the rate in the elderly population there were also no deaths reported in those under 9 years of age 39 this is consistent with observations from other countries in the united states as of april 2 2020 only 398 03 of the 149370 covid-19 patients were under 1 year of age 40
 current recommendations in most countries including the us are to test all babies born to mothers who are either positive for or who are suspected of having covid-19 41 the us centers for disease control adopted this approach in late may 2020 due to concerns that the disease may be more severe in neonates over two dozen neonates less than 30 days old at presentation have been reported in the medical literature as of may 21 2020 table 2
summarizes the available information 22 23 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 two thirds were born to mothers with covid-19 the others presumably acquired the virus from household contacts three were preterm fever was noted in 48 respiratory symptoms in 30 and emesis or diarrhea in 37 many reports listed lethargy or changes in neurological status poor feeding and other non-specific symptoms notably three 11 were asymptomatic only one baby who presented at 3 weeks of age with nasal congestion poor feeding and lethargy progressed to hypotension and respiratory failure requiring intensive care 52 encouragingly there were no deaths one question that frequently arises is whether those called to attend at the delivery of a newborn should wear coronavirus-resistant personal protective equipment since positive pressure ventilation which can generate aerosols is a potential intervention at each delivery considerations include the availability of the equipment whether mothers presenting for delivery are being routinely screened and what is known regarding the baseline rate of positive tests in the general population including those who are asymptomatic for newborn infants born to mothers who have or are suspected to have covid-19 viral rt-pcr testing from the nasopharynx oropharynx or nares is recommended beginning after 24 hours of life 57 until proven negative with at least two tests 24 hours apart these babies should be kept separate from any other neonates separation of sars-cov-2 positive mothers and negative or status-unknown babies is still encouraged but it is acknowledged that this is not based on evidence-based data of post-natal transmission if the decision is made to keep the mother-baby pair together there are guidelines for physical distancing maternal hand hygiene and face mask use breast-feeding should still be encouraged which will affect whether the mother and infant are separated unless expressed breast milk is considered as an option 58 regarding breast-feeding there are no extensive reports about whether sars-cov-2 is present in breast milk two publications indicate that the virus can be detected in breast milk 58 61 further information may modify current guidelines that breastfeeding may be advisable in covid-19 mothers under strict measures of infection control physical distancing when not feeding mother wearing mask thorough cleaning 57 58 human milk banks have added covid-19 questions to their donor screening and requirements for pre-donation quarantine during the common holder pasteurization process the breast milk is raised to 625c for thirty minutes the infectivity of the sars-cov-2 virus was eliminated when the virus was exposed to temperature of 56c for thirty minutes 62 a definitive recommendation for adding testing for the presence of sars-cov-2 by rt-pcr to the evaluation for early- or late-onset neonatal sepsis is not yet possible given the paucity of data especially in the absence of any known risk as outlined in table 2 neonates are affected both before 72 hours and after note that all the neonates reported in table 2 had a history of exposure to either tested or symptomatic covid-19 contacts until more extensive epidemiologic studies are published health care professionals will have to factor the prevalence in the obstetric and general population as well as local testing practice to decide overall it may be that children are relatively protected from covid-19 in general and in the severity of disease when they do acquire due to the observation that there is a linear relationship between age and the ace2 receptor 63 of note this was only sampled from the nasal epithelium and did not include any neonates although the attack rate in children is far lower than in any other age group a worrisome complication has become apparent termed multiorgan inflammatory syndrome  children mic-s over a hundred children have had this kawasaki syndrome-like condition including some who were asymptomatic for covid-19 but tested positive by rt-pcr or serology 64 to date we are unable to find any cases in a child under the age of one year because there are so few neonates who have been diagnosed with covid-19 therapeutic recommendations or guidelines based on evidence or clinical experience are not possible most of the cases listed in table 2 received supportive or routine care at this point if a baby is critically ill and either positive for sars-cov-2 by rt-pcr not serology or strongly suspected of having the disease based on exposure history and symptoms consulting experts in adult disease is advised given their larger accumulated experience any recommended drug therapy will require risk-benefit assessment including adjustments for dose and timing considerations for this specific population the best hope for the longer term is for a long-lasting effective vaccination together with an effective serology test that will identify both recent and past infection with sars-cov-2 the rapidity with which sars-cov-2 has spread and the number of cases and deaths from covid-19 is unlike anything seen since at least the spanish flu pandemic of 1918-19 but a hundred years later international cooperation and rapid dissemination of experience has permitted those facing the need to care for a patient with a disease they have never seen before to tap into the experience of others we can expect case reports and small series to be replaced by larger and more systematic studies followed by prospective trials and long-term follow-up reports for anyone who may have a patient with sars-cov-2 or covid-19 it is important to follow the medical literature including consensus expert guidelines 
with an altered immune system the pregnant woman may be at risk of acquiring covid-19 but most evidence has been based on critically ill pregnant women although screening seems to show lesser prevalence clearly pregnant women will continue to be vulnerable to sars-cov-2additional accumulation of data on teratogenicity of sars-cov-2 is required despite early reassuring datavertical transmission of sars-cov-2 from the mother to the baby seems limitedcovid-19 infection in babies and infants of less than one year of age seems to be low and acquisition in most cases seems to be postnatal
 
more data from both hospital and community-based acquisition of sars-cov-2 by pregnant women is requiredsince the prevalence of covid-19 is lower in infants studying the underlying mechanisms and immune system of the newborn may lead to better understanding of how the virus may be controlledan adequate blood test to identify current and previous infection is urgently requiredany vaccine developed will need to be tested on children to protect neonates maternal immunization programs may be necessary
 the reader will come to appreciate thatsars-cov-2 virus can cause covid-19 in pregnant women but that there may also be asymptomatic carriersthe prevalence of positive tests for sars-cov-2 in women presenting for delivery varies from 3 to 13 and may be dependent on the prevalence in the general populationabout 3 of newborns may have detectable virus but it is not clear when it was acquired most newborns do wellbased on 26 reported cases affected neonates generally do well and need only supportive therapy
 
59 60  public masking an urgent need to revise global policies to protect against covid-19 maryam keshtkar-jahromi mark sulkowski kourosh holakouie-naieni   novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 is spreading fast around the world with many uncertainties about routes of transmission treatment and prevention currently the united states has the highest number of cases no drugs or vaccines have yet proven to be effective and non-vaccine preventative measures are the key in our fight against this transmissible virus with high mortality the who recommends robust control measures to contain community spread of infection worldwide but the virus is nonetheless spreading within communities and we have had limited success in breaking the transmission chain although new evidence supports tremendous capacity of this virus to spread from asymptomatic individuals messages about public masking remain conflicting more clarification from international organizations is needed to optimally support efforts to prevent the spread of sars-cov-2 we now know that a significant portion of coronavirus-infected individuals are asymptomatic or even minimally symptomatic with nonspecific symptoms13 and can spread the infection45 in a study from china nasopharyngeal viral loads from asymptomatic individuals were as high as those from symptomatic patients suggesting the potential for a major role in community transmission6 in an observational study in china asymptomatic sars-cov-2infected individuals were identified as sources of infection in 79 of confirmed cases7 during the diamond princess cruise ship investigation 712 of 3711 individuals tested positive whereas 331 465 of positive cases were asymptomatic at the time of testing in follow-up 179 of infected cases never developed symptoms8 based on this understanding of virus transmission public health experts urged mass masking to prevent virus spread9 as of the time of this writing mid-april 2020 the who recommends against public masking for asymptomatic individuals10 but the science around this topic has been rapidly advancing some countries austria czech republic china hong kong israel italy japan mongolia singapore south korea taiwan turkey and the united states have taken varied steps to advocate universal masking as an additional step to reduce community transmission of sars-cov-2 the who has not endorsed this as a global policy yet possibly because of lack of supply limited evidence for effectiveness potential noncompliance andor concerns regarding increased anxiety and stigmatization engendered by masking moreover there is concern that public masking will limit the supply of essential masks for healthcare workers and others at the highest risk of infection however a resistance to mass masking seems inconsistent with our knowledge of the rate of asymptomatic infections and the risk of transmission from these individuals the us cdc has recommended a policy of cloth face covering in public where social distancing is hard to maintain but this policy has been practiced in many different ways11 following this recommendation mandatory universal masking for all hospital visitors patients and healthcare workers has been proposed12 and implemented as a robust preventive strategy in many american healthcare facilities including massachusetts general hospital the johns hopkins university and health system the university of maryland medical system the university of chicago medical center the university of illinois hospital the university of rochester medical center the university of california san francisco the university of virginia heath system rochester regional health and st lukes university health network this list is growing fast outside of healthcare settings for many people the motivation for wearing a mask is primarily for their own protection which unintentionally leads to protecting their community we consider both protection of the wearer and of the community to be important but we believe that source control is most important in a systematic review before the sars-cov-2 pandemic wearing face masks reduced the odds of contracting acute respiratory infections by 6 among casual community contacts and by 19 among household contacts if both the infected and healthy individuals wore masks13 masks have been shown to be effective in reducing respiratory virus shedding from droplets and aerosols of symptomatic individuals infected with coronavirus influenza virus and rhinovirus14 there is also laboratory evidence that homemade masks effectively stop droplets from infecting the wearer15 surgical masks are disposable and designed to protect healthcare workers although surgeons used cloth masks to protect wounds from droplets many years ago the barrier layer in cloth masks is usually two layers of cotton-woven fabric compared with two to four layers of nonwoven polypropylene fabric with filtration holes in surgical masks effectiveness of cloth masks compared with surgical masks needs further evaluation because some clinical studies have raised concerns regarding their effectiveness16 however the wearing of cloth masks by asymptomatic individuals is justified by evidence that droplets and aerosols get trapped when they hit the weave of the fabric with potentially better trapping than surgical masks in any case cloth masks have been adopted as an alternative when surgical masks are limited in supply17 moreover cloth masks are cheap washable easy to make and can be used by the general population without imposing extra cost to local governments while they are already overwhelmed by lack of resources while the sars-cov-2 pandemic rages most nations are not receiving clear and concise instructions about public masking from public health authorities we call on who and country-level public health leaders to urgently consider revising their policies on mass masking to facilitate implementation of appropriate interventions in communities around the world considering the close community contact in densely populated areas around the world and documented evidence of sars-cov-2 transmission from asymptomatic individuals it is appropriate to consider masking as a robust tool to limit sars-cov-2 transmission this is highly recommended in public places including public transportation grocery stores bakeries pharmacies hospitals rehabilitation units nursing homes offices places of religious worship workplaces or even crowded streets in summary laboratory data support both surgical and cloth masks but real-world efficacy of cloth masks needs further evaluation cloth masks are affordable globally and might be the only option in some areas with limited resources based on our current level of evidence we highly recommend mass masking around the world during the pandemic whereas surgical masks are the preferred recommendation for the general public cloth masks should be considered as a substitute if supplies are limited or surgical masks are not available  clinical characteristics of 24 asymptomatic infections with covid-19 screened among close contacts in nanjing z hu c song c xu g jin y chen x xu h ma w chen y lin y zheng  previous studies have showed clinical characteristics of patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease and the evidence of person-to-person transmission limited data are available for asymptomatic infections this study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic covid-19 virus carriers epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of covid-19 patients or suspected patients in nanjing jiangsu province china from jan 28 to feb 9 2020 both in clinic and in community asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the covid-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples their clinical records laboratory assessments and chest ct scans were reviewed as a result none of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms while nucleic acid screening five cases 208 developed symptoms fever cough fatigue etc during hospitalization twelve 500 cases showed typical ct images of ground-glass chest and 5 208 presented stripe shadowing in the lungs the remaining 7 292 cases showed normal ct image and had no symptoms during hospitalization these 7 cases were younger median age 140 yearsp0012 than the rest none of the 24 cases developed severe covid-19 pneumonia or died the median communicable period defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests was 95 days up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases through epidemiological investigation we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members which even caused severe covid-19 pneumonia overall the asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization however the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness these results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged  the epidemic of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease infections that developed in wuhan hubei province has spread to other provinces in china as of 16 february 2020 51857 patients with covid-2019 have been reported and 1121 deaths were confirmed in china ding et al 2020  to date accumulated evidence has indicated personto-person transmission both in hospital and family settings chan et al 2020 guan et al 2020 phan et al 2020 yang et al 2020  since january 23 2020 the source city was locked down to suppress the spread of the disease however the massive human movement during the traditional chinese new year holidays might have fueled the spread of the disease at present there were at least 10000 cases in other provinces mostly identified through symptoms plus recent travel history to hubei province china genetic analysis of covid-19 revealed that the virus was similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov  unlike sars-cov transmission of covid-19 occurs during the prodromal period when those infected are mildly ill and carry on usual activities which contributes to the spread of infection heymann and shindo 2020 zou et al 2020  according to the report on diamond princess among the 1723 tested travelers 189 asymptomatic individuals were positive for the covid-19 virus as of 17 february 2020 wikipedia 2020  which indicated that a large number of asymptomatic carriers and mild patients remain undiscovered in the community it is crucial to identify and isolate asymptomatic carriers and mild patients in order to contain the outbreaks in later stages here we conducted an epidemiological investigation among close contacts of covid-19 patients in nanjing jiangsu province china and identified 24 asymptomatic carriers we sought to delineate the clinical characteristics and the transmission potential of asymptomatic infections the demographic characteristics of the 24 asymptomatic cases are shown in table s1 in supporting information none of the cases were healthcare workers and 8 333 had a history of recent travel to hubei case 1 and 5 were residents of hubei marked with blue arrows case 3 4 6 9 13 and 17 have travelled to hubei marked with blue boxes and the period in hubei might be the suspected contact time the suspected contact time of other cases who stay in nanjing was marked with gray boxes according to the epidemiological investigation the diagnosis date of each case showed that the number of cases who have been to hubei decreased since jan 28 2020  figure s1 in supporting in-formation individuals of all ages were involved in the covid-19 asymptomatic infection with age ranging from 5 to 95 years old median 325 years whereas 208 524 of the cases were aged below 15 years eight cases 333 were males two cases had a history of smoking case 1 and case 13 and 2 were diagnosed with diabetes and hypertension case 8 and case 13 five cases case 2 4 5 6 and 10 figure 1  had symptoms during hospitalization all the five cases developed fever without chills with body temperatures fluctuating from 365c to 380c but none presented high fever body temperature 39c cases 4 6 and 10 were free of other symptoms case 2 also had cough fatigue and nasal congestion and case 5 presented cough fatigue dizziness and arthralgia several cases also occurred transient symptoms during hospitalization including fever with chills case 8 diarrhea case 21 and 22 and rashes case 16 and 18 that were discussed by clinical expert panel and considered as an infusion reaction of intravenous immunoglobulin side effects of lopinavirritonavir and darunavircobicistat respectively and were therefore not grouped as cases with symptoms caused by covid-19 on admission all 24 cases had a chest ct scan twelve 500 cases showed typical findings of chest ct images of ground-glass or patchy shadows in the lungs  figure s2 in supporting information five 208 cases showed stripe shadows in lungs an atypical image finding ct scans of the rest 7 292 cases showed normal images four 167 of the 24 cases had lymphopenia 0810 9 cellsl on admission leukopenia was also observed in 4 cases elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase aspartate aminotransferase creatine kinase c-reactive protein and d-dimer were uncommon table s1 in supporting information during hospitalization case 2 and case 5 developed leukopenia seven cases presented an elevated level of serum lactose dehydrogenase among whom 3 were accompanied with an increased level of c-reactive protein  figure s3 in supporting information antiviral therapy was given to 21 cases 875 as initiated therapy in which one case also received antibiotics therapy antifungal therapy plus immunoglobin therapy and immunoglobin therapy was also given to 2 cases all these cases were treated with interferon atomization none of the cases developed severe pneumonia requiring systemic cor-ticosteroids treatment mechanical ventilation or admission to icu and none died table s1 in supporting information as of feb 18 2020 a total of 18 cases 750 had the virus cleared 2 continuous negatives of nucleic acid tests among whom 9 cases were discharged from the hospital while the rest 9 were kept in hospital for further observation six cases case 3 8 13 16 19 and 23 had nucleic acid tests reversed to positive after one negative result of particular concern case18 showed positive again even after the continuous negative of nucleic acid tests five cases case 7 9 11 14 and 24 had the virus cleared within a short time the communicable period defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests ranged from 1 to 21 days median 95 days iqr 35-130 days figure s4 in supporting information table s1 in supporting information due to the censored data of 6 cases and the indeterminate date of the exact first infection the communicable period was underestimated we found that 7 292 cases had normal ct images and no symptoms during hospitalization as compared with other cases these 7 cases were younger median 140 p0012  table s2 in supporting information there were no differences in other characteristics between these 2 groups possibly due to the limited sample size the blood test of these 7 cases showed no obvious abnormity the median communicable period of the 7 patients was 40 days iqr 20-150 we reviewed the medical records and epidemiological history of each case and of their family members if they were admitted in hospital for confirmed or suspected covid-19 infection in the family of case 13 relative 1 wife of case 13 first visited the hospital  figure 2  relative 1 a 64-yearold otherwise healthy woman developed fever the highest temperature was 387c cough fatigue and vomiting on jan 30 2020 three days later feb 2 2020 she visited the hospital and was tested positive for the covid-19 virus then epidemiological investigations and nucleic acid tests were conducted on her son relative 2 daughter-in-law relative 3 and case 13 relative 2 and 3 had developed respiratory symptoms before investigation and were demonstrated positive for the covid-19 virus nucleic acid test was also positive for case 13 but he had no symptoms during admission through epidemiological investigation case 13 admitted his travel history to the city of huanggang hubei province on jan 19-20 2020 relative 1 2 and 3 are all local nanjing residents and denied the history of contact with any confirmed or suspected covid-19 patient except for case 13 in the recent 14 days during hospitalization case 13 had no symptoms but remained positive for the covid-19 virus till feb 18 2020 which indicated that the communicable period could be as long as 29 days from jan 21 to feb 18 2020 among the 3 infected family members relative 1 developed severe covid-19 pneumonia and was admitted to the icu on feb 6 2020 relative 2 and 3 cleared the virus on feb 18 2020 in brief case 13 an asymptomatic covid-19 carriers transmitted the virus to his cohabiting family members and 1 of the infected individuals developed severe covid-19 pneumonia and was admitted to icu in the present study we provided epidemiological and clinical data of 24 asymptomatic covid-19 infections identified from the screening of close contacts in nanjing jiangsu province these asymptomatic cases were mildly ill as compared to those previously reported in wuhan hubei guan et al 2020 huang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020  none of the 24 cases developed severe pneumonia as of feb18 2020 and only 5 cases showed typical symptoms during hospitalization similar to previous studies chang et al 2020 huang et al 2020  fever cough and fatigue were the main symptoms lymphopenia and leukopenia previously associated with disease severity chen et al 2020 guan et al 2020 huang et al 2020  were uncommon in the asymptomatic cases of the present study interestingly we found that young cases 15 years old were prone to be asymptomatic even during hospitalization and to have a normal ct image which partially suggested that nucleic acid testing would be crucial to identify asymptomatic infections in young close contacts notably we provided evidence for transmission from an asymptomatic infector to close contacts that led to severe covid-19 pneumonia these findings indicate that asymptomatic carriers can result in person-to-person transmission and should be considered a source of covid-19 infection it is also implicated by the report of the diamond princess that large numbers of asymptomatic or mild patients might have been hiding in the community therefore it is of great public health significance to strictly monitor close contacts via multiple nucleic acid screenings to contain potential outbreaks of particular since massive movement returning to the work place and the school is in progress active contact tracing and strict health monitoring should remain an important strategy in china or worldwide guidance of self-protection active isolation of close contacts either at home or centralized should be continuously highlighted isolation and multiple virus nucleic acid detections are also recommended for discharged covid-19 patients our study was conducted in nanjing a city with adequate medications and public health interventions the included cases were identified from systematic screening of the close contacts of covid-19 patients or suspected patients both in clinic and in community all asymptomatic carriers were admitted to and treated in the second hospital of nanjing and therefore the study population has strong representativeness of the whole city we collected the contact history and followed longitudinal nucleic acid tests of the close contacts during their hospitalization which provided a relatively reliable communicable period of asymptomatic cases however it is notable that the real communicable period was longer than calculated due to the censored data of 6 patients and the indeterminate date of the exact first infection secondly our study was conducted in nanjing and the results might not be generalizable to other areas in china thirdly there is still a possibility of missing carriers when screening from close contacts using the pharyngeal swab specimens at last this study is limited by the small sample size and lack of data on nucleic acid tests before the diagnosis date large-scale multicenter studies are needed to verify our findings all screening-identified asymptomatic covid-19 cases in nanjing were admitted to the second hospital of nanjing the only hospital to admit for covid-19 patients of the city from jan 28 to feb 9 2020 we retrospectively reviewed documents on epidemiological investigation and medical records asymptomatic carriers were screened from close contacts both in clinic and in community close contacts were defined as 1 cohabiting family members of the covid-19 patient or suspected patient or 2 individuals who were exposed to the covid-19 patient within 2 meters for more than 1 hour within 2 days before the symptom onset of the patient nucleic acid test was performed on the same day when the contacts were tracked the asymptomatic covid-19 cases here were defined as cases who were tested for covid-19 nucleic acid positive but without symptoms while screening actually among the 24 cases only 19 cases have not developed symptoms during hospitalization this study was reviewed and

findings from a beta coronavirus outbreak on an american miniature horse breeding farm in upstate new york e goodrich l l mittel d a glaser s ness l r radcliffe m t divers j   beta coronavirus bcov was first detected and characterised from a foal with enterocolitis in 1999 davis et al 2000 a more recent prevalence study demonstrated the equal likelihood of isolating ecov from both gastrointestinaldiseased and healthy foals slovis et al 2014 as a coinfecting agent however this same study showed a significant association between ecov and gastrointestinal disease in foals slovis et al 2014 aside from gastrointestinal disease in foals ecov has also been associated with outbreaks in adult horses in racing facilities in japan and in boarding facilities in the us oue et al 2011 2013 pusterla et al 2013 in these outbreaks of adult horses the most common clinical signs associated with ecov infection were anorexia lethargy fever and less commonly specific signs of gastrointestinal disease oue et al 2011 2013 pusterla et al 2013 nemoto et al 2014 ecov has also rarely been associated with necrotising enteritis and hyperammonaemic encephalopathy in horses fielding et al 2015 giannitti et al 2015 the purpose of this study is to describe an outbreak of bcov that occurred on an american miniature horse amh breeding farm in upstate new york to the authors knowledge this outbreak of bcov constitutes the largest one described in a single closed herd situation the clinical presentation faecal pcr results and faecal shedding of the virus for the animals involved in this outbreak are described possible transmission of bcov via human movement from the outbreak site to one horse at a barn off the premises is also described aside from the size of this outbreak several other factors also set it apart from other bcov outbreaks previously described in the literature including the mortality rate morbidity rate and duration of faecal shedding pusterla et al 2013 nemoto et al 2014 fielding et al 2015 the bcov outbreak reported here occurred at an american miniature horse farm in upstate new york from late january to early february of 2013 the outbreak of bcov on this farm included 29 miniature horses and one donkey ranging in age from 6 months to 15 years median 55 years the horses were housed in individual pens within a single open barn and the adult jennet was housed in a separate shed outside disconnected from the main barn fig 1 the pens within the main barn allowed for physical contact between individuals in adjacent pens the most recent addition to the farm arrived approximately 3 months prior to the onset of this outbreak there was no recent travel history for any of the animals on the farm the outbreak began with the onset of fever lethargy and mild colic signs flank watching laying down frequently and anorexia in two 3yearold mares in adjacent pens fig 1 index cases 1 and 2 these two cases beginning simultaneously were considered the index cases of this outbreak in total five horses all positive for bcov on faecal pcr and ages ranging from 6 months to 12 years median 5 years developed clinical signs the clinical signs of anorexia lethargy and fever ranging from 1025 to 1044f 392 to 402c were consistent among the five miniature horses who developed clinical illness over the course of the outbreak table 1 one infected horse also developed diarrhoea while two other infected horses developed mild colic signs and had decreased faecal production clinical signs in four of the five horses were selflimiting and resolved in 25 days with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug nsaid flunixin meglumine administration by the owner for febrile episodes two mares the index cases were given antibiotics at the onset of clinical signs including trimethoprim sulphamethoxazole tablets orally and oxytetracycline intravenously these treatments were administered prior to the diagnosis of bcov an 8yearold stallion also required supportive care on the farm with intravenous fluids due to dehydration associated with diarrhoea one of the index cases index case 2 continued to be febrile inappetent had no manure production and mild colic signs after 5 days of treatment on the farm and was referred for more intensive care to the cornell university equine hospital see hospitalised mare section once the diagnosis of bcov infection was made via molecular detection of the virus in the faeces pcr testing from the hospitalised horse faecal samples were collected from both clinically ill and healthy horses and the donkey on the premise for pcr detection of bcov at various times over a 26day period beginning 9 days after the onset of clinical signs all individuals on the farm had a minimum of one faecal pcr performed and a maximum of six faecal pcr tests for bcov over that period edta whole blood was also collected from six faecal bcov pcr positive horses three affected and three unaffected and tested for bcov by pcr these blood samples were collected on day 9 after clinical signs began in the index cases days 2 4 and 9 after clinical signs developed in the three affected horses complete blood count cbc and serum chemistries were also performed on the index case who required hospitalisation one faecal sample was also collected for molecular detection of bcov from a 10yearold quarter horse mare who was owned by an employee of this farm but housed at a separate location with additional horses this horse developed a fever of unknown origin approximately 1 week after clinical signs were first detected in the two index cases at the primary farm on arrival to the cornell university equine hospital index case 2 was lethargic and slightly underconditioned with a body condition score of 49 her mucous membranes were dark red with a toxic line and her capillary refill time was about 3 s her sclera appeared mildly icteric and she was tachycardic 60 beatsmin digital pulses were palpable in both front limbs and all four hooves were warm but lameness was not noted her rectal temperature was 381c 1006f significant cbc findings included an elevated hct 47 normal 3446 and low total solids ts 49 gl normal 5278 gl suggestive of both dehydration and protein loss a leucopenia 47 109l normal 55125 109l characterised by lymphopenia 15 109l normal 1850 109l and neutropenia 28

mmoll and elevated aspartate aminotransferase ast 834 ul normal 100600 ul the mare was treated with supportive care including intravenous fluids crystalloids and colloids omeprazole pentoxifylline and ice boots the mare continued to improve over the next few days her temperature remained normal clinical pathologic parameters normalised appetite gradually increased and she finally passed faeces on day 3 of hospitalisation 8 days after onset of clinical signs a sample of that faeces was collected and tested positive for beta coronavirus by pcr for infection control purposes all animals admitted to cornell university equine hospital are required to have a faecal salmonella culture performed this faecal sample was negative for salmonella by culture a faecal quantitative floatation was performed and two strongyle eggsgram were detected targeted diagnostic testing was performed on this case due to economic concerns for this reason along with season of the year january in upstate new york and the clinical signs present other enteric pathogen testing was not performed the aetiologic agent of the outbreak was determined to be a beta coronavirus based on molecular detection of virus in the faecal sample from the hospitalised mare initially followed by molecular detection in additional faecal and whole blood samples from other miniature horses on the farm the pcr assay used will also detect other members of the betacoronavirus family including bovine enteric coronavirus canine respiratory coronavirus human coronavirus oc43 and equine enteric coronavirus the primers and probe sequences target a conserved region within the nucleocapsid gene and were provided by a third party under a confidentiality agreement the assay was originally validated using in vitro rna transcripts containing the target region derived from bovine enteric coronavirus analytical sensitivity was determined to be 100 copies with a slope of 3327 and an efficiency of 9979 all samples are run with an exogenous rna control encapsulated rna phage added at the samples lysis step to monitor for rtpcr inhibition once the diagnosis of beta coronavirus was made on the hospitalised index case faecal samples were collected from the remaining 29 animals at the farm four of which also had current or previous clinical signs molecular diagnostic test results and clinical signs are summarised in table 1 fifteen of those animals sampled initially were positive via faecal pcr for bcov in total 25 animals 83 on the primary premise tested positive over the course of the 4week period during which faecal samples were collected five 20 of the 25 animals who tested positive demonstrated clinical signs associated with bcov while 20 80 of the positive animals remained asymptomatic no animals displaying clinical signs tested negative for bcov edta whole blood was also collected from six of the miniature horses that were pcr positive on faeces these blood samples were collected one time 9 days after the outbreak began on the farm four of these animals were pcr positive for bcov on whole blood three of which had previously n  1 or currently n  2 demonstrated clinical signs furthermore virus isolation vi was performed on the edta whole blood samples and equine herpesvirus2 ehv2 was isolated from two of the horses one yearling without any clinical signs and one adult stallion with clinical signs isolation of this ehv2 virus from edta whole blood in conjunction with molecular detection of bcov in whole blood has not been reported previously and the role that ehv2 played in this outbreak if any is unclear bcov including ecov is not routinely recovered by vi and most studies on ecov prevalence rely on pcr assays pusterla et al 2013 2015 miszczak et al 2014 hemida et al 2017 to the authors knowledge this was the first time that bcov had been diagnosed in an adult horse in new york state and little was known about its role in disease in adult horses at the time vi is not a pathogenspecific testing modality so it is often performed on whole blood samples from horses with fevers of unknown origin as a means of detecting viraemia due to unknown viral pathogens vi was performed on the whole blood samples in this outbreak as part of an investigative workup for a fever of unknown origin and also because of the possibility although unlikely of isolating bcov for further characterisation the faecal sample collected from the farm employees horse housed in a separate location approximately 6 miles from the primary premises tested positive for bcov by pcr no additional samples were collected from this horse so followup testing was not performed to the authors knowledge no other horses present at this separate facility 68 total horses in the barn became ill or were tested for bcov faecal samples were collected intermittently over the next several weeks from all amh and the donkey on the primary premises one horse tested positive initially and was still positive 25 days later on faecal pcr two other horses demonstrated bcov shedding in faeces on two samples collected 22 and 18 days apart there was no correlation seen between beta coronavirus cycle threshold ct values in faecal samples and expression of clinical signs followup samples beyond that time period were not collected and all three of these horses remained asymptomatic throughout the entire duration of the outbreak the lack of mortality in this bcov outbreak is in contrast to the case fatality rates reported in some previous outbreaks involving adult horses oue et al 2011 2013 pusterla et al 2013 fielding et al 2015 previous studies have demonstrated that ecov is a very common agent present in healthy foals 20 weeks of age slovis et al 2014 for this reason it has been hypothesised that there may be a protective effect of breeding farms against ecov due to constant exposure of the mares to ecov shed by the foals this farm was not bringing in outside mares to be bred to their stallion the stallion was only used for breeding the mares on this farm and the farm generally produced up to 6 foals per year all mares and geldings were turned out together for exercise so all had contact with each other daily and the stallion was turned out separately perhaps the presence of foals on this farm helps explain the lack of mortality and the low morbidity seen in this outbreak compared with that described elsewhere the exposure of adult horses to foals could however also explain the source of this outbreak as the two index cases were on one side of the barn adjacent to the only two weanlings 6 months old in the barn who also tested positive for bcov but never developed clinical illness ventilation of the barn alone does not offer much insight to disease spread of aerosolised viral particles as the barn had upward ventilation throughout ecov has been described in one outbreak among adult miniature horses and a miniature donkey originating from a single competition fielding et al 2015 the case fatality rate of this outbreak was 27 among those animals who tested positive for ecov in their faeces fielding et al 2015 other prior outbreaks have published case fatality rates ranging from 0 to 7 oue et al 2011 2013 pusterla et al 2013 the published durations of faecal shedding of ecov has ranged from 3 to 14 days among outbreaks and experimental infections in adult horses nemoto et al 2014 fielding et al 2015 over the course of this outbreak bcov pcr was performed on faecal samples from each animal as few as one time and as many as six times the prolonged shedding periods of at least 25 22 and 18 days duration occurred in three horses who failed to demonstrate any associated clinical signs throughout the outbreak period to the authors knowledge these durations of faecal detection are longer than previously described in animals lacking clinical signs of illness in contrast a european paper described one horse who shed ecov in faeces for 35 days but subsequently died with severe diarrhoea miszczak et al 2014 similarly faecal samples from a 28yearold horse submitted to the animal health diagnostic center ahdc at cornell for bcov faecal pcr testing were positive at days 1 28 63 and 99 after onset of disease this horse originally demonstrated clinical signs of a fever 40c 104f mild colic signs lethargy anorexia and developed softformed faeces clinical illness lasted for a total of 710 days a glaser personal communication 2014 this information suggests that a potential for prolonged shedding longer than the previously published 14 days should be considered in any biosecurity plan following bcov infection at a facility horse 13 fig 1 was the most recent addition to this farm this gelding was brought to the farm approximately 3 months prior to the onset of the outbreak in this outbreak horse 13 tested positive for bcov on faecal pcr during the outbreak but remained asymptomatic while this may represent another possible source of this outbreak it is difficult to explain why clinical disease would not have been seen sooner in the index cases if the new horse was shedding beta coronavirus upon arrival as the incubation period for ecov has been demonstrated to be 24 days post inoculation nemoto et al 2014 if this horse was the source of the outbreak it would represent a very prolonged shedding period which is possible as mentioned above or else intermittent shedding of bcov which to the authors knowledge has not yet been documented an association has been demonstrated between viral load and mortality in ecov outbreaks fielding et al 2015 although viral load was not measured in this outbreak there was no correlation detected between beta coronavirus ct values in faecal samples and expression of clinical signs so it is unlikely that differences in viral load were solely responsible for the differences seen in disease expression in this outbreak other factors affecting mortality may include strain differences as well as environmental and host characteristics the miniature horses of this report were all in excellent lean body condition such ideal condition may have offered protection from the common secondary complication hepatic lipidosis that may plague sick inappetent miniature horses the one animal which required care at a referral veterinary hospital had been treated for 5 days on the farm with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications perhaps contributing significantly to the prolongation of clinical signs previously described outbreaks of ecov demonstrated morbidity rates ranging from 20 to 67 pusterla et al 2013 fielding et al 2015 the morbidity rate in this bcov outbreak was only 17 5 of 30 horses showing clinical signs with 80 of the positive animals in this outbreak remaining asymptomatic this is in contrast to only 33 asymptomatic positive animals in a previously described ecov outbreak among a similar population fielding et al 2015 as mentioned previously this discrepancy could also be explained by the hypothesis that exposure of adult horses to bcov from foals may offer some protection against morbidity and mortality associated with this virus this also suggests that there may be a greater likelihood than previously suspected of asymptomatic animals perpetuating an outbreak of bcov at the time of this outbreak there was no equinespecific antibody test available to detect horses with subclinical or previous ecov infections currently there is an ecov s proteinbased elisa that would have been useful to further characterise the role of asymptomatic shedders in this bcov outbreak kooijman et al 2016 this outbreak also suggests that people can play a role in transmission of bcov among horses the horse who was housed at a separate facility but owned by an employee of the primary premises developed clinical signs compatible with bcov and tested positive for bcov on faecal pcr although an unrelated bcov transmission and infection could have occurred on the second farm a more likely explanation for the source of transmission was the farm employee as there were no other common contacts shared between the two farms this highlights the need for stringent biosecurity efforts including the limit of human movement to other farms during a bcov outbreak our findings suggest all individuals at risk for disease should be tested not just those demonstrating clinical signs prior to lifting quarantine measures further work is necessary to establish guidelines for bcov quarantine timeframes as animals both with and without obvious clinical signs may shed virus for prolonged periods of time no conflicts of interest have been declared this investigation was focused on studying the animals affected by

asymptomaticmild symptom patients constitute a substantial component of covid-19 disease burden objectives the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 originating from wuhan rapidly spread throughout china while its origin remains uncertain accumulating evidence links a wet market for the early sars-cov-2 spread in wuhan similarly the influence of the marketplace on the early transmission dynamics is yet to be investigated using the daily series of covid-19 incidence stratified according to contact history with the market we have conducted quantitative modeling analyses to estimate the reproduction numbers r for the market-to-human and human-to-human j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f transmission the reporting probability and the early effects of public health interventions we estimated r at 024 95cri 001-138 for market-to-human transmission and 237 95cri 208-271 for human-to-human transmission during the early spread in china 2019-2020 moreover we estimated that the reporting rate for cases stemming from market-to-human transmission was 2-34 fold higher than that for cases stemming from human-to-human transmission suggesting that contact history with the wet market played a key role in identifying covid-19 cases our r estimate tied to market-to-human transmission has substantial uncertainty but it was significantly lower compared to the reproduction number driving human-to-human transmission our results also suggest that asymptomatic and subclinical infections constitute a substantial component of the covid-19 morbidity burden dashed line indicates 50 percentile and areas surrounded by light grey and deep grey indicates 95 and 50 credible intervals cri for posterior estimates respectively upper panel a correspond to infections arising from market-to-human transmission lower panel b correspond to infections through human-to-human transmission respectively epidemic day 1 corresponds to the day that starts at december 82020 j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f  a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 originating from wuhan rapidly spread around the world to give rise to the most important pandemic event in recent history the cumulative number of confirmed cases has reached 35 million cases including 250000 deaths as of may 17 2020 1  early mean estimates of the reproduction number based on the epidemics growth rate have been estimated in the range 14-35 comparable with estimates for seasonal 2009 pandemic flu sars and mers 2 3 4 5 6 7  considering the explosive spread and significant severity associated with the novel coronavirus the who declared this public health emergency a pandemic on march 11 2020  and the world is coming together to fight the spread of the coronavirus evidence suggest that the novel coronavirus likely jumped from a primary reservoir eg horseshoe bats to an intermediary reservoir possibly generating an outbreak among wild animals in at least one wet market in wuhan china 8 9  the virus first infected multiple individuals working or visiting the huanan seafood wholesale market at an early stage initiating multiple chains of transmission that ensured sustained transmission in the human population 10  while the detailed origin of the outbreak remains uncertain significant evidence strongly links the huanan seafood wholesale j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f market in wuhan for the early spread of the novel coronavirus covid-19 among humans 9  in this paper we conduct quantitative modeling analyses to quantify the role of the wet marketplace on the early transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus in china 11  for this purpose we analyzed and modeled data that stratifies the market hazard market-to-human transmission and human-to-human transmission dynamics daily series of laboratory-confirmed covid-19 cases were extracted from a recently published study 9  from december 8 2019 to january 21 2020 we analyzed a total of 425 confirmed cases by date of symptoms onset including information on whether the case was linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market that is this unique case series stratifies cases with visiting history to the huanan seafood wholesale market which has been purported as source of this large epidemic at an early stage 9  and those arising from human-to-human transmission because the corresponding incidence curve is subject to reporting delays the last 12 epidemic days j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f were excluded from our analysis thus the study period is set from december 8 th  2019 to january 9 th  2020 we model two types of infections a market hazard market-to-human transmission including primary infections arising from zoonotic transmission to some extent and b human-to-human transmission chains a model schematic of the transmission dynamics is provided in figure 1  primary infection index case occurs as a result of a spillover event and primary infections may generate secondary cases the number of infected individuals stemming from the market-to-human and the human-tohuman route are denoted by im and ih respectively we employed a discrete-time integral equation to capture the daily incidence series with contact history let fs denote the probability mass function of the serial interval of length s days which is given by  where ecmt represents the expected number of new cases with onset day t infected through market-to-human transmission p is the conditional probability of extinction j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f within one generation given by 1rm1 12 13  where rh and rm represents the average number of secondary infections generated by one single infection generated from the market-to-human or from the human-to-human transmission respectively to account for the type of infection dependent probability of occurrence  j 14  we assume that the number of observed cases for infection type j on day t hjt occurred according to a bernoulli sampling process with the expected values ecjht-1 where ecj ht-1 denotes the conditional expected incidence on day t given the history of observed data from day 0 to day t-1 denoted by ht-1 thus the number of expected newly observed cases is written as follows subsequently we also account for the reporting probability that depends on the type of infection we assume that the number of reported cases by infection type j on  where 1 and 2 scale the intensity of public health interventions where 1 and 2 is expected to be smaller than 1 and period1 and period2 define the study periods the number of expected newly observed cases should be updated as we assume the incidence hj is the result of the poisson sampling process with the expected value of ehj the likelihood function for the time series of observed cases of primary infection through the market-to-human transmission and secondary infection through human-to-human transmission that we employ to estimate the reproduction number and other relevant parameters is given by where u indicates parameter sets that are estimated from this likelihood the serial interval is assumed to follow a lognormal distribution with the mean and sd at 47 and 29 days respectively based on ref 15  the maximum value of the serial interval was fixed at 16 days as the cumulative probability distribution of the lognormal distribution up to 16 days reaches 099 for sensitivity analyses we examined the effect of varying the mean of the serial interval on rj by varying the mean serial interval from 27 to 67 days  the 16 17  our method is a powerful tool to estimate the underlying cases including asymptomatic and mild symptoms and our results suggests that those proportions constitute a large fraction of the epidemics magnitude in fact the result of careful screening detailed examination and follow-up studies to confirm that the people did not turn symptomatic at a later stage of a total of 565 japanese returnees evacuated from wuhan city by government-chartered planes during january 29-31 2020 revealing a ratio of 4 asymptomatic to 9 symptomatic cases and the estimated asymptomatic proportion was reported to be 308 95 confidence interval 77-538 18 19  for the covid-19 outbreak that unfolded aboard the diamond princess cruise ship the proportion of truly asymptomatic infections was estimated at 179 95cri 155-2025 among a largely senior population 20  in addition one study reported that the majority of seasonal coronavirus infections are asymptomatic by most symptom definitions and only 4 of individuals experiencing a seasonal coronavirus infection episode sought medical care for their symptoms 21  taken together this evidence further underscores the need to account for a significant fraction of asymptomatic cases furthermore reporting probabilities for cases stemming from market-to-human and human-to-human cases were estimated to be low but we estimated that the reporting rate for market-to-human route was 2-34 fold higher suggesting that contact history with the huanan seafood wholesale market played a key role in identifying cases with covid-19 in the context of the influenza season when many influenza patients with non-specific symptoms fever and respiratory symptoms visit medical facilities which further complicates an accurate diagnosis of covid-19 based on nonspecific symptoms 22  indeed during the initial disease stages infected individuals with covid-19 exhibit clinical features that are similar to those of other common respiratory diseases 23  our results are not free from limitations we cannot rule out the possibility that some cases with contact history with the huanan seafood wholesale market got infected by relatively lower compared to human-to-human transmission the power of our approach lies in the ability to infer epidemiological parameters with quantified uncertainty from limited data collected by surveillance systems the authors declare no conflicts of interest no ethical approval is requested routes are classified into market-to-human transmission and human-to-human transmission infected through market-to-human route and human-to-human route is indicated by im and ih respectively reported cases of primary case infected through market-to-human route and of secondary or later cases though human-to-human route is indicated by cm and ch respectively a virus with substantial human-to-human transmission potential could yield subsequent transmissions caused by human-to-human transmission j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f
