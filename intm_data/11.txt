fighting against covid-19 innovative strategies for clinical pharmacists huibo li siqian zheng fang liu wei liu rongsheng zhao   in december 2019 a novel coronavirus 2019-ncov was first detected in cases of acute respiratory illness in wuhan hubei province china which then caused a rapid outbreak and pandemic of infection in 203 locations worldwide1

2 on february 11 2020 the coronavirus study group csg of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses formally designates it as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 on the same day the world health organization who officially named the disease caused by this virus as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 following the advice of the emergency committee the who director-general has declared the sars-cov-2 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern and pandemic for the reason that the virus might spread to countries that do not have robust health systems3 as of april 2 2020 sars-cov-2 has caused 896450 infections and 45526 deaths worldwide which is a tragic milestone4
 with the continuous changes in the covid-19 pandemic situation more than 40 thousand of medical personnel nationwide rush to hubei and several expert teams sent abroad by chinese authorities to italy iran and iraq to aid the pandemic fighting and a few medical teams sent clinical pharmacists to participate in the treatment of covid-19 its important to offer both complicated treatment of icu patients to reduce mortality and comprehensive treatment of mild and general patients to improve the cure rate in public health affairs pharmacists have been responsible for a significant role in flu season the us pharmacists and physicians collaborate to make flu patients receive timely treatment5 in two outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars the canadian pharmacists played a vital role in drug distribution drug information and supporting direct patient care6 as the first sars-cov-2 detected location with extensive experience chinese pharmacists also responded quickly and carried out a variety of strategies to provide pharmaceutical care this study retrieves and investigates related work performed by chinese clinical pharmacists during the sars-cov-2 outbreak summarizes the roles and responsibilities of clinical pharmacists and proposes innovative strategies for developing pharmacy services for reference by global pharmacists as of april 2 2020 the chinese cnki wanfang data vip and english pubmed embase cochrane library databases self-media networks website of professional society or medical institution and clinical trial registry platforms were searched online with the text words novel coronavirus or 2019-ncov or covid-19 or sars-cov-2and pharmacy service or pharmaceutical care or guideline or guidance various pharmacy-related societies and medical institutions that organized clinical pharmacists to actively participate in the work to fight the sars-cov-2 pandemic were investigated the clinical characteristics of diseases current status of medications and clinical needs of covid-19 patients were collected in wuhan huoshenshan fire god mountain hospital leishenshan thunder god mountain hospital 16 fangcangfangcang shelter hospitals and wuhan tongji hospitals sino-french new city branch by interviewing the frontline clinicians and pharmacists with the large scale spread of sars-cov-2 global researchers clinicians epidemiologists quickly shared their studies on the virus genome sequence characteristics and routes of transmission2

7 prevention and control strategies8 the clinical characteristics of the disease9 10 11 12 and treatment recommendations13

14 the chinese pharmacists were invited to participate in the development of the international federation of pharmacy fip health advisory for health advice for global pharmacists and the pharmacy workforce under sars-cov-2 outbreak15 and the pharmacists in peking university third hospital were responsible for the translation of the chinese version16 the chinese pharmaceutical association cpa organized pharmacy experts to analyze assess and summarize the existing guidelines literatures and expert consensus combining with their experience during sars in 2003 and developed the expert consensus on guidance and prevention strategies for hospital pharmacy personnel17 and retail pharmacy staff18 the pharmacists in peking university third hospital discussed hospital and community pharmacists role and the content of pharmaceutical care during the pandemic19

20 provincial and municipal pharmacy quality control centers and medical institutions have formulated work recommendations in response to sars-cov-2 infection and formulated a list of drug reserves21 the chinese wisdom pharmaceutical union also carried out the development recommendations about smart pharmacy services under the epidemic22
 to assist clinicians in better understanding and prescribing the drugs on the medication list clinical pharmacists created a rational drug use manual for frontline medical personnel to apply treatment of covid-19 including usage and dosage solvents precautions adverse drug reactions and dose adjustment for special populations such as the pregnant women children elderly patients dialysis patients ecmo patients etc23

24 pharmacy administration commision of chinese hospital association chapac compiled the fangcang shelter hospital drug formulary in addition national pharmacist team of supporting hubei frontline pharmacists updated anti-epidemic medicine news weekly 30 issues in total including the latest international guidelines research results and information related to covid-19 and the answers of the questions and myth busting from frontline clinicians during the epidemic all the pharmacists work files have been summarized collated and compiled into books at present with no targeted antiviral medicines for preventing or treating the sars-cov-2 infection25 pharmaceutical scientists clinicians and pharmacists are actively conducting registered studies to explore effective treatment options there are 239 and 524 observational or interventional studies registered on international clinical trial database and the chinese clinical trials registry database respectively so far pharmacists in the peking university third hospital participant to explore the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine sulfate in comparison with phosphate chloroquine in severe patients with covid-19 chictr2000029898 and provide data support for establishment the standardized treatment and optimized dosing regimen in clinical practice26 not only can pharmacists participate in clinical trials but also establish a database of clinical drug research in the real world based on medical recordsbig data to analysis the safety and effectiveness of medication therapy in patients with different types of covid-19 chictr2000031376 currently there is no specific medicine or vaccine for covid-19 and no medicines or vaccines have been fully tested for safety and efficacy25 pharmacists had conduct evidence-based evaluations of the efficacy of medications discussed in the current seventh edition national diagnosis and treatment guidance developed by the china national health commission cnhc14 and other treatments in the sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers to provide reference for treating covid-19 for example evaluating the indications and effectiveness of lopinavirritonavir27 abidor interferon28 chloroquine phosphate and other antiviral drugs in the prevention and treatment of covid-1929 noticing the dosage and precautions of ribavirin28 and glucocorticoids30 deciding which drugs can be nebulized31 to explore the optimal dosing regimen route of administration to assist frontline doctors based on the existing evidence available the hospital pharmacy professional committee of chinese pharmaceutical association developed the expert consensus on rational drug use in clinical practice for covid-1932 furthermore the pharmacists in the peking university third hospital participated in the international evidence-based guideline for covid-19 treatment drugs developed by the mcmaster evidence-based medical center of canada and were responsible for the drug evaluation and manuscript writing of the antiviral drugs the guideline is now complete and in submission to reduce the risk of infection it is recommended that medical institutions use innovative methods to dispense drugs to inpatients such as using automated dispensers and intelligent drug storage cabinets22 and intravenous drugs be centrally deployed in the pharmacy intravenous admixture services pivas in competent medical institutions inpatient order review and dispensing flowchart see fig 2
 as the responsible person pharmacists shall review the prescriptions accurately and efficiently during the epidemic pharmacists in all medical institutions shall jointly establish and optimize prescription review rules and knowledge database use rational drug of clinical decision support system cdss to review prescriptions to reduce the irrational prescriptions and medication errors and to ensure medication safety22 the establishment of drug knowledge base shall focus in the following areasavoid the concomitant use of lopinavirritonavir and other cyp3a4-metabolized drugs avoid concomitant use of oral antibiotics and microecologic agents see appendix 1 covid-19 drug interactions33
pay attention to the risk of duplicate use of medications especially medications patients take from homepay attention to the compatibility and configuration of intravenous drugs especially traditional chinese medicine injections and drugs that require atomization
 a retrospective study suggests that 232 of the covid-19 patients have complications34 based on the characteristics of the comorbidities of the affected population clinical pharmacists shall play a vital role in medication reconciliation and develop implement medication therapy management mtm for patients with chronic diseases to improve medication compliance accuracy and cure rates to support medical care a few days after the opening of the first fangcang shelter hospitals health workers in wuhan had access to electronic information systems supported by cloud platforms and connected with higher-level hospitals for record keeping data transfer and monitoring of quality of care and outcomes35 there are nearly 1000 beds equipped with nearly 200 drugs in a fangcang shelter hospital however only three to five pharmacists are stationed at each spot to meet the needs of pharmaceutical service for patients in fangcang shelter hospitals pharmacists in tongji medical college of huazhong university of science and technology launched the online pharmaceutical monitoring service which is an online pharmaceutical service model mainly using wechat app with smart mobile36

37 each patient in fangcang shelter hospital shall answer the drug information questionnaire on admission and medication information is uploaded to the cloud platform and questions are answered promptly36
 the online pharmaceutical service model not only effectively reduce the chance of hospital-acquired infections but also improve the efficiency of pharmacy services and achieve timely and effective professional medication guidance for patients throughout the entire process pharmacists play an essential and unique role within the healthcare team to optimize patient care during this covid-19 pandemic as a member of a multi-disciplinary diagnosis and treatment team mdt pharmacists shall give full play to their pharmacological expertise and consider the patients symptoms and etiological results combining with liver and kidney function and pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug to formulate individualized drug regimens and to improve cure rate38
 in the current pandemic financial and material resources are being consumed largely nutritional status shall be taken as a basic vital sign and nutritional treatment shall be considered as first-line treatment39 nutritional pharmacists as members of the multidisciplinary collaborative team had set up standardized nutrition therapy procedures for severe and critical patients with covid-1940 meanwhile pharmacists shall assess the risk of stress-induced gastric mucosal lesions venous thromboembolism vte and be alert to the occurrence of complications among covid-19 patients public transport in many regions has been suspended to lower the risk of disease transmission thus online health services have been widely adopted in order to improve the effectiveness of drug therapy for mild patients in the case of extremely limited medical care resources pharmacists across the country actively provide medication education and mtm to patients and provide psychological counseling to the public through a variety of methods including telehealth consultation the beijing pharmacist association selected 27 pharmacist volunteers with rich clinical experience and mtm qualifications in tertiary hospitals and established an online voluntary pharmacy service team of cloud pharmacy care quickly patients or public can consult pharmacists on cloud pharmacy care platform in the form of pictures texts or internet calls within 8 am-8 pm on medication-related issues including drug reformation chronic medication management lifestyle guidance and psychological counseling in response to the need for pharmaceutical care of patients in wuhan 16 fangcang shelter hospitals the chapac organized more than 100 senior clinical pharmacists to support the frontline pharmacists in wuhan about the frequently asked questions and myth busting and provide multi-media of chronic home management popularization materials in various forms including text picture animated cartoon and video are created the pharmacists created a fangcang shelter radio station to popularize covid-19 related prevention and control and medication knowledge relieve patients panic and nervousness about the disease and use the educational materials above for the fangcang shelter patients provide a series of lectures called reasonable use of medicine war will win on the rational use of medicines see fig 4
41 the lectures related to medication education for patients therapeutic drugs covid-19 reasonable nutrition dietary advice self-protection and medication instructions after discharge targeting patients medication needs at admission during hospitalization and upon discharge besides pharmacists have a pivotal role to play not only in ensuring access to medicines and medical devices but also in public health namely by informing the public about preventative measures advising about behavioural precautions and in the risk assessment early detection and referral of individuals suspected to be at a higher risk of being infected15 pharmacists shall spread and promote medical knowledge popularization the in live broadcast or recorded course through the tv program the internet and other medias to public such as tik tok bilibili youku youtube it is particularly worth mentioning that through relevant science popularization public have learned to wash hands properly and wear mask scientifically which can greatly improve peoples health awareness and the development of such hygiene habits will benefit for life sars-cov-2 is a highly contagious virus and the disease progression of infected patients happens rapidly frontline medical staff continuously explore suitable diagnosis and treatment schemes in practice in the face of public health emergencies domestic and foreign clinical pharmacists collaborated together to take advantage of their pharmacology and pharmacological expertise to actively participate in the medical activities of covid-19 and to maximize pharmacists value and responsibility conclusively the role of a clinical pharmacist is not only being an academic leader to formulate work guidance and recommendations but also a practitioner of pharmacy services providing medical advice to frontline medical staff and ensuring the rational use of drugs during the epidemic at the same time we found that the epidemic has driven the development of innovative and remote pharmacy services the epidemic of covid-19 is changing every day and clinical pharmacists need to constantly update the latest progress on the treatment and explore the innovative pharmaceutical services for the current situation additional retrieved pharmacy-related resources and information of covid-19 see appendix 1 li hb zheng sq liu f and liu w contributed to writing the manuscript liu f and zhao rs performed the manuscript frame all authors reviewed and approved the final manuscript

 the main task of the pharmacy emergency command group was to perform the functions of the pharmacy administration committee of the module hospital take general charge of the relevant pharmacy administration work of the module hospital implement the unified plan and deployment of personnel drugs and consumables and accept the instructions and scheduling of the superior specifically this included a formulation and review of the treatment medication plan and the drug formulary and a review of the types dosage forms specifications quantities packaging etc of the emergency drugs any difficulty in supplying drugs consumables and disinfectants was reported to the superior in a timely manner with a request for support the drug supply assurance group was responsible for the purchase storage and distribution of drugs and disinfectants and ensured the supply of drugs this group made purchases and requisition and budget plans according to the inventory and the consumption furthermore it adjusted the inventory in time according to the diagnosis and the treatment plans the clinical treatment demand and the drug reserve to fulfill the demand of clinical use finally it submitted the drug applications to the supporting unit and the local government requested for the drugs in a timely manner and took good care of the registration and management of donated antiepidemic drugs the drug dispensing group was responsible for the daily drug dispensing work of the module hospital it controlled the drug use trend provided drug use information for the clinic ensured the drug supply and prevented overstocking in a timely manner the quality control group checked the quality of the purchased and donated drugs including legal qualification and validity it strictly implemented the relevant provisions of the state food and drug administration the drugs donated and allocated for domestic production must be the ones approved by the state administration for production with an approval number and a quality standard and the validity period must be more than 6 months from the expiration date furthermore this group immediately handled and reported the problematic drugs once they were discovered the clinical pharmaceutical care group reviewed the prescriptions and provided online medication consultation and education for the patients through the internet telephone video and other forms for drug userelated problems this group communicated with the medical staff of the module hospital on time gave feedback on the problems encountered while providing pharmaceutical care paid attention to adverse drug reactions adrs and recorded and filled in the adr report on time in the following section we describe the characteristics of the module drug dispensing service including information system module pharmacy critical care drug trolley and packaging service the module hospital information system existed as a subsystem and was connected with the hospital information system in time the electronic medical record system and outpatient doctor workstation system were used to issue medication orders for the patients the pharmacy information system was used for account keeping and management such as drug supply in and out of the warehouse and inventory drug data collection drug planning prescription deployment and expiration period management when entering the module hospital the patients were assigned an identification code and the patient data were filed and entered into the information system each doctor was assigned a unique user code and password so that he or she can complete the work of issuing orders inspections and checklists on logging into the electronic system based on the characteristic of mild symptoms of the patients with covid-19 together with the diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia trial version sixth edition national health council other documents and literature9

10 the reference list of key therapeutic drugs was summarized and the structure and quantity of patients drug demand were identified to establish a scientific and rational drug formulary by the drug supply assurance group 
table 1
presents the list of the drugs according to the classification based on the dosage forms and pharmacologic functions approximately 50 kinds of drugs were listed all drugs were stored under the storage conditions specified in the drug instruction manual and attention was paid to storage temperature and humidity the main treatment was oral medicine table 1 shows that there were 37 kinds of oral preparations 74 and 13 kinds of injections 26 the reason for the treatment with mainly oral medicine was that the module hospital mainly hosted the patients who had covid-19 with mild symptoms in addition to covid-19 targeted treatment the drug formulary also focused on patients mental state and underlying primary diseases and also covered the chinese patent medicine and emergency medicine as indicated in table 1 1 the drug formulary covered the antiviral antibacterial antipyretic analgesic antitussive antiasthmatic expectorant and gastrointestinal drugs these drugs were screened out as related to the treatment of covid-19 32 of total drugs according to the novel coronavirus
pneumonia treatment plan the characteristic action of sars-cov-2 on the respiratory and intestinal tracts and the mechanism and the clinical manifestations of the disease 2 sedative and hypnotic drugs were prepared 2 of total drugs because some patients can be highly nervous 3 for a few patients with underlying primary diseases the drug formulary covered drugs for chronic diseases such as antihypertensive hypoglycemic and lipid-lowering drugs 28 of total drugs 4 the combination of traditional chinese and western medicine was conducive to the rehabilitation of the patients with covid-19 therefore the drug formulary also included 7 kinds of chinese patent medicines 14 of total drugs 5 considering that some patients with mild symptoms may develop more severe symptoms 18 kinds of critical care drugs were included 18 of total drugs based on the course characteristics of covid-19 and considering that some patients with mild disease may suddenly develop severe or critical disease9 the drug dispensing group set up 4 critical care trolleys figure 1
 loaded with all kinds of critical care drugs table 1 and supplies which could be provided on-call anytime the trolley was divided into 3 layers the first layer was a box with a cover which was used to load the entire box of critical care drugs and the back of the box cover was designed with a separate bag for loading scattered drugs the second and third layers were designed with a left drawer and a right cabinet with a door the drawer was for placing syringes and other consumables and the cabinet was for placing large infusions the entire body of the critical care trolley was made of stainless steel with a pulley and handle design making it convenient for emergency movement once a patient developed a critical condition such as shock respiratory failure heart failure etc the medical staff visited the patient with the critical care drug trolley to immediately administer the critical care medicine according to the patients condition the medical staff decided about transferring the patient to the designated hospital the drugs used in the module hospital were the same as those used in the ordinary hospital however for the special case of covid-19 specific outer packaging of the drugs was required11 considering that the patients with mild disease needed mainly the oral drugs we adopted transparent plastic bags that could be sealed labeled them with the patients name and bed number using a tag and marked them with the name and quantity of the drugs with a black oily pen as shown in figure 2
 the advantages of the package are as follows 1 the medicine in the transparent bag is clear at a glance with a clear label which is convenient for handover and can be checked by different personnel during drug distribution pharmacist checknurse distributepatient inform 2 moisture-proof dustproof and sealable features ensure the convenience and cleanliness of the drug storage and 3 disposable plastic bags are cheap and economical and can be sterilized and destroyed after use based on several clinical medication practice analyses the national health commission edited the diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia sixth trial edition revised version national health council which recommended a combination of chinese and western medicine to treat covid-19 most of the patients in the module hospital were older people older than 50 years and some of them had chronic primary diseases therefore the combined use of chinese and western medicine the use of multiple chinese patent drugs or the combined use of chinese patent drugs and chinese herbal decoctions was common most of the doctors participating in the diagnosis and treatment in the module hospital were western medicine doctors hence it may be necessary for the pharmacists of the clinical pharmaceutical care group to actively participate in evaluating drug compatibility interactions and adverse reactions to ensure the safety of the patients taking the jianghan module hospital as an example possible problems of drug compatibility are summarized in appendix 1 the module pharmacy was placed in a clean area after the doctor processed the order on the computer the order information was immediately transmitted to the pharmacy pharmacists examined electronic prescriptions and checked with doctors when a prescription was called into question approximately 20000 electronic orders of the doctors were reviewed online by clinical pharmacists which reduced the irrational drug use and minimized the risk involved after reviewing the prescriptions the qualified drugs were dispensed packaged and handed over to the patients by the pharmacists in the designated areas to reduce and avoid the severe adrs or adverse drug events ades the clinical pharmacists informed and educated the patients about reasonable and safe medication when adrs or ades were observed in the patients the doctors or nurses consulted with the clinical pharmacists and filled in the adr report on the adr or ade online reporting platform within time considering the particularity of the covid-19 infection making full use of information technology to provide pharmaceutical care not only reduced direct contact with the patients and avoided unnecessary cross infections but also saved resources such as protective clothing so that limited resources could be used in places of great need the emerging media platform wechat has the following characteristics group or private chat text or voice message remote online video call or voice call and other functions which can meet the needs of different patients and facilitate pharmacists to remotely view patients conditions medication status and possible adrs we set up a wechat group for medication consultation and pasted the quick response qr code in each ward of the module hospital with the help of the nurses to facilitate the patients to join the group by scanning the qr code the group provided medication consultation for patients there was 1 qr code and 1 wechat group for every 150 beds patients were free to join or quit the wechat group more than 20 clinical pharmacists joined all the wechat groups and were quickly divided into groups according to their specialties provided medication consultation anytime and anywhere answered patients different kinds of questions and appeased patients anxiety figure 3
shows pharmacists in the module hospital using wechat to provide medication consultation to the patients among them figure 3a shows the wechat qr code pasted to the module ward and figures 3b and 3c show that the pharmacists provided personalized one-on-one medication consultation services for the patients because most patients were seniors who tend to use smartphones and new technologies less frequently the knowledge about rational drug use was distributed in a timely manner by a community module radio station to relieve the patients panic and tension about the covid-19 disease pharmacists of the clinical pharmaceutical care group oversaw the module radio station which informed all the patients in the module about the medication rational nutrition and diet suggestions for covid-19 and self-protection and medication guidance after discharge the series rational medication to fight against the epidemic of the jianghan module radio stations information emission covered the following subjects 1 education about the antiviral drugs antibacterial drugs chinese patent drugs and symptomatic treatment drugs antipyretic antitussive etc at the module hospital 2 nutrition and diet for the prevention and treatment of the covid-19 and living habit suggestions and 3 self-management and medication guidance after discharge the lecture was broadcasted at a fixed time every day with the start time and content announced in the public area of the module hospital the same lectures were looped again after 3 days figure 4
shows clinical pharmacists broadcasting and spreading the knowledge about rational drug use the pharmacy emergency command group was established for the standardized management of the pharmaceutical care for patients who have covid-19 with mild symptoms in the jianghan module hospital according to the principle of early detection early diagnosis early reporting early isolation and early treatment the module hospital was the first one to have been used for patients who have covid-19 with mild symptoms with the continuous improvement of the module hospital some aspects such as patient admission criteria and variety of drugs need to be adjusted depending on the actual situation for early stage treatment 50 kinds of drugs were determined whereas in the later stage the quantity and variety of drugs had been adjusted and supplemented according to the actual situation for some patients with chronic basic diseases the treatment needed to be altered such as using insulin preparations for the patients with diabetes with the progress of in-depth knowledge about covid-19 some antiviral drugs should be added in the drug formulary to be used against covid-19 according to the newer editions of the novel coronavirus pneumonia treatment plan based on medical evidence the sex and the age of 1312 patients in the module hospital were analyzed and the results are presented in table 2
 showing that the proportion of infected men 548 was larger than that of women the age of patients ranged from 16 to 74 years among these patients the 50- to 59-year age group accounted for the largest proportion 3659 followed by the 40- to 49-year age group 2012 and 30- to 39-year age group 1837 a total of 34 patients 24 male patients and 10 female patients had a history of smoking 26 of the total the results showed that the proportion of patients older than 50 years reached 5527 indicating that pharmacists should pay attention to the patients compliance with medication especially older patients who need to take multiple drugs orally the rate of smoking in the patients was very low perhaps because the module hospital mainly hosted patients who had covid-19 with mild symptoms by march 9 2020 the jianghan module hospital was closed up until then the pharmacists had worked for 34 days in the module hospital for patients who had mild covid-19 the pharmaceutical care task completed by pharmacists is shown in table 3
 the module hospital studied in this article was the first one to have been used in the prevention and control of covid-19 infectious disease the practice of pharmacy administration and pharmaceutical care in the hospital were explored for the first time in treating 1848 patients with mild covid-19 disease the pharmacy department of wuhan union medical college hospital quickly launched the emergency mode established a pharmacy emergency command group built an organizational structure for pharmacy administration and constantly improved the medication management in the module hospital we also innovatively used information technology and a new media platform wechat to provide pharmaceutical care we created a new covid-19 module pharmaceutical care model to provide pharmaceutical care for the patients by ensuring drug supply setting up critical care trolleys designing specific drug packaging bags and creating a module radio station to inform about rational medication knowledge and achieved excellent outcome this model can be applied to other module hospitals in china to fight against covid-19 and can also provide reference for international public health emergencies the pharmacy emergency command group compiled the work manual for pharmacists in a module hospital quickly which helped to standardize the medication management the drug formulary of the module hospital needs continuous readjustment to adapt to the clinical demands according to the characteristics of the patients admitted as the professional pharmaceutical care for the patients was effective the pharmacists have become an important part of the medical staff in the module hospital owing to the high risk of infection noncontact medication consultation and education should also be provided which can improve the patients compliance and relieve patients psychological pressure  covid-19 legal implications for critical care n coghlan d archard p sipanoun t hayes b baharlo  the covid-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented challenge for the provision of critical care anticipating an unsustainable burden on the health service the uk government introduced numerous legislative measures culminating in the coronavirus act which interfere with existing legislation and rights however the existing standards and legal frameworks relevant to critical care clinicians are not extinguished but anticipated to adapt to a new context this new context influences the standard of care that can be reasonably provided and yields numerous human rights considerations for example in the use of restraints or the restrictions placed upon patients and visitors under the infection prevention and control guidance the changing landscape has also highlighted previously unrecognised legal dilemmas the perceived difficulties in the provision of ppe for employees pose a legal risk for trusts and a regulatory risk for clinicians the spectre of rationing critical care poses a number of legal issues notably the flux between clinical decisions based on best interests towards decisions explicitly based on resource considerations should be underpinned by an authoritative public policy decision to preserve legitimacy and lawfulness such a policy should be medically coherent legally robust and ethically justified the current crisis yields numerous challenges for clinicians aspiring to remain faithful to medico-legal and human rights principles developed over many decades especially when such considerations could easily be dismissed however it is exactly at such times that these principles are needed the most and clinicians play a disproportionate role in safeguarding such principles for the most vulnerable  on the 31 december 2019 china reported the first cases of a pneumonia of unknown aetiology in wuhan hubei province 1  subsequently identified to be due to a novel coronavirus 2019-ncov 2  renamed as sars-cov-2 due to its potential to cause a severe acute respiratory syndrome 3  the world health organization who declared this virus and the disease covid- this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved 19  a public health emergency of international concern pheic 4  the virus spread globally manifesting a pandemic 5  and outside china outbreaks in iran and italy further illustrated the potential for disease and associated mortality 6 7  though the uk diagnosed its index case at the end of january the events that unfolded in lombardy three weeks later vividly demonstrated the susceptibility of a fully functioning modern health service to this unprecedented challenge 9 10  against this backdrop in anticipation of an impending sudden and unsustainable burden on the health service and wider civic society the uk government stepped up its response 11  culminating in the coronavirus act 2020 12  and other legislative measures including those mandating social distancing commonly referred to as the lockdown these various legislative measures grant wide powers to the executive and enact deep changes in the ordinary functioning of systems across society from health and social care to law and order and the food supply chain in doing this they introduce interferences with a wide range of human rights the act alone comes to 359 pages however two critical points must be made first these measures do not purport to regulate every aspect of the crisis rather they make targeted amendments to and supplement existing law second they do not replace or remove certain fundamental standards relevant to intensive care such as the human rights act hra 1998 or the mental capacity act mca 2005 frontline clinicians should thus not assume that they are acting in a legal vacuum where the new measures do not include specific provision for particular situations rather the pre-existing law rights standards and guidance continue to apply this existing framework will frequently adjust to take account of the present exceptional circumstances but it is not simply extinguished -a point that was reiterated during the parliamentary debates during the expedited passage of the coronavirus act 13 14  this article aims to outline the broad framework within which we can consider the medico-legal and ethical aspects of some of the more readily identified issues experienced during the surge in demand for critical care in particular it analyses legal aspects of patient care standard of care informed consent restraint and isolation family rights personal protective equipment and the legal and ethical aspects of rationing critical care abstract legal analysis is an imprecise art given how much turns on the specific circumstances and so specific or final answers cannot be given this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved negligence and the standard of care covid-19 has imposed on clinicians a need to move in certain cases from delivering the best care they can to a lower standard of acceptable safe care the question thus arises as to the legal position encountered by medical professionals who knowingly though reluctantly find themselves providing a lower standard of care than that which they would have only recently delivered the english law of negligence typically defines the standard of care by reference to a reasonable person where a special skill is involved the standard is that of the ordinary skilled person exercising and professing to have that special skill 15  this is assessed by reference to all of the circumstances in light of the facts known at the time it follows that there is no absolute requirement to deliver the best possible care the bolam test holds that a doctor will not have been negligent where they have acted in accordance with a practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical opinion even where another body of opinion takes a contrary view the test accepts and accounts for disagreements as well as variations in the exercise of clinical judgement subsequent case-law has nuanced this noting that any responsible body of opinion must be capable of withstanding logical analysis by the judge 16  that professional guidance is important evidence in considering the standard 17 18 and that the standard is set by reference to the doctors post not the particular experience or rank of the individual doctor 19 20  the law thus allows doctors discretion in the manner in which they provide care to patients as well as allowing consideration of the breadth of factors which may influence their decision making over the decades there has arguably been a ratcheting up of the standard required as medical advances and dissemination of knowledge have occurred in the pandemic situation by contrast it would allow for the i degree of uncertainty and ii the particularly pressured circumstances under which doctors are operating to be taken into account as one leading textbook suggests one can hardly expect the same meticulous attention in a hospital that is coping with a rail disaster or an epidemic as at normal times 19 21  in short the test would seem to protect doctors who provide a reasonable standard of care consistent with a logical body of medical opinion and taking into account the new circumstances specific to covid-19 notwithstanding the fact that this may be of a lower standard than that previously provided this is consistent with the approach that the general medical council gmc have outlined in respect of regulatory law 22  however clinicians should keep three points in mind first this leeway is not unlimited in particular clinicians who have been re-deployed to areas outside of their area of expertise will not this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved be granted more leeway they will be held to the same standard of care as others in the same post second clinicians operating under such constraints need to evidence not only the treatment undertaken but also the rationale underpinning their decision making a doctor asserting that they satisfied the requirements of the bolam test may need to evidence the constraints placed upon their ability to deliver care by the circumstances at the time this may require a more extensive explanation of how decisions have been arrived at and a more thorough recording of the circumstances in which such decisions are made than was required before covid-19 third clinicians will need to ensure that their practice is acceptable to a reasonable body of medical opinion ensuring awareness of clinical guidance is likely to be important and doctors retain their general duty to keep up-to-date with developments in medical knowledge 23  nevertheless doctors are not required to read each and every publication and practitioners may be excused ignorance of newly reported advances in practice 24  similarly a clinician will not be negligent solely through a failure to practise in accordance with what is now accepted wisdom abroad 25  these points may be of some reassurance to doctors who find themselves dealing with a rapidly-evolving pandemic with great volumes of new research being published much of it contradictory and of questionable quality less flexibility can be expected of the law around informed consent in the critical care setting this is likely to be particularly important because a feature of covid-19 is that most patients arguably retain capacity until the point where they need sedation contrast in ordinary times the evidence given in ferreira 26  such patients must give informed consent to their treatment clinicians must inform them of the treatments material risks those that a reasonable patient would regard as significant or that the doctor should be reasonably aware that the particular patient would regard as significant and of reasonable alternative treatments 27 28  this standard is stricter than the ordinary bolambolitho one exceptions to this duty apply only where the doctor reasonably considers that disclosing a particular risk would be seriously detrimental to the patients health or in situations of necessity such as urgent treatment where the patient is unconscious or otherwise unable to make a decision 29 30  moreover advance care planning should be discussed where feasible 27 31 32  finally though unlikely in the context of critical care before carrying out further interventions it will be necessary to consider whether the patient can reasonably be awoken to consent 33  this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved a significant challenge for clinicians is the uncertainty around this new pathogen with limited evidence on which to base decisions that makes it difficult to judge which risks are material and how treatment might evolve doctors are likely to best discharge their duty to patients by being honest about what is and is not known within the limits of the available evidence it will be for the patient and doctor to then decide upon whether to pursue particular treatment or opt for a different approach accepting the limitations of the evidence one particular point that arises is the likely need to inform sars-cov-2 negative patients of the risk of acquiring it through pursuing treatment for example surgery 34  doctors should ensure there is adequate written evidence as to the consent process patients receiving critical care are typically unable to leave they also frequently lack capacity that inability can arise directly from their life-threatening condition but it can also arise from treatment sedation andor restraints applied to them managing these issues and ensuring protection of the patients health life liberty and autonomy give rise to a host of complex legal issues at the intersection of criminal civil regulatory and human rights law a large body of guidance addresses these issues 35 36  we will focus on three important aspects of human rights law first the sedation and restraint of a patient must remain tightly linked to the life-saving treatment be kept to the minimum necessary and not materially differ between those with and without an underlying mental disorder in order not to amount to a deprivation of liberty article 5 european convention on human rights echr 37 38  this is the principle established in ferreira 39  restraints that are stricter than necessary or that continue beyond the life-threatening condition are likely to amount to a deprivation of liberty requiring authorisation by law through the deprivation of liberty safeguards dols process or court order prior consent to the restraints is highly unlikely to provide a sufficient legal basis 40  conversely insufficient or inappropriate restraint may lead to harm to or even death of the patient or others potentially breaching articles 2 right to life or 3 freedom from torture and inhuman and degrading treatment second difficult issues as to the patients autonomy and consent arise under article 8 right to private and family life as addressed in the previous section third particular risks of discrimination notably on grounds of race and disability arise in the application of restraint article 14 echr against that background two particular risks ensue in the covid-19 context  this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved extreme possible quadruple capacity situation 41  that contrasts with ordinary guidance requiring one critical care nurse per bed 42  in that context the ordinary practice of monitoring sedation levels to ensure the patient does not awake may not suffice in order to avoid this happening and so protect the patient from foreseeable harm articles 2 and 3 echr care teams may increase sedation levels for all patients use physical restraint with bed buddies restraining any patient who wakes whilst the lead nurse attends or use mechanical restraint mittens moreover the lower nurse-and doctor-to-patient ratios risk patients remaining sedated and restrained longer than strictly medically necessary in the first instance the relevant law is sensitive to context it is likely to tolerate stricter or longer restraint than that which would be applied when resources were optimal so long as such restraints remain the minimum required in that context they are unlikely to cross the line into a deprivation of liberty this leeway will not however be unlimited and inadequate inappropriate or clearly excessive restraint will raise article 2 3 or 5 issues as appropriate careful thought must be given to modifying restraints policies to ensure a fair balance based on evidence meeting the above standards and including regular review notably evidence from the us and continental europe suggest that physical and mechanical restraint are ineffective at preventing forcible extubation and increase the risk of inadequate supervision 43  prior to deploying such restraints clinicians should carefully consider a number of issues fig 1  second critical care patients are subject to the same isolation and quarantine rules as others in hospital under the infection prevention and control guidance 44 45  this guidance which envisages possible and confirmed cases of covid-19 being grouped together where singleisolation rooms are unavailable raises a number of human rights issues notably the risk that someone is infected as the result of this grouping and the lawfulness of any deprivation of liberty to enforce the quarantineisolation 46  both of which are beyond the scope of this article one critical point is however relevant clinicians must be crystal clear as to what restrictions apply to a patients movement and what their legal basis is as outlined above the sedation and restraints that are incidental to life-saving treatment fall outside article 5 once that treatment ends any restrictions on a patients movement must be justified on other grounds that would apply for instance to continuing to isolate a patient post-ventilation under the infection prevention and control guidance 47  any control or restraint of the patient may amount to a deprivation of liberty and thus require a legal basis notably schedule 21 to the coronavirus act 2020 this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved most hospitals have severely restricted family visiting rights to inpatients including those in icu 48  public health englands infection control guidance recommends permitting access to essential visitors only such as parents of paediatric patients but goes on to recommend local risk management with the need for proportionality 44 49  the way hospitals implement this raises a number of issues these hospitals restrictions interfere with the family rights of both the patient and the relatives article 81 echr 30 50  moreover visitors play a role in ensuring public scrutiny of standards of care may act as an advocate and defender of an incapacitated patient and their face-to-face presence is likely to facilitate more rigorous consultation where best interest decisions fall to be made than consultation by telephone or electronic mail their presence is likely to be particularly crucial in the case of children and vulnerable adults above all when the visitor has the power to make decisions on their behalf for example someone with parental responsibility or a lasting power of attorney to be justified this interference must pursue a legitimate aim be prescribed by law and be finally still in respect of proportionality blanket bans are typically difficult to defend that is particularly so here where as outlined above the degree of interference is much higher in some cases and the interests of vulnerable groups are in play which in turn raises possible discrimination issues 52  policies granting exceptions for children persons with a learning disability birth partners and persons receiving end-of-life care are significantly more likely to be justified than ones containing no such exceptions 53  hospitals should consider alternative measures to mitigate the restrictions regular contact to update family members on the patients situation unless inconsistent with patient confidentiality is required where reasonably this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved practicable and is in any event important to facilitating any best interest decisions and some version of an advocate and defender role video-calls with the patient raise interesting issues this is best analysed through a general data protection regulation lens 54  it would constitute processing of sensitive personal data relating to health and so require legal bases under both articles 6 and 9 of the regulation regulatory guidance should also be complied with 55 fig 2  hospital trusts as employers are under a range of duties to ensure the health and safety of staff this includes providing safe places and systems of work here we focus on the duty to provide adequate personal protective equipment under regulation 41 of the personal protective equipment at work regulations 1992 58  employers must ensure that suitable ppe is provided to employees who may be exposed to a risk to health or safety at work except where and to the extent that such risk has been adequately controlled by other means which are equally or more second what this guidance does not provide is reassurance that if a bone fide decision was made not to carry out duties due to the inadequate provision of protective equipment the clinician would be protected from regulatory and legal repercussions the employment rights act 1996 62 offers some protection against dismissal on the sole or principal grounds of refusal to work in an area of work reasonably believed to be a serious and imminent risk to health how this would this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved be viewed by professional regulators however is unclear this difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that should clinicians continue working with inadequate protective equipment this could consequently present a risk to patients 63  ultimately such a situation manifests a legal risk for trusts both for breach of the 1992 and other health and safety regulations and potentially in negligence or article 2 echr claims by staff or patients however certain negligence claims may be indemnified by the government under section 11 of the coronavirus act the possibility of having to ration acute life-saving care has perhaps been clinicians greatest concern the legal principles of rationing particularly acute life-saving care are not straightforward drawing upon a complex interaction of several legal regimens this section will highlight four important areas whilst there is no universally accepted definition to rationing scheunemann and white state that a unifying feature of most definitions is that of denying a potentially beneficial treatment to a patient on the grounds of scarcity 64 65  using this definition triaging or prioritising access to potentially life-saving treatment in the face of finite resources is rationing first rationing is an everyday part of healthcare provision including in critical care 66  the nationally agreed transplant benefit score 67 is one example of a rationing tool it aims to be transparent and use patient and clinical indices to maximise benefit an urgent request for a lifesaving donor liver may not fit the system exactly but still has its basis in clinical justification which acts symbiotically with resource considerations 68 69  in critical care judgements as to whether a treatment is either clinically indicated in the best interests of the patient or futile take into account the quality of care that can reasonably be provided given the available resources the courts have repeatedly upheld the lawfulness of resource considerations 70 71  in this sense a degree of rationing has already occurred in this pandemic reduced staff-to-patient ratios use of sub-optimal equipment postponement of nonurgent care re-deployment of non-critical care staff 41 and apportionment of organ support all ration care in the context of bestowing critical care during the covid-19 crisis however these measures remain within a margin of acceptability the focus remaining on the clinical benefit or best interests of the individual patient within the new context 70 71 72  the more difficult issue will come if and when resources are so scarce that critical care has to be refused to some patients this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved against their best interests when the line is crossed from triage by outcome to triage by resource paragraph 21 73  this is a difficult and at times fuzzy line but it should be drawn clearly dressing up a decision that is primarily based on resource limitations as a clinical or best interests decision risks illegitimacy in medicine and vulnerability to legal challenge 74  judicial reviews of clinical commissioning groups rationing decisions on public law grounds have rarely succeeded see fig 3  policy decisions sympathetic to the resources made available under current government policy are a legitimate consideration 79  though the courts deference is not unlimited policies must not be overly rigid in order to permit consideration of individual circumstances 80  the need for robust evidence to support any criteria is heightened beyond the ordinary public law standards in certain cases by the human rights and equality implications of denial basing decisions solely on age or disability including many underlying conditions would amount to unlawful direct discrimination 81  including criteria that have a disproportionate impact on older persons or persons with a disability for instance using age comorbidities or quality adjusted life years as indicators amounts to prima facie indirect discrimination this may be justified if the use is shown to be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim in this case appropriately allocating scarce nhs resources but adequate evidence of the appropriateness of these indicators will be necessary as argued by liddell et al this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved unpublished observation small differences between patients may not be meaningful and allocation decisions based on very limited evidence and poor science could be challenged finally in very exceptional circumstances a denial of critical care to particular individuals leading to death may violate the states article 2 echr positive duties 82  fourth perhaps the greatest difficulties arise from the prospect of withdrawing ventilatory support from a patient who is still deriving benefit from that treatment in favour of another who may have greater survival prospects this situation raises extremely difficult issues with three specialist lawyers recently arguing that removal of ventilation from a capacitous patient who does not consent and withdrawal of ventilation from such a patient after he has lost capacity to communicate his decision may be murder or manslaughter 76  we make two observations first in certain cases withdrawal will fit within the existing law where a patient with capacity consents to withdrawal where treatment is futile as in the case of a patient in permanent vegetative state 83  or where the treatment is no longer clinically indicated or in the best interests of the patient 83  withdrawal will be lawful under ordinary principles by contrast withdrawing ventilation from a patient whose best interests require continued treatment in order to allow a different patient with better prognosis to use the ventilator does not fall within that ordinary framework second there is no clear authority on the position outside that framework there is some limited support for the courts being flexible in an exceptional circumstance like this as the specialist lawyers note in re a conjoined twins the court approved the separation of conjoined twins in circumstances which would lead to the death of the weaker twin 84  failure to pursue an elective separation was deemed likely to result in the death of both as they continued to grow the court acknowledged that where the need to act in the best interests of each child produced a conflict it was appropriate to undertake a balancing exercise given the absolute non-viability of the weaker twin the exercise was in many ways simpler in respect of the conjoined twins than it would be for patients competing for ventilators the principles of the case however may still be applicable where one individual has much more to gain from a course of treatment than another where performance or non-performance has consequences for both patients and where the duty towards one patient is irreconcilable with the duty to another this interpretation would almost certainly require prior sanction by the courts second the ordinary case-law requiring that life-prolonging treatment be given is underpinned by the duty to take reasonable steps to protect life rather than an absolute duty and contains some suggestion that a different approach may apply where resources are inadequate 85 -although other case-law appears to contradicts this 86  this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved our analysis illustrates the careful diligence clinicians must employ when making decisions relating to resource allocation vis--vis clinical judgement a national emergency may recalibrate what is reasonable or even possible clinicians must consider resources optimally and efficiently and avoid recognising resource considerations inappropriately in delivering life-saving treatment how thinly these resources are spread is a matter for policy makers hospital trusts and the wider nhs ethics and law do not neatly coincide yet as the preceding section on legal aspects of rationing affirms the difficult issue concerns a context in which scarce resources mean that critical care could be refused to some patients against their best interests as previously narrated what is needed is clear guidance from an authoritative public policy and robust evidence supporting its criteria it also needs ethical justification unfortunately rather than a single authoritative policy originating from an appropriate body a  this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved circumstance to be equitable or how exactly should one seek to do the least harm and most good this problem is compounded by the pressure of exigency third since guidelines disagree as to which criteria should be adopted or in what order of importance the requirement of authoritative ethical justification may not be met the problem is that there can be reasonable disagreement as to which criterion should be decisive it may be easy to set some aside first come first served and the tossing of a coin or use of a lottery first come first served whilst practical is not a defensible moral principle in as much as the hour of first presentation should not trump considerations such as clinical need however disagreement extends even to principles of prima face plausibility the use of age as a criterion for prioritisation does as previously suggested invite the charge of direct discrimination even the use of age as a marker of what are seen as relevant differences such as clinical frailty and the likelihood of survival or of the prospect of fewer years of life after treatment would be prima facie indirect discrimination yet it is also hard to justify morally age as such is a morally irrelevant difference as a signifier or something that is relevant it is crude unreliable and always defeasible yet the use of age as such has intuitive attractiveness to many one important reason is the fair innings argument 89  this holds that everyone should have an opportunity to lead a life of a certain duration resources should then be distributed and care given selectively to ensure that those who have yet to live that length of life are prioritised over those who have already managed to do so it has an intuitive appeal why shouldnt those who have not had an opportunity to lead a life of decent duration be preferred to those who have already done so nevertheless what exactly counts as a fair innings and even if we can agree it is not clear why we should speak of fairness in this context 90  luck and circumstances play a major role in this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved how long we live and it is not clear that we can speak of the length of a life as a good that can and should be distributed the need for care irrespective of age might arise from bad luck but it might also arise from choices for whose consequences an individual should rightly be held responsible a last moral consideration is this the application of any rationing guidance will cause moral injury in those compelled by circumstances to utilise what they believe bears serious moral costs furthermore rationing human resource clinical expertise and the efforts of the multi-disciplinary team adds to this burden recognition of these harms and support for those who suffer them is paramount support for clinicians in their decision-making by ethics committees is desirable though it should be recognised that the provision of such services is variable it is perhaps with a twisted sense of irony that the echr this year celebrates 70 years since its inception the covid-19 global pandemic will challenge rights and legal considerations in numerous and as yet unrecognised ways these implications will not be unique to healthcare but will be felt throughout society despite these challenges such considerations are inherently malleable to context clinicians employing a commitment to the usual medico-legal and ethical principles even whilst the ability to meet these commitments is being tested more so than ever will make a disproportionately positive contribution in safeguarding such principles in this sense it is not a twisted irony at all now more than ever we must look to the core values encoded in our rights and legal regimes in facing the new challenges raised by the pandemic it remains to be seen exactly what final cost not merely fiscal but also human will be levied by this pandemic especially upon those most vulnerable in society undoubtedly medical professionals especially in critical care will play a disproportionate role in setting this potentially intangible price

rationing of personal protective equipment huang-tz ou yea-huei kao yang  b pharm s   a s one of the earliest countries to activate public health measures taiwan has felt a more moderate effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic than many other countries it has had relatively few infections as of 8 april 2020 there were 379 confirmed cases with 5 deaths in taiwan compared with 1 371 189 cases with 80 522 deaths globally imported covid-19 cases have constituted most infections in taiwan 326 imported vs 53 locally acquired suggesting that community outbreaks have been less frequent other proactive measures undertaken by the taiwanese government have included strengthening quarantine measures at ports of entry retrospectively identifying potential covid-19 cases and identifying new infection patterns or symptoms and clustered cases to promptly track potential infection sources or paths the government has also aggressively enforced rules about mask wearing self-quarantine and social distancing 1  during the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003 public demand surged in taiwan for personal protective equipment such as surgical masks these are seen as must-have equipment and demand for masks reflects peoples fear during a public health crisis in response to a shortage of surgical masks due to the covid-19 outbreak in late january 2020 the taiwanese government imposed a ban on the export of surgical masks and requisitioned all domestically produced masks in early february 2020 the government implemented a rationing system for distributing surgical masks to prevent panic buying 2 this system uses multilayer logistics to ensure quick and efficient implementation it integrates the manufacturing sector national health insurance nhi system information and communication technology and logistics of delivery and distribution to ensure that all citizens receive masks while prioritizing the allocation of sufficient masks to health care personnel surgical mask production was quickly scaled up in early april 2020 to 13 million masks a day for taiwans population of 238 million to allow for an increase in the individual allowance to 10 masks every 2 weeks community pharmacies which are strategically located and have nhi-integrated information systems were given the responsibility of distributing and rationing masks directly to the public a real-time open tracking system for mask availability was immediately implemented at each pharmacy using website and mobile applications to guide citizens in need of masks the system included online chatbots and voice assistants that provided information about the supply of masks and the locations of the 6515 nhi-contracted pharmacies across the nation community pharmacists repacked the bulk packages of masks into unit packets containing the rationed amount and completed the nhi online procedures for residents in their communities often serving as the first point of contact between individuals and the health care system community pharmacists offered education and consultation on proper hygiene strategies disseminated accurate information to counter myths and misinformation and provided emotional support to alleviate public concerns arising from the covid-19 crisis at this time dispensing services provided in community pharmacies have been particularly crucial in minimizing the potential for a large influx of patients seeking prescriptions from hospital pharmacies at the same time physicians and nurses in communitybased primary care clinics have played a critical role in the early identification of potential covid-19 cases by examining patients with clinical symptoms obtaining their history of travel or transit in affected countries or areas which can be accessed from the patients nhi identification cards and referring suspected case patients to government-designated hospitals in a timely fashion stringent policies have been implemented to control access to taiwanese hospitals unessential visits have been suspended and persons with any signs or symptoms of covid-19 are directed to an outdoor quarantine station for evaluation or the emergency department for isolation in negatively pressurized rooms 3  other measures have included the strict diversion and transport of patients with covid-19 to different levels of hospitals on the basis of the severity of their symptoms and the segregation of hospital wards to ensure appropriate patient care 4  during this pandemic several challenges to community pharmacists have emerged small independent pharmacies with limited manpower had difficulty using the rationing system for mask purchases taiwans pharmacy organizations in collaboration with pharmacy schools have provided timely support to independent pharmacies by arranging for student volunteers to help repack masks for purchases and prepare and deliver educational materials small pharmacies have had difficulty managing the large influx of

pharmacies during this period including minimizing promotional activities and encouraging electronic payments has been recommended 6  large crowds seeking prevention and control strategies or products in pharmacies may create risk for virus transmission 6  in taiwan an online service platform for purchasing surgical masks from governmental websites has been developed to relieve overcrowding in pharmacies and reduce virus transmission on the other hand some taiwanese hospitals have encouraged patients to return for prescription refills at their outpatient pharmacies potentially increasing risk for exposure to the infection the government and pharmacy associations have responded by urging the public to maximize their use of services provided by community pharmacists during this crisis finally drug shortages are a potential problem due to the recent supply chain disruptions caused by the lockdown of manufacturers in areas affected by covid-19 identifying alternative drugs and minimizing requests for no substitution are potential solutions to mitigate this problem 6  in this unprecedented global public health emergency a reliable network of health care professionals in communities near where people live is vital for providing services and products for self-care and reducing anxiety and panic this covid-19 crisis is the moment for community health care workers to

zhao guo-wei huang he-sheng wang   antibiotics are one of the major agents widely used in clinical practice for the prevention and treatment of infections however irrational antibiotic using has also become a common issue worldwide 13 which has resulted in a rise and exacerbation of antibiotic resistance and leading to a decline in clinical efficacy and an increase in adverse reactions irrational antibiotic use has presented an enormous challenge to infection control in hospitals the world health organization who considers bacterial resistance to be one of the healthcare issues that is severely threatening to human life similarly china is also facing a large threat from antibiotic use 46 to enhance the management of antimicrobial agents the ministry of health moh of the peoples republic of china released the nationwide special campaign for antibiotic stewardship program asp 2011 and conducted a specific rectification of irrational antibiotic use in china 610 in this study we investigated and analyzed the changes in relevant indicators in antibiotic use in 41 medical organizations 19 tertiary hospitals and 22 secondary hospitals between 2011 and 2013 in an attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of specific activities in the control of antibiotic use in secondary and tertiary hospitals in tianjin china the special antibiotic use rectification program was initiated in november 2011 in china in the present study antibiotic use data were collected through inpatient medical records 1 year defined as 1 cycle in april of each year starting from 2011 for 3 consecutive years ie april of 2011 april of 2012 and april of 2013 based on a quasi-experimental study the quality management system qms and plan-do-check-act pdca management concept 1113 antibiotic use indicators were assessed and analyzed to compare any changes among the 3 cycles this clinical investigation was conducted in 2011 at 41 public hospitals including 19 tertiary general hospitals and 22 secondary general hospitals in tianjin which is one of 4 directly controlled municipalities of china the use of antibiotics in the 41 hospitals was summarized for analysis the valid hospital records with hospitalization duration between 3 and 30 days were collected from each hospital the data on antibiotic consumption were normalized to defined daily doses ddd100 days for inpatients and a total of 14 760 cases were included in this study according to the requirements of the nationwide special campaign for antibiotic stewardship program asp in 2011 the percentage of antibiotic use in inpatient cases at general hospitals should not exceed 60 and antimicrobial use density aud in general hospitals must be controlled at 40 defined daily doses ddds per 100 patient days moreover the percentage of antibiotic prescriptions given to emergency patients cannot exceed 4000 and the proportion of prophylactic antibiotic use in patients undergoing type i incision surgeries cannot exceed 3000 finally preoperative inpatient prophylactic antibiotic use should be performed 052 h before surgery except for cesarean sections antibiotic selection and treatment course must be rational and the duration of prophylactic antibiotic use for those undergoing type i incision operations must be controlled within 24 h the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of tianjin medical university and informed consent was obtained from each participant a multidisciplinary team of clinical professionals specializing in infectious disease critical care medicine microbiology disinfection and isolation and pharmacology participated in professional conferences seminars and training courses in a variety of areas through discussion and in-depth study professionals could effectively master the cutting-edge information of industry change and workplace experience thus being able to play a vital role in correctly diagnosing infectious patients in hospitals properly treating infectious patients and enhancing the prevention and control of infection hazards in a hospital setting clinical training was provided by a multidisciplinary team of experts in the areas of infection control refractory disease strategies perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis laboratory-to-clinic microbiology communication conditions for initial hospital visiting of acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids patients and protection of medical staff basic principles of antibiotic use and guidelines for clinical antibiotic use against infectious diseases in addition to improve diagnosis and treatment of infections training courses were provided in the following areas acquisition of common infectious diseases during long-term hospitalization monitoring of the accumulation of infectious diseases with known or unknown sources and construction of infection prevention software and hardware moreover clinical training also included courses on the advantages of hand washing and the efficacy of using alcohol hand rub other courses of interest covered the establishment of temporary quarantine zones for newly admitted patients recent advances in environmental disinfection infections resulting from unsanitary hospital environments prevalence and trends of novel middle east coronavirus infections and a general increase of nosocomial infections related to surgery-induced patient hypothermia antibiotic prescriptions were analyzed and assessed by infection experts and hospital quality control centers on-site feedback was provided to each hospital regarding several issues of antibiotic use including overuse the presence of name redundancies for generic formulas drug selection and distribution challenges specific drug biases lack of first-generation cephalosporin for surgical prophylaxis in hierarchical catalogues and whether surgical prophylactic antibiotics eg aztreonam cefoxitin and ceftriaxone should be included in catalogues a number of measures were introduced in tianjin since the initiation of the asp campaign in 2011 to implement hierarchy management of clinical antibiotic use promote scientific and rational antibiotic use reduce antibiotic resistance and ensure safety of medical service this was done to accomplish antibiotic prophylaxis and rational diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases in addition nosocomial infections and infectious outbreaks in general hospitals were monitored via antibiotic use and resistance surveillance networks prescriptions and medical orders were identified by computer-assisted electronic prescription systems through integration of clinical patient data basic medication information and the pathogen spectrum of infection electronic prescription systems can increase the rate of standardized prescriptions as such use of information technology is a developing trend in standardized management and a long-term strategy for achieving rational antibiotic use in a clinical setting antibiotic consumption data was provided by hospitals of tianjin tianjin center for nosocomial infection control review and checked with the relevant hospital infection data statistical analysis was performed using spss software version 170 the ratios of antibiotic use in hospitalized patients are mainly presented as percentages repeated measure analysis of variance was conducted for comparison among groups a p-value 005 was considered statistically significant the percentage of antibiotic use in inpatient cases from all hospitals was controlled within 6000 as required and was reduced gradually from 6038 to 4688 from april 2011 to april 2013 aud was improved annually and decreased from 5160 to 3537 ddds meeting the requirement of aud 40 ddds the proportion of prophylactic antibiotic applications for type i incision procedures was reduced from 8667 to 2508 not exceeding 3000 as specified by governmental guidelines on antibiotic use the percentage of antibiotic prophylaxis 052 h before surgery except for cesarean section was increased from 8638 to 100 the compliance rate of antibiotic prophylaxis for 24 h in patients undergoing type i surgical incision operations significantly increased from 4030 to 9637 p005 table 1 the percentage of antibiotic use by inpatients and aud in tertiary hospitals was reduced from 6025 to 4844 and from 5607 ddds to 3450 ddds respectively the proportion of prophylactic antibiotic applications for type i incision operations decreased from 8667 to 2508 the percentage of antibiotic prophylaxis 052 h before surgery except for cesarean section increased from 8570 to 100 the compliance rate of antibiotic prophylactic use for 24 h in patients with type i incision surgeries in all general hospitals significantly increased from 5000 to 97 p005 table 2 the percentages of antibiotic use by inpatients and aud were reduced from 6127 to 4484 and from 4918 ddds to 3590 ddds respectively the proportion of prophylactic antibiotic application for type i incision operations decreased from 100 to 2886 the percentage of antibiotic prophylaxis 052 h before surgery except for cesarean section increased from 9884 to 100 the compliance rate of antibiotic prophylactic use for 24 h in patients with type i incision surgeries improved from 5000 to 97 all these changes were statistically significant p005 except for the change in the timing of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients receiving type i incision operations table 3 antibiotic resistance is not a newly emerging issue yet it has become increasingly threatening although antibiotic resistance is a phenomenon that occurs during the natural developmental process irrational antibiotic use can accelerate the emergence of antibiotic resistance education and clinical management in antibiotics use have become strong measures to control bacterial resistance globally through controlling and monitoring the prescription and pre-authorization of antibiotics use 1416 causal analysis of irrational antibiotic use was performed by the chinese government and significant improvement has been made through specific rectification of antibiotic use as a result all indicators for antibiotic use showed a decreasing trend with the compliance rate of rational antibiotic use increasing annually inappropriate antibiotic selection by doctors and misunderstanding of drug indications has influenced the misuse of antibiotics to treat viral infections rather than bacterial infections a national prevalence survey about hospital infection and antibiotics using in britain pointed out the general antibiotic use rate was 347 the intensive care unit has the highest antibiotic use rate of 608 and the use of antibiotics in surgery was about 36 17 studies have shown that more than 50 of the antibiotic was used unreasonably 18 the unseasonable using results in the rise of antibiotic resistance prolonged hospitalization and increased medical expenses mexico and brazil use promulgation of policy to restrict antibiotic sales the restriction on antibiotics use has an influence on the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesics drugs 19 in addition an intervention study 20 showed the education and training of pharmacists can promote the rational use of vancomycin in intensive care units icus unreasonable antibiotic use can be controlled through education and training of clinicians clinical pharmacists and nurses medical staff knowledge of antibiotics needs to be further improved 2123 moreover antibiotics were prescribed based on experiences rather than pathogenic laboratory examination indicated by the low rate of such analyses 24 some antibiotics were prescribed as desired by patients and their families to avoid doctor-patient disputes 2526 furthermore misunderstandings occurred with respect to public knowledge of antibiotic use including the misinterpretation of antibiotics as the equivalent of anti-inflammatory agents some misunderstood the concept of antibiotics exaggerating their efficacy and abusing them via direct purchase over-the-counter at drug stores the 2010 survey on household medications in china showed that 794 of residents had a habit of stocking antibiotics and 754 of residents medicated themselves or family members for the treatment of inflammation cold or fever 27 antibiotic use in each department was improved through a specialized comprehensive management program training on rational antibiotic use was enhanced to strictly control drug indication and administration and to determine the frequency of antibiotic use based on pharmacokinetic features following the principle of minimum effective dose and shortest treatment course antibiotic use was guided by the results of bacterial culture and drug susceptibility testing scientific efficient pragmatic and advanced management of antibiotic use was accomplished through implementation of a long-term scientific and comprehensive management system based on information technology this system monitored nosocomial infections and outbreaks in general hospitals via clinical antibiotic use and resistance surveillance networks combined with a computer-assisted electronic prescription system this strategy achieved highly efficient scientific and pragmatic management of antibiotic use reducing the length of hospital stays decreasing the misuse of healthcare resources and delaying antibiotic resistance 2831 the results of antibiotic resistance monitoring before and after asp revealed that the resistance of pseudomonas aeruginosa to carbapenem and to meropenem continuously declined in both tertiary and secondary hospitals from 20102012 the latter decreasing from 2301 to 1575 drug resistance of acinetobacter baumannii decreased as evidenced by the reduction of meropenem resistance from 2616 to 1404 since the implementation of the asp campaign antibiotic resistance of acinetobacter baumannii has declined as represented by a significant 2530 reduction in -lactam resistance and resistance reductions for fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside of 50 to 2030 consistent with the results reported by another domestic study 32 the overall resistance of pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased for meropenem 389 to 112 ciprofloxacin 265 to 124 and imipenem 415 to 22 over the period of study 33 since the initiation of the asp campaign in april 2011 in tianjin rational antibiotic use has been improved by establishing prescription assessment systems antibiotic costs were reduced by 122 million rmb in 2013 and cumulatively by 786 million rmb over the course of the 3-year study the current goal of rational antibiotic use was largely achieved in urban areas significant improvements were made in all regions through collaborative efforts and controls from health administrative departments professional societies disease control centers medical institutions and insurance sectors 3436 there are some limitations in this study it was targeted at overall antibiotic use in general hospitals without detailed exploration of antibiotic use in specialized fields such as internal medicine surgery obstetrics and gynecology pediatrics and intensive care 3738 however based on the developing trend of the asp campaign relatively satisfactory outcomes have been accomplished in the management of antibiotic use in china antibiotic use management is a complicated issue and a long-term challenge significant improvements have been achieved in antibiotic use in tianjin through the asp campaign although continuous efforts are required to consolidate and enhance these improvements for normalizing rational antibiotic use in our future work  coronavirus disease 2019 utilizing an ethical framework for rationing absolutely scarce healthcare resources in transplant allocation decisions anji wall e timothy pruett peter stock giuliano testa   the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 has upended health care in the united states and around the world
1
 as the first wave of surges hits the coasts of the united states the rest of the country is likely to follow and most of us will be faced with challenging decisions at personal professional and institutional levels as transplant professionals we will encounter even more limitations in donor organs as well as personnel capacity and equipment limitations in our hospitals these limitations will differ among states cities and programs making it exceptionally challenging to come up with national guidance on how to approach transplantation during the covid19 pandemic while transplants have been categorized as tier 3b by the centers for medicare and medicaid cms recommendations for limiting nonessential surgical procedures meaning they are of the highest acuity and should not be postponed we all know that there is nuance to which transplant patients and procedures truly meet this standard
2
 we therefore must prepare ourselves to make difficult decisions about which patients to transplant when to limit transplant capacity and how to best care for those patients who have undergone transplantation
3
 transplant capacity is being constrained by limited resources beyond that of donor organs and absolutely constrained in areas where resources are not available eg if there are no icu beds transplants requiring postoperative icu beds cannot be done
4
 as resources become limited our decisions about who to transplant will need to be guided by both the practical reality of each centers capacity as well as underlying ethical values in this manuscript we discuss the ethical standards and values that we can use to guide the transition into making decisions regarding transplantation in each of our centers and programs as we are faced with the covid19 pandemic as transplant professionals we have significant experience with allocating scarce resources most of us make listing decisions regularly considering not only medical factors but also financial and psychosocial factors all needed to make a transplant successful
5
 the balance we have tried to strike is between justice or providing an equal opportunity for transplantation and utility or ensuring acceptable benefits from transplantation
6
 the way that we currently put allocation into practice is a twostep process to achieve utility if a patient is deemed to have an acceptable potential to benefit from transplantation he or she is listed to ensure justice when an organ becomes available for transplant a match run determines the order in which listed patients are prioritized for that organ what the covid19 pandemic is forcing transplant programs to do is determine which of the patients who have met the bar for utility or have been deemed acceptable for transplantation in general should continue to be considered for transplantation given the new concerns of increased limitations on our ability to transplant patients as well as the risks of covid19 infection
4

 as we move into the era of covid19 it is time to think beyond our traditional use of the two principles of justice and utility for organ allocation and begin to think in terms of the ethical values framework for rationing absolutely scarce healthcare resources described by dr emanuel and colleagues to make the transition from usual practice to increasingly resourceconstrained practice
7
 the four ethical values that guide rationing of absolutely scarce healthcare resources are to maximize benefit treat people equally promote and reward instrumental value and prioritize the sickest patients maximizing benefit can be conceptualized as saving the most lives and saving the most life years treating people equally is based on the principle of justice which sets rules for how to treat people with the same need for a scarce resource in the same way eg first come first served as done with kidney allocation or random selection so as not to advantage those with quicker and easier access to hospitals promoting and rewarding instrumental value means giving priority of treatment to those who have made contributions eg healthcare workers those involved in research or to those who are likely to make contributions in the future eg healthcare workers who can return to the workforce and treat patients finally prioritizing the worst off requires determining who is the worst off and what they should be prioritized for the following sections apply each ethical value to transplantation making the argument that we will have to transition our mindset from the simple utility vs justice calculous of organ allocation to the more nuanced ethical values approach of rationing absolutely scarce healthcare resources during the covid19 pandemic this paper is not a call to abandon the already established ethical principles of justice and utility in organ allocation but rather to add the consideration of the ethical values framework for decisions that deviate from standard transplant practice due to capacity constraints risks of covid19 transmission and transplant team safety maximizing benefits to our transplant patients is a delicate balance in the setting of covid19 just looking at a match run and determining if the donor and recipient pairing is a good combination will not be enough and continuing to apply the dominant mindset that the more patients we transplant the more lives we save and the more life years we gain will not be adequate we have to pivot and think about what patients will truly benefit from transplantation in each program during this pandemic
4
 
8
 there are several ways in which we can answer this question based on the local environment
4
 in severely resourceconstrained areas the answer is to transplant only the sickest patients who are already using medical resources and most likely to die in a short time frame without an organ transplant for example patients with fulminant hepatic failure who will die without a liver transplant or status 1a heart patients who are nondischargeable on biventricular assist devices both of whom are already occupying an icu bed in less affected areas maybe the answer is to transplant the moderately ill patients who still have significant shortterm mortality but are likely to have better outcomes shorter icu stays hospital stays and use less blood products and other scarce resources in minimally affected areas we may broaden this to patients who will benefit from transplant use fewer resources and are low risk for exposure to covid19 one example that comes to mind is a straightforward kidney transplant recipient who will have a 2hour operation 3day hospital stay will be able to go home and selfisolate and has a low risk of readmission in order to answer the question of who we can benefit from transplantation we must begin by determining the resources that are needed for a successful transplant and if those resources are available if we start with the donor we have a dead person who is utilizing an icu bed nursing staff and mechanical ventilation after the icu the donor utilizes operating room resources including personnel surgical masks and gowns here we must consider the competing needs of the donor hospital for these resources after donation the organ transplantation is also resource intensive recipients utilize operating rooms blood products and icu beds albeit to different extents depending on the organ transplanted again this requires personnel ventilators and personal protective equipment that may be needed in other areas of the recipient hospital maximizing benefit goes hand in hand with minimizing risk therefore we must also consider the parallel risk of covid19 transmission to the recipient either through donorderived infection nosocomial spread or community transmission pre or posttransplant
9
 
10
 kumar et al
4
 suggest that transmission of covid19 in lung transplantation is high risk as the virus is primarily isolated from the respiratory tract but that there is evidence of viremia in 15 of cases making donor to recipient transmission possible in any transplant in areas of high rates of community spread it is essential to screen all recipients for covid19 risk and may be ideal test some or all recipients prior to transplantation currently only south korea is testing all asymptomatic recipients with np swabs prior to transplantation
4
 moreover as part of patient screening we must determine if patients can enact a postdischarge quarantine or physical distancing plan including virtual clinic visits to minimize the risk of exposure to covid19 patients who are unable to physically distance from others after transplantation due to living arrangements may need assistance from the transplant program to secure alternative housing for to allow for this or be given supplies such as masks to assist in decreasing the risk of covid19 transmission if postdischarge housing arrangements are high risk and cannot be changed then transplant programs may need to consider not transplanting these highrisk patients acknowledging that this type of policy may affect lower income patients more harshly than higher income patients and should only be a consideration if there is truly no alternative strategy for risk minimization moreover as a transplant community we should strive to test all donors so as to minimize the risk of transmission from donors to recipients as has been done in italy canada switzerland spain and korea
4
 even with universal donor testing there will be false negatives so a negative test does not guarantee zero risk of donor to recipient transmission
11
 just as we discuss the risk of infectious disease transmission from increased risk donors with recipients we have an obligation to discuss the risk of covid19 transmission with recipients even if that discussion is focused more on the unknown rather than known risk table 1 provides a series of questions to address the resource limitations and risk minimization capacity to consider prior to transplantation when considering the limitations and risks we have to recognize that each solid organ transplant is different with respect to the risk of transmission of covid19 anticipated icu and hospital stay level of immunosuppression needed to prevent early rejection and intensity of postoperative monitoring a standard kidney transplant from a good donor for example will not require intensive care and be discharged within 3 days of the operation while a decompensated lung transplant patient will require both postoperative icu care and a longer duration of hospital stay a frail heart transplant candidate with a high likelihood of needing postdischarge inpatient rehabilitation afterward is at higher risk for covid19 infection than a robust candidate who can quarantine at home after discharge each donorrecipient scenario will have different considerations when it comes to resource limitations potential benefits and risks in our assessment of the ethical value of maximizing benefit we must acknowledge that there are many unknowns
9
 
10
 we currently do not have the supplies to test for covid19 on a large scale and therefore do not know the true prevalence in our communities we do not know the risk of transmission of covid19 to solid organ recipients from donors who have the disease as there are no known donor to recipient transmissions at this time
4
 moreover we do not know how transplant patients who acquire covid19 postoperatively or who undergo transplantation while infected will fare given their immunosuppressed state we are entering a time of uncertainty and have to acknowledge this uncertainty to ourselves and also to our patients as we try to make the best decisions to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks of transplantation the section above addresses the consideration of assessing the potential benefits and risks for each individual transplant scenario however as programs become more resource constrained they will have to make decisions about categorically excluding certain groups of patients from transplantation even if patients are currently active on the transplant waiting list
4
 the ethical value underpinning these decisions is that all people must be treated equally
7
 for example many programs have made the decision to discontinue living donor kidney and liver transplantation that means all living donor operations are discontinued regardless of patient desire to proceed some programs have had to limit liver transplantation to only high meld patients lung transplantation to unstable patients and heart transplantation to higher status patients some programs are refusing to consider donors who are not tested for covid19 each of these decisions is made at the level of the program and not at the level of the patient they do not consider whether the patient is willing to take a risk on a donor that is not tested or if a patient with a lower meld than the cutoff would still like to be considered for transplantation as programs are forced to make decisions that set more stringent criteria regarding who will be considered for transplantation it is essential that these decisions are made in a transparent and equitable manner one way to ensure this is for programs to communicate their decisions to patients who do not meet the new criteria and make these patients inactive so that they do not receive offers for transplantation the discussion thus far regarding maximizing value and treating patients equally has focused primarily focused on transplant recipients as we transition to a more global assessment of transplant practices within the context of a pandemic we have to think beyond the recipients promoting and rewarding instrumental value in the framework of rationing absolutely scarce healthcare resources is aimed at ensuring the protection of the healthcare workforce who both take on personal risk by treating covid19 patients and who have the potential to continue to provide societal benefit with their expertise after recovery
7
 the idea of instrumental value can also play into transplantation in at least two ways broadening the scope of consideration beyond the transplant recipient the first is the instrumental value of the deceased donor a deceased donor has the potential to save the lives of several patients who are suffering from end organ disease this is a huge societal contribution which should be generally be rewarded by prioritizing the utilization of critical care and operating room resources however the scale can be tipped against prioritizing deceased donors if the donor is suboptimal a dcd unlikely to pass within an acceptable time frame or the donor or recipient hospitals are too overwhelmed to have the capacity for organ donation or transplantation during a surge there will likely be a live person with a competing need for the resources being utilized by the donor can we as the transplant community recommend that a donor takes priority over a live individual in need of icu care and mechanical ventilation we might if that donor will save more lives or more life years with their organs thereby maximizing overall benefit but we must be selective about which donors will truly maximize benefits to transplant patients through donation and be expedient in our donor evaluation and timing so as to minimize the utilization of these scarce resources we must keep in mind that in a severely resourceconstrained scenario the donor has the potential to save many lives while there is a patient or multiple patients whose real lives are in jeopardy awaiting a ventilator a second consideration in the framework of instrumental value is that of the transplant team members most transplant physicians surgeons and advanced practice providers are ready to jump in and do what is necessary not only to take care of their transplant patients but also to care for any patients where they are needed many of us have the training to be versatile in our roles for example abdominal and thoracic transplant surgeons generally have critical care acute care surgery and trauma surgery training if we cannot do transplants due to a covid19 surge we can step in to assist our acute care and trauma surgery colleagues as they will have to continue to operate even in the face of the pandemic we can also offer to do donor operations at our own hospitals so as to minimize donor team travel
4
 
12
 an area in which we have to be thoughtful is who should take on the role of direct patient care of covid19 patients it is essential that those of us caring for immunosuppressed transplant patients are not also caring for covid19 patients thereby putting our immunosuppressed patients at risk
12
 in a surge situation we must all have a plan for how our groups can care for our transplant patients while supporting the needs of our institutions a final more global consideration that must occur as resources become further constrained is how to prioritize the worst off in general the concept of prioritizing the worst off is secondary to and supportive of the first concept of maximizing benefit
7
 it requires defining who is the worst off and how the worst off are prioritized this value is useful in determining who should be prioritized for vaccines experimental treatments icus and ventilators we must specifically consider transplant patients in these scenarios should for example transplant patients or waitlisted patients get priority for vaccination if one becomes available so as to protect those who are already immunosuppressed or those likely to become immunosuppressed should they receive priority for experimental treatments as they are potentially more vulnerable due to immunosuppression for icus and ventilators should a transplant patient who suffers a complication and is likely to have a prolonged resourceintensive recovery take priority over a young patient with covid19 and respiratory decompensation in addressing these types of questions we have to determine which patient is worse off and then balance the worse off patient with the value of maximizing benefits and favor the individual who will meet our first goal saving more lives or life years these global decisions about prioritization of the worst off within a hospital are not decisions that physicians in the united states are used to facing moreover the culture of transplantation is that of pushing the limits and getting patients through their postoperative course even when it will be a long resourceintensive process our desire to do everything for our transplant patients may conflict with the competing interest of other patients in the hospital and may end in triage decisions that go against our nature as transplant physicians ultimately we must be willing to consider what it means to be the worst off in a pandemic and make or allow our institutions to make prioritization decisions in light of the larger picture of all patients in need of scarce resources the transplant enterprise is wellversed in allocating scare healthcare resources because of the limited supply of donor organs and we are now facing new challenges with the covid19 pandemic while the examples we provide in this manuscript come from abdominal transplantation our area of expertise the general principles values and processes for determining who we should transplant applies across organ types we cannot afford to continue business as usual when we are faced with more limitations in donors personnel supplies and hospital capacity we must begin thinking of transplantation in the context of the covid19 pandemic and apply the framework of ethical values for rationing absolutely scare healthcare resources to this transition so that we can be thoughtful stewards of donor organs honest advocates for our patients and continue to add value to our institutions moreover this is unfortunately unlikely to be the last time that we face a pandemic or largescale disaster situation and this framework is not just applicable to covid19 but can guide us in future scenarios the authors of this manuscript have no conflicts of interest to disclose as described by the american journal of transplantation  challenges and responses a tertiary hospital in 2019-ncov epidemic hong li zhuo zhang ping li hu nie   our hospital the west china hospital of sichuan university wch su is located in the sichuan province of western china which borders adjacent to hubei province west china hospital a nationally recognized 4300-bed institution is a third-level comprehensive teaching hospital with annual outpatient visits of 544 million and emergency visits of approximately 280000 on january 7 2020 a novel coronavirus was officially announced as the pathogen of the unknown viral pneumonia in wuhan on january 21 2020 the first imported novel coronavirus pneumonia case was confirmed in sichuan province in contrast on january 16 the hospital already initiated the preparation for epidemic prevention and control including an emergency plan organization of expert groups for medical treatment epidemic monitoring screening and triage remote consultation personnel training personal protective equipment ppe reserves and other detailed arrangements such as isolation wards extension workflow and patient path design at the same time based on our previous experience a fever screening and triage station was set up at the emergency department ed all these rapid reactions benefit from the emergency response mechanism formed in disaster in the past dozen years such as the sars outbreak in 2003 the bird flu outbreak in 2009 and the three tremendous earthquakes in 2008 2012 and 2017 moreover in 2018 the china international emergency medical team sichuan mainly established by our hospital has been certified as an emergency medical team by the world health organization3 in other words the whole hospital was preparing for a potential emergency in an orderly and routine way at that period most people stayed in the peace and the happiness of the approaching lunar chinese new year however the epidemic situation changed dramatically and authorities implemented a cordon sanitaire in wuhan on january 23 20204 according to various media reports the local epidemic situation in wuhan was almost out of control and the medical resources related to the prevention and control of the epidemic were extremely scarce the public was in a state of panic the sentiment soon spread across the country in this situation our hospital also faced enormous challenges but within less than a week it made a series of quick and effective responses first emergency plans were immediately activated all cadres who are on leave as well as all the staff of key departments such as the infectious disease respiratory emergency ed critical care and experimental medicine departments were recalled back to chengdu to be on standby second at the same time temporary fever triage and waiting areas were immediately set up on vacant lots close to the ed in anticipation of the possible surge of fever cases and the potential insufficient space in the existing fever screening and triage stations third human resources were unified for allocation and management in terms of the unified requirements of the government a 21-member medical team was dispatched to wuhan meanwhile many specialist doctors were mobilized to receive the epidemic screening training and participate in the screening work in the fever clinic the reception capacity of the fever clinic has been improved to cope successfully with the soaring number of fever patients fourth medical supplies were rationally allocated despite having prepared in advance the country has faced a shortage of ppes supplies since the outbreak began the medical team sent to wuhan took away more than half of the hospitals protective materials which brought some difficulties to the hospitals epidemic prevention and control work to solve the problem of material shortage in a short period a strict ppes management plan was implemented a four-level risk classification and ppes practice guidance were established in strict accordance with the protection guideline and some research recommendations56 ppe resources rationing was induced in the epidemic prevention and control areas fever clinic triage area as well as the regular working areas without any exceptional condition a surgical mask was dispensed every 4 h while only one n95 mask would be provided per shift in high-risk areas fifth single-cycle visiting-flow management and pre-examination triage scheme were established on the whole hospital campus each medical building including the outpatient building was under closed management with single-entry and single-exit channels medical staff and patients with their relatives were asked to use different entries and exits for getting in and out of the buildings figure 1 volunteers were recruited at the entrance for screening and those with abnormal temperatures or respiratory symptoms were not allowed to enter the buildings and were directed to the fever clinic this flow management strategy helped identify one case in the first week  sixth given the publics panic about the epidemic and the possible influx of a large number of outpatient visits after the spring festival holiday the hospital immediately opened a free online consultation clinic for viral-related symptoms7 using advertisements on public social media people can directly scan a qr code by means of the mobile wechat app to enter the online consultation platform after completing a self-evaluation questionnaire containing disease symptoms and epidemiological history patients can receive a free online evaluation and response from doctors within 6 h publicity information was released through social media and the public was advised to reduce unnecessary hospital visits the platform received approximately 500 online visits every day and it helped reduce unnecessary runs on medical resources on the first day of the outpatient service resume the number of visits was less than 2000 which was down 90 percent from the same period last year and the number of visits to fever clinics remained stable at approximately 100 cases per day therefore the decrease in population density in the hospital helped to reduce the pressure of epidemic prevention and control significantly seventh the communication and notification of epidemic and clinical information were strengthened to stabilize the confidence of medical staff the hospitals carried out a daily notification system for epidemic prevention and control to every department including ppes stock quantity current dynamic trends of the confirmed and suspected cases in the hospital and the daily progression of the dispatched medical team and so on timely and transparent release of information helped stabilize emotions infectious diseases have become a major challenge to human society in this century emerging infectious diseases caused more frequent and complex epidemics in the past 2 centuries such as sars zika mers and covid-19 global health systems are still under-prepared for any significant outbreaks even with considerable progress89
 the recent outbreak of coronavirus in wuhan china has imposed challenges on the chinese medical system the sharp increase in the number of covid-19 patients and the shortage of medical supplies strained the medical service system public panic throughout the whole country and the following surge in hospitals almost collapsed the system in some areas although the epidemic situation varies from region to region timely and reasonable preparation will contribute to effective medical responses and epidemic outbreak control the covid-19 coronavirus seems to be very contagious and spreading faster and broader than other previous viruses10 as happened in wuhan and other cities around the world once a regional outbreak occurs a bank run on medical resources and the following medical system breakdown may be inevitable as numbers of patients surge implementation of an emergency response strategy preemptively could delay the growth and limit the size of the epidemic11 to cope with this particular and possible future mass casualty incidents every health facility should do its best to prepare for the ongoing pandemic medical staff and workforce recruiting medical resources preparation and re-allocation and urgent expansion of essential medical spaces should be the critical emergency response strategy for every hospital and may provide essential support for epidemic prevention and control active and rational patient flow management in advance such as moving line re-design and control pre-examination triage and remote online medical service will help to reduce the risk of patients surge and nosocomial infections according to our experience all of these response strategies helped to reduce the impact on the medical system through the implementation of the above measures the hospitals epidemic prevention and control and various clinical work have been carried out in an orderly manner at the time of writing the number of outpatient visits and inpatient admissions was stable and reasonably controlled we hope that these measures will continue to help effectively control the epidemic and our experiences will provide a reference for other medical institutions  when the wrong people are immune teneille brown r  after a disaster such as the covid-19 pandemic there will be an irresistible desire to blame others despite documented failures in the federal governments response to the pandemic injured individuals will not be able to hold it accountable due to the broad application of governmental immunity congress and state governments have provided targeted immunity to various device manufacturers and emergency volunteers however the one group with huge targets on their backs are individual physicians who are often making impossible choices that are reasonable at the time but might not appear reasonable to a jury after the fact and with the bias of hindsight recognizing that the potential for liability might cause undue psychological stress on health care providers this essay argues for statutory immunity that protects them from rationing and other health care decisions that are made in good faith and that are in compliance with documented state institutional or professional pandemic-response guidelines  after a disaster such as the covid-19 pandemic there will be an irresistible desire to blame others people will attribute intentionality to actions that were purely accidental and deem people careless for failing to prevent unforeseeable harms 2 even assessments of causation will be influenced by whether we think someone acted selfishly 3 we will blame our neighbors for going to the grocery store without wearing masks we will blame those who hoarded pallets of toilet paper we will blame the chinese we will blame the broken health care system we will blame the physician who ignored our appeals for a ventilator for our dad after so much death we may even blame god the post-mortems will frustratingly attempt to identify the cause of this catastrophe as if there were that simple hopefully in the midst of this powerful need to blame we will not forget who the primary target of our outrage should be-our federal executive branch we are only midway through the crisis and it is already quite clear that the presidents response has been nothing short of reckless 4 he has made a number of notable missteps that may have exacerbated the death toll to make this plain i will canvass just a few of them here rather than immediately using the defense production act to order companies to produce needed tests and medical supplies the president downplayed the seriousness of the virus 5 the failure to immediately develop testing capacity led directly to an inability to conduct effective contact tracing when tests were initially developed by the centers for disease control cdc they were determined to be contaminated due to sloppy laboratory procedures 6 other laboratories began developing reliable tests for the virus but the cdc wanted to be the sole source and federal drug administration fda regulations that required emergency use authorization were slow to be approved 7 these initial testing failures allowed the virus to quietly spread among the many who are asymptomatic 8 due to the termination of the senior director for global health security and biodefense in 2018 there has not been a coordinated authoritative federal response 9 doctors have complained that they are not looking to the cdc for trustworthy data and are instead relying on more informal networks and non-governmental publications 10 the president also frequently misstated the availability of testing leading people to bombard their local health care facilities for tests that they did not have 11 regarding treatment the president later claimed that the fda had approved a -game-changer drug hydroxychloroquine despite the fda later correcting that the drug was still being tested for 5 zolan kanno-youngs and ana

michael bloomberg said  he then claimed he had -total authority to mandate a premature reopening of the state economies which went against his health experts advice and notably the us constitution 19

-liberate virginia and save your great 2nd amendment it is under siege 20 lamentably despite being the primary mistake-maker here the federal government itself will enjoy broad immunity and will be essentially protected from any tort liability related to its covid-19 response the concept of sovereign immunity derives from english law where it was assumed that -the king can do no wrong 21 since the thirteenth century the english monarchy could not be sued unless it agreed to waive immunity the concept was somewhat clumsily borrowed and applied to our federal and state governments in the united states despite our emphatic rejection of an unaccountable crown there are principled justifications to federal sovereign immunity namely the separation of powers supports executive agency policy decisions being protected from being secondguessed by the courts 22 immunity may also be defended on instrumental grounds as the governments motive is to protect the general welfare and not to maximize profits and avoid liability 23 while these claims have merit there are even more powerful counterarguments that 2433 1990 holding that a states invocation of sovereign immunity when the petitioner alleges colorable fourth amendment claims violated the supremacy clause of the constitution section 233a of the public health service act -grants absolute immunity to phs officers and employees for actions arising out of the performance of medical or related functions within the scope of their employment by barring all actions against them for such conduct see hui v castaneda 559 us 799 806 2010 in some cases even a bivens remedy is precluded such as when public health service officers or employers are sued under the public service act discretionary duty that was breached she would likely still lose due to the common law -public duty doctrine the public duty doctrine holds that because governments owe a duty of care to every citizen they do not owe a duty to any one particular citizen 35 both state and federal courts have interpreted this to mean that government officials such as emergency responders cannot be sued in tort when they fail to perform their duties such as sending aid in response to a 911 call if there was no direct contact or assurance of aid to a particular individual then there was no duty for the dispatcher for example to perform her functions 36 the public duty doctrine has astonishing consequences and often insulates the police emergency responders and many state agencies from being accountable for their negligence or wrongdoing there is nothing to suspend this doctrine during public health emergencies and in fact the emergency situation is likely to expand its application to summarize as a result of both the discretionary function exception and the public duty doctrine we can expect that injured individuals will not be able to seek adequate legal recourse from our federal or state governments for their failure to respond appropriately to the pandemic thus one of the only ways the federal government will be accountable for wrongdoing will be if the president suffers political consequences in the next election relying solely on political accountability is worrisome however for one political accountability has been significantly watered down in the last decade in part due to almost unlimited corporate money in political campaigns 37 and the distortions of representation in the electoral college 38  this is also fueled by information asymmetry we cannot assume that the electorate has the bandwidth to pay attention to the many conflicting news stories and evidence of political wrongdoing political accountability requires a great deal of focus and time that many voters simply do not have this may be in part why it has taken considerable presidential mismanagement to move the needle at all the presidents approval ratings were at an all-time high despite some major mistakes in his response to covid-19 they only very recently have started to decline 39 importantly however even if the president suffers significant political consequences from his mishandling of the pandemic almost none of this will trickle down to the agency executives or career bureaucrats who did his bidding while political accountability in theory provides a check on shoddy political decision-making it provides a very weak check on agencies 40 this is sometimes by design 41  perhaps most important of all political accountability even if perfect does absolutely nothing to compensate those who were individually injured by executive recklessness the need to compensate injured parties provides the strongest basis for removing immunity if government is responsibly conducting their risk benefit analyses there will not be many plaintiffs seeking compensation but the complete lack of a remedy for carelessly inflicting personal harm flies in the face of our democratic principles of government april 21 2020  available

that so long as they provide informed consent immunity is appropriate for prescribing unapproved medications this appears to be linked with the -right to try movement however there are sound reasons why we do not permit individuals to be treated with medications that are not proved as safe or effective even if an individuals cost-benefit analysis skews toward welcoming greater risk and we

health care workers for carelessness when they respond to an emergency 49 even so the immunity provisions in the prep and cares acts speak to congressional recognition that the fear of liability might

compliance with a documented policy 61 if an institution has no documented policy and leaves rationing up to the individual decision they expose both the physician and the institution to legal liability from discriminatory or substandard decisions implementing a policy that complies with anti-discrimination law is prudent in these situations to reduce this risk there are only so many physicians and nurses and only so many beds the possibility of a medical malpractice lawsuit will do nothing to prevent the need to ration if there is only 1 icu bed available and ten patients vying for it the possibility of ex post tort liability will not instantly create nine more beds perhaps if the government could be accountable for this failure more beds and ventilators could be produced or reallocated from regions that are not as hard hit by covid-19 but the physicians on the frontlines cannot be expected to create additional resources while fighting this pandemic the normal incentives of deterrence will thus not work to create better rationing or to remove the need for rationing indeed the possibility of liability will only make the necessary rationing more discriminatory and unfair as physicians cater to the loudest wealthiest or most educated patients who fight the hardest and who seem most likely to  there will be many institutional policies related to covid-19 that will expose individual physicians to liability and these instances may be even more common than the need to ration scarce resources physicians are being instructed by their states professional associations and in addition to taking extra precautions during procedures physicians are also being instructed by their employers to reschedule or cancel cancer heart and lung interventions that they think can wait several weeks this is done both to reduce the risk of the immune- 1913 1926 2008  65 cath lab digest data shows reduction in us heart attack activations during covid- 19 pandemic april

that patients who had a delayed diagnosis or treatment might sue the physicians who made this call if it turns out not to have been clinically appropriate for them while these decisions might all be perfectly reasonable during a pandemic the fear or reality of having to defend these utilitarian decisions in court might add undue stress on the physicians who are doing their best to follow state or institutional policy 66 the value of immunity comes not just from rejecting the second-guessing of emergency decisions that were thrust upon an overwhelmed industry there is also considerable value in giving physicians peace of mind that the forced choice between two terrible possibilities will not later be penalized in court during normal times emotions run high when a loved one is denied medical treatment or injured during a procedure the resulting break-down of communication may lead to a lawsuit as many people will be unhappy with how resources were rationed or decisions made under ordinary circumstances a physician may be liable for a clinical judgment that could foreseeably cause a patients death however these are not ordinary circumstances and health care providers are being asked to make impossible decisions that may aid our ability to respond to covid-19 but which might increase the risk to individual patients there is often no third option that avoids putting a particular patient at risk to help others immunity is appropriate in these situations where the providers decisions are objectively reasonable and defensible ex ante and for which there would be great psychological value in removing the possibility of suit while it might seem unlikely that many families will sue as they should appreciate that the extenuating circumstances of the pandemic not all families will be so understanding or reasonable 67 to be sure there may be greater distrust of physician decision-making and increased incentives to sue in the wake of this pandemic as people are more isolated and anxious and may be suffering from severe economic instability additionally as the social distancing measures cities and states have adopted to -flatten the curve are working the lack of a big surge in infections as was seen in new york might anger those patients who assume that the precautionary measures were not necessary 68 given this we can expect that some number of families will claim that a physician who denied their family member treatment or performed a procedure differently due to covid-19 precautions caused them a compensable injury depending on the circumstances a judge and jury may agree causation and breach are not discoverable facts of nature but rather are morally laden and susceptible to hindsight bias 69 hindsight bias could be particularly severe here cases would not be litigated until long after the chaos of the pandemic has subsided which might permit juries to forget just how extenuating the circumstances appeared to be ex ante therefore even if physicians were doing their best at the time to fairly allocate resources and follow institutional policies a jury could find them liable for making an intolerable choice that caused harm indeed even if the possibility of an award is remote the very prospect of this possibility may create unfair and paralyzing fear for physicians who as a group already overestimate the risk of being sued 70 this article advocates for removing the possibility of a medical malpractice claim for individual physicians and independent health care providers when they are complying with published state professional or institutional covid-19 policies in good faith ideally as part of any emergency response packages that are passed legislatures should either develop or require hospitals to develop protocols for rationing ventilators ecmo machines icu beds and personnel it would be best if the policy were mandatory at the state level to encourage cooperation between health care facilities 71 further and more to the point when enacting these statutes legislatures should incorporate tort immunity for health care workers who comply with covid-19 treatment protocols in good faith in the absence of a state directive this article also advocates for immunity for individual physicians when they comply with a recognized professional organizations guidance related to covid-19 or institutional policies related to their covid-19 response this is not merely to limit the liability of a powerful group it is to recognize the unbearable situation that health care workers face during a pandemic which is not at all of their own creation it is also to recognize that certain decisions might appear unreasonable ex post but they were not unreasonable ex ante health care providers are under an inordinate amount of stress as they expose themselves to a serious or deadly disease often while working incredibly long hours the extenuating circumstances of a pandemic necessitate immunity for physicians who are doing their best to bravely make critical decisions with imperfect information  one way to do this would be to require gross negligence or more before a physician could be liable for refusing someone hospital resources rather than immunizing them from negligence only when their conduct was reviewed as -reasonable the reasonability review embedded in medical futility statutes guts them of their immunity protection and removes the desired peace of mind they are intended to bestow their end-of-life plans to discourage only certain groups from refusing life-sustaining treatment should emphatically not be immunized from tort liability 75 further given our experience with medical futility statutes it would be prudent to afford clearer protection from suit than what the medical futility statutes typically provide 76 for examples specifically targeted at providing physicians immunity in response to a pandemic we can also look to laws in effect in maryland and new york at least wo states have passed targeted immunity laws which would protect paid health -that all physicians physician assistants specialist assistants nurse practitioners licensed registered professional nurses and licensed practical nurses shall be immune from civil liability for any injury or death alleged to have been sustained directly as a result of an act or omission by such medical professional in the course of providing medical services in support of the states response to the covid-19 outbreak 80 the immunity does not attach if the injury was caused by gross negligence but it is otherwise much broader than the maryland statute for one it provides immunity for actions that are not performed in accordance with any state public health directive but are rather just -in support of the states response it also provides for immunity in non-emergency situations a  that a physician acted with an intent to kill then a criminal action seems completely appropriate a civil action also seems appropriate if unlikely where a plaintiff can make out a prima facie claim that the physician acted with gross negligence or worse immunity should only cover negligence claims to strike the right balance between protecting physicians and compensating plaintiffs who were clearly wronged denying actions for criminal or grossly negligent actions provides too much immunity and has the potential to absolve or even encourage bad actors remain liable for policy decisions they implement this might be unsatisfactory as it is harder for a plaintiff to prove that a policy as opposed to an individual physicians decision violated the standard of care this is a risk but one that seems justified to ensure that immunity is not overly broad to protect decisions that might be unreasonable even given the pandemic ideally the cost of making difficult decisions during a pandemic should not fall on individual patients those who are injured by others carelessness should have some legal resource when they are wronged but our powerful desire to correct a potential injustice and to shift the cost elsewhere should not come at the expense of holding individual health care workers responsible for decisions that were reasonable ex ante there is great risk of hindsight bias where juries might forget the very real and conflicting pressures physicians were facing especially if communities do not experience the overwhelming surges that were predicted the summary judgment standard of -no reasonable juror could find breach provides a good guide for tailoring immunity to those situations where it can do the most good and the least harm immunity laws recognize that even if a plaintiff is properly denied recovery at the summary judgment stage getting to this point imposes considerable emotional and financial costs on the individual physicians in addition to having to review case files be deposed and physicians did not create this pandemic situation while they are intimately involved in its mitigation these heroic efforts should not expose them to unnecessary malpractice liability merely because government immunity makes them the last target standing our state and federal governments should be accountable as public health agencies and government figures have a moral and legal duty to protect their citizens and prepare for health emergencies 83 there is a possibility that the federal government could waive immunity for personal injury related to its response to the pandemic following the threat of a previous h1n1 pandemic congress passed the swine flu act which created a private right of action against the us from injuries resulting from swine flu inoculation 84 or the government could set up a compensation fund for families adversely affected by rationing decisions while removing immunity-where the government acted recklessly or in ways that abused its discretion-would be a sensible way to provide accountability it also seems politically quite unlikely we can hope for some political recourse as the executives and their agencies that failed to prepare or respond may be removed from office however for the reasons described above this is an enormously imperfect check crucially it provides no remedy for the parties who are injured by carelessness or wrongdoing if a corporation develops a defective product that injures we are learning many lessons from this pandemic some welcome and some not one lesson we might take away from this is the need for better remedies against government officials when they completely fail to perform their public duties the time has come to pass legislation that more significantly waives immunity in line with our democratic ideals now more than ever we must fight the dangerous notion that our leaders are kings

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 or covid-19 pandemic has forcibly affected healthcare in other subspecialties than the primarily involved intensive care infectious diseases and general practice neurosurgery is influenced by the redistribution of medical resources to those acutely needing covid-19 care and by the need to handle or prevent covid-19 among neurosurgical patients and staff 15 several editorials letters and articles have given accounts of neurosurgery during the covid-19 pandemic 1 49 the immediate responses include diversion of ventilators and intensive care resources to prepare management of covid-19 patients with subsequent decrease in neurosurgical resources and extensive postponing of elective patients patients are triaged and prioritized to manage all patients medical needs during the pandemic regular neurosurgical emergences still occur 4 and the needs of these patients must be coordinated with the extraordinary demands of healthcare for covid-19 patients with terminology such as triage and prioritization the public and professionals communicate that all medical needs can be met although extreme adjustment and measures are necessary

european regions via member countries of eans with one department in every country and to obtain better coverage of italy and spain two countries that were initially most severely struck by covid-19

indications to treat patients preexisting differences in neurosurgical capacity and practice would fail to adequately reflect effects of the pandemic if only practices during the pandemic would be surveyed hence we constructed a questionnaire that recorded practice and attitudes before and during the pandemic the time points in december and march were chosen to reflect regular practice during a regular working week and practice affected by the covid-19 pandemic in the vicinity of its european peak respectively we postulated that the supply of neurosurgical care would be in balance with demand and expectations in december 2019 but that supply would decrease and affect neurosurgical care during the pandemic several guidelines and recommendations have been recently published on how to manage the pandemic and possible shortage of resources 4 11 15 22 the guidance comprises prioritization by postponing non-urgent cases triaging of cases to use resources effectively and optimally meet individual medical needs and finally rationing of cases the process of selection of who will not be treated to optimally meet a medical need we observed prioritization and rationing but with differences between centers optimization of care by reorganization was employed in some italian and spanish centers where the responsibility of neurosurgical emergencies was concentrated to some centers while others took responsibility for regional elective care and still others shifted tasks to manage covid-19 patients such task shifting 23 and concentration by sub-specialization are possible in healthcare systems that have several smaller centers but not in countries like uk ireland denmark sweden and finland that already have fewer large regional centers with catchment areas often over 2000000 inhabitants moreover the number of neurosurgical beds1000000 was already low in the latter groups of countries providing for only a small number of potential beds these beds may have been used as efficiently as already under normal conditions the mechanisms of demand and supply suggest that available resources affect how many and which patients are treated via local indications for admittance and surgery accordingly regional centers in europe with lowest number of beds responded that not all patients received therapy according to medical needs even before the pandemic in december 2019 first the demand for neurosurgery appears to have decreased during the pandemic the number of sah and tbi patients treated during the pandemic was significantly lower in march 2020 than december 2019 although indications for emergency treatment of neurosurgical patients have remained similar and guidelines specifically state that neurosurgical emergencies need to be handled according to already accepted knowledge and experience 5 11 22 24 only three centers stated that they would not admit one hypothetical typical neurosurgical sah patient in need of intensive care several authors have described a decrease in trauma probably secondary to lockdown and decreased travel 12 which agrees with fewer tbi patients in intensive care in march 2020 a similar finding was evident for sah patients but the difference was smaller it has been suggested that sah incidences have decreased also and the incidence of sah may be prone to chance or seasonal flux however it is also possible that patients avoid medical consultations during the pandemic or get misdiagnosed because of confirmation biased healthcare workers suspecting covid-19 in patients suffering from headaches as suggested recently 25 the obvious default response to decreased resources was to prioritize patients who would risk death or permanent loss of function unless treated and postpone care that could wait accordingly most centers reported fewer elective craniotomies and increased time on the waitlist before surgery interestingly a hypothetical patient with glioblastoma had an unchanged or shortened expected time to surgery in 15 centers and a doubled time in four hypothetical patients with meningiomas or cervical spinal stenosis were treated with a similar timeframe in six and seven centers respectively while waitlist would be increased with a few weeks in three and four and postponed until after corona in eleven and ten postponing care implies that the patients will still be treated and would not risk permanent deficits from the extended wait one might even speculate that patients scheduled for meningioma or cervical stenosis surgery might experience decrease or stabilization of symptoms that may change the original surgical indication and reverse the decision to operate conservative management has a place for slowly growing meningiomas and cervical pathology 18 26 and even surgeons probably operate a higher number of patients than theoretically necessary to avoid harm from the progressive disease it is not possible to make an exact prognosis of which patients benefit from any treatment and healthcare statistics typically deals with number needed to treat nnt as a measurement of how many patients must be treated for one to have the intended benefit in pharmacological management nnts may be higher than 100 27 while surgical therapies require values much closer to one yet the ideal of nnt  1 is probably impossible to reach it is probable that longer waitlist may force nnt closer to 1 if patients are followed closely and operated rapidly if their conditions deteriorate under conditions like a pandemic resource constraints may ensue and health services must be provided with attention to cost efficiency and inevitable priority settings all prioritization decisions bring controversy 21 28 prioritization and triaging suggest that patients will receive adequate treatment and do not necessarily risk harm from waiting or triaging to a certain treatment mathiesen t submitted practically prioritization assesses the severity of untoward consequences and necessary urgency to treatment to avoid harm 4 notably the algorithm entails the possibility that postponed care can lead to irreversible loss of function or even death prioritization under such conditions is no longer compatible with everybody getting access to legitimate care it is more correct to use the term rationing which explicitly clarifies that treatment is not offered to everyone with a legitimate need extensively postponed treatment until post-corona may prove to be a form of disguised rationing rationing was more transparent when centers reported changed indications for surgery and intensive care between the december and march weeks elective craniotomies would not be offered to our hypothetical patients with glioblastoma or meningioma in six centers and five would not treat the elective patient with spinal stenosis it is likely that inability to offer surgery to the hypothetical gbm patient in or questionnaire would be an example of rationing that actually shortened the expected survival of the patient since surgery postponed for several months would no longer be a relevant treatment option the centers that modified surgical indications for elective surgery also reported restricted admission for the hypothetical emergency patients one might argue that surgery of a meningioma or spinal stenosis would be undertaken after corona restrictions were reversed but not offering surgery to a gbm patient or patients with the urgent conditions ich and sah clearly constitutes rationing of care in summary some form of rationing via changed surgical indications was evident in ten of the 25 responding centers 40 rationing was clearly implemented to adjust to covid-19 the ten centers that reported changed indications for surgery also stated that not all patients could get treatment according to legitimate needs it appears that the immediate response in all centers was to postpone non-urgent care and to reconsider indications for patients in higher age groups or with severe conditions where benefit from neurosurgical treatment was uncertain such as elderly patients with intracerebral hematoma or comatose patients with sah these measures were also typically recommended in guidelines and other articles although publications became available when measures already were taken 5 6 11 european neurosurgeons largely lack specific training knowledge or experience of practice during a pandemic but acted similarly and it appears effectively since only marginal changes appear to have affected the long-term prospects of most neurosurgical patients this observation illustrates a human faculty to practically use available knowledge and solve a new unexpected problem moreover guidelines gave only general recommendations and left interpretation and application to local medical experts the post hoc publication of guidelines may seem ironical or useless but we argue that the publications filled a need they reflected extensive consensus and might serve as retrospective confirmation that the challenge was met appropriately and in agreement with peers still our survey indicated that application varied extensively it may well be affected by differences in severity of the pandemic but we also found major differences in neurosurgical capacity per catchment population catchment area of individual centers and neurosurgical culture the term collateral damage describes untoward effects on health that were indirectly caused by sars-cov-2 14 which may have taken several forms related to resource shortage misdiagnoses and reluctance to fill available hospital beds it is obvious that deviation of healthcare resources to a new entity deprives existing therapies at least during an adjustment phase it is obvious from our questionnaire that neurosurgical care has been rationed and patients have been deprived of neurosurgical care because of lacking resources and redistribution of resources the most obvious shift was maybe that ventilators and anesthesiology staff were shifted from neurosurgical care to lifesaving covid-19 therapy many countries in europe became prepared in advance because they had realized what had happened in unexpectedly hit unprepared italy many centers in countries that were not severely hit by covid-19 decreased their elective activity and restricted indications for surgery very rapidly while their capacity remained comparable with centers with extensive covid-19 loads the response reflected a principle of precaution since lack of preparation for the pandemic would have been negligent if the pandemic would have reached the specific region a draconic shutdown of non-emergency treatment also in centers with a small load of covid-19 was probably rational but might have unnecessarily deprived patients of neurosurgical care still it is probable that the dichotomization between urgent and non-urgent care failed to handle patients with intermediate needs and may even have emphasized urgency over benefit our hypothetical 75-year-old patient with ich may have had a very urgent condition with limited benefit of surgery while a less debilitating elective condition in our hypothetical elective patients may have had more to lose with extensively postponed surgery sufficient empirical data on postponed non-urgent surgery is not available and the sudden need to prioritize has identified an important topic to surveyalso to critically analyze practices in centers that already had institutionalized long waitlists prior to the pandemic the coronavirus can induce neurological disorders such as polyneuropathy encephalopathy and demyelinating lesions 29 headache disturbance of consciousness olfactory nerve dysfunction and seizures have been reported among the symptoms of the disease subsequently there is evidence of misdiagnoses when non-covid-19-related symptoms of neurosurgical disease were mistakenly evaluated as covid-19 symptoms leading to patients and doctors delay 15 25 patients and physicians may have been reluctant to occupy hospital beds for fear of getting infected by sars-cov-2 17 likewise it was important to ensure that neurosurgical wards and the operating room were maintained free from covid-19 this requires continuous active surveillance and testing 30 moreover we have pushed a dual burden ahead many patients had their treatment postponed for months it will become necessary to treat these patients while new patients get diagnosed and the total number of patients needing care has accumulates the other burden is the healthcare economical debt the financial resources were stretched by collapsing income and failing economy while healthcare spending to save lives increased the burden of covid-19 differed between european countries the fact that pandemics burden of death varies from country to country is well known 20 five participating centers considered that all patients with legitimate medical needs received care as needed in december 2019 and march 2020 while fifteen centers could no longer meet all medical needs in march 2020 and five centers reported that some patients were left with unmet legitimate needs already in december 2019 still four centers apparently continued business as usual although some had considerable numbers of covid-19 patients in the country as expected our figures indicate that centers were worst affected if their regions were severely hit and if their pre hoc resources were comparatively low in fact some centers had fewer beds and longer waitlist even before the pandemic than those others had during covid-19 measures thus small margins forced changes in indications and services to a high extent it was also evident that the centers with comparatively low resourcesmillion inhabitants stated doubts whether legitimate needs were met already before this pandemic another issue is cultural difference of indications some centers did not consider any of the three hypothetical patients with intracerebral hematomas as surgical candidates the observation may reflect a quest for evidence of benefit from prospective randomized trials while others may have used evidence based on other literature and experiences one issue to explore is whether the limitations in indications reflect adaptation to limited resources or whether resources have been limited secondary to decreased demand the ethics of extrapolating results from the negative prospective randomized trials 19 with questionable external validity 13 merit separate studies it is important to survey whether a relative lack of resources might have influenced the readiness to accept trial outcomes as evidence for non-neurosurgical management of intracerebral hemorrhage it appears that most centers and countries even among those hit worst have been able to deliver extensive neurosurgical services so that emergency surgery has only been limited in few centers while most centers have postponed surgery of non-urgent character thus a backlog has been created and the impact of this backlog may also differ depending on available resources 2 16 it is probable that large numbers of available beds will create less morbidity from extended waitlists than already limited resources taken together our analyses indicate that resources in terms of available neurosurgical beds vary extensively in europe centers with large margins have responded very effectively and centers with small margins appeared to have provided cost-effective services before the pandemic but have upheld services only if their regions were hit mildly by covid-19 in this context the lack of consensus on a constant need to prioritize health-care needs to be studied further several of the seemingly most affluent countries had few neurosurgical beds reported an ongoing discourse on prioritization and restricted services and indications to a higher extent than centers that did not report a discourse of prioritization it is possible that the discourse of prioritization rapidly had focused on how to prioritize and decrease healthcare spending rather than to discuss which rationing is necessary and acceptable the idea that prioritization of healthcare in the sense of rationing is maybe not necessary might need further exploration in the future taken together there was no unifying feature for the centers that maintained services the majority was situated in areas with limited covid-19 burden and none had very few beds per population a family likeness might be a combination of sufficient numbers of beds which would be higher in the regions struck hardest and work ethics where all patients were considered to be entitled to having legitimate medical needs met our survey is entirely dependent on reports from the responding neurosurgeons and selected centers we had a short timeframe to receive responses and may have failed to get relevant input the responses from each center are representative for the centers but may not necessarily reflect larger regions countries or europe although they provide a snapshot from different areas with different healthcare systems and sars-cov-2 exposures even during the course of the pandemic in a particular department patient management policy could have changed more or less this is why we use the term snapshot when we are examining a rapidly changing situation quantitative data on sizes of catchment areas and available beds agreed well internally within reports from each center but such data may be differently defined in different healthcare systems strictly regionalized large centers in nordic countries have very strictly defined populations to serve while smaller neurosurgical centers in densely populated areas may have an overlap of catchment areas with other hospitals moreover the normalization of data from 1 week in departments of different sizes is prone to flux and possible disproportionate influence from chance fluctuations in centers with small catchment areas since their reported figures were multiplied while figures from the largest centers were divided moreover the assessment of medical needs is subjective and value laden assessment of surgical indications may vary between individual surgeons we attempted to maximize reproducibility and representability by inviting five senior surgeons to fill out the questionnaires from each center and thereby compensate for individual idiosyncrasy and thereby estimate that the responses do represent local consensus we compared 1 week in december with 1 week in march one can question whether a week during march in a different year without a pandemic would have been a better control the choice of december was made to allow for the detection of the probable sudden sharp change in the care of neurosurgical patients because of the pandemic which we considered would be better reflected with comparison with a week close in time moreover one can question which measure of covid-19 burden would best reflect an impact on practice practice is affected by a combination of expectations and need to react to a real situation while corona statistics reflect disease spread and need for intensive care with a delay the number of covid-19 reflected deaths can reflect several weeks of intensive care utilization and sars-cov-2 can be transmitted several weeks before infection is diagnosed moreover there is a delay before cases appear in statistics and country statistics fail to reflect regional differences for these reasons any surrogate parameter of covid-19 burden is diffuse we chose population-adjusted national values of diagnosed cases and covid-19-related deaths as a cumulative approximation of the perceived and actual pandemic challenges during the surveyed pandemic week we have conducted a rapid survey of changes of neurosurgical care during the covid-19 pandemic rationing of neurosurgical care was common and neurosurgical activity was decreased in 80 of responding centers yet differences were unexpectedly large in available resources and adaption to the pandemic we need to further survey how attitudes to neurosurgical care in different series affect our populations and which margins of resources might be needed to provide neurosurgical care according to professional ethics  care in the time of coronavirus ethical considerations in head and neck oncology eli gordin a andrew day lenka stankova elizabeth heitman john sadler   the covid19 pandemic has significantly altered the daily practice of head and neck oncology throughout the world most head and neck cancers require urgent management within weeks as extended delays may result in additional morbidity or even death however oncologic care has been critically challenged by pandemicdriven uncertainty and numerous novel multilevel covid19specific risks now in addition to treating patients cancers head and neck oncologists must alsoprotect the patient from infection with sarscov2 as well as minimizing risk factors for covid19related fatality in the event of infectionprevent the spread of covid19 within healthcare institutions and the communityminimize the risk of covid19 transmission to healthcare workersfairly allocate resources to all patients in a time of scarcity
 what follows is an examination of the ethical implications involved in navigating the above risks these issues need to be reconciled with the desire to deliver standard of care therapy amid great uncertainty and in the context of a shortage of resources the hope is that by describing these conflicts clinicians will be better able to understand their own ethical perspectives and those of their colleagues while approaching treatment decisions the lack of data concerning covid19 is immediately apparent to clinicians especially as it relates to head and neck oncology this new widespread disease creates a high level of uncertainty which permeates further discussions new studies are published daily estimates of the prevalence of covid19 vary widely covid19 is not distributed uniformly throughout the world or even within the united states and guidelines are not necessarily generalizable to all institutions the rate of nosocomial transmission is not known exposure risk to healthcare workers is unclear especially in the context of procedures that are generally necessary while delivering head and neck cancer care the actual risk of contracting covid19 in the community or the healthcare setting cannot be specified moreover the wide variation in the presentation of covid19 makes it highly challenging for hospitals and clinicians to plan for the future care needs of their patients sarscov2 infection may be unrecognizable with minimal or no symptoms in some patients while others may suffer catastrophic multiorgan system failure this wide range of disease severity compounds the difficulty in predicting which clinical services will be overwhelmed as the pandemic evolves and therefore what resultant opportunity cost may be lost in diverting resources from head and neck patients to a projected crisis in an ideal setting head and neck cancers are diagnosed workedup and brought to treatment expediently within a matter of days to weeks whether surgical resection radiation chemotherapy immunotherapy or a combination of modalities is employed should depend only on which treatment strategy gives the patient the greatest chance of actualizing his or her goals of care whether treatment is curative or palliative organ preserving or excisional standard or experimental or whether treatment is completed in one sitting or over the course of many weeks should only depend on what is in the best interest of the patientas expressed by that patient treatment should be guided by a multidisciplinary treatment team of healthcare professionals who provide the counseling and education regarding all possible treatment options that have been vetted with scientifically rigorous evidence the treatment decision is a personal one between a patient and his or her doctors and should be free ideally from external pressures such as finances access scheduling and availability of resources the physician should have only the interests of that one patient in mind and the patient should be able to focus on only those considerations that relate to adherence to the treatment plan to the exclusion of other concerns these ideals are based on the four pillars of medical ethics beneficence nonmaleficence autonomy and justice all of which are patientcentered that is we should do good to and for our patients while avoiding doing harm and allow the patients needs and values to guide the treatment planas we would for any other patient in a similar situation although foundational a standard of medical practice based on these principles alone would be poorly generalizable and neglects the practical limitations of inconvenient clinical situations and imperfect systems of care it views the patient in isolation from his or her community and excludes the finite economics and resources of medicine and the associated implications to public health it does not address the requirement that healthcare workers prevent harm to themselves which in turn enables them to continue to render care finally it does not recognize that the patient is motivated in part by practical responsibilitiesfinancial social and otherwisethat may serve as obstacles to treatment medicine is not practiced in a vacuum independent from society and politics there are other factors that influence medical decision making at every level that transgress the ideal framework of the textbook doctorpatient relationship this was the case long before covid19 and will be the case far after that is not to say that we were not practicing good medicine prior to covid and it does not mean that we cannot continue to do so in the face of such a pandemic however as we invoke ethical principles in the name of quality medical care it must be recognized that we are not above the influence of the practical societal forces at play that have always been involved in the calculus of medical decision making head and neck cancer treatment plans are generally formulated in adherence with the national comprehensive cancer network nccn guidelines according to the nccn nccn guidelines are the recognized standard for clinical direction and policy in cancer care and are the most thorough and frequently updated clinical practice guidelines available in any area of medicine additionally the nccn guidelines provide recommendations based on the best evidence available at the time they are derived emphasis added
1

 obviously the nccn guidelines were derived before the novel coronavirus infected its first victim insufficient time has passed to amass necessary data regarding the risks of covid19 to patients with both head and neck cancer and their providers therefore we cannot know whether the current nccn guidelines would stand as they are now if such risks were fully elucidated certainly the need to balance risk in the formulation of a treatment plan is not novel and treatment guidelines are dictated by known risks the risks of treatment failure are balanced against the risks of morbidity and mortality from proposed interventions these concepts are incorporated into medical jargon for example the term unresectable is sometimes substituted as shorthand for stating that a surgical procedure involves a degree of risk that is deemed unacceptable relative to the perceived benefit of attempting surgical extirpation currently many organizations including the nccn have advocated for practices that are not considered standard of care in light of the covid19 pandemic these include postponing office visits and radiology appointments for cancer surveillance converting clinic visits to telehealth encounters when possible and minimizing aerosolgenerating procedures such as flexible laryngoscopy
2

 as per the nccn websites reference to covid19 individual clinical judgment is necessary these recommendations cannot provide absolutes for alternate strategies during the covid19 outbreak furthermore some of these recommendations would not normally be considered standard of care or optimal but are reasonable under these unusual circumstances in which minimizing visits and potential exposure has become a priority
3

 this suggests that managing the perceived though unknown risk of spreading covid19 has superseded the standard of care in some situations such as the follow up of posttreatment patients with head and neck cancer while these situations may not have a clear impact on the immediate management of the patient it is possible that early detection of cancer recurrence could be missed because of such practice modifications whether this risk is justified by a reduction in the spread of covid19 to the patient associated healthcare staff and the population in general is not known available data show that the chances of fatality from covid19 are significantly higher in patients with certain comorbidities including pulmonary disease cancer and immunocompromised status4 5 these conditions are common in patients with head and neck cancer it also appears that patients who are infected with sarscov2 who undergo major surgery have a significantly increased risk of mortality
6
 furthermore because no effective treatments for covid19 are available at this time the most effective management strategy is disease prevention the actual risks of surgery in the current context are unknown and the information necessary to adequately counsel patients is not available the 30day mortality risk incurred by undergoing major head and neck surgery may be around 3 at baseline7 8 if the patients risk of mortality when undergoing major head and neck surgery during the covid19 pandemic were increased by a defined percentage we could easily explain this to the patient a surgical standard of care would prevail if the average overall survival of the surgical patient still exceeded that with nonsurgical treatment if the surgical patients chance of mortality were increased beyond that of nonstandard alternative therapy the surgical standard would be inappropriate at this moment in time it may be reasonable to assume that most patients who have head and neck cancer do not have covid19 and that they are more likely to die from that cancer if left untreated than they are from the infection in cases where the efficacy of nonsurgical treatment is inferior or unknown relative to a surgical standard of care a compelling reason to forego safety for alternative therapy would be needed in this situation when only patient benefit is considered deviation from the standard of care for a known cancer becomes more difficult deviation from the established standard of care would be more acceptable if there were a clear and present benefit to the patient for example if an institution was experiencing a major nosocomial outbreak of covid19 it might be prudent to avoid surgical therapy that would necessitate admission in favor of nonstandard treatment thereby avoiding a delay in some form of care similarly an institution without available ventilators or operating rooms due to a massive surge in covid19 would present the same problem these examples assume that there are no other institutions where the patient could receive treatment given the constraints in health insurance and financial resources for many patients this situation is certainly possible any treatment offered to the patient requires detailed informed consent for surgical excision the added risk of mortality due to covid19 would ideally be described to the patient if treatment is nonstandard this clearly must be articulated to the patient as well we presently have insufficient information to counsel the patient in our normal capacity unfortunately we must still explain these unknowns to the best of our ability the appropriate ppe for mucosal head and neck cases in the setting of covid19 is in question aerosolgenerating procedures create an increased risk of respiratory viral infection to healthcare workers relative to other patient encounters9 10 the available data mainly concern intubation and it is unclear what ppe is necessary to prevent sarscov2 transmission in surgeries where aerosolization is occurring potentially for hours on end far in excess of an intubation this duration of continuous exposure would likely carry a much higher viral load and a greater severity of disease again the exact risks are currently unknown the likelihood of operating on an unrecognized covid19 positive patient may be reduced by preoperative testing but considering the oftquoted false negative rate of 20 for nasopharyngeal sampling for sarscov2
11
 as well as the significant proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals the risk cannot be eliminated even for patients with covid19 negative the risk for community infection is continuous selfquarantine for preoperative patients up to the time of surgery would serve to further decrease this risk though the exact risk of transmission to the healthcare worker is unknown statistical principles dictate that staff who engage in greater numbers of these cases would be placed at increased danger especially as the viral cases proliferate in the community as risk increases there comes a point at which surgeons may become uncomfortable with continuing their work if the surgeons risk were known how might this information be incorporated into the formulation of the standard of care add to this the combined risk to all the healthcare workers involved both during the procedure and in the postoperative setting where aerosolgenerating procedures continue to be necessary in caring for wounds and tracheostomies it could be argued that institutions now bear a burden to inform their staff of these exposure risks to sarscov2 this communication could be implemented in part by incorporating review of any potential for transmission of infectious disease and specifically covid19 into the presurgical timeout this would at least assist in communicating a heightened risk to operating room personnel as with patients informing healthcare staff of the risks involved would respect the autonomy of those individuals and allow each member of the treatment team to consent to participate willfully utilizing safety precautions with which each provider is comfortable as with the limits to informed consent of the patient such disclosures are difficult because the risks in question are not yet quantifiable healthcare workers have always faced some personal risk in the treatment of head and neck cancer radiation therapy and medical oncology personnel take precautions to prevent exposures to ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic agents in surgery the risk of transmission of human immunodeficiency virus hiv and hepatitisc virus hcv were seen before the covid19 pandemic unlike the current pandemic the above risks are now well defined and there is institutional policy and governmental regulation set in place to protect workers from them relative to bloodborne disease what constitutes an exposure event related to sarscov2 is unclear a covid19 exposure from a patient who unknowingly harbored the virus would easily go unrecognized unless and until the healthcare worker or patient developed symptoms additionally as opposed to hiv and hcv there currently are no established medications to lessen the impact of an exposure to sarscov2 for a time lack of general knowledge regarding the transmission and infectivity of hiv fueled fears among healthcare workers the situation with covid19 parallels the early days of hiv and we do not yet know whether our current infection control practices are too stringent or whether we should be increasing our usage of ppe and other measures time will certainly tell while it has become clear that effective infection control practices for hiv are relatively simple precautions against bloodborne transmission involving gloves a surgical mask and eye protection it does not necessarily follow that this will be true of sarscov2 it may be prudent to err on the side of caution this would maximize our adherence to the principle of nonmaleficence a complete discussion of a healthcare workers duty to treat in the setting of his or her own personal risk is beyond the scope of this paper the reader is referred to the work of heidi malm and her coauthors in 2008
12
 suffice it to say that even among healthcare workers there is no consensus regarding this topic modern medicine comprises so many different specialties and vocational roles that the heterogeneity of individuals within health care prevents a blanket statement of the degree to which personnel understand expect and consent to all possible occupational risk furthermore any perceived burden of reciprocating prior benefits bestowed by society to the healthcare worker is not generalizable nor agreed upon lastly only a few professional associations suggest that a duty to treat exits in the face of personal harm with fewer incorporating it into an oath or pledge
12

 as for the physician treating head and neck cancer it is not reasonable to suggest that subjecting oneself to physical harm while carrying out routine functions of patient care was somehow consciously or implicitly consented to by choosing this specialty or that the physician is ethically obligated to work without regard for his or her wellbeing head and neck oncology physicians expect to work long hours and to make difficult choices while engaging in emotionally laden human interaction they can expect to sacrifice time they might have spent with their families and their other passions for the responsibility of treating others lifethreatening cancers but not their own health or that of their families each practitioner must be allowed to decide the degree of risk he or she is willing to accept like all patients who contract covid19 elderly healthcare workers and those with medical comorbidities are at increased risk for mortality and their exposure risk should be reduced as much as possible this reality increases the need for clarity around what constitutes adequate respiratory ppe for aerosolgenerating procedures especially as maximal ppe may not be available for all providers without the support of good data to understand covid19 transmission and severity institutions that do not make every effort to provide the highest level of ppe to staff participating in long duration major mucosal head and neck surgery expose these valuable healthcare professionals to unknown and potentially unacceptable risks forcing healthcare workers to accept these risks by threatening to withhold pay revoke privileges or other disciplinary action is coercive and unethical neglecting healthcare workers welfare will only serve to compound the tragedy of the covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic will tax the availability of medical resources in many areas where scarcity is not already a reality in some locations both regular hospital and icu beds are already in short supply as well as ventilators this shortage must be reconciled with the need to treat patients with head and neck cancer who would best be addressed surgically additionally head and neck operations require the expenditure of scarce ppe and in many cases may necessitate enhanced ppe that are rarer still the availability of such ppe is already problematic there may not be one universally accepted definition of rationing as it applies to health care for many the term possesses pejorative undertones and harkens back to the debate over managed care and the associated pressures for physicians to cut costs to increase profits for private businesses or themselves for our purposes let us consider that for a given patient substituting an alternative treatment for the most effective treatment for any reason other than patient preference is a form of rationing which may involve 1 economic rationingwhere the most effective treatment for a disease may not be adopted because the cost would outstrip the resources available to society an institution or an individual 2 rationing to promote public healthwhere the administration of the most effective treatment for an individual may be outweighed by a detriment to the public health for example institutions may limit the widespread use of broadspectrum antibiotics to prevent the emergence of drug resistant organisms rationing to promote public health is a manifestation of the ethical principle of justice many of our standards of care may not only be based on which treatment offers the greatest benefit to the individual patient but also which treatment can be the most widely distributed to patients with the disease in question while not consuming undue resources that are also needed for other patients if a patient requires oncologic treatment but that treatment involves an exposure risk to other patients and healthcare staff substituting the standard of care for this one patient in order to mitigate the resultant public health crisis may be justified if a hospitalwide outbreak were to occur by treating one infected oncology patient the increased burden of sick patients and healthcare staff on an already stretched medical system might result in otherwise preventable deaths by rendering a shortage of providers and additional necessary resources of course this is completely dependent on the degree of transmission risk and delaying treatment to a patient with cancer who is known to be covid19 positive is more easily justified than to one of unknown status 3 sociopolitical rationingthere are ongoing examples of rationing in our society that conflict with the principle of justice namely the unequal distribution of medical care in american society based on class race location employment status and others this observation is not meant to spark an argument over healthcare reform rather it illustrates an example of the disparity of resources between one population and another it could be argued that physicians ration every day our time is finite we spend more of it with some patients than with others most of us do not work 365 days each year and we share time with friends and family that could otherwise be spent treating patients if a patient misses a radiation treatment during the week many institutions will not make up for it on saturday expedient scheduling for oncologic surgery has always been problematic due to an overload of elective nonurgent cases while diminishing the patientcentered clinical ethic these practices may be necessary to keep institutions financially solvent so they can provide ongoing care if resources were truly limitless withholding the most effective treatment for any reason other than truly informed patient preference would not be ethically sound most would agree that healthcare resources are in fact finite and that there is a point at which it no longer becomes possible to treat all patients with the means that would provide the greatest chance for the most rapid maximally effective strategy as our healthcare system becomes ever more dependent on increasingly complex treatments and technology to deliver the most effective care we inch toward the time when we can no longer afford to provide these treatments to all patients who might warrant them unfortunately the covid19 pandemic has propelled rationing from the pages of ethical texts to the forefront of conversation as providers and administrators engage in daily medical decision making and the formulation of hospital policy in a world of limited resources when allocating scarce medical resources to patients we should minimize death and significant disability the timecourse of illnesses and the degree to which both treatment and its delay will impact survival and quality of life are critical considerations rationing decisions that serve public health maximize treatment benefit across society considerations such as social or economic status whether a patient is intrinsically more deserving than another and the order in which patients seen should not have bearing on treatment decisions13 14 15
 neither covid19 patients nor patients with head and neck cancer are intrinsically more deserving of resources than the other patients with newly diagnosed head and neck cancer represent an opportunity to treat a disease that carries grave consequences if untreated but also a high chance of cure depending on stage or life extension preserving resources for a projected swell of covid19 patients prioritizes hypothetical patients for actual ones indeed some emergency capacity should always be maintained to treat lifethreatening conditions unfortunately the expected rate of emergency situations in the setting of widespread covid19 is uncertain and projections are not always accurate perhaps the disagreement lies not in whether rationing is ethical when resources are scarce but in the question of who should be responsible for making decisions regarding which patient does or does not receive treatment incorporating extrinsic forces into medical decision making might erode the doctorpatient relationship and lead to injustice on the other hand maybe decisions on social justice should not be made by physicians because they are not extensively trained in such matters while some physicians may prefer not to make such ethical decisions it is also likely that many are made uneasy when lawmakers and administrators dictate which treatments are appropriate for specific patients it is possible that bedside rationing by the physician based on clinical judgment may be the most effective and practical means of allocating care with the greatest degree of flexibility in this context the physicians role in rationing is not only inevitable but has been long established
16

 physicians individually and collectively may feel dutybound to advocate for their patients to the exclusion of other influences because of the nature of the patientdoctor relationship caution in these situations is advisable physicians have various degrees of power and influence within an institution each patients access to resources should not depend upon their physicians rank or skill in negotiating for or time ppe ventilators hospital beds and ancillary personnel while these problems have always existed institutions must recognize and minimize this potential for inequity 
many patients with head and neck cancer in need of surgical excision have an excellent prognosis in the face of a lifethreatening disease and this must not be lost amid the crisis of the covid19 pandemic resources such as covid19 testing operating room time hospital beds personnel and ppe should be granted to these cases whenever available to facilitate standard of care therapythe risks of covid19 to healthcare workers involved in the treatment of head and neck cancer must not be overlooked although these risks are still poorly defined institutions have a duty to protect their healthcare workers hospital leadership must recognize that staff who routinely participate in longduration mucosal aerosol generating cases are at elevated risk and deserve strong consideration for allocation of maximal respiratory ppe additional protection should be granted to staff with risk factors for covid19related mortality preoperative timeout checklists should incorporate the potential for transmission of infectious disease when procedures involve aerosolization this factor and its known risks should be explicitly stated to all staff participating in surgery healthcare workers should not be forced to participate in situations that they perceive as unnecessarily risky any plan to preserve ppe for potential patients while simultaneously asking healthcare workers to treat curable life threatening diseases in front of them without full protection should be considered criticallypatients who are to undergo treatment for head and neck cancer should be informed of the elevated risks that covid19 presents as well as the uncertainty involved patients should undergo pretreatment covid19 testing for surgery this should be done as close to the operative date as possible patients should also be instructed to selfquarantine for 14 days preoperativelyproviders must consider their own patients needs in addition to the public health need in the context of the pandemic they must weigh a patients disease severity and acuity as well as the prognosis with treatment the duty to do what is in the best interest of one patient may at times be at odds with the duty to protect other patients and the medical workforce a conflict has always existed between our means and methods of distributing care and the core principles of medical ethics this tension has been underscored by the emergence of covid19 and the associated disruption to head and neck oncologic practice examples of ways in which benefit to the individual patient has been historically compromised even if by the smallest degree are abundant that is not to say all are clearly unethical and should be discontinued the current pandemic may provide an opportunity to reassess old habits while navigating new constraints
  ethical framework for nutrition support resource allocation during shortages lessons from covid19 albert barrocas denise schwartz baird jeanette hasse m david seres s charles mueller m   the unwelcome arrival of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 the cause of the coronavirus disease covid19 pandemic has led healthcare professionals to face situations that were given little if any attention in the past discussions and policymaking regarding the management of scarce or absent resources such as ventilators have become commonplace taking into consideration that the situations in different regions are evolving in various ways this article will attempt to summarize the impact of the pandemic on nutrition support practice the authors provide suggestions for management of nutrition support resources and how multidisciplinary bioethics or triage committees can help direct decisions other articles have provided nutrition recommendations for providing care to patients with covid19
1
 this article does not review nutrition support prescriptionswhen and what to feedrather it focuses on the ethics issues related to resources the considerations presented are based on what is currently known these are highly likely to change as we gain experience with covid19 vigilance is necessary as this pandemic is different from any prior influenza outbreaks the covid19 pandemic has presented us with the troubling trichotomy
2
namely what can be done technologically what should be done ethically and what must be done legally technologically efforts are underway to prevent manage and hopefully eradicate covid19 these include for example mitigation practices with the population and medical components that include personal hygiene social distancing personal protective equipment sheltering in place possible use of antiviral medications convalescent plasma and vaccines the role that nutrition support interventions play remains undefined traditionally medicalethical decisionmaking in the united states has been guided by the 4 principles of autonomy beneficence nonmaleficence and distributive justice fairness in the allocation of goods whether this last principle refers to the actual possession of or equal access to those goods or even if possession of the good is a privilege and not a right it is subject to debate autonomy the paramount principle that should be respected under all circumstances may be superseded by any of the other 3 in times of limited resources ethical principles dictate the allocation of resources when they are scarce in such a way to provide the best care to the greatest number or conversely to decrease the number who will be harmed the interest of the community at large may need to supersede individual interests this problem was described by gostin et al3 how do we ethically and legally balance public health with civil liberties legally the criminal and civil liability and penalty for the actions taken during normal circumstances may or may not be applicable during national crises or emergencies such as the current pandemic healthcare professionals can minimize the likelihood of legal repercussions by assuring appropriate communications and documentation and applying systematic policies eg the abcd rule to be discussed later in this article the concept of rationing is not new to healthcare military triaging of wounded soldiers has been practiced for centuries it divides casualties into those likely or unlikely to survive this is now in common use in civilian emergency masscasualty response when resources are rapidly depleted they are expended on those most likely to survive organ transplantation is a daily example of healthcare rationing because of limited donors selection of recipients is usually determined based on several criteria established by institutional transplant selection committees and the organ procurement and transplantation network of the us health resources and services administration
3

 in the last decade discussions of healthcare scarcity have often evolved along economic lines where access is de facto rationed to those who can afford health insurance the survival of the fittest by ability to pay for healthcare criteria has been touted as an example of jungle ethics based on darwinian theory of natural selection
4
 these economic disparities have become more acute during the pandemic and have sharpened focus on the debates on nationalized healthcare a variety of shortages of nutrition support products and components have been occurring for years short supplies of components of parenteral nutrition pn have been addressed with guidance from the american society for parenteral and enteral nutrition aspen

 but these dealt primarily with individual patients andor surrogate decisionmakers and not crisisbased or shortagebased decisionmaking many standard policies and practices assume there is an inexhaustible supply of resources and ready access to procedures and practitioners these often eschew the intentional consideration of justice as it applies to scarcity in ethical considerations specific to the care of individuals scarcity forces us to consider the needs of those most likely to benefit from medical interventions these decisions however may be difficult to codify fairly for example criteria such as age may fairly or unfairly stratify the likelihood of benefit the covid19 pandemic has catapulted us into a situation in which frontline healthcare professionals are facing the need to make difficult rationing decisions the potential for resourcebased decisions regarding nutrition support although not as dramatic and final as ventilator allocation may be on the horizon moreover healthcare providers themselves may be considered a scarce resource given the dangers to the healthcare worker through contact with patients infected with covid19 nutrition practitioners should be concerned about nutrition support prescriptions that require repeated contact with the patient eg protein modular supplements bolus vs continuous tube feeding increasing the frequency of visits is likely to increase the risk to workers via repeated exposures to infected patients and increased consumption of personal protective equipment this could potentially lead to the loss of a scarce resource specifically the healthcare worker who could become ill or quarantined from exposure to say nothing of the human cost if the healthcare worker succumbs to covid19 issues regarding shortages of enteral formulas supplies and pumps have been reported in some hospitals around the us personal communication anonymous sources the shortages may be related to increased demand rather than limitation in production and transportation since nutrition manufacturers are considered essential and continue to operate around the clock some of the shortages in areas of the country could be alleviated by the mobilization of products located in another part of the supply chain for example hospitals that may have an abundance of products but currently low occupancy rate could provide products to institutions in need via a hospitaltohospital transfer in addition some healthcare professionals providing care to critically ill patients with covid19 may not be acquainted with the various nutrition products adding to inappropriate utilization scarcity and potential complications during the covid19 crisis basic ethical principles and recommendations will apply regardless of the resource in question scarce resources must not be allocated based on such things as ability to pay race religion sex social status and connections class or group wealth citizenship or intellectual disability the following concepts are proposed for healthcare providers and institutions to consider in resource allocation decisions based on 3 recently published articles

 four fundamental values have been proposed by emanuel et al12 maximizing benefits produced by scarce resourcestreating people equallyproviding and rewarding instrumental value a person with instrumental value is one who saves othersgiving priority to the worst off worst off refers not only to the sickest but also to those who have the most to lose in the long term if they die such as young people
 emanuel et al
12
 constructed 6 recommendations from these 4 ethical values 
benefits should be maximized save the most lives and maximize improvements in individual posttreatment length of lifepriority for allocation is given to healthcare workers and others in the front lines of carethere should be a random allocation for patients with similar prognosesdifferent prioritization per intervention may arise in response to changing scientific evidencesome priority should be given to individuals who participate in research to prove the safety and effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutics this criterion should be used as a tie breaker in patients with similar prognosesthere should be no differentiation in allocating resources between patients with covid19 and those with other medical conditions
 the principles and recommendations referenced above are not universally accepted are the subject of ongoing discussion and are presented here to illustrate some of the issues being debated in clinical ethics prioritization of frontline workers 2 for example raises issues of privilege similarly if the prognosis of covid19 acute respiratory distress syndrome ards is different from other forms of ards codification of a similar distribution of resources 6 ignores medical judgment translating and implementing the resource allocation recommendations require input from clinicians ethicists religious leaders administrators lawyers public and patient representatives and other interested parties they should work in a multidisciplinary or crossfunctioning fashion in which the focus is on the function of the team rather than who carries out the function there is no onesizefitsall approach in planning the development and implementation of allocating resources because of the heterogeneity of geographic locations hospital or institution size and affiliations each institution should develop their protocols to be adaptable to their environment and available personnel the protocols should be evidence based and as objective as possible to assure just treatment and uniformity to all ideally allocation decisions should be based on highquality prognostic assessments several scoring systems have been developed to assist in the process all are limited one such example developed by white and colleagues at the university of pittsburgh proposed and implemented a priority score possible scores being 18 for patients with critical illness based on the concept of maximizing benefits for the largest numbers of the population

 this system considers both surviving to hospital discharge and the likelihood of achieving longterm survival the shortterm survival scores range from 1 to 4 and are based on physiological parameters such as the sequential organ failure assessment sofa score longterm survival scores are assigned 2 points for those with major conditions and 4 points for those with serious lifelimiting conditions with expected survival  1 year low scores indicate more favorable prognoses than high scores figure 1 the implementation of such objective strategies requires an initial assessment and frequent reassessment of a patients condition there is significant controversy about substituting clinical judgment with a scoring system however disagreement between scoring and clinical judgment may be attenuated through use of multidisciplinary teams for adjudication the role of nutrition support professionals in the deliberations of resource allocation cannot be underestimated although decisions regarding nutrition support do not equate in gravity with the finality of those dealing with forgoing either withholding or withdrawing ventilatory support the nutrition support professionals are pivotal in assessing the patients overall condition and need for if any nutrition interventions nutrition support professionals can recommend changes in volume composition and routes of nutrition support as well as help cluster care to limit how many times a nurse must go in the room of a covid19infected patient to accommodate limited or no resources nutrition support professionals should also be involved in the process of scarce nutrition support resource allocation for example if a hospital has fewer numbers of enteral nutrition en pumps or supplies than there are patients requiring pumpassisted feedings the nutrition support professionals would need to provide guidance on enpump allocation en pumps may need to be prioritized for the patients with critical illness who cannot safely receive or tolerate gravity or intermittent feedings once pumps and supplies are freely available pumpassisted en could resume for all patients who would ordinarily receive this mode of feeding nutrition support professionals should be represented in bioethics committees discussed below when nutrition issues arise recommendations by the nutrition support professionals or a nutrition support team should be guided by the benefitvsriskburden evaluation the nutrition support professionals should communicate with peers in other institutions in their communities to reach consensus on protocols thus adding to strength and uniformity of such approaches ethical dilemmas related to the care of patients in the covid19 pandemic need to be rapidly addressed by multidisciplinary bioethics committees with the development of policies and procedures to assist providers in making difficult allocation decisions contingencies relating policies to the conditions of scarcity must be included in other words policies for rationing scarce resources should apply only during times of scarcity what defines scarcity can also be controversial for example if everyone who needs a ventilator is on a machine but patienttonurse ratios are twice normal and machines not intended for critical care ventilation are being used care is nonstandard as a result of limited resources it would be reasonable to consider this a condition of scarcity although this type of scarcity is highly unlikely to affect nutrition care in the hospital it is illustrative nutrition support resource scarcity could include limited enteral formulas parenteral solutions feeding tubes and related supplies as well as enteral and parenteral pumps triage committees should be created based on recommendations from bioethics committees with input from hospital legal consultants and administration and become activated once scarcity has been declared the triage committee is not a new concept such groups were formed in the 1960s when decisions had to be made regarding who would receive hemodialysis
14
 these committees were composed of physicians nurses ethicists community representatives and other interested parties however because of the volume and speed with which decisions are anticipated during a pandemic a small facile team may be desirable difficult allocation decisions should fall to these multidisciplinary triage teams rather than the primary treatment team to alleviate any concerns about preferential treatment or bias these teams should contain at a minimum a clinical ethicist and clinicians familiar with the treatment of covid19 andor critical illness to make the process as fair and transparent as possible the criteria used to make decisions should also be transparent because of the nature of decisions related to allocation of scarce resources the media is likely to pay close attention to the actions of each hospital similarly regulators and lawmakers may be risk averse in allowing healthcare facilities more autonomy in allocation of scarce resources for example based on new york state law nutrition support cannot be withheld without a patients permission or that of their surrogate
15
 temporarily suspending that law could create a profound public response healthcare facility bioethics committees are well advised to rapidly form regional consortia to ensure regional homogeneity in policy and to provide stronger representation of the ethical needs of the healthcare enterprise to regulators and lawmakers critical thinking is crucial in preventing ethics dilemmas and to assist in healthcare decisionmaking with a focus on achieving patientcentered care
16
 advance care planning acp is recommended for all individuals aged 18 years it becomes more essential during crises such as covid19 than during noncrisis times healthcare professionals should take the lead and complete their own acp documents the healthcare team should encourage the public and their patients to complete acp documents and advance directives advance directives should be updated as warranted and considered as a patients plan of care is formulated with the patientfamily existing advance directives should be reviewed to ensure specific language addressing the potential of resource allocation is included helpful resources for acp are available online

 respecting the patients or surrogate decisionmakers autonomy is still of importance even in the face of shortages a thorough approach to obtaining advance directives might alleviate some of the burden on scarce resources although removal from lifesustaining treatment lst is not considered to be ethically or legally different from withholding lst thus the term forgoing removal is undoubtedly more emotionally laden in the case of nutrition support clear prognostic discussions and advance directives may preclude the initiation of en or pn that is not felt to offer qualityoflife or quantityoflife benefit discussions regarding donotresuscitate orders particularly when held urgently are emotionally laden for all involved curtis et al proposed the concept of informed assent instead of informed consent
21
 rather than requiring the patient andor family to take responsibility for the decision the clinician requests from them permission to allow the clinician attending physician to assume that responsibility a welldocumented process for obtaining informed assent was previously published

 in addition specific steps in conducting criticalcrucial conversations have been described previously

 legal considerations make up the third component of the troubling trichotomy although the likelihood of legal civil or criminal penalties may be minimal under pandemic or crisis medical care such concerns and potentials exist
22
 forgoing interventions without a patients consent or assent under normal circumstances can result in a civil claim of negligence or unintentional tort harm following standardized protocols such as using the abcd rule may attenuate the risk the abcd rule suggests the following steps accepting the patient for whom there has been a breach of duty by violating the applicable standard of care causing the related damage or harm
23
 
24
 the likelihood of holding a clinician or institution liable for forgoing a critical intervention eg ventilators nutrition support which leads to harm without a patients consent is minimized when such actions are the result of uniformly applied triage protocols state and federal immunities exist in some instances for physicians nurses and other practitioners during emergencies but may fall short on specifics the vewpoint of cohen et al
22
 points out the urgent need for action by state governments to expand and clarify current immunity statutes to include the use of protocols during emergency and pandemic situations the impact of the covid19 pandemic will be long lasting dealing with scarce resources is already a reality and may yet become far worse in areas hardest hit resource scarcity may become more widespread and likely more severe if preventive measures such as physical distancing are eased prematurely and testing fails to halt the spread based on previously established and accepted ethical principles and values several systems for quantitative triage have been proposed using the objective criteria nutrition support clinicians should make appropriate recommendations regarding nutrition interventions based on anticipated benefit availability of products cost and risk to providers patients and families should be encouraged to update or executecreate advance directives based on appropriate prognostic evaluations although there may be legal concerns about actions taken during the pandemic the likelihood of actual liability charges is minimized through appropriate policymaking and uniform application of policy that is regionally homogenous and accepted of law makers because of the uncertainty of the course of the covid19 pandemic for which there is currently no cure or vaccine ethical protocols should be viewed as living documents or a work in progress  predictive mathematical models for the number of individuals infected with covid-19 a fokas s n dikaios g kastis a  we model the time-evolution of the number nt of individuals reported to be infected in a given country with a specific virus in terms of a riccati equation although this equation is nonlinear and it contains time-dependent coefficients it can be solved in closed form yielding an expression for nt that depends on a function t for the particular case that t is constant this expression reduces to the well-known logistic formula giving rise to a sigmoidal curve suitable for modelling usual epidemics however for the case of the covid-19 pandemic the long series of available data shows that the use of this simple formula for predictions underestimates nt thus the logistic formula only provides a lower bound of nt after experimenting with more than 50 different forms of t we introduce two novel models that will be referred to as rational and birational the parameters specifying these models as well as those of the logistic model are determined from the available data using an errorminimizing algorithm the analysis of the applicability of the above models to the cases of china and south korea suggest that they yield more accurate predictions and importantly that they may provide an upper bound of the actual nt results are presented for italy spain and france  the novel coronavirus 2019-ncov initially emerged in wuhan china at the end of 2019 it is the third coronavirus to appear in the human population in the past two decades following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov outbreak in 2002 and the middle east syndrome coronavirus mers-cov outbreak in 2012 china responded quickly to this outbreak by informing the world health organization also after chinese scientists identified the sequence of the causative virus 1  this information was immediately shared with the international community furthermore china took effective measures for the containment of the spread of this outbreak the 2019-ncov is less pathogenic than the earlier two coronaviruses 2  for example in the first case of pneumonia caused by this virus reported in usa a 35-years-old healthy individual who had travelled in wuhan presented in a hospital four days after he experienced dry cough and low grade fever he proceeded to develop pneumonia 5 days later but quickly recovered 3  this is the typical disease course for young persons however the 2019-ncov has a significant mortality rate for elderly persons and for those with a variety of underlying medical conditions including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases as well as diabetes mellitus furthermore this virus is highly contagious as a result of these facts and the lack of appropriate early international measures for the suppression of its spread it has now caused a pandemic this pandemic represents the most serious global public health threat since the devastating 1918 h1n1 influenza pandemic justifiably several countries have adopted draconian measures to combat this threat the scientific community in addition to its accelerated efforts to develop an effective treatment and a vaccination is also playing an important role in advising policy makers of possible non-pharmacological approaches to limit the catastrophic impact of the pandemic for example two possible strategies called mitigation and suppression are thoroughly discussed in the important paper 4  in the early stages of the pandemic uk was following mitigation but after the publication of this report is now following suppression the main goal of this paper is to develop suitable mathematical models for predicting the time evolution of the cumulative number nt of the individuals reported to be infected in a given country by covid-19 these models can be used for predicting several features of the epidemic such as the time that a plateau will be reached as well as the total number of individuals reported to be infected at that time here the plateau is defined as the time when the rate of change of the people reported to be infected is 5 of the maximum rate of infection we introduce two novel models called rational and birational the important advantage of these models is that they provide more accurate predictions for the characteristics of the plateau also importantly the birational model may provide an upper bound of nt and hence it is preferable to the rational one however the rational model can be constructed sooner than the birational one the input needed for the rational model is data until around the time t when the maximum rate of infection occurs the corresponding point on the curve describing nt is known as the inflection point on the other hand the birational model requires data for several more additional days assuming that the number of individuals reported to be infected is a timeinvariant percentage of the actual number of infected persons the model discussed here should be useful for long-term planning strategy and for reassuring the public a prerequisite for the development of any accurate model is the existence of appropriate data for the pandemic of covid-19 such data are already available there exist a long series of data from china and south korea where their covid-19 epidemics are passed the plateau italy spain and france passed the inflection point several days ago and uk has now also passed this point the total reported cases of the above countries as well as of greece where the situation is better and usa where it is worse are shown in figure 1 estimated rates of change new reported cases for italy spain france and uk are plotted in figure 2 these graphs show that in all countries except greece the growth of the epidemics is similar for the first approximately 10 days after the day that the number of infected persons reached 500 however following this period the behaviour of the epidemics is different presumably reflecting the type of measures and the time that these measures were implemented in each country according to our definition china reached the plateau around march 2 2020 and south korea around april 13 2020 the mathematical modelling of epidemics has a long and illustrious history it began with the kermack-mckendrick model introduced in 1927 5  in this pioneering paper the population is divided into susceptible infectious and recovered removed sub-populations then specific ordinary differential equations are formulated specifying the time evolution of the functions representing these populations the above work was certainly ahead of its time it was rediscovered in the 1980s and since then it has provided the basis for a variety of deterministic models known as sir models in particular rigorous mathematical results for such models are derived in 6  the extension of sir to models involving partial differential equations is presented in 7  statistical models have also been highly effective for modelling aspects of epidemics in what follows we first postulate a general model for the accumulative number nt of individuals reported at time t to be infected by a viral epidemic we assume that the function nt satisfies the ordinary differential equation this is a riccati equation that is specified by the time dependent function t and the constant parameter nf the function t and the parameter nf depend on the basic characteristics of the particular virus and on the cumulative effect of the variety of different measures taken by the given country for the prevention of the spread of the viral infection the dependence of t on time reflects various time-dependent factors including the fact that the effect of the different measures taken by the government depends on t the case of tconstant can be considered as an ideal case remarkably although 1 is a nonlinear equation depending on time-dependent coefficients it can be solved in closed form its solution depends on t the constant parameter nf and the constant of integration  in the particular case that t is a constant denoted by  equations 2 yield the classical logistic formula    interestingly this simple formula is adequate for capturing the evolution nt of typical viral epidemics for example determining the three constant parameters   and nf of equation 3 with data from the ebola virus epidemic of 2014 in guinea we find the excellent fit depicted in figure 3  importantly the above parameters remain essentially unchanged if we use a smaller set of data for their determination which shows that the logistic model could also have been used for predictive purposes throughout this paper the unknown parameters are determined by employing an error-minimizing algorithm described in section 2  ebola outbreak of guinea in 2014 predicted vs actual for the total cumulative number of individuals reported to be infected as a function of days after the day that 500 cases were reported the logistic formula given by equation 3 gives an excellent fit for the actual data as it will be shown in section 3 the simple formula 3 also provides a good fit of the covid-19 pandemic however the long series of existing data of the epidemics of china and south korea shows that the logistic model does not provide accurate predictions for example figure  6a shows that if we use a subset of the existing data of the epidemic in south korea for the determination of the parameters of the logistic model and then compare the resulting graph of nt with the available data we find that the logistic model underestimates nt thus the logistic model provides a lower bound of the actual nt this raises the following natural questions first is it possible to find a model yielding more accurate predictions than the logistic model and second is it possible to construct a model that overestimates nt which would then provide an upper bound of the actual nt after experimenting with more than 50 different forms of t we have obtained affirmative answers to both of the above questions we have introduced two novel models which will be referred to as rational and birational in the former model the exponential function appearing in equation 3 is replaced by a rational function in the birational model the values of the parameters specifying this rational function change depending on whether t is larger or smaller than a parameter denoted by x in order to evaluate the above two novel models and to establish their capacity for quantitative predictions in comparison to the logistic model we implemented the following steps i for the epidemics of china south korea italy spain and france we computed the value of t this value shows that for the above countries the date of april 26 which is the last day that we have analyzed the data for nt and for its derivative corresponds respectively to t77 t51 t26 t24 and t22 ii for the epidemics of china and south korea we fitted the data for nt with the logistic rational and birational models in addition for china we plotted the relevant fit for the derivative of nt from theses graphs it became clear that after t around 59 days march 20 2020 the effect of a second wave of reported infections became apparent thus for the epidemic of china we limited our analysis until t59 thus we fitted the three models using data only until t59 iii in order to establish the predictive capacity of the rational and birational models in comparison to the logistic model we determined the parameters of these three models for the epidemic in south korea by using data only up to t37 this date corresponds to the date of april 26 for spain and it differs only by two days with the date that corresponds to france and italy the rational and birational model provided respectively a lower and upper bound of the actual nt furthermore the rational model gave a better lower bound than the logistic model the analogous results for china are discussed in section 3 this analysis provides support of our speculation that the birational model can be used for predicting an upper bound for the actual nt using data until april 26 2020 we found the following dates and number of reported cases may provide upper bounds for the characteristics of the plateaus in italy spain and france june14 2020 244199 reported individuals may 19 2020 225267 reported individuals may 20 2020 138151 reported individuals let f denote the relative infectivity of the epidemic defined by   4 we assume that f is a linear time-dependent function of n let the constant nf denote the final cumulative number of individuals reported to be infected taking into consideration that f vanishes when n nf we have inserting equation 5 in the definition 4 we find the basic equation modelling this situation namely the riccati equation 1 the particular case of a riccati equation with constant coefficients corresponding to the case that  is constant has appeared in a variety of dynamic processes including the modelling of epidemics indeed in the classical sir model mentioned in the introduction if one assumes that r0 then after replacing in the first order differential equation satisfied by i s with i-t where the constant t denotes the total population one finds a riccati equation of the form 3 where t is replaced by a constant another notable example of the appearance of a constant coefficients riccati equation in the mathematical modelling of infectious processes can be found in the paper of anderson and may 9  this work describes the dynamic interaction of parasites with their host-environment in this paper whose impact in the field of mathematical biology was far reaching 10  a riccati equation is formulated that involves a single constant parameter it should be noted that certain optimal features of the dynamics of the sir model are also characterised by a riccati equation that involves three independent functions of time 6  in order to solve the riccati equation 1 we first use the independent change of variables specified by the second of equations 2  this gives rise to an equation similar to equation 1 all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by peer review is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 6 2020  indeed substituting equation 6 into the above constant coefficients riccati equation and simplifying we find   solving this equation substituting the resulting expression in equation 6 and simplifying we find the first expression in equation 2 we expect that the validity of the above model improves as t increases thus we avoid evaluating equation 6 at 0 to express  in terms of nf and n at 0 instead we determine  by matching the expression obtained from the first of equations 2 with the actual data an important information provided by the above model is the time t when the maximum rate of infection is achieved computing the second derivative of the right-hand side of the first of equations 2  and requiring that the resulting expression vanishes we find that t satisfies the equation where throughout this paper prime denoted differentiation with respect to time using the above expression in the exponential occurring in the expressions for n and evaluated at tt we find for the logistic model we have t  thus equations 8 yield taking into consideration that the logistic model is a good approximation of the relevant dynamic process the above value of t provides an approximate value for the time that the inflection point is reached the rational and birational models are defined respectively as follows all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by peer review is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 6 2020   with x in the neighbourhood of t the birational model is based on the natural assumption that the parameters of the rational function specifying the function nt are different before and after t it is quite satisfying that this very simple model yields the best fits among more than 50 models that were tested among those models were several fractal models in the simplest such model the exponent kt in the logistic formula was replaced with kt   letting in equation 11   we find by comparing equations 10 and 11 with the first of equations 2 it is straightforward to determine t for both the rational and the birational models for the rational model for the birational model if b c d k are close to b1 c1 d1 k1 then nf is close to c1 and hence the value of t after x is close to the value of t before x computing the second derivative of the right-hand side of equation 10 and equating the resulting expression to zero we find that the value of t for the rational model is characterized by the equation similarly for the birational model where the parameters b d k are replaced with b1 d1 k1 respectively replacing the rational function in the expressions for n and of its derivative with the rational function of equation 13 we find that for the rational model similar expressions are valid for the birational model all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by peer review is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 6 2020  we arranged the data in the form of individuals n reported to be infected over time measured in days after the day that the number of cases reached 500 all evaluated models were fitted using the simplex algorithm which is an iterative procedure that does not need information regarding the derivative of the function under consideration the algorithm creates a random simplex of n  1 points where n is the number of the model parameters that need to be estimated the simplex changes iteratively by reflection expansion and contraction steps until it finds the model parameters that minimize the given likelihood function the constrained variation of the simplex algorithm 12 13 available in matlab  was used for all tested models an l1-norm was employed in the likelihood function to improve robustness 14  the simplex algorithm is particularly effective for cases where the gradient of the likelihood functions is not easy to calculate random parameter initializations were used to avoid local minima the simplex algorithm was chosen because it performed better than the nonlinear least-squares curve fitting algorithms evaluated in this work namely the levenberg-marquardt 15 and the trust-region-reflective 16 algorithms the stability of the fitting procedure was established by using the following simple criterion different fitting attempts based on the use of a fixed number of data points must yield curves which have the same form beyond the above fixed points the fitting accuracy of each model was evaluated by fitting the associated formula on all the available data in a specified set the relevant parameters specifying the logistic rational and birational models are given on table 1 we first computed the inflection point for china south korea italy spain and france this occurred respectively at t19 t13 t33 t25 and t29 see table 1  this corresponds to february 2 march 6 march 31 april 2 and april 4 2020 respectively for computing t we require the time that the derivative of n becomes maximum for this purpose we used the model with the best fit in the neighborhood of the inflection point which in all cases turned out to be the birational model figures 4 and 5 show that the logistic rational and birational formulas provide accurate fits for the available data for the epidemics of china and south korea however by carefully scrutinizing the situation of the china epidemic it became clear that after around t59 the effect of a second wave of reported infections begins to have an effect thus whereas for south korea we used all the data up to our cut of date of april 26 2020 to fit the 3 models for china we used data only until t59 it is important to emphasize that whereas each of the three equations 3 10 and 11 can fit the data quite well the predictive capacity of these formulas is not the same this is best illustrated by using the epidemic of south korea figure 6a shows the fits of the above equations using data only up to t37 which corresponds approximately to the date of april 26 2020 of the epidemics of italy spain and france it is clear that each of the above equations gives a different curve furthermore the rational and birational models provide a lower and upper all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified

experimented with different values of x for all such values the birational curve was above the rational curve however in order to obtain a curve that is above the actual nt it was necessary to choose xt9 since it is important to have an upper bound we propose the following strategy for the choice of x choose the value of x in the vicinity of t which yields the uppermost curve the analogous results for china are shown in figure 6b  now since t43 is already in the stable sigmoidal part of the curve of the actual data the three curves corresponding to the logistic rational and birational models are very close to each other and to the curve of the actual data importantly the birational curve is above the curve of the actual data thus the birational model as with the case of the south korea provides an upper bound for nt regarding the birational model for the cases of italy and spain the uppermost curves were obtained by using xt whereas for france for xt-3 all rights reserved no reuse

data from china in the period january 11 to february 10 2020 is used in 19 to estimate the associated per day infection mortality and recovery rates iv in 20  by combining a stochastic model for the covid-19 infection with the knowledge of data from china during january and february 2020 the probability that newly introduced cases might generate new outbreaks is calculated v in 21  an sidr model

require critical care 308 and individuals who require critical care 132 seasonal variations were incorporated by allowing the basic reproduction number to be a time-dependent function following a cosine curve that peaks in early december here we have modelled the cumulative number n of persons reported to be infected by covid-19 in a given country as a function of time in terms of the riccati equation 1  although this equation is a nonlinear ordinary differential equation containing time dependent coefficients it was solved in closed form yielding 2  for appropriately chosen functions t the first of equations 2 provides a flexible generalization of the classical logistic formula that has been employed in a great variety of applications including the modelling of infectious processes the fact that  is now a function of t has important implications in particular it made it possible to construct the rational and birational models which at least for the epidemics of china and south korea provide respectively were able to provide more accurate predictions furthermore the birational model provided an upper bound of the actual nt this suggests that the methodology introduced in our work may be used for providing bounds of important aspects of the current pandemic for example it can provide reasonable estimates for the time that the plateau will be reached as well as the number of persons that will be reported to be infected at that time the approach presented here has several novel and useful features i for the case that an infection that has been stabilized any of the three models analyzed here can be used for the evolution of the cumulative number of persons reported to be infected via a simple analytical expression this expression can be used for a variety of purposes ii more importantly the rational and birational models can be used for predictive purposes providing accurate estimates for the characteristics of the plateau iii our approach has the capacity for increasing continuously the accuracy of the predictions as soon as the epidemic in a given country passes the time t the rational model can be used furthermore when the sigmoidal part of the curve is approached the rational model can be supplemented with the birational model a simple criterion of checking whether the birational model can be used is given in section 21 also as more data become available the parameters of the rational and of the birational models can be re-evaluated this will yield better predictions iv the riccati equation 1 together with the flexibility of the arbitrariness of t offer the possibility of deciphering basic physiological mechanisms dictating the evolution of nt in particular following the transient stage of the epidemic it may be envisioned that t becomes a function of n instead of a function of t by plotting  in terms of n is possible to scrutinize a posteriori their relationship we find that after t approximately equal to t-7 the relation between the relation between  and n500 is remarkably linear see figure 8 how can the apparent success of the simple approached followed in our work can be explained presumably the constant nf defining equation 1 the constant of integration  entering the associated solution and the constant parameters specifying the function t must capture the essence of the underlying time-evolution process this suggests that the cumulative effects of a variety of different mechanisms express themselves via the few parameters entering in the explicit solution formulas 3 10 and 11 in this connection it is worth recalling that the single parameter characterizing the riccati equation of the celebrated anderson-may model mentioned earlier represents the cumulative effect of different biological mechanisms it is shown in 9 that this constant can be expressed in terms of the population size parameter h the mortality rate of uninfected hosts parameter b the mortality rate of infected hosts parameter   b and the rate at which infected hosts recover and become susceptible parameter  an additional partial explanation of the success of our approach is that it shares the same philosophy employed by the powerful technique of artificial intelligence known as machine learning indeed the explicit formulas 3 10 and 11 used in this work can be thought of as algorithms where given t they predict n these algorithms are characterized by several parameters which are fixed by the knowledge of the data thus the more data are available the better this algorithm learns how to make accurate predictions hence choosing these parameters by requiring that the analytical solution matches the data curve is consistent with the approach of machine learning this point is further explored in n dikaios a s fokas and g a kastis deep learning for predicting aspects of the covad-19 pandemic in preparation taking into consideration the ubiquitous use of the logistic model and the fact that equations 10 and 11 provide variations of the logistic formula these equations may be useful for the modelling of a variety of phenomena all rights reserved no reuse allowed without

may 6 2020  the fact that two different viral infections namely covid-19 and ebola are modelled by the same ordinary differential equation suggests that the riccati equation 1 proposed here plays a generic role in the modelling of viral epidemics it is worth noting that the so-called burgers equation which is an evolution partial differential combining the generic effects of diffusion and nonlinear convection admits a travelling wave solution that satisfies the riccati equation 1 in the case that t is a constant  this constant specifies the speed of propagation of the traveling wave whereas nf is free parameter appearing in burgers equation hence the mathematical analysis presented in this work may also be relevant for some of the phenomena modelled by appropriate generalizations

 an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 began in wuhan hubei province china in december 2019 1 the genetic characteristics of sars-cov-2 have proven to be significantly different from human sars cov and middle eastern respiratory syndrome mers cov 2 common signs of sars-cov-2 infection include respiratory symptoms fever cough shortness of breath and breathing difficulties in more severe cases infection can cause pneumonia severe acute respiratory syndrome organ failure and even death 1 the virus is highly infectious spreading rapidly via human-to-human transmission as of march 12 2020 there were 80981 confirmed cases in china 3173 deaths and 44067 cases in 117 countriesterritoriesareas outside china 1440 deaths 3 currently there are no approved antiviral therapies for covid-19 the world health organization who has now declared the coronavirus a global pandemic when responding to the covid-19 pandemic medical services are under great pressure an effective coordinated pharmacy support system and event-driven pharmaceutical care activities are needed mobile cabin hospitals the square cabin hospitals have been built in wuhan china the epidemic epicenter in china to treat patients with mild symptoms of the virus pharmacists are actively engaging in the public health operation in china since the outbreak either at their home hospitals and community pharmacies or at the square cabin hospitals in wuhan the chinese pharmacy profession has gained valuable experiences through providing essential support to the public health operation in this commentary we share our experiences of providing pharmacy services combating coronavirus in china to disseminate what we have learned to the international pharmacy society the timely supply of preventive and treatment medications and the provision of event-driven pharmaceutical care are critical to support and enhance public health emergency operations during the coronavirus pandemic specifically pharmacy needs to work with other healthcare organizations professionals and government agencies to address the following seven service needs 1 drafting professional service guidances to pharmacists and pharmacies 2 establishing emergency drug formularies based on treatment guidelines 3 coordinating with drug companies and distributors to ensure adequate supply storage and transport of identified formulary drugs 4 providing event-driven pharmaceutical care 5 establishing remote pharmacy services to reduce the incidence of human-to-human infections 6 educating the public with a focus on infection prevention and disease management and 7 involving in clinical trial research to screen evaluate and develop antiviral medications in line with national and international guidelines 4 additionally pharmacists must learn how to protect themselves from getting infected as well in the next section we share the pharmacys responses in meeting the needs of pharmacy services in china during the epidemic to outline the roles that pharmacists in community hospital and other diverse healthcare settings can play in preventing the spread of covid-19 and supporting the efficient management of infection by healthcare systems the chinese pharmaceutical association cpa published a separate expert consensus the coronavirus sars-cov-2 infection expert consensus on hospital pharmaceutical work guidance and prevention and control strategies and the coronavirus sars-cov-2 infection expert consensus on work guidance and prevention and control strategies for retail pharmacies 5 6 based on these two consensus documents the coronavirus 2019-ncov outbreak information and interim guidelines for pharmacists and the pharmacy workforce international guidelines have been drafted by the international pharmaceutical federation fip with the participation of the cpa the document gives reliable information on 2019-ncov and covers preventive measures from how to wear a mask to effective disinfection what equipment to stock advice that pharmacists can give and appropriate laboratory testing the document is downloadable in the six official united nations languages on the fip website 7 the department of pharmacy at xiangya hospital central south university proposed to develop a pharmacy emergency support guarantee system within a public health response operation a novel initiative in chinese public health fig 1 the pharmacy system aims to establish mechanisms to address drug shortages through surveillance early warnings drug emergency supply and distribution monitoring the safe use of medications and event-driven pharmaceutical care during the coronavirus epidemic 4 concurrently the xiangya hospital pharmacy department also published a reference book pharmacy service guarantee support for the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia the book provides pharmacists with evidence-based information and standardized operation protocols during the prevention and control of the epidemic there is currently no specific vaccine and no effective antiviral therapy against sars-cov-2 the china national health commission cnhc has released the diagnosis and treatment guidelines for the new coronavirus infected pneumonia the cnhc guidelines currently in its sixth update 8 the cnhc guidelines suggest the use of antiviral drugs -interferon lopinavirritonavir ribavirin chloroquine umifenovir and traditional chinese medicines tcms for treatment although these therapies may not be recommended by the who their treatment roles are based on past experiences during the sars outbreak in china in 2003 with the consideration of lack of drug therapies to treat the coronavirus the cnhc guidelines recommend eight tcm injections for severe and critical cases for severe cases xiyanping xuebijing reduning tanreqing and xingnaojing injections are recommended for critical cases three additional tcm injections can be considered shenfu shengmai and shenmai to assist clinicians in better understanding and prescribing these drugs pharmacists applied evidence-based medication use evaluation approaches to collect and summarize drug information with these recommended drugs the hunan pharmaceutical association and the chinese hospital association pharmaceutical committee each separately compiled the drug information for the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia and the drug formulary in square cabin hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic both prescription including resuscitation drugs and over-the-counter otc medication shortages may occur drugs may also be in short supply due to production disruptions for various reasons pharmacists and pharmacies must conduct active surveillance and establish early warning mechanisms to address drug shortages in a timely manner the american society of health-system pharmacists ashp guidelines on managing drug product shortages and a published provincial drug shortage surveillance and early warning platform in hunan china can be referenced and adapted to create local regional and national platforms to manage prescription drug shortages during a pandemic 9 10 figure 2 shows the proposed prescription drug shortage surveillance and early warning mechanism community pharmacies and pharmacists should pay equal attention to potential shortages of otc drugs this is especially important due to an increase in the public buying otcs to treat the symptoms of the illness fever cough and shortness of breath from the advice of healthcare professionals and public agencies event-driven pharmaceutical care is provided to covid-19 patients in china during the epidemic the event-driven pharmaceutical care goes beyond routine activities medication review prescribing support and patient counseling three characteristics of the event-driven pharmaceutical care are 1 ensuring the appropriate use of off-label drugs many drugs recommended in the cnhc guidelines are used off-label pharmacists conduct literature evaluations and publish guidances for the off-label use of these drugs adverse drug reactions of some of these drugs are similar to the symptoms of the coronavirus disease such as fatigue fever and flu-like symptoms with -interferon it is necessary for pharmacists to assist in evaluating the efficacy and safety of these drugs and to monitor adverse drug reactions the pathological anatomy of the first patient with a covid-19 related death showed liver damage 11 which was either drug-induced or caused by the sars-cov-2 pharmacists are reminded to monitor drugs that may cause liver damage and to adjust drug dosing based on the patients liver function 2 ensuring the rational use of tcms the cnhc guidelines recommend the use of tcms for the coronavirus treatment preliminary evidence shows that integrating tcms and western medicines for covid-19 can improve the clinical cure rate and reduce the rate of disease progression from common infection type to severe type 12 however it is worth noting that the current research of tcms is based on clinical observations and is mostly used for patients with mild symptoms pharmacists with specialized training in tcm are confronted with preparing tcm formulations providing drug information to physicians and tcm pharmaceutical care for patients pharmacists should warn physicians about any interactions between tcms and western medicines when these drugs are prescribed for example the combination of hanshi yufei decoction and antipyretic analgesics can cause excessive sweating and even dehydration some proprietary tcms contain western medicine ingredients such as pipa lu a strong antitussive contains 015 mg of morphine per milliliter serotonin syndrome may occur when pipa lu is administered with monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as linezolid and 3 providing online real-time clinical support to frontline physicians and pharmacists working at the epidemic epi-center wechat the largest social communication mobile platform in china groups are established by pharmacy experts and pharmacists in china to provide clinical support for front-line pharmacists in hubei the epi-center of the coronavirus outbreak these chat groups create accessible drug use platforms by engaging in pharmacotherapy consultation through information and resource sharing in real-time in order to effectively reduce overcrowding and block the spread of the virus through person-to-person transmission during the coronavirus epidemic medical institutions across china have launched remote pharmacy services such as online drug prescribing drug consultation and drug delivery services for example the pharmacy department of xiangya hospital central south university created an online remote pharmacy service via wechat pharmacists provide patients with free medication consultation and education allowing patients to purchase medications online and arrange for home drug delivery the implementation of these remote pharmacy services provides out-of-hospital pharmaceutical care access and helps to reduce the risk of cross-infection during unnecessary hospital visits the positive effects of these remote services on patient care during the epidemic is helpful for pharmacy to further establish its professional role in china during an epidemic false information and rumors can generate serious negative effects when the public cannot access timely authoritative and scientific information regarding the epidemic 13 for example after the media in china reported that shuanghuanglian a tcm that contains extracts from the dried fruit of forsythiae fructus inhibits sars-cov-2 in vitro it sparked panic buying of this medication online and offline the mass of people assembling to purchase this oral solution increased the risk of human-to-human disease transmission similarly after the media reported that chloroquine phosphate can inhibit sars-cov-2 in vitro there were reports of a female patient who was not infected with sars-cov-2 but self-medicated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets 18 g 24 h the patient subsequently developed mental disorders and cardiac arrhythmias requiring hospitalization in an intensive care unit these incidences demonstrate that it is necessary for pharmacists and pharmacy associations to engage in public education to disseminate reliable authoritative information to the public and guide the publics rational thinking and behavior during the coronavirus epidemic to this end the chinese pharmacists association and the chinese pharmacological society released the expert consensus guidance on the rational drug administration and home drug therapy during an epidemic 14 a large number of popular science articles on coronavirus infection prevention and treatment and on home medication use during an epidemic have been written by pharmacists and published over the internet with the hope of decreasing drug-related problems the need to provide education to particular population subgroups homeless prisoners etc should be addressed it is important to note that the impact of these public education activities depends on the public trust of pharmacists and pharmacy as a profession currently more than 80 clinical trials have been registered in the chinese clinical registry to test for a coronavirus treatment during the first week of february china launched two placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir slated to include 760 people with covid-19 the studies should be completed by the end of april 2020 a few trials have started to test chloroquine an antimalarial drug that killed off the sars-cov-2 in cell cultures researchers are studying whether steroids diminish inflammation in people with severe covid-19 or cause harm another 300-person controlled trial is aimed to test whether serum antibodies from covid-19 survivors could rapidly help someone newly infected with the sars-cov-2 virus fifteen trials listed in chinas registry expect to enroll a total of more than 2000 people in studies on a variety of tcms including the largest trial assessing shuanghuanglian with 400 participants 15 pharmacists are actively cooperating with research sponsors in the management of clinical trials including the proper supply use storage and disposal of experimental drugs in compliance with relevant clinical trial regulations pharmacists are also actively conducting pharmaceutical evaluations on the efficacy and safety of related trial drugs in summary during the coronavirus epidemic in china the chinese pharmacy profession has acted swiftly and forcefully with the above seven responses the impact of these measures needs to be further evaluated especially the several responses that rely on the public trust of pharmacy as a profession in china the epidemic of covid-19 is quickly evolving and the prevention and treatment pose great challenges to pharmacy services although chinese pharmacists have made significant contributions to the public health operation in fighting the epidemic the epidemic exposes a series of threats that we should face directly the first is that the number of frontline pharmacists is inadequate for example there are nearly 1000 beds in a square cabin hospital equipped with nearly 200 drugs including antiviral drugs rescue drugs and drugs used in the respiratory digestive and cardiovascular systems however only three to five pharmacists are stationed at each square cabin hospital pharmacists are undertaking dual responsibilities in the process of drug supply and management and pharmaceutical care it is not possible for a pharmacist to be able to provide quality essential pharmacy services with these heavy workloads second the lack of pharmacist consultations can lead to an overutilization and inappropriate use of antibacterial medications some doctors routinely prescribe covid-19 patients antibiotics such as quinolones or cephalosporins in the absence of a diagnosed bacterial infection this prescribing behavior increases the risk of microbial resistance and adverse reactions third most research manuscripts related to the coronavirus pharmacy services were written in chinese and published in chinese journals thus they cannot easily be shared with the international pharmacy community fourth although many drugs are being studied in clinical trials the design and quality of these clinical trials should be properly monitored many trials contain levels of bias such as small sample size and lack of control randomization and objective outcome evaluation criteria as a result these clinical trials are wasting valuable resources and will be unable to provide high-quality evidence of treatment efficacy and safety in response the china state council issued the notice on standardizing medical institutions to conduct clinical research on new coronavirus pneumonia drug therapy 16 the notice aimed to screen more effective drugs through standardized scientific orderly and efficient clinical drug research the first point is to further clarify the conditions for conducting research for example the drugs used for clinical research should be a marketed drug that has been validated by in vitro and animal experiments the second point is to further standardize the research process with regards to ethical review and record-keeping and hospitals should perform quality control and risk management throughout the process the third point is to speed up the application in an orderly manner for example the scientific research group recommends experimental drugs to the joint prevention and control medical treatment group and the medical treatment group decides whether to expand the scope of their use or include them in the treatment plan two final reflections professional guidances should be established not only to pharmacists and pharmacies but also to the general population and to particular population subgroups eg homeless prisoners etc the role of the community pharmacists in preventing the spread of covid-19 virus should be strengthened community pharmacists are charged with key responsibilities including informing advising and educating the community maintaining a stable supply of pharmaceuticals and personal hygiene products and screening suspected cases and making appropriate referrals as necessary 17 in summary chinese pharmacists and pharmacy associations have responded forcefully to the covid-19 epidemic the experiences and lessons learned in china not only allow the chinese pharmacy profession to improve pharmacy operations but also provide insight to the international pharmacy community to plan and operate pharmacy services to combat current and future epidemics  healthcare ethics during a pandemic kenneth iserson v   disasters recur on a regular basis in any disaster and especially in those caused by disease the public expects healthcare professionals to be on the front lines indeed most healthcare professionals expect that of themselves and their colleagues in most disasters and certainly during the current covid-19 pandemic frontline healthcare professionals face two key ethical issues 1 whether to respond despite the risks involved and 2 how to distribute scarce lifesaving medical resources in this paper i discuss how healthcare professionals weigh risk factors related to their response and the actions the healthcare community can take including proper communication and mitigating responder concerns to maximize and maintain our caregiver workforce i then very briefly discuss the ethics of scarce resources and suggest options such as recalling retired clinicians to service improvisation and husbanding available resources to mitigate rationing as covid-19 devastates the world bringing another feared and inevitable highly infectious pandemic to the current generation of healthcare professionals we face a slew of ethical dilemmas some of our colleagues around the globe reportedly have already had to make resource-allocation decisions about which patients to treat others have had to struggle to provide lesser degrees of degraded care we have little direct control over these situations most of the world failed to recognize the existential threat of this new coronavirus early enough to fully prepare institutional local regional national and international mobilization and response political expediency hubris scientifically ignorant leaders and incomplete information led to this inadequate advance planning by minimizing the threat when it appeared further delaying vital public health action at this point the most vital ethical decision in our war against an unseen enemy is the one over which each of us has direct control will we stay to help in the fight most disaster plans depend on physicians nurses support staff and prehospital personnel to maintain healthcares frontlines during crises yet planners cannot automatically assume that all healthcare workers will respond will our hospitals and clinics have enough physicians advanced practitioners nurses technicians maintenance and administrative staff to keep the doors open the computers running the linens clean the lights on and the facilities safe will our 9-1-1 systems still be able to dispatch medics firefighters and police that depends on the iterative possibly hourly or daily decisions that each affected individual repeatedly makes such decisions are not purely ethical but rather are complex determinations based on religious and personal values family and community responsibilities health and financial stability and risk assessment in 2001 for example the ama code of ethics was modified from solemnly commiting ourselves to apply our knowledge and skills when needed though doing so may put us at risk1 to physicians should balance immediate benefits to individual patients with ability to care for patients in the future2 the american college of emergency physicians meanwhile stated in its 2017 code of ethics for emergency physicians courage is the ability to carry out ones obligations despite personal risk or danger emergency physicians exhibit courage when they assume personal risk to provide steadfast care for all emergency patients including those who are agitated violent infectious and the like3 despite these professional ethical codes nothingeither morally or legallycompels a response to risk-prone situations other than military personnel no one is required to respond to potentially life-threatening emergencies professional oaths and codes may serve to guide practitioners but they are not absolutes the factors that guide people to respond are very personal healthcare workers individual behavior and that of our organizational professional and political leadership can modify those factors to increase the number that are willing to respond4 the moral backbone of medical professionalsa duty to put the needs of patients firstmay be tested as they determine whether to stay and carry out their professional roles or to step back and decrease their own personal risks whether providers will stay depends on their own risk assessment and value system the duty to treat when ones health life or personal well-being is threatened is not absolute in a risk-prone situation each of us will prioritize our personal and professional values those traits in ourselves that we consider to be our fundamental driving forces most clinicians first assess the risks to our own and to our familys life health and safety we may then factor in to varying degrees our religious beliefs and personal motivations all colored by elements of our personality next we may consider professional factors including the precepts in our healthcare professions oaths and codes as well as other ethical and religious dicta to which we subscribe most clinicians will focus on their concrete professional responsibilities5 these professional factors include emergency physicians may also feel that in these situations they are compelled to use their special knowledge about triage allocation of scarce resources eg vaccines prophylactic or treatment medications or intensive care unit icu ventilators public health mandates eg isolation or quarantine or mandatory vaccination and the use of altered standards of care46 when preparing for a disaster planners should consider not how they expect people to respond but rather why they are likely to respond7 the risks to physicians and other healthcare providers will vary by the nature of the causative agent the providers activities and underlying health and the protections offered and used people decide which risks to accept or to avoid based on their own perceptions of the source and quality of the information they receive89 quick emotional impressions often precede and guide rational risk appraisals10 provider and population perception of their risk from covid-19 will probably not be congruent with reality in part this will be due to the discordant messages from many senior politicians and other officials but also will be influenced by the real-time updates in scientific knowledge about the disease its transmission and possible protective measures in crises individuals must balance good information from valid media government and other sources to help identify the actual risks to themselves and their loved ones providing the best current information about the risks as well as the opportunities to assist during a crisis will help healthcare professionals make defensible decisions in disaster settings5 transparent and consistent information generates the trust necessary for both caregivers and the population to develop a reasonable risk assessment during conditions of uncertainty11 issuing incomplete or conflicting information as was done during the first months of the covid-19 outbreak caused many providers to make decisions to respond based on heated emotions and inaccurate risk perceptions people have been shown to naturally exaggerate the risk of phenomena that are unknown or dreaded such as those with delayed irreversible or manmade effects those that have new unknown or unobservable risks those that are global and those that are hyped by the media5 historical precedent and the nature of the medical profession demonstrate that we will have enough physicians and probably nurses to treat patients other professional and non-professional staff needed to keep healthcare institutions operating may not be as willing to risk themselves recent history suggests that we probably will not have enough support personnel because although they may be at as much or more risk than healthcare professionals their personal safety is often considered as an afterthought by administrators an important lesson from the sars outbreak is that whereas most clinicians will stay and fight vital support personnel including those in materials and supply logistics cleaning information technology communications maintenance and refuse removal may feel no commitment to assist moreover they may feel undervalued unprotected from risks and ignored when they are omitted from vital communications12 if all the staff necessary to run medical facilities fail to receive timely relevant and believable information they may not respond and the quality of available healthcare will deteriorate widely distributing accurate risk assessments and descriptions of protective measures for staff will encourage the maximal number of clinicians and other necessary personnel to respond to the situation therefore disaster planners and managers should do everything possible to communicate the risks clearly to all members of the healthcare system and to provide them with as much support and security as possible risk communication figure 1 is the exchange of real-time information advice and opinions between experts and people facing threats to their health economic or social well-being 13 its purpose is to enable people at risk to make informed decisions to protect themselves and their loved ones13 risk communication can help keep healthcare and other vital workers at their posts but it must be done by appropriate people educated in risk-communication techniques in a trustworthy manner honestly frequently openavailable and through easily accessible means which includes role-modeling by those in charge14 in addition to providing information research shows that to attain the maximal response during risk-prone and other disasters planners must do everything practicable to mitigate perceived risks and to address other concerns that may prevent staff from being either able or willing to work in a disaster table 1 to address one concern on march 20 2020 the american academy of emergency medicine issued a position statement saying in part that they believe a physician nurse pa first responder or other healthcare professional has the right to be removed from the schedule of work requiring direct contact with patients potentially infected with covid-19 for issues of personal health such as being on immunosuppressive therapy or other similar concerns without the risk of termination of employment15 rarely discussed but a key part of maintaining our workforce is to support the psychosocial needs of the healthcare team according to medical anthropologist monica schoch-spana pandemics arent just physical they bring with them an almost shadow pandemic of psychological and societal injuries as well17 psychosocial support for healthcare workers in the current war against covid-19 will be akin to post-traumatic stress disorder treatment for soldiers manning the front lines for extended periods people respond to the risks differently so experienced professionals will need to intervene before tragic adverse events occur in the current pandemic some key resources are and will increasingly become scarce physicians will need to consider how to distribute available resources and obtain or improvise others the most ethical course of action is to do everything possible to delay having to ration vital materials already in short supply include viral test kits and their associated equipment and reagents personal protective equipment ppe ventilators and hospital  especially icu  beds while china rapidly erected new prefabricated hospitals to treat patients and many countries around the world are establishing alternative care sites the united states has been slow to act often not considered healthcare workers especially those with expertise treating the critically ill will inevitably become a scarce resource however as the situation changes most healthcare workers will constantly reassess their decisions about responding as increasing numbers of personnel get sidelined due to actual or suspected disease exhaustion or fear for themselves or their families some active and retired personnel who initially stayed out of the fight or were sidelined due to illness or other circumstances may reassess their decision and join the battle employing senior medical students and extending advance practitioners scope of practice has been suggested as one way to ameliorate this problem in england and wales the national health service has asked about 65000 retired doctors and nurses to return to work in scotland they are recalling those who retired within the past three years if these clinicians have been away from practice for more than a short time they will receive brief refresher training26 the institute of medicine among others have described how to best manage resource scarcity in a widespread disaster table 2 many of these strategies are discussed in more detail elsewhere 27 during or after attempts at conservation reutilization adaption and substitution are performed maximally rationing will need to be implemented31 the ethical principle that guides rationing is distributive justice which requires that scarce resources be distributed fairly providing them to those most in need specifically it requires impartial and neutral decision makers to consistently apply rationing decisions across people and time treating like cases alike32 this is based on utilitarian principles including conservation of resources fiduciary responsibility stewardship multiplier effect does the person have a job that will save other lives immediate usefulness medical success and caretaker role3334 most ethicists agree however that such distribution should be equitable although in some circumstances other distribution methods such as first come first served equal distribution and even no distribution may be more rational even with agreement about equitable distribution scarcity often requires clinicians to prioritize which patients receive the resources3334 as the covid-19 pandemic extends its devastation physicians around the world are already facing the daunting task of rationing lifesaving resources this is upending their traditional method of treating the sickest first in emergency departments or first come first served in the icus31 in italy physicians have reported limiting ventilators to those less than 60 years old and china and spain have implemented medical resource rationing the us government and many states that have developed rationing plans have yet to explicitly implement them35 many of these plans may be outdated and none have been tested to determine whether they will save lives in fact a canadian study of h1n1 patients found that 70 of patients that a rationing plan would have removed from ventilators survived with continued ventilation36 dr laura evans an intensivist at the university of washington is working with her state to devise a triage plan that would be doing the most good for the most people and be fair and equitable and transparent in the process yet the washington state health department recently issued a statement that triage teams under crisis conditions should consider transferring patients out of the hospital or to palliative care if the patients baseline functioning was marked by loss of reserves in energy physical ability cognition and general health36 rationing plans must conform to general ethical principles and to existing community moral standards community input into these plans is vital for maintaining the publics trust in clinicians the institutions and the organizations involved in disaster relief and resource allocation a major ethical dilemma is that current rationing criteria may skew away from normally disadvantaged populations in the past allocation plans were developed by the healthcare community in the current crisis some planning groups have tried to address this by asking disparate communities throughout their region to offer input into the plans 36 in all circumstances rationing scarce medical resources is difficult and stressful such distribution rather than being based on politics money or power must be based on an equitable fair openly available pre-existing plan it may be beneficial to have emergency physicians and intensivists take the lead under set protocols in making these decisions since they have had more experience than others in doing this on a regular basis ideally they will have support from their institutions bioethics consultants social workers and chaplains rationing will not end when medications to treat covid-19 are eventually identified or vaccines are produced for prevention in the first weeks or months there will be limited amounts available with massive public anguish over how they are being distributed those involved in developing and implementing healthcare resource distribution will need to think ahead and include this eventuality in their plans lastly resource allocation is not the only option disasters are the exact situations where clinicians and administrators need to think outside the box by expanding clinical roles and responsibilities relaxing restrictive regulations improvising medical equipment and devising other solutions to scarcity27 until the pandemic ends we will need to encourage our healthcare workforce to stay at their posts and to use their fortitude and intellect as they face the multiple challenges involved with their jobs  will covid-19 mark the end of an egalitarian national health service sabrina germain   the exceptional circumstances brought about by the covid-19 pandemic have affected the traditional organisation of healthcare resources allocation in the uk since its inception the national health service nhs has aimed to regulate risks of ill health in the population by providing an equal and universal provision of healthcare services to residents based on their health status rather than their ability to pay the rapid spread of this new virus has however triggered a shift in paradigm from an egalitarian allocation of healthcare resources to a utilitarian approach which has led to discussions about societys greatest taboos death and dying and the economic value of individuals health the rapid growth of covid-19 cases around the world has also highlighted the difficulties governments have had in dealing with the allocation of scarce resources even though the nhs remains publicly funded the provision of services is now ranking the needs of patients that are directly or indirectly affected by the virus rather than providing equal access to treatment for all this paper argues that the current governments emergency healthcare policy has thereby favoured a utilitarian approach to healthcare rationing and potentially initiated the end of an egalitarian nhs the paper first unpacks why the allocation of healthcare resources is fundamentally a question of justice in britain and explains why healthcare law and policy require a philosophical approach in times of crucial change and crisis secondly the paper provides a critical analysis of the current situation for the allocation of healthcare resources and the provision of services to patients directly or indirectly affected by the virus it concludes that the liberal egalitarian conception of distributive justice at the heart of the nhs that aims to guarantee free and equal access to healthcare is now in jeopardy and is being replaced by a utilitarian approach based on a priority ranking of patients for the provision of services at this critical time the resources available and mobilised for healthcare in the uk have been out of sync with the growing needs of society long before the surge of covid-19 1 in fact the scarcity of these resources has mandated patterns for their allocation ever since the inception of the nhs 2 aneurin bevan founder of the nhs had established that healthcare resources had to be available universally based on patients needs rather than their ability to pay in order to stop ill health in the population after the war this automatically placed the national institution within a framework of justice 3 nonetheless considerations around the basic entitlement to healthcare whether resources should be allocated based on a patients a communitys or a populations needs or whether the nhs should aim to provide individuals with greater life opportunity by satisfying healthcare needs still to this day occupy the policy debate and most particularly in this time of crisis in theory justice mandates that we treat equally those who are alike and those who are different in proportion to their differences justice balances the needs and desires of individuals with the claims of the community 4 it is concerned with human relationships in the social order and issues of distribution distributive justice as an element of justice provides methods for the allocation of resources moral political philosophers have called on different ideas of distributive justice such as liberal equality utilitarianism communitarianism and libertarianism to create appropriate allocation frameworks for healthcare 5 each of these four conceptions of distributive justice can form the basis of a healthcare policy at times they are also merged to adjust the distribution of healthcare resources granted healthcare resources do not possess outstanding attributes in comparison to other health determinants however their moral significance derives from the role they play in our lives the pattern chosen for their allocation must therefore focus on the attainment of justice 6 it is the indisputability and seriousness of healthcare needs that make the distribution of these resources stand out from the allocation of any other consumer good their importance stems from the potential they have to alleviate risk of illness suffering and absolute harm 7 in line with these theoretical considerations the bedrock of liberal egalitarian justice on which rests the nhs aims to provide equal access to care through the availability of publicly financed services at the point of use 8 the british population and explains in part why over the past 70 years the egalitarian core of the nhs has been adapted but has persisted in spite of major political and economic shifts 9 even though crucial turning points at the national level have triggered healthcare reforms that embraced alternative ideas of justice at times prescribing the use of utilitarian means or libertarian principles to achieve greater efficiency and guarantee equal access to care the original egalitarian goals have not been compromised 10 after the war bevan was convinced that illness should neither be an indulgence for which people have to pay nor an offence for which they should be penalised but a misfortune the cost of which should be shared by the community 11 there was also the necessity to respond to fear with a collective action led by the state from the start the nhs rested on ideas of fairness and equality and an understanding that resources had to be shared in order for the rich and the poor to have the same access to services 12 all would be treated equally even the most vulnerable patients thanks to the redistribution of resources and a system of provision based on needs rather than means the nhs was to level the healthcare playing field by providing more care to the least favoured and most vulnerable as well as equal access to services for all other types of patients 13 over the years successive governments have had to reinterpret bevans commitment because of diminishing resources and growing healthcare needs the rationing of resources became an underlying theme in healthcare policy as early as the 1980s the change in culture embracing libertarian and utilitarian methods in healthcare that was initiated at the beginning of the thatcher era 14 was taken forward by new labour in the 1990s and climaxed under the coalition government the nhs principles of equality in healthcare were preserved but a neoliberal approach started to be adopted for the delivery of healthcare services 15 this historical evolution of ideas of justice in british healthcare is of interest when assessing the impact of changes brought by times of crisis after brexit 16 covid-19 is yet another crucial turning point for the nhs policy-makers having to react in 9 ibid 10 14 in 1979 the thatcher government introduced competition and efficiency in social policy to fight overwhelming public expenditures after a controversial review of the nhs the conservatives introduced the purchaser-provider divide in healthcare universality of care was preserved and equality in access was upheld but resources simply had to be optimised to derive the greatest utility from a more efficient nhs in order to address the needs of vulnerable patients see national health service and community care act 1990 15 the health and social care act 2012 placed the patient at the heart of the system and medical professionals in a support role the nhs principles of equality in healthcare were preserved but a neoliberal approach to the delivery of healthcare services had been adopted healthcare had become a fully fleshed market where the private sector was encouraged to compete with providers to offer the best and most cost-efficient services to patients these changes shaped the place given to the independent sector private and corporate entities in the financing and provision of healthcare services in the twenty-first century 16 urgency to a situation that may require them to leave behind its egalitarian foundations to embrace a more utilitarian approach to the provision of healthcare services the current pandemic confronts the nhs with unprecedented demands and pressures with a direct effect on intensive care units and the medical workforce 17 some groups of patients such as the elderly and individuals affected by comorbidities have recorded greater fatality rates others affected by underlying socioeconomic inequalities that were at play prior to the spread of the infection are also more prone to contracting the virus 18 nevertheless the infection is non-discriminatory in nature affecting all social statuses and affluences 19 this does not however translate into a levelling of access to healthcare resources for all 20 dramatic ethical dilemmas relating to resource allocation are thereby brought into sharper focus the government has to determine how to allocate scarcer resources with the growing and urgent need to mitigate the impact on the nhs and the population if the british healthcare system were to keep in line with its principles of egalitarian justice healthcare services would be delivered equally to all similarly situated patients on the territory this would entail that patients be treated alike regardless of whether or not they have contracted the virus additional resources would however be provided to more vulnerable or critical patients in comparison to less urgent cases as an exception to this strict equality rule 21 however the reality of the pandemic does not allow for the system to spread out its resources in order to preserve equality for instance patients cannot be rotated to share ventilator time or bed days in hospital the system therefore automatically reverts to a de facto first come first served basis until resources are depleted 22 in the near future a critical juncture will be reached where clinicians will be forced to choose between providing life-sustaining conditions to patients or abandoning treatment such concrete discussions around death and the cost associated with life-sustaining treatments have never been so pressing but the race against the virus no longer allows for a pause to reflect on a collective decision around the allocation of healthcare resources in times of crisis

model of rationing with equality in access as a second-rank priority the aim is to maximise healthcare outcomes by favouring individuals with a greater chance of survival and introducing a ranking of patients 23 for instance on 21 march 2020 the national institute for health and care excellence nice has introduced at breakneck speed its covid-19 rapid guidelines to facilitate intensive care clinicians assessment of patient needing to be admitted into critical care the recommendations suggest that doctors consider the medical benefit including the patients likelihood of recovery from critical care admission to an outcome that is acceptable 24 the advice requires upstream decision-making upon the patients admission and a certain level of speculation on how well they will respond to critical care only time will tell whether these criteria have indirectly imposed age-based rationing in the sense that elderly patients tend to have a greater propensity for comorbidities and may be assessed as having less of a likelihood of recovery from critical care at a philosophical level our society also needs to decide whether forgoing equality in access to care for the elderly is a choice that needs to be made in a time of pandemic whether these older patients have had their fair innings and should sacrifice their care for younger patients more likely to recover from the infection 25 an approach that seems to have been taken by the current government other vulnerable groups of patients also feel the repercussions of this change in allocation strategy mostly patients suffering from chronic conditions such as diabetes or cancer individuals in need of living-donor transplantation have also had their surgeries postponed or cancelled for fear that they would take up intensive care beds at post-op routine check-up appointments have for some part moved online but patients suffering from chronic illnesses that may require additional attention tend to refrain from asking for help for fear of overburdening the healthcare system 26 at the diagnostic level utilitarian considerations are also coming into play as the uk entered the delay phase of its plan to fight covid-19 on 12 march 2020 policy shifted with regards to the testing of individuals at risk of having contracted the virus the nhs no longer offered testing in the community and reserved the process to the hospital setting for immunocompromised and intensive care patients 27 other patients with symptoms that did not require inpatient medical care were asked to self-isolate without an official diagnosis 28 these measures were rolled out in parallel to a letter sent to primary care doctors that set out a list of activities to be halted or postponed in gp 23 d shaw d harvey and d gardiner dont let the ethics of

surgeries 29 equality in access to preventative medicine was thereby replaced to allocate scarce resources to individuals more at risk in addition in an effort to provide a centralised response to the crisis the government has drafted emergency legislation among other special stipulations the coronavirus act encloses provisions to grant a temporary authorisation of practice to designated healthcare professionals and emergency volunteers 30 the effort to rally a greater number of medical professionals raises other ethical questions that should be addressed in light of the new utilitarian approach to resource allocation even though after much pressure the government took the decision to test healthcare workers showing symptoms the lack of routine testing of key workers certainly endangers patients 31 not aware of their health status asymptomatic health workers may transmit the disease while providing care 32 it may well be that we should now consider providing preferential treatment to this essential group of workers in times of health emergency it is important to guarantee that the medical forces be as fit as possible and in the event that they do fall sick that they return to work swiftly for the benefit of the population simply put prioritising healthcare professionals wellbeing and treatment can be justified because it would help maximise the health outcome of the entire population 33 most striking is the emphasis put by public powers on individual responsibility and collective action without any available treatment or vaccine the government sought to relieve pressure from the nhs by incentivising the public to adopt social distancing measures and for individuals to self-isolate if they suspected they have the virus 34 in an effort not to detract resources from the healthcare system british society could now reflect on another conception of distributive justice that would embrace communitarian approaches to rationing communitarian thoughts and justice theories tend to focus on a balanced allocation of resources that takes into account a patients illness but also the needs of the local community to achieve just outcomes for society as a whole 35 if we are to think collectively about healthcare outcomes we should also seriously account for underprivileged groups such as rough sleepers drug users and the homeless during a pandemic these groups are less likely to have access to the nhs as they are for most part unregistered residents and may not be able to practice daily hygiene putting them at a greater risk of getting infected 36 protection of vulnerable groups and at-risk patients is an upstream process that will require some redesign of current healthcare institutions after the pandemic offering appropriate healthcare support to immigrant populations improving sanitation and access to medical services in shelters as well as increasing access to care for people with disabilities are only a few examples of initiatives that must be put into place to protect these groups from future epidemics 37 debates around who should meet their death first make us uneasy as a society 38 this is in part the reason why we have missed out on an opportunity for a collective dialogue at the onset of the pandemic we now leave some of the most tragic decisions in the hands of clinicians on the ground 39 triage among incoming patients occurs on a daily basis however choices at a systemic level such as the allocation of intensive care beds ventilators and test kits among different hospitals remain in the remit of the government clinicians will continue to follow deontological principles and act in the best interests of their patients these principles may sometimes conflict or work independently from governmental guidelines that dictate the allocation of resources at a macro level 40 nonetheless clinicians will have to adjust their clinical assessment to mitigate resources and maximise the greater good in line with the governments utilitarian healthcare policies 41 all of these moral decisions cannot be made in silos healthcare workers need support from their professional colleges and colleagues from other disciplines among which are political theorists and bioethicists to make the best judgement calls 42 indeed the pandemic has demonstrated that distributive justice and its different conceptions egalitarianism utilitarianism communitarianism or libertarianism are no longer confined to theoretical assumptions but anchored in reality and that they must be used as a first port of call to find models for the allocation of scarce resources the second world war had brought about a national egalitarian institution for the care of the british people the current war on the virus has given rise to a new wave of utilitarianism for the provision of healthcare services with a realistic outlook on the situation it is clear that the aftermath is not in close sight with a vaccine potentially only available in 12-18 months the cost of having scaled up critical and intensive care on the entire territory and having purchased services and hospital beds in the independent sector will have long-term effects on nhs finances going back to the egalitarian model that was already under strain prior to the advent of covid-19 will be practicably impossible even if current utilitarian emergency policies are suspended the nhs will nonetheless need to first address the delays in treatment that occurred during the time of the pandemic second the public health strategy will have to be reassessed to prepare for a potential future incident of a similar scale and to learn the lessons from the current episode it is now time for us to accept that the nhs will face hard choices in the weeks months and even years to come as a consequence of this devastating pandemic unfortunately some will be direct and others indirect victims of covid-19 for lack of critical and intensive care resources or because of delays in treatment we should however remind ourselves that resources continue to be used to save as many lives as possible in order to offer all a fair and equal opportunity to pursue life plans upon recovery from an illness 43 things may never go back to the way we knew them before this pandemic especially with regards to the healthcare system and resources available we are entering a new period that has triggered personal and collective grief for this loss of normalcy 44 this overhaul may however have given us an opportunity to discuss as a society the resources we wish to allocate to the nhs in the future and the manner in which we believe it is most just to ration what is now available 43 o goldhill ethicists agree on who gets treated first when hospitals are overwhelmed by

understand the human catastrophe of the coronavirus disease2019 covid19 epidemic as of april 12 2020 there were 557043 cases of documented covid19 infection in the united states and 21952 deaths
1
 our economy except for limited sectors has come to a complete halt as we practice physical distancing to try to mitigate the effects of the pandemic in the 10 weeks since covid19 began to accelerate there has been a flurry of information from corners expected and unexpected to help us with this understanding rapid publication of peerreviewed data has defined the possible risk factors for covid19 its clinical course and its possible epidemiology in this unusual time of a public health emergency numerous nonpeerreviewed manuscripts have been uploaded to preprint servers and their unreviewed data and conclusions must be evaluated in this spirit nevertheless data both published and in preprint form point to a tantalizing hypothesis that covid19 infection and its severity can be explained by the concentration of glycosylated severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 sarscov2 viral particles in the lung epithelium the concentration of glycosylated angiotensinconverting enzyme receptor 2 ace2 in the lung epithelium and the degree and control of the pulmonary immune response to the sarscov2 spike protein at approximately day 8 to 10 after symptom onset which may be related to both ace2 appears to be the primary receptor for entry of sarscov2 into various epithelial tissues an envelope anchored spike protein allows entry of coronaviruses into host cells by binding to a host receptor and fusing viral and host membranes
2
 analysis of sarscov a betacoronavirus most similar to sarscov2 and responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars
3
 defined a receptorbinding domain rbd of the sarscov spike protein that specifically recognized ace2
4

 susceptibility to sars appears to be primarily dependent on the affinity of the spike rbd to bind host ace2 in target tissues in the initial viral attachment step and differences in the affinity of the rbd for ace2 may determine the zoonotic host and epidemiology of spread
5
 protein crystal structure analysis of the sarscov rbd complexed with ace2 demonstrated that this differential binding affinity resides in a critical receptorbinding motif of the spike receptor protein and in particular the composition of amino acids 442 472 479 480 and 487 determine affinity for human ace2 as opposed to other hosts
5

 predicted protein structural analysis of these critical five residues in the sarscov2 analogous to sarscov suggested an increased binding affinity to human ace2 by sarscov2
6
 a synthetic sarscov2 rbd was found in vitro to bind and enter cells transfected only with a human ace2 receptor and no other known coronavirus targets such as dpp4 the target of merscov
7
 therefore it is rational to assume that like sarscov sarscov2 uses the ace2 receptor on target tissues as its primary mechanism of entry recent work with cryo electron microscopy of ace2 bound to a spike protein fragment of sarscov2
8
 suggests that the viral spike protein is a trimer with one of the trimer rbd sites exposed to bind ace2 additional structurefunction studies
9
 also appear to indicate that the viral spike s protein of sarscov2 is highly glycosylated the s protein is cleaved by proteases into two subunits s1 and s2 and the s1 subunit is further divided into sa and sb domains with the sb domain predicted to bind to human ace2 the s2 subunit is responsible for fusion of the virusace2 complex with the cell membrane and is highly glycosylated at evolutionarily conserved sites
9

 it is tempting to speculate that alterations in glycosylation of both the spike protein as well as ace2 can modulate viral binding it is also tempting to speculate that alterations in the highly glycosylated and evolutionarily conserved viral fusion subunit could modulate s proteinace2 complex fusion with the cell membrane and potentially attenuate human to human transmission the importance of ace2 binding by sarscov2 in covid19 is underscored by the observation that anosmia and dysgeusia have recently been observed in patients with covid19
10
 and that ace2 expression has recently been found to be high in the oropharynx and tongue
11

 binding of ace2 by sarscov2 in covid19 also suggests that prolonged uncontrolled hyperglycemia and not just a history of diabetes mellitus may be important in the pathogenesis of the disease a known history of diabetes dm and ambient hyperglycemia were found to be independent risk factors for morbidity and mortality in sars
12
 in a followup analysis of 135 patients high fasting plasma glucose fpg was an independent predictor of sars mortality
13
 diabetes was found in 74 of a cohort of hospitalized covid19 patients and appeared to be a risk factor for severity of disease
14
 a history of diabetes was associated with 225 of covid19 intensive care unit icu admissions vs 59 of nonicu admissions in one case series
15
 and another recent icu case series reported 14 of 24 58 with a history of diabetes
16
 mortality of covid19 in patients with diabetes was found to be 76 vs 09 in patients with no comorbidities
17

 a possible explanation for a link between hyperglycemia and ace2 levels in the severity of covid19 disease could be explained by several clinical observations in sars and preclinical observations in the nod diabetic mouse as noted above potential changes in glycosylation of the ace2 as well as glycosylation of the viral spike protein both possibly induced by uncontrolled hyperglycemia may alter both the binding of the viral spike protein to ace2 and the degree of the immune response to the virus in a subset of 39 patients who had no prior diabetes received no steroid treatment during hospitalization and who survived sars fpg levels during hospitalization were found to decrease before discharge
13
 twenty of these 39 51 patients had diabetes during hospitalization
13
 and at 3 years of followup only 2 of 39 5 did autopsy examination of an unrelated individual revealed high levels of ace2 expression in the alveolar tissue of the lung the islet cells of the pancreas the heart and the kidney this suggested a mechanism of transient hyperglycemia induced by a transient inflammation of the islet cells of the pancreas by sarscov through binding of sarscov to the ace2 present on islet cells resulting in a transient insulin dependent diabetes mellitus which resolved with resolution of disease
13

 in a study of nod diabetic mice ace2 protein levels in the lung were putatively elevated when compared to control mice and returned to the control level when insulin was administered
18
 by reducing levels of glycosylated ace2 target in the target lung tissue by glycemic control this could possibly reduce the number of glycosylated viral binding sites in the lung and hence possibly ameliorate some of the inflammation and symptoms of covid19 disease this also suggests a possible paracrine loop hypothesis for covid19 infection where the virus infects the pancreas and lung leading to hyperglycemia and upregulation of glycosylated ace2 in the lung and further virus binding and inflammation poor glycemic control could therefore make the disease more severe in a case series of 138 covid19 patients glucocorticoid therapy was used in 449 of nonicu patients and 722 of icu patients
15
 and presumably this glucocorticoid use made hyperglycemia and possibly clinical symptoms more severe a recent review of glucocorticoids in viral diseases recommended against use in covid19 pneumonia and suggested that it could cause harm
19

 it is interesting to note that as this article was going to press that another group has expressed a similar hypothesis
20

 potentially high and aberrantly glycosylated ace2 in the lung nasal airways tongue and oropharynx in uncontrolled hyperglycemia could also serve as increased sarscov2 viral binding sites thus leading to a higher propensity to covid19 infection and a higher disease severity interestingly high ace2 has a protective effect in various organs
21
 ace2 gene expression is increased by estrogen in a mouse model 
22
 a potential protective factor for sarscov2 infection and pathogenicity as men are more likely than women to both acquire covid19 and have more severe disease recent survey studies found that ace2 gene expression was higher in tissues of women and in younger adults an inverse correlation to disease severity
23
 a possible explanation for this discrepancy is that gene expression experiments cannot measure posttranslational modifications such as protein glycosylation in the nod diabetic mouse model ace2 activity in the lung did not rise and then fall with insulin administration but the amount of ace2 protein apparently did
18
 this is consistent with a rise in glycosylated ace2 as opposed to total ace2 since antibody binding to proteins as measured by western blot analysis could be affected by glycosylation
24
 therefore it is likely that it is the amount of glycosylated ace2 receptor and not simply the amount of ace2 alone that is responsible for virus binding and fusion if true this argues for better glycemic control in patients with prediabetes and diabetes as a potential mechanism to slow covid19 spread and reduce the severity of symptoms additionally since 38 of the american population without a history of diabetes or prediabetes has a hemoglobin a1c over 61 in random sampling
25
 use of high a1c as a risk stratification for covid19 could have merit clinical information about the timing of the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards in sars and covid19 is also informative in a series of 75 patients with sars
26
 median time to oxygen desaturation occurred around day 4 after the onset of symptoms median time to peak viral load occurred around day 10 and median time to peak ards requiring intubation occurred around day 10 to 12 in a series of 138 covid19 patients
15
 median time to dyspnea from the onset of symptoms was 5 days to hospital admission was 7 days and to ards 8 days in a series of 24 covid19 patients admitted to icus in the seattle area the median time to hospital admission was 7 days from the onset of symptoms another case series from wuhan suggests a median time from symptom onset to development of computed tomography ct scan changes consistent with covid19 pneumonia to be a median of 5 days
14
 it appears that both sars and covid19 have a similar clinical course of infection symptom onset dyspnea and oxygen desaturation at approximately day 5 after symptoms in a fraction of symptomatic patients followed by a worsening of disease to ards requiring intubation at day 7 to 10 after symptoms in a smaller fraction of dyspneic patients this appears to be coincident with a peak in viral load as measured in nasopharyngeal swabs at day 10 after symptom onset in sars
26
 the timing of the ards in sars also corresponded to the timing of immunoglobulin g igg seroconversion
26
 additionally the neutralizing antibody nab response to the sarscov spike protein in patients who died of sars occurred earlier in the course of the disease 147 days after symptom onset vs those who survived 20 days and the nab antibody titer was higher in those who died of sars than in those survived
27
 notably viral load in covid19 in severe cases appears to remain high 10 days after symptom onset
28
 and it is tempting to hypothesize that a similar mechanism applies to sarscov2 the study of sarslike coronaviruses in animal models has been of necessity difficult in large part due to concerns in preventing a pandemic similar to the one we are currently experiencing sars experiments require a biosafety level 3 laboratory and experiments where recombinant coronavirus constructs were produced by insertion of various novel spike protein rbd coding sequences into benign or nontransmissible coronaviruses were specifically banned by the national institutes of health in 2014
29

 however experimental information exists on sars infection and immune response from a chinese macaque animal model
30
 in this model vaccination with a modified vaccina virus containing the fulllength sarscov spike protein followed by infection with sarscov induced varying degrees of diffuse alveolar damage in the majority of the experimental animals 7 days after infection adoptive transfer of serum from macaques vaccinated with the sarscov spike protein but not infected with sarscov was performed and this serum induced diffuse alveolar damage at rates greater than control serum in sarscovinfected macaques indicating that the spike protein neutralizing antibodies were amplifying virus damage by sarscov in the lung even at low doses of serum high doses of serum still caused alveolar damage even if they reduced sarscov viral titers and the damage appeared to be restricted to acutely infected animals the action of the serum in inducing this damage also appeared to be due to driving of pulmonary macrophages excessively to a proinflammatory m1 polarized state possibly through involvement of the glycosylated fc gamma receptor serum from deceased sars patients in this study also induced this proinflammatory m1 polarization as well the acute onset of lung inflammation in sars resulting in ards appears to be tightly associated with monocytemacrophage polarization and function
31
 during acute infection macrophages display a classically activated inflammatory m1 phenotype and express cytokines such as interleukin6 il6 high il6 levels were associated with increased mortality in a series of 191 hospitalized patients with covid19
16

 it is tempting to consider that the same mechanism acts in covid19 as in sars where an overactive macrophage m1 inflammatory response as neutralizing antibodies to the sarscov2 spike protein form at day 7 to 10 results in ards in susceptible patients it is also allows consideration of agents which may interfere with this overly brisk macrophage inflammatory response and perhaps influence the course of the disease in particular those that blunt but do not completely abrogate m2 to m1 balance in macrophage polarization as well as viral load which in sars appears to be temporally related to the onset of ards it is of interest that in a mouse model of asthma macrophage m2 polarization is increased by estrogen
32
 additionally estrogen also accelerates acquisition of an m2 phenotype in a monocyte cell culture model
33
 differences in m1 to m2 polarization may perhaps explain the partial protective effect of female sex in the pathogenesis of covid19 it is a tribute to the ingenuity and effort of the medical and scientific community that we currently have multiple agents in clinical trials to help treat covid19 all of which have a rational basis however for an agent to have an effect in blunting the medical complications of a widespread pandemic where hundreds of thousands of infected patients are at risk of fatal progression of disease this agent needs to be cheap relatively nontoxic and rapidly scalable only one of the agents being considered at this point meets these criteria hydroxychloroquine has been used of the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune conditions for nearly 70 years it has also been used as malaria prophylaxis and treatment for nearly 50 years it is extremely safe and has been used widely in underdeveloped countries for these conditions in children and in pregnant women with little to no monitoring while there are potential concerns for rare drug interactions with other agents that prolong the qt interval and there are concerns with retinopathy with long term use neither of these uncommon complications should be clinically significant if appropriate caution an electrocardiogram ekg before therapy is employed
34

 there is a possible rational basis for the development of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of covid19 in clinical trials of treatment and prophylaxis hydroxychloroquine inhibits sarscov2 in vitro at concentrations achievable in human lung tissue
35
 chloroquine a related compound inhibits sarscov replication and spread in cell culture possibly through reducing glycosylation of the ace2 receptor
36
 interestingly computer simulations suggest that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are predicted to bind to the active site of the enzyme udpnacetylglucosamine 2epimerase which catalyzes the rate determining step in the sialic acid biosynthesis pathway
37
 and thus there is a rational basis to assume hydroxychloroquine can interfere in terminal glycosylation of proteins in the golgi apparatus in a small unrandomized clinical cohort of 80 patients the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has been shown to rapidly reduce viral load in covid19 patients and ameliorate clinical symptoms in the majority of patients
38
 in another small randomized unpublished study of 62 covid19 patients undertaken after the observation that none of a cohort 80 lupus patients in wuhan on chronic hydroxychloroquine therapy developed covid19 infection 62 patients with mild covid19 symptoms and signs of covid19 pneumonia on ct scan were randomized to 200mg of hydroxychloroquine orally twice daily for 5 days and usual care or usual care alone
39
 in the hydroxychloroquine arm of this study 806 of subjects had improvement of covid19 pneumonia findings on ct scan vs 508 of controls after 5 days of therapy p0476 and 0 of patients on hydroxychloroquine progressed to severe disease vs 129 of control patients pnot done hydroxychloroquine also can act as an oral hypoglycemic agent as patients with diabetes taking hydroxychloroquine for rheumatologic diseases had a significant reduction in hemoglobin a1c when compared to methotrexate
40
 and thus can serve to reduce hyperglycemia a possible covid19 risk factor for disease severity while studies are mixed on this topic and the balance of m1 to m2 macrophage polarization may differ depending on the local microenvironment hydroxychloroquine has been shown in at least one study to block the polarization of macrophages to an m1 inflammatory subtype
41
 and it is predicted to interfere with glycosylation of a number of proteins involved in the humoral immune response possibly including the macrophage fcr gamma igg receptor and other immunomodulatory proteins potentially through inhibition of udpnacetylglucosamine 2epimerase in combination with potential other immunomodulatory effects this could possibly blunt the progression of covid19 pneumonia all to way up to ards where a potential overconversion to an inflammatory m1 macrophage subtype occurs in response to a postulated brisk humoral immune response to the sarscov2 spike protein around day 8 to 10 after symptom onset while we await larger randomized studies and more analysis of patient subtypes to determine who if anyone will benefit from hydroxychloroquine in the context of this theoretical framework for covid19 infection the results to date are supportive although much caution should be used in interpretation of these early small clinical trials regardless of the results of larger clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine in covid19 it is hoped that the above analysis can provide a testable theoretical framework to allow for advances in our understanding and control of this

evidence to guide practice is scant four months into the pandemic there are models of possible trajectories of the disease but there are still no clear national recommendations to guide practice that could reduce the spread of infection in hospitals facing limited availability of personal protective equipment ppe including surgical masks and n95 masks this confusion complicates the tradeoff decisions hospitals must now make between conserving supply for the immediate future and limiting spread of infection now anticipating even greater need as the virus spreads in communities across the country many have opted to limit the use of ppes especially n95 masks to only certain clinical procedures and patient encounters as the new york times reported recently doctors nurses and staff at hospitals across the country are sounding the alarm about risk of exposure 1 but one solution may be hiding in plain sight and its rooted in basic high school physics the largest respiratory droplets which are expelled by coughing sneezing or speaking come from the pharynx and upper respiratory tract 2 this is also where the virus replicates the most 3 volume is a cubic function so these large

tracts of infected patients can remain suspended in the air for several hours 4 this makes n95 respirators indispensable for protecting healthcare workers treating critically ill patients it also raises the question of whether more humble alternatives could block the large droplets outside critical care settings as dr sui huang lays out in a brilliant exposition of the problem even makeshift masks create a physical barrier that limits where these droplets can land 5 while wearing them doesnt stop all exposure it is curtailed and studies of crude masks made from basic consumer materials suggest that they can make a difference perhaps more importantly masks drastically reduce the number of droplets that make it beyond the wearers mask and into their surroundings this insight may be critical for coronavirus preliminary analysis of nasals swabs from asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals indicate that they appear to have similar viral loads 6 using a mask allows even those who do not suspect that they are infected to reduce the probability of transmission added to social distancing this barrier could reduce the number of viral copies making contact with others and coming to rest on surfaces waiting for the unwitting brush of a hand that later meets the face countries that have adopted uniform mask requirements such as the czech republic have benefitted from a more notable flattening of their epidemic curves than their counterparts 7 the cdc recently followed suit recommending that the general public wear makeshift masks in public areas where social distancing is difficult 8 however some healthcare organizations have remained slow to consider them for all employees coming into work while current rationing helps preserve the supply of n95s and procedural masks it comes at the risk of adding to the problem by infecting those working in hospitals the same healthcare workers trying to avoid transmission from patients are susceptible to another sourceeach other one study suggests that physicians spend around a quarter of their time caring for patients 9 though that measure likely varies by specialty and may be far higher under current circumstances it highlights the fact that healthcare involves significant interaction outside of patient care even with rapid advances in the use of telemedicine and remote work policies for non-essential workers this still leaves plenty of opportunities to unwittingly pass the virus among unprotected colleagues reports from other countries indicate that relative to other groups healthcare workers are over-represented among confirmed cases estimates from several us states suggests that as many as 20 of covid-19 cases may be among healthcare workers 10 the high numbers suggest that exposure beyond patient care is responsible for at least some transmission 11 adding to the problem is that higher inoculating doses of certain pathogens are hypothesized to result in more severe disease 12 13 and clinics and hospitals are the most likely places to encounter highly concentrated doses of the coronavirus initial analyses and anecdotal reports indicate that healthcare workers are indeed becoming more ill than the general population 14 15 the joint commission which accredits hospitals has endorsed allowing workers to use their own privately owned masks and respirators 16 but even these resources run dry quickly some groups are already sewing masks for donation to hospitals that are critically short of ppe we suggest that hospitals treat makeshift masks not only as substitute but also as a complement to ppe where none is currently being used due to rationing requiring that anyone on the premises of a patient care organization whether in clinical or non-clinical workspaces cover their nose and mouth with a mask -homemade if necessary -is a valuable measure in its own right some hospitals have already adopted this policy we urge that this become a universal policy across the country in all health care institutions and nursing homes the math of coronavirus hasnt worked in our favor but it isnt set in stone even if we cannot completely prevent transmission we can take simple steps to reduce its spread asking that the general public wear homemade masks was a step in the right direction we recommend that all persons entering clinics and hospitals in clinical settings as well as any other non-clinical areas where healthcare workers convene should wear a mask this can be a surgical mask if possible but a makeshift homemade mask should be permitted if surgical masks are unavailable or are in short supply another we must consider it as a small investment that pays compound interest by safeguarding healthcare workers and flattening the curve by reducing the likelihood of spreading the virus among themselves their patients and families  intensive care management of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 challenges and recommendations jason phua li weng lowell

the third coronavirus infection in two decades that was originally described in asia after severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers1 as the covid-19 pandemic spreads worldwide intensive care unit icu practitioners hospital administrators governments policy makers and researchers must prepare for a surge in critically ill patients many lessons can be learnt from the cumulative experience of asian icus dealing with the covid-19 sars and mers outbreaks in this review we draw on the experience of asian icu practitioners from a variety of settingsand available literature on the management of critically ill patients with covid-19 and related conditionsto provide an overview of the challenges the icu community faces and recommendations for navigating these complexities these challenges and recommendations are summarised in table 1 table 2
 the number of people diagnosed with covid-19 worldwide crossed the one million mark on april 2 2020 the case fatality rate across 204 countries and territories was 522 by comparison the sars epidemic infected 8096 people in 29 countries from november 2002 to july 2003 and had a case fatality rate of 963 whereas the mers outbreak infected 2494 people in 27 countries from april 2012 to november 2019 and had a case fatality rate of 3444 these fatality rates should be interpreted with caution because they vary across regions are higher in strained health-care systems and do not account for undiagnosed patients with mild disease who do not contribute to the denominator5 6 7
 in a review by the who-china joint mission of 55 924 laboratory-confirmed cases in china 61 were classified as critical respiratory failure shock and multiple organ dysfunction or failure and 138 as severe dyspnoea respiratory rate 30 breaths per min oxygen saturation 93 partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen pao2fio2 ratio 300 mm hg and increase in lung infiltrates 50 within 2448 h8 not all critical cases were admitted to the icu indeed icu admissions are dependent on the severity of illness and the icu capacity of the health-care system in italy the country outside china with the most patients with covid-19 until march 29 2020 up to 12 of all positive cases required icu admission9 10

 in a large report 49 of all 2087 critically ill patients with covid-19 in china died21 22 small single-icu studies found mortality rates of 62 in wuhan china and 67 in washington state usa but these figures had not accounted for many who were still in the icu15 16 although 97 of patients on invasive mechanical ventilation died in a multicentre study conducted early in the wuhan outbreak mortality is affected by local practices and larger studies are awaited23 the same study reported that 53 of deaths were related to respiratory failure 7 to shock presumably from fulminant myocarditis 33 to both and 7 to unclear mechanisms23 mortality is associated with older age comorbidities including hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease chronic lung disease and cancer higher severity of illness scores worse respiratory failure higher d-dimer and c-reactive protein concentrations lower lymphocyte counts and secondary infections5 8 12 15 18 21 22 23 24 although patients older than 60 years account for more than 80 of deaths younger patients are not spared21 22 the median time from symptom onset to death is 28 weeks whereas the median time from symptom onset to clinical recovery is 68 weeks8 18 prediction of the trajectory of illness from symptom onset is difficult and prognostic tools and biomarkers are urgently needed5
 
figure 1
suggests an initial approach for icu practitioners who are called to assess a patient with suspected covid-19 infection the non-specific clinical features do not easily distinguish severe covid-19 from other causes of severe community-acquired pneumonia25 who suggests that covid-19 be suspected in patients with acute respiratory illness and fever plus travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission or contact with a confirmed or probable covid-19 case in the 14 days before symptom onset and in patients with severe acute respiratory illness who require hospitalisation without an alternative diagnosis that fully explains the clinical presentation26 given the exponential rise in the number of areas with community transmission worldwide and the substantial risk of missing cases early in a local outbreak9 icu practitioners should increasingly have a high index of suspicion and a low threshold for diagnostic testing for any patient with severe acute respiratory infection where available diagnosis is based on rt-pcr assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 patients with pneumonia might have falsely negative upper respiratory tract samples20 although sampling from the lower respiratory tract is recommended by who such as with sputum and endotracheal aspirates26 this procedures potentially generate aerosol and must be performed with strict airborne precautions8 27 although the diagnostic yield of bronchoalveolar lavage for covid-19 might be high28 bronchoscopy should generally be avoided to minimise exposure of health-care workers to sars-cov-229 30 the sensitivity of rt-pcr assays for the critically ill is currently unknown repeated sampling might be required when initial tests are negative despite suspicious clinical features31 importantly rt-pcr assays might be unavailable in many icus and where available still take time to run meanwhile serological assays are being developed32
 specific data on supportive icu care for covid-19 are lacking and current recommendations are based on existing evidence from other viral respiratory infections and general intensive care management figure 2

 reports suggest that non-invasive ventilation niv and high-flow nasal cannula hfnc were used in between one-third and two-thirds of critically ill patients with covid-19 in china11 12 13 15 minimal data exist to confirm or refute safety concerns regarding the risk of aerosol generation by these devices epidemiological data suggest that niv was associated with nosocomial transmission of sars34 however human laboratory data suggest that niv does not generate aerosols35 suggestions that hfnc might be safe are questionable studies that might be taken to support the safety of hfnc were not designed to show whether or not hfnc is aerosol generating and did not examine the spread of viruses36 37 moreover although niv might reduce intubation and mortality in mild ards38 it is associated with higher mortality in moderate-to-severe ards from multiple causes39 and a high risk of failure in mers40 although weak evidence suggests that hfnc might reduce intubation rates without affecting mortality in unselected patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure41 delayed intubation as a consequence of its use might increase mortality42 thus niv and hfnc should be reserved for patients with mild ards until further data are available with close monitoring airborne precautions and preferably use of single rooms thresholds for intubation in the event of deterioration and the absence of single rooms should be kept low extrapolating from sars intubation of patients with covid-19 also poses a risk of viral transmission to health-care workers and intubation drills are crucial34 43 the most skilled operator available should perform the task with full personal protective equipment ppe and the necessary preparation for difficult airways the number of assistants should be limited to reduce exposure bag-mask ventilation which generates aerosols should be minimised by prolonged pre-oxygenation a viral filter can be placed between the exhalation valve and the mask43 rapid sequence induction with muscle relaxants will reduce coughing end-tidal carbon dioxide detection and observation of chest rise should be used to confirm endotracheal tube placement the use of closed suctioning systems post-intubation will reduce aerosolisation a major focus of mechanical ventilation for covid-19 is the avoidance of ventilator-induced lung injury while facilitating gas exchange via lung-protective ventilation44 45 prone positioning should be applied early given its association with reduced mortality in other causes of severe ards although outcome data on prone positioning in covid-19 used in 12 of patients in one icu study from wuhan15 are currently lacking the tendency for sars-cov-2 to affect the peripheral and dorsal areas of the lungs provides the ideal conditions for a positive oxygenation response to prone positioning veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo is reserved for the most severe of ards patients in view of evidence that it might improve survival including in mers46 47 48 however the decision to provide very advanced care for fewer patients should be balanced against the requirement to provide less advanced care for more patients49 preliminary data for covid-19 are not encouraging11 13 15 17 in one report out of 28 patients who received ecmo 14 died nine were still on ecmo and only five were successfully weaned5
 patients with covid-19 might have hypovolaemia due to anorexia vomiting and diarrhoea11 12 13 14 15 nevertheless fluids should be administered cautiously and preferably with assessments for pre-load responsiveness such as the passive leg raise test given the high incidence of myocardial dysfunction in covid-1911 13 15 16 23 this incidence might be due to strong binding affinity of the sars-cov-2 spike protein to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 a membrane-bound receptor crucial for host cell entry that is expressed in the heart and lungs among other organs50 51 a conservative or de-resuscitative fluid strategy52 with early detection of myocardial involvement through the measurement of troponin and beta-natriuretic peptide concentrations and echocardiography53 54 and early use of vasopressors and inotropes are recommended figure 2 most patients with covid-19 in china were given empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics and many oseltamivir because laboratory diagnosis of covid-19 takes time and distinguishing the disease from other bacterial and viral pneumonias is often difficult11 12 13 14 15 one study of 201 patients with covid-19 found only one co-infection with a different virus and none with bacteria24 another study of 92 patients found six co-infections by other common respiratory viruses55 and a third study of 115 patients found five co-infections with influenza56 any empirical antibiotic and anti-influenza therapy should be rapidly de-escalated based on microbiology test results and clinical response chinese reports also show that systemic corticosteroids were administered to approximately half of patients with covid-19 with severe or critical illness12 13 14 15 17 a retrospective study of 84 patients with ards associated with covid-19 found lower mortality in those treated with methylprednisolone but the findings are limited by the observational design of the study small sample size and possible confounders24 because covid-19 might be associated with a cytokine storm like that seen in other viral infections immunosuppression has been proposed as an approach that might be beneficial for patients with signs of hyperinflammation such as increasing ferritin concentrations57 although the benefits of immunosuppression are unproven and the role of corticosteroids in covid-19 remains unclear a systematic review of observational studies of corticosteroids for sars found no impact on mortality but possible harms including avascular necrosis psychosis diabetes and delayed viral clearance58 similarly an observational study found that corticosteroids for mers did not affect mortality but did delay viral clearance59 a systematic review of observational studies suggested that corticosteroids might increase mortality and secondary infections in influenza60 until further data are available the routine use of corticosteroids in viral severe acute respiratory infections including covid-19 is not recommended61
 rapid liberation from invasive mechanical ventilation to reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia and to create icu capacity must be balanced against the risks of premature extubation especially without facilitative post-extubation niv and hfnc and subsequent re-intubation and the attendant risks of viral transmission to health-care workers transfer of patients out of the icu for investigations such as ct scans risks spreading sars-cov-2 and can be minimised with alternatives such as point-of-care ultrasound62 the latter was prioritised by some chinese icus and evidence of varying degrees of an interstitial pattern and consolidation on lung ultrasonography now exists for patients with covid-1963 64 finally the median icu length of stay for covid-19 was 8 days in a chinese report18 however larger studies are needed to better understand the course of covid-19 after admission to the icu who recommends that de-isolation of patients requires clinical recovery and two negative rt-pcr assays performed 24 h apart61 viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract continues beyond 10 days after symptom onset in severe covid-1965 this fact has significant implications for the use of isolation facilities no proven therapy for covid-19 exists but several candidatessome previously used against sars-cov and mers-covhave been used empirically and are undergoing investigation61 66

summarises the evidence for some of the more prominent therapies remdesivir67 68 69 70 lopinavirritonavir71 72 73 74 chloroquine75 76 77 hydroxychloroquine79 80 intravenous immunoglobulin81 82 convalescent plasma83 84 85 tocilizumab57 86 favipiravir87 and traditional chinese medicines88 89
 admittedly therapies for which efficacy is not supported by strong evidencenot in covid-19 and not even in sars and mersare being administered in the hope of improving outcomes before or in parallel with clinical studies this enthusiasm to try new therapies during outbreaks must be balanced against ethical and scientific safeguards during the ebola outbreak who experts concluded that due to exceptional circumstances it was ethically acceptable to offer unproven interventions that have shown promising results in the laboratory and in animal models but have not yet been evaluated for safety and efficacy in humans as potential treatment or prevention90 during the sars outbreak however ribavirin was widely used but was subsequently found to be at best ineffective and at worst harmful58 although expert guidance can be sought from local or international societies patients treated with experimental therapies should be enrolled in a clinical study when possible covid-19 is extremely transmissible with every case seeding more than two secondary cases10 91 in the who-china joint mission report 2055 health-care workers accounted for 37 of cases with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 in china8 who recommends that ppe for health-care workers providing direct care to patients with covid-19 should include medical masks gowns gloves and eye protection with goggles or face shields92 for aerosol-generating procedures tracheal intubation niv tracheostomy cardiopulmonary resuscitation bag-mask ventilation and bronchoscopy masks should be n95 or ffp2-equivalent respirators and gowns or aprons should be fluid resistant although some clinicians have suggested the additional use of powered air-purifying respirators paprsgiven accounts of health-care workers acquiring sars despite wearing n95 respirators and available albeit limited evidence that paprs result in less contamination of health-care workers43their use comes with significant logistical challenges93
 there are several pitfalls related to ppe close attention to the supply chain is needed given the global shortage of medical masks and respirators5 6 94 reuse between patients and use beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life might be required95 fit testingpreferably done before outbreaksis crucial and should be regularly performed as facial contours change with time96 non-n95 reusable masks with high-efficiency particulate air hepa filters that do not require fit testing might be considered96 although health-care workers often focus on donning ppe data suggest a substantial risk of self-contamination when doffing ppe97 training on the specific steps of wearing and removing ppe together with hand cleansing is crucial and references for these procedures are widely available98 building a safety culture and encouraging staff to point out protocol errors were useful to reduce nosocomial sars transmission99
 surface decontamination is also key to infection prevention viable sars-cov-2 persists on inanimate surfaces such as plastic and stainless steel for up to 72 h27 because more than one-third of health-care workers mobile phones might be contaminated with common viral pathogens100 these should be cleaned regularly or wrapped with specimen bags that are discarded after contact with patients or daily environmental contamination by sars-cov-2 was detected on furniture and equipment within a patients room and toilet in singapore101 during the mers outbreak in south korea viable coronavirus was detected on doorknobs bed guardrails air exhaust dampers and elevators102 immediate and proper disposal of soiled objects is also warranted as sars-cov-2 might be transmitted faecally28 31 101
 visits to the icu should be restricted or banned to prevent further transmission except perhaps for the imminently dying63 93 where feasible video conferencing via mobile phones or other interfaces can be used for communication between family members and patients or health-care workers to protect other patients and health-care workers critically ill patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19 should ideally be admitted to an airborne infection isolation room aiir that is at negative pressure relative to surrounding areas with accessible sinks and alcohol hand gel dispensers figure 1 especially if aerosol-generating procedures are done103 however a survey of 335 icus across 20 asian countries showed that only 12 of icu rooms were aiirs and 37 of icus had no aiirs during the sars outbreak in singapore negative pressure ventilation was created by mounting industrial exhaust fans93
 if aiirs are unavailable patients can be placed in adequately ventilated single rooms with the doors closed as recommended by who104 in the same asian survey only 37 of icu rooms were single rooms and 13 of icus had no single rooms105 the number of single rooms and aiirs was generally lowest in low-income countries where single icu rooms are unavailable cohorting of cases in shared rooms with dedicated staff is an alternative with beds spaced apart104 although the current evidence points towards droplet rather than airborne transmission of covid-198 concerns of nosocomial transmission in shared rooms remain especially when aerosol-generating procedures are performed thus ppe should be considered for patients in shared rooms oxygen masks with hepa filters might provide some protection for non-intubated patients106
 controlling the community spread of covid-19 is difficult but possible107 and crucial for the preservation of icu capacity national and regional modelling of needs for intensive care is crucial9 10 many countries might not have enough icu beds in the first place let alone isolation or single rooms the median number of critical care beds per 100 000 population was 23 in ten low-income and lower-middle-income countries 46 in five upper-middle-income countries and 123 in eight high-income countries in asia in one analysis108 and 96 in 28 high-income countries in europe in a 2012 report109 china an upper-middle-income country has 36 critical care beds per 100 000 population108 and wuhan was initially overwhelmed by covid-195 6 15 italy a high-income country with 125 critical care beds per 100 000 population109 continues to struggle with the outbreak9 10 110 by contrast a low-income country such as uganda has only 01 critical care bed per 100 000 population108 111 this raises serious concerns about the ability of resource-limited settings to manage critically ill patients with covid-19112
 most countries cannot match chinas feat of rapidly building new hospitals and icus during the covid-19 outbreak in wuhan15 surges in the number of critically ill patients with covid-19 can occur rapidly thus icu practitioners hospital administrators governments and policy makers must plan in advance for a substantial increase in critical care bed capacity9 10 113 adding beds into a pre-existing icu is a possibility but space constraints and nosocomial transmission from crowding limit this option6 other options include the provision of intensive care outside icus such as in high-dependency units remodelled general wards post-anaesthesia care units emergency departments or deployable field units figure 16 113 another option is the transfer of patients to designated hospitals and icus although the centralisation of expertise and resources might improve outcomes and efficiency these benefits must be weighed against the risks of inter-hospital transfer6 9 the sustainability of depending on a few centres or scarcity thereof even as the outbreak worsens must be considered a substantial increase in icu capacity involves increases not only in bed numbers but also in equipment eg ventilators consumables pharmaceuticals and staffing6 10 93 113 although focusing on bed numbers without ensuring the availability of necessary equipment is unsafe such equipment might be in short supply use of transport operating theatre and military ventilators might be required to reduce strain on icus elective surgeries should be postponed and lower-acuity patients discharged to other areas including designated de-escalation wards for recovering icu patients with covid-19 who might still require isolation high icu workload-to-staffing ratios are associated with an increase in patient mortality114 augmentation of staff with colleagues from other icus or even non-icu areas might be required6 training of these external staff on general intensive care management and specific covid-19 protocols is crucial6 93 113 standardised short courses exist115 such as the basic course which incorporates a mobile app for access to course material while caring for patients incredibly more than 40 000 health-care workers were deployed from other parts of china to wuhan8 however as the pandemic spreads support from other sectors of a hospital or a country might increasingly be scarce as every area starts to become overwhelmed staffing of icus must take into account the risk that health-care workers might become infected with sars-cov-26 93 minimising the risk of infection is essential not only because of the direct loss of manpower but because of the potentially devastating effect of staff infection on morale which might result in absenteeism where possible rostering of staff should consider segregation of teams to limit unprotected exposure of all team members to infected patients or colleagues and the resultant loss of staff to illness medical leave or quarantine116 physical distancing of staff including having meals separately is important travel restrictions to limit exposure to covid-19 are being implemented and should be considered worldwide117
 health-care workers in icus are especially vulnerable to mental health problems including depression and anxiety during outbreaks like covid-19 because of the constant fear of being infected and the demanding workload118 staff who worked in high-risk sars units continued to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder years later119 measures to prevent such problems include a focus on infection prevention to reassure staff clear communication from hospital and icu leadership limitation of shift hours and provision of rest areas where feasible and mental health support through multidisciplinary teams including psychiatrists psychologists and counsellors117 118
 should icus become overwhelmed by covid-19 despite surge strategies5 6 9 10 15 critical care triage that prioritises patients for intensive care and rations scarce resources will be required figure 1110 120 this applies to patients with and without covid-19 because both groups will be competing for the same icu resources critical care triage is ethically complex and can be emotionally draining it should ideally be coordinated at a regional or national health-care systems level and some countries have now provided guidelines for covid-19121 122 a triage policy implemented by clinicians trained in triage or senior icu practitioners complemented by clinical decision support systems might identify patients with such a low probability of survival that they are unlikely to benefit from icu care120 although generic physiological outcome prediction scores might not accurately predict the course of illness5 older adults with comorbidities higher d-dimer and c-reactive protein concentrations and lower lymphocyte counts do worse5 8 12 15 18 21 22 23 24 rationing of resources also involves the withholding and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments for existing icu patients to this end it is noteworthy that a quarter of patients who died early in the wuhan outbreak did not receive invasive ventilation5
 a search of whos international clinical trials registry platform on march 31 2020 revealed 667 registered trials on covid-19 although many are trials of repurposed or experimental therapeutic agents other more basic questions that are equally crucial should be addressed through research some of these questions have been listed as potential challenges in table 1 table 2 the short-term and long-term prognoses of critically ill patients have to be clarified data on the effectiveness of niv and hfnc and the associated risk of viral transmission remain scarce34 35 36 37 the risk of nosocomial transmission in shared icu rooms should be studied more data on cardiac involvement and myocardial dysfunction are needed11 13 15 16 23 the role of ecmo is unclear49 the indications for corticosteroids should be crystallised while considering interactions between different therapies61 for example although limited by confounding from differences in baseline severities a post-hoc analysis of a non-covid-19 ards trial suggested that beta-interferon use was associated with higher mortality compared with placebo in patients receiving corticosteroids but not in those who were not on corticosteroids123
 multiple challenges to research exist during pandemics first the surge of disease often outpaces the traditional steps for research including protocol design securing of funding and ethics approval all amidst busy clinical work pre-approved adaptable plans drawn prior to an outbreak are useful for example several interventions against sars-cov-2 are being incorporated into the randomized embedded multi-factorial adaptive platform trial for community-acquired pneumonia remap-cap a pre-approved platform trial for severe community-acquired pneumonia second many ongoing studies of covid-19 are single-centre and underpowered to detect significant differences in meaningful outcomes between arms to this end pandemics provide a great opportunity for collaboration platforms such as the international severe acute respiratory and emerging infection consortium isaric and the international forum for acute care trialists infactformed during the 2009 h1n1 pandemicenable large research networks to share common goals and standardise data collection globally124 who has also produced a master protocol for trials on experimental therapeutics for covid-19125 last the pace of research and data sharing must be balanced with scientific quality and ethical integrity chinas rapid sharing of the sars-cov-2 genetic code had an immediate impact on case identification isolation and the spread of the virus126 the covid-19 pandemic also saw a ballooning of the number of preprints manuscripts openly posted online before peer review during the ebola and zika outbreaks the median time between preprints and peer-reviewed publication was 150 days127 although preprints rapidly provide new knowledge icu practitioners should be aware of the potential compromise in data quality when the conventional peer-review process is bypassed a systematic review also found that only 50 of ebola intervention studies fully complied with frameworks for ethical trial conduct128
 as countries ramp up efforts to prevent or delay the spread of covid-19 the world must prepare for the possibility that containment and mitigation measures might fail even if sars-cov-2 infects a small proportion of the 78 billion people on earth many thousands will still become critically ill and require icu care the icu community must brace itself for this potentially overwhelming surge of patients and optimise workflows in advance for rapid diagnosis and isolation clinical management and infection prevention hospital administrators governments and policy makers must work with icu practitioners to prepare for a substantial increase in critical care bed capacity they must protect health-care workers from nosocomial transmission physical exhaustion and mental health issues that might be aggravated by the need to make ethically difficult decisions on the rationing of intensive care researchers must address key questions about what remains a poorly understood disease collaboration at the local regional national and international levelwith a focus on high-quality research evidence-based practice sharing of data and resources and ethical integrity in the face of unprecedented challengeswill be key to the success of these efforts

  rationing in a pandemic lessons from italy lucia crax marco vergano julian savulescu dominic wilkinson   in late february and early march 2020 while infection rates in china fell italy became the european epicenter of the coronavirus sars-cov-2 2020 epidemic at the beginning of may 2020 italy entered the so called phase two consisting in a progressive reopening of business and social activities while monitoring the eventual raise of the epidemic curve phase two posed a number of ethical questions such as finding a new balance between personal liberties and public health privacy concerns from the use of movement tracking apps and down the line access to vaccines or improved medications we think that it is however important to look back and determine which lessons can be derived from the way italy confronted the scarcity of medical resources available to confront the epidemic especially since this experience can prove invaluable for other countries that are still facing the epidemic peak in the paper we analyze the features of the italian recommendations why the raised heated debate and why it is important to have ethical guidelines and balanced and consistent allocation procedures to prioritize patients in march and april 2020 a huge effort was made by the national government to flatten the epidemic surge by enforcing increasingly stringent containment measures in order to reduce the impact of the outbreak on the health system despite facing a likely major social and economic crisis the italian government imposed a nationwide lockdown on 9 march prohibition of all movements of people within the whole territory and closure of all non-essential business activities some think a systematic and strong response arrived too late pisano et al 2020 such measures inevitably have a delayed impact and hospitals were hit by what has been called a medical tsunami with high caseload punctuated by a stream of deaths the enormous challenge for the health systemfacing a dramatic shortage of icu beds and staffhas been how to meet the medical needs of patients affected by covid-19 even though authorities state that no cases of people who failed to get into intensive care have been reported many italian physicians working in icus in northern italy have stated otherwise as has the mayor of bergamo one of the hardest-hit cities ansa 2020 nacoti et al 2020 rosenbaum 2020 guerzoni 2020 professionals experienced uncertainty and distress about how to allocate the dramatically scarce resources available as that situation was unprecedented for everyone in some hospitals at the peak of the surge the rationing involved not only ventilators but oxygen as well at the beginning of march some hospitals around milan were already collapsing some of them admitting more than 200 patients with severe respiratory failure every day as difficult allocation choices were already being made clinicians including one of the authors mv of the ethics section of the italian society of anesthesia analgesia resuscitation and intensive care siaarti were asked to publish guidance on the allocation of limited resources they worked between shifts to construct the recommendations box 1 that sparked a heated debate immediately after the release box 1 key elements of siaarti recommendations vergano et al 2020a b the recommendations issued by siaarti suggest that if a choice to ration medical equipment and intervention is needed the maximum individual benefit in terms of expected life yearslikelihood of survival plus remaining likely years of a patients lifeshould be prioritized according to this principle the recommendations suggested evaluating age comorbidities and functional status of any critically ill patient this was subsequently criticized as ageist as well as unconstitutional and discriminatory against elderly patients fnomceo 2020 quotidiano sanit 2020a b rodriquez 2020 it was perceived as not consistent with the values on which the healthcare system is grounded according to the siaarti guidance the drivers of decision for admission to icu should be the clinical picture taking into account biological not mere chronological age comorbidities and preexisting functional status this kind of soft utilitarian approach is already applied in italy in specific fields of dramatically scarce resources such as organ transplants cillo et al 2015 this approach is justified by the need to maximize the achievable benefit in terms of life years gained thus optimizing the use of available resources not only the probability of survival and the greatest life expectancy are considered but also the predicted length of the icu stay and hence the use of intensive care resources nonetheless this kind of approach is the opposite of the egalitarianism that pervades the wider italian healthcare system sometimes in pursuing what is good we run the risk of forgetting what is fair in emergencies the patient-centered duty to care needs to be balanced with public-focused duties to promote equality of persons and equity in distribution of risks and benefits also individual allocating decisions must be supported by fair institutional processes that may include strategies such as preparing conserving substituting adapting re-using and re-allocating resources hick et al 2020 in every single country facing covid-19 emergency if no ethical guidelines or balanced and consistent allocation procedures are applied to prioritize patients there is a concrete risk for unfair choices emanuel et al 2020 should the shortage arise with no rationing plan in action decisions would be left to the ruling of local healthcare and hospital authorities or to the clinicians judgment in the heat of the moment resulting in approaches both inconsistent and uncoordinated one motivating concern for the siaarti guidance was the real chance that the prevalent criterion would be first come first served such an approach appears to remove responsibility for choice over life and death and can be thought as avoiding having to make ethically fraught choices between patients we will only point out in passing that from an ethical standpoint there is no actual difference between action and inaction when they both cause harm and injustice choosing first come first served is to be responsible for the foreseeable avoidable deaths of many people in a pandemic moreover this approach would also carry the huge risk of social unrest and riots due to the rush to obtain hospital beds or at the very least hospital overcrowding with the ensuing risk of further spread of infection major inequities would also arise from a self-made utilitarian approach by the clinicians left to their own individual intuitions the risk of arbitrariness and disparities of judgment is only partially reduced by the recommendations that do not set specific thresholds and state that cutoffs must remain flexible the aim is to provide a guidance not a substitution of the individual clinical judgment last but not the least individual physicians would be as it happened in italy under a tremendous moral distress facing such a terrible task of improvising decisions about whom to treat they would literally be out on an ethical limb in italy as elsewhere in the world we were dramatically unprepared for such a startling emergency and not just because we had not enough icu beds staffing or funding we were not prepared at all to face such dramatic choices in retrospect the siaarti recommendations might have been written differently it would have been better to have had a chance to involve members of the wider community in reflection on how to make decisions in the event of such a health emergency as was done in maryland in the usa in 20122015 daugherty biddison et al 2019 in maryland multiple forums were held with the general public and with healthcare workers and disaster professionals using a deliberative democracy approach input from citizens was then fed into policy recommendations developed by an expert working group this kind of approach would have given the recommendations greater legitimacy and might have provided additional support to clinicians we do not know what the future will be like after the pandemic but it is clear that we should try to rethink the whole issue of allocation of scarce resources in emergency conditions finding out commonly shared and accepted values to construct a contingency plan with sound and consistent ethical guidelines and proper structuressuch as triage committeesto help apply guidelines relieving the individual front-line clinicians of that burden the approach is similar to other settings but this is not acknowledged by the general public or better by the critics of the triage recommendations now more than ever we are aware that a universal functional and proactive public healthcare system has the best chances of appropriately facing an unforeseen outbreak of a viral disease its full functionality is important at the early stage when no specific immunization or treatment interventions are available since it guarantees proper infrastructures to mobilize a testing regime that provides the data that health-policy leaders need to make decisions and it guarantees a fair and consistent access to supportive care it will become crucial later when drugs and vaccines will hopefully be available to define their price and deliver them widely effectively and fairly we do not know yet if this hard time will turn into a global catastrophe but should learn from the history of past epidemics that one of the highest risks is to give wrong priorities jones 2020 box 2 box 2 key lessons from italy  special considerations in the management of adult patients with

outbreak has spread to more than 180 countries with the usa reporting the most confirmed cases worldwide as of may 2020 and widespread infection ie reports of covid-19 in all 50 states the case fatality rate believed to be at least 1 is uncertain and might vary by country1 quarantine and physical distancing measures have been implemented in most jurisdictions to slow down the spread of the virus older and immunocompromised populations appear to be at a higher risk for severe potentially life-threatening illness related to covid-19 compared with the general population with reported case fatality rates as high as 15 in patients aged 80 years or older2 this observation presents a particular concern for patients with myeloid neoplasms including acute myeloid leukaemia myelodysplastic syndromes myeloproliferative neoplasms and overlap disorders with features of both myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms all of which present at a median age of 6570 years3 4 although patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia are generally younger the age distribution at presentation is bimodal with an increasing incidence of disease in patients older than 45 years moreover treatment for acute lymphocytic leukaemia is highly immunosuppressive and often prolonged in duration thus the risk of complications related to covid-19 in these patients is a concern early data from the chinese national database repository suggest an over-representation of patients with cancer in the covid-19 cohort5 covid-19-related case fatality rates are estimated to be 56 in those with cancer2 and patients with cancer are at a 35 times higher risk of severe covid-19 compared with the general population5 additionally case fatality rates of up to 37 have been reported in patients with haematological malignancies and covid-196 one study found that case fatality rates were much higher in hospitalised patients with haematological cancers who developed covid-19 than in hospitalised health-care providers with covid-197 however the exact incidence of covid-19 in patients with cancer in general and in patients with leukaemias in particular is unclear resource allocation that prioritises the care of patients with covid-19 will affect the care of patients with other serious medical conditions such as haematological malignancies compounding the problem is the disruption to the timely delivery of cancer-directed therapies because of constraints on access to healthcare and the supply of blood products and the disruption to the supply chain of drug therapies and medical supplies during the pandemic moreover the manpower and time needed in screening for sars-cov-2 and the risks and consequences of sars-cov-2 infection among health-care personnel have had an effect across all diagnostic specialities8 therefore the minimisation and rationing of oncology care while assuring the best possible treatment for patients with cancer requires pandemic planning and collaboration by haematology and oncology representatives local health organisations and policy makers9
 this viewpoint provides a summary of the current challenges in caring for patients with acute leukaemias ie acute myeloid leukaemia and acute lymphocytic leukaemia and other myeloid neoplasms ie myelodysplastic syndromes myeloproliferative neoplasms and overlap syndromes and offers a consensus on clinical practice guidance for optimal care in both the university and community health-care settings the paucity of evidence-based data to guide leukaemia management during the pandemic prompted an online discussion which initially involved leukaemia experts from highly affected areas in the usa in which aspects of leukaemia care during the initial days of the covid-19 pandemic were discussed subsequently sharing this collective experience with the larger community of leukaemia care providers was recognised to be prudent given the wide and rapidly progressing effects of the pandemic to gain further input and perspective from different parts of the usa and other countries around the world additional authors were invited to participate in the collaborative effort on the basis of their speciality and location the experts on our panel are haematologists and oncologists who are highly specialised in leukaemia myeloid neoplasms and transplant care discussions were held through virtual online meetings given the scarcity of evidence-based data on the management of leukaemias in the context of covid-19 recommendations in this viewpoint are based largely on expert opinion and experience and complement the guidelines issued by relevant medical societies because of the fluid health-care situation amid a rapidly evolving outbreak the actions and contingency plans proposed in this viewpoint should be considered in the context of disruptions to the local health system we address various aspects of clinical management and provide specific suggestions to optimise the treatment of patients with haematological malignancies during the covid-19 pandemic panel 1

panel 1summary of key recommendations
shifting care to the outpatient setting
leukaemia providers should determine how long patients can be managed for without in-person follow-up blood tests and therapies including blood product support the frequency of clinic visitations should be individualised and will vary by the acuity of the illness the need for close monitoring of potential complications during therapy and blood product and medication supply among other factorstelehealth services eg telemedicine and video conferencing provide valuable delivery platforms to facilitate adherence to physical distancing guidelines and should be preferred for patientprovider encounters that do not require infusional therapy transfusions or laboratory tests
ethics resource allocation and advance care planning
haematologists caring for patients under crisis standards of care are advised to consult with the centralised hospital ethics committee to address complex ethical issues involving the rationing of lifesaving interventions when the situation arisesalthough the overarching goal is to offer potentially curative treatments when appropriate the futility of further treatment in patients with advanced multi-line refractory disease who have exhausted standard-of-care options and are without access to clinical trials must be consideredhaematologists should have goals-of-care discussions with all patients with haematological malignancies under their care particularly older patients 60 years and those with a haematological malignancy associated with a poor prognosis such goals-of-care discussions in the covid-19 era by stressing the potential resource limitations might considerably reduce the proportion of patients with advanced disease who elect for intubation thereby resulting in the modification of current treatment goals preventing inappropriate escalation of care10

blood product and transfusion management
during times of blood product shortages we recommend maintaining a haemoglobin serum concentration of more than 7 gdl for patients with haematological malignancies requiring red blood cell transfusion with a higher threshold for those with burdensome symptoms or serious comorbidities such as active cardiopulmonary disease consider increasing the intervals between transfusion episodes with more red blood cell units transfused per episodewe recommend a phased response for platelet transfusions on the basis of the estimation of available blood bank resources during times of severe shortage avoiding prophylactic transfusions even if platelet concentration is less than 10 000 platelets per l in the absence of bleeding with consideration of the prophylactic use of antifibrinolytics could be considered
growth factor support
the benefit of minimising the duration of neutropenia with growth factors must be balanced against the rare but potential risk of worsening the pulmonary complications related to covid-1911 there is a theoretical risk of worsening pulmonary inflammatory injury by the use of growth factors in moderate-to-severe active covid-19 one setting in which the use of growth factors should be reconsidered12 13

clinical trials
continued participant accrual in clinical trials investigating drugs of probable therapeutic benefit and in late salvage trials offering the only viable option for patients with advanced leukaemia is recommended whenever logistically possibleenrolment in clinical trials in which patients are randomly assigned to commercially available standard-of-care therapies might place patients at unnecessary risk to comply with study-related procedures and therefore continued enrolment in these trials in the pandemic should be re-evaluatedfor patients with relapsed or refractory haematological malignancies for whom clinical trials represent the only viable treatment option the decision to participate in a trial will need to be pursued on a case-by-case basisonsite monitoring is inconsistent with physical distancing goals and protocol deviations are unavoidable the us food and drug administration the european medicines agency health canada and other regulatory agencies have issued guidance on the safe conduct of trials during the pandemic
general approach to treatment and legal ramifications
careful clinical judgment must balance the risks and benefits of various treatment options and patient burden to allow for the best possible outcomes the goal should still be to not compromise care for patients whose cancer is curable despite the pandemicsubstituting standard-of-care intensive chemotherapy with potentially suboptimal less intensive treatment regimens to reduce inpatient bed and intensive care bed use requires a transparent discussion between the patient and the providerdiscussions with patients regarding deviations in therapy from the standard of care to lessen the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection proceeding with therapy with the possibility of greater morbidity in the event of a sars-cov-2 infection or deviations in planned therapy if cancer centre resources are compromised unexpectedly should be endorsed at a unit level and documented in the patient notes to show the process for these decisions
research agenda
the american society of hematology has launched a global registry initiative intended to provide periodically updated summaries of observational data to physicians we encourage physicians who treat patients with leukaemia to submit their data on patients with haematological malignancies and covid-19 to this publicly accessible resource patients with haematological malignancies undergoing therapy require expert supportive care services that can be severely strained during a pandemic despite preparedness plans prioritising the support and safety of the health-care staff a considerable number of health-care personnel will probably become unavailable because of sickness mandated quarantines fear of exposure or concerns about family safety8 14 furthermore some personnel will be required to or volunteer to take on additional patient care responsibilities could come to work regardless of a high personal risk eg from old age or comorbid conditions adopt not yet fully proven mitigation strategies or inadvertently expose other essential colleagues which is a particular risk given the high incidence of subclinical infections15
 challenges in resource allocation are likely to be greatest at institutions already functioning at their maximum workforce capacity8 physical distancing measures and efforts to minimise the exposure of patients with comorbidities such as haematological malignancies to health-care environments will have detrimental downstream effects on the delivery of healthcare including fewer in-person patient visits delays in timely laboratory testing interruptions to chemotherapy administration despite many treatments depending on timely cyclic administration and delays to surgical and radiation therapy planning16 patients with haematological malignancies should follow standard precautions related to covid-19 and minimise physical contact similar to the recommendations for older patients specific to patients with haematological malignancies physical distancing measures and fear of infection have an effect on the willingness and ability of volunteers to donate blood products resulting in potential shortages of red blood cells platelets and plasma factors consequently institutions could implement more restrictive transfusion guidelines liberalise the use of erythroid growth factors or do both to decrease transfusion needs delaying the administration of therapies including cellular and immunological approaches for which supportive interventions eg tocilizumab might be commandeered to manage sars-cov-2 infections needs to be considered to maximise the effect of physical distancing measures in-person hospital visits should be minimised as much as possible for the safety of both the patients and the staff17 it is also recommended that all personnel involved in the care of patients with haematological malignancies including patients asymptomatic for covid-19 in addition to using appropriate personal protective equipment and infection control procedures be routinely tested for sars-cov-2 if logistically possible and the frequency of which should be based on the local patterns and frequency of sars-cov-2 infections16 17 additionally we strongly recommend that covid-19 areas and oncology departments in hospitals are strictly separated with a view towards keeping the cancer wards and clinics free of covid-19 one approach in such cases might be to have separately staffed wards one for patients who are positive for sars-cov-2 one for patients who are negative for sars-cov-2 and a third to isolate patients until their covid-19 status is known each nursing unit should develop and follow pre-emptive strategies to avoid patientpatient and staffpatient transmission especially in wards with patients who are immunosuppressed and in whom the adverse consequences of such transmission might be serious limiting in-person visits for patients in an in-house palliative care unit can have a considerable effect on both patients and families with respect to quality of life the implementation of non-traditional strategies to deliver healthcare such as telehealth platforms has the potential to partially mitigate the negative effect physical distancing has on the delivery of cancer care18 however for patients with haematological malignancies remote healthcare is often insufficient given their need for frequent phlebotomies transfusion support and scheduled treatments health-care providers will need to prioritise patients on the basis of the urgency and the goals of care in some cases treatment and assessment can be safely delayed and in-person visits can be avoided via the use of telehealth or remote communication approaches in other cases such as for patients who require urgent life-sustaining or potentially curative therapies in-person visits are essential if possible patients should receive therapy in their local area to minimise travel to large academic centres because of rising demand and scarce resources hospital systems face ethical challenges in the rationing of health-care resources19 rationing access to and services for intensive care units to those who are critically ill and near the end of life poses a challenge for and disrupts the equipoise of the health-care provider rationing these lifesaving yet finite resources is an ethically complex decision making process that requires balancing and rectifying ethically competing goals9 19 community-based guidelines have been put in place during crisis standards of care to deal with the issues of resource use that could arise if lifesaving measures are in short supply20 we strongly advise haematologists and intensive care physicians caring for patients under crisis standards of care to consult with centralised hospital ethics committees who can provide guidance in cases where complex ethical issues involving the rationing of lifesaving interventions might arise although various a priori approaches have been suggested to facilitate resource triage during a pandemic fair resource allocation at the patient level should be based on judgment by experienced intensive care physicians using established evidence-based prognostic scores useful online resources and publications exist that outline frameworks for identifying key ethical issues during a pandemic and guidelines on ways to navigate these issues21 22 the availability of adequate and timely intensive care support is crucial for oncology and haematology treatment programmes eg intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation in these circumstances not only should any uncertainties regarding the availability of intensive care unit support be considered during treatment planning discussions but the haematologist must be prepared to deliver precise information on life expectancy and potential long-term individual outcomes to the intensive care provider the haematologist should be willing to appropriately advocate for the treatment of their patients with curable haematological malignancies in cases of overzealous restriction of resources in essence we must recognise that some patients with haematological malignancies who require admission to intensive care units for reasons related or unrelated to covid-19 have cancers that are still curable so deprioritising their access to intensive care units should be avoided blood product transfusion support is an integral aspect of supportive care and many curative therapies eg intensive induction and allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation require that patients reliably receive blood product transfusion support during protracted myelosuppression conversely patients without the prospect of cure might still glean clinical benefit from non-intensive therapies or best supportive care and transfusion support is often fundamental for these patients23 patients receiving chronic transfusion support not only represent a considerable logistical challenge to the hospital systems blood bank capability but are also a potential source of sars-cov-2 transmission because of frequent exposure to other patients and staff concerns over blood donor safety in the covid-19 era taken together with physical distancing and quarantining initiatives have prompted donor deferral to the detriment of the pool of blood product donors an inherently high demand for blood products among patients with haematological malignancies coupled with a diminished donor pool and a reduction in blood bank service providers places severe strain on the cancer centres capacity to provide transfusions although most blood management groups generally follow restrictive thresholds for transfusion based on national guidelines ie transfusion is not indicated until the haemoglobin serum concentration is 78 gdl24 this approach might not be appropriate for certain populations at high risk of complications related to anaemia including those who are older 60 years and those who have cardiovascular disease25 controversy remains about the appropriate haemoglobin trigger threshold for red blood cell transfusion in patients with various myeloid neoplasms26 resulting in a wide variation in transfusion practices among physicians and institutions27 regardless contingency plans for emergency transfusion might require the adoption of increasingly restrictive transfusion thresholds to match the constraints on blood product supply consideration should also be given to increasing the interval between transfusion episodes and increasing the number of transfusion units given per episode thereby reducing the number of patient visits to health-care institutions28 where possible community-based blood draws for blood count and cross-matching should be implemented nonetheless a severe shortage of blood products and uncertainty about future supply should prompt clinicians to discuss risks and benefits with their patients especially if intensive myelosuppressive chemotherapy is under consideration given the short shelf life of platelets platelet availability is particularly problematic in the event of blood product shortages28 we propose a stepwise approach to platelet transfusion in patients with haematological malignancies on the basis of the estimation of resources in the local blood bank if platelet resources are unaffected locally continue with local institutional policies if platelet availability is reduced initial strategies to conserve platelet stocks include avoiding prophylactic platelet transfusions for surgical interventions by deferring non-urgent procedures and establishing an inpatient and outpatient threshold for prophylactic platelet transfusions of less than 10 000 platelets per l for the overall population with chronic needs for situations in which the available pool of platelet products is very low we advocate for a strategy of non-prophylactic platelet transfusion on the basis of data showing no survival benefit for prophylactic platelet transfusions among patients with haematological malignancies undergoing chemotherapy29 30 additional strategies in times of serious shortage could include avoiding prophylactic platelet transfusions with rare exceptions eg disseminated intravascular coagulation and coagulopathy of acute promyelocytic leukaemia and considering the use of prophylactic antifibrinolytics such as aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid if the risk of bleeding is high in patients negative for sars-cov-2 infection31
 although early studies32 33 have presented conflicting data on the detection of sars-cov-2 rna and infectious virus in blood specimens and blood borne transmission of sars-cov-2 has yet to be reported the us food and drug administration fda recommends donor deferral measures to prevent the transmission of sars-cov-2 via blood components34 these measures include the careful screening of blood donors for symptoms of covid-19 and the recalling of untransfused blood products from infected donors to address the urgent need for blood components in certain areas the fda has revised these recommendations by for example reducing the deferral period in populations at high risk such as men who have sex with men and donors who have travelled to or from covid-19 endemic areas to encourage more blood donations35
 the use of prophylactic antimicrobials constitutes an important aspect of leukaemia management for disease-induced and chemotherapy-induced neutropenia36 many chemotherapy protocols for myeloid neoplasms do not incorporate the routine use of haematopoietic colony-stimulating factors eg granulocyte colony-stimulating factor to prevent chemotherapy-induced neutropenia the use of growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or other myeloid growth factors should probably be avoided in patients with moderate-to-severe sars-cov-2 infection given the potential risk of exacerbating inflammatory pulmonary injury especially in the case of patients with disorders that have overlap between myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms12 13
 although patients with haematological malignancies and neutropenia are potentially at a higher risk of having severe covid-19 compared with the general population because of an immunocompromised state the differential diagnosis for neutropenic fever remains broad and empirical antibacterial therapy should be initiated promptly pending further workup we recommend screening for sars-cov-2 in all patients with haematological malignancies and a fever whenever possible and before haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation cellular therapy such as with chimeric antigen receptor t cells and chemotherapy we recommend that when sars-cov-2 is identified in a patient with neutropenic fever with or without respiratory symptoms well established protocols of broad-spectrum and even antifungal agent administration should be applied along with covid-19 therapies specific to the institution given the safety concerns surrounding hepatotoxicity and qt interval prolongation corrected for heart rate with some of the agents used to treat patients with covid-19 such as hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin we do not recommend prophylaxis with these agents for patients with haematological malignancies negative for sars-cov-2 however several ongoing clinical trials in north america and elsewhere should provide further guidance on this point eg nct04330495 and nct04329923 because of the increasing concern that microthrombosis is contributing to the pathophysiology of covid-19 many institutions are now adopting prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation as a part of their treatment algorithms for the infection37 careful consideration and frequent monitoring of coagulation markers and platelet counts in the context of acute leukaemia should be undertaken when making decisions regarding the administration of anticoagulation minimising the disruption to clinical care and preserving the integrity of clinical trials is a major challenge during a pandemic physical distancing and other mitigation efforts in the community negatively affect several standard clinical trial procedures including patient accrual the optimal delivery of interventions patients adherence to medical treatments patient monitoring and adverse event reporting and the evaluation of outcome measures38 39 in addition most laboratories that do correlative studies such as biomarker assessments pharmacokinetic assays and pharmacodynamic assays are closed the effect of these important mitigation measures on preclinical research should also be recognised because leukaemia translational laboratories are suspending or drastically scaling back operations to comply with physical distancing requirements40
 to ease the burden on participating health-care facilities now prioritising covid-19 studies academic centres and drug sponsors have begun to suspend patient enrolment in many ongoing interventional trials some centres have needed to put accrual to phase 3 trials and some phase 2 trials on hold when a viable standard-of-care option exists however we must maintain and support continuing clinical intervention trials whenever possible including the continued accrual of new participants while ensuring patient safety and study feasibility39 this support should apply to randomised trials investigating the effects of interventions of proven clinical benefit and trials involving multi-line refractory patients who have exhausted all alternative standard-of-care options recognising the challenges affecting standard protocol procedures the fda and health canada have issued guidance for doing clinical trials during the covid-19 pandemic particularly emphasising patient safety41 42 in europe a covid-19 pandemic task force set up by the european medicines agency in collaboration with the clinical trials facilitation and coordination group has been established to take quick and coordinated regulatory action related to covid-19 medicines43
 in accordance with good clinical practice drug sponsors protocol investigators local institutional review boards and ethics committees should continue to establish memoranda of policies that explain how clinical trial activities can be done effectively while allowing for possible disruptions in usual care at the study sites42 disruptions related to the pandemic including when patients become symptomatic from a sars-cov-2 infection during therapy might necessitate protocol deviations suspension of all non-essential procedures related to the trial that do not directly ensure safety should be considered for example extended hospital visits for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies and non-crucial response assessments should be eliminated during the height of the covid-19 pandemic when the risk of exposure in the cancer centre outweighs any immediate direct benefit to the patient continuing patient access to the study drug when approved by both the sponsor and the institutional review board might include shipping the study drug directly to patients mobile laboratory blood draws and the approval of telehealth study visits in the absence of evidence-driven clinical guidelines in the covid-19 setting the health-care provider must carefully balance the risks and the benefits when making a treatment recommendation the administration of intensive chemotherapy amid an active pandemic can place patients at a high risk of contracting a severe sars-cov-2 infection with potentially fatal consequences and might lead to the need for intensive care considering the challenges faced by the oncology community in treating adult patients with myeloid neoplasms major medical societies including the american society of hematology have released resources to help providers to care for patients with haematological malignancies appendix pp 1314 these intervention strategies are mainly aimed at mitigating the risk of inducing an immunocompromised state that can predispose patients to a potentially fatal sars-cov-2 infection and reducing the effect of the pandemic on hospital bed capacity and intensive care capacity by decreasing the intensity and the length of chemotherapy exposure we have outlined a proposed general approach to the treatment of adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and acute lymphocytic leukaemia during the pandemic appendix pp 1516 we would like to emphasise that the situation remains fluid and individual clinical practice needs to be adapted to the local circumstances eg resource availability and local disease epidemiology and to the individual patient we have summarised the key considerations of the management approaches for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia panel 2

 in the setting of the covid-19 pandemic many of our recommendations align with those of the covid-19 advisory panels of the american society of hematology we have outlined a detailed discussion on the rationales and available evidence supporting these recommendations in the appendix pp 312 the underlying principles behind these recommendations are the need to minimise the risk of contracting sars-cov-2 and reduce the severity of ensuing covid-19 for patients by avoiding health-care exposure and periods of immunosuppression and providing effective disease-directed treatment we acknowledge that these recommendations reflect a compromise and partly deviate from routine practice in the non-covid-19 setting as the evidence base evolves these recommendations should be critically re-evaluated and additional adjustments will probably become necessary in the futurepanel 2summary of treatment guidelines for the management of adult acute myeloid leukaemia
general recommendations

consider delaying treatment unless there is an urgent need to initiate treatment44
screen all patients in need of intensive induction treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 before treatment initiation
if the test is positive consider delaying treatment by 1014 days with careful consideration of cytoreductive agents in the interim consult with infectious disease specialists regarding the criteria to clear the patient for chemotherapy ie two negative covid-19 tests and an absence of symptomsif the test is negative repeat the test after 24 h if there is high clinical suspicion because the rt-pcr test has a sensitivity of about 7045
if the patient is positive for sars-cov-2 and there is an urgent need to initiate induction treatment consider treatment with close monitoring for any evolving and related covid-19 symptoms
consider treatment discontinuation if the patient develops symptoms of covid-19 early initiation of cytokine modulators could be considered for patients with covid-19 who are symptomatic from covid-1946 47
prioritise outpatient management following induction therapy once the necessary follow-up is ensured48


induction

for younger 1865 years or fit patients who are deemed eligible for intensive chemotherapy on the basis of general health and performance status who are newly diagnosed
treatment induction with cytarabine and an anthracycline eg 7 days of cytarabine infusion and 3 days of an anthracycline infusion or similar in non-acute promyelocytic leukaemia with a specific regimen based on risk stratification and all-trans retinoic acid with arsenic trioxide in non-high-risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia should remain standard49
use caution with prophylactic corticosteroids to prevent differentiation syndrome during therapy for acute promyelocytic leukaemiaif there are severe shortages in hospital bed capacity support staff or both alternative low intensity outpatient induction regimens eg a hypomethylating agent and venetoclax might be necessary49 50

for older patients 65 years deemed eligible for intensive chemotherapy
outpatient treatment with a hypomethylating agent with or without venetoclax or targeted inhibitors should be strongly considered49 50



consolidation

consider deferring patients without adverse risk disease who need allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplants when they test negative for minimal residual diseaseconsider reducing the number of chemotherapy consolidation cycles with high-dose cytarabine and the cumulative cytarabine dose within each cycle49 51
consider maintenance therapy with a hypomethylating agent as an alternative to intensive post-remission therapy after careful consideration of the risks versus the benefits52
consider high-dose cytarabine consolidation as an alternative to autologous haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation

supportive care

the benefit of minimising the duration of neutropenia with growth factors must be balanced against the rare but potential risk of worsening the pulmonary complications related to covid-1949 the use of growth factors in patients with moderate-to-severe covid-19 should be reconsideredfollow transfusion contingency plansmonitor patients for drugdrug interactions between venetoclax ivosidenib gilteritinib and azole antifungals and covid-19 therapies eg hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin

in older patients 65 years consider minimising steroid exposure because of the concern that steroids could increase the risk of severe covid-1954 55
in older patients 65 years consider reducing the dose of daunorubicin and pegylated asparaginase during treatment inductiondelay treatment with anti-cd20 monoclonal antibodies if possible because these agents reduce immunoglobulin concentrationsconsider second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors with reduced dose steroids in philadelphia chromosome-positive disease56


consolidation

consider blinatumomab if patients are positive for minimal residual disease after two cycles of chemotherapyconsider advancement to maintenance if patients are negative for minimal residual disease and have already received most of their treatment

maintenance

in older patients 65 years consider reducing the dose of steroids and avoiding vincristine57
pending further evidence prompt initiation of blinatumomab to treat minimal residual disease in philadelphia chromosome-negative b-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia remains standard58


relapsed or refractory disease and transplantation

consider inotuzumab over blinatumomab as the first salvage option to reduce the duration of hospital stay57
consider delaying allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation for patients in first complete remissionpatients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphocytic leukaemia in second complete remission should have an allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplant promptly considering the high-risk nature of disease and the high risk of relapse57
if feasible consider delaying therapy with t cells with chimeric antigen receptors directed to b-lymphocyte antigen cd19 for patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphocytic leukaemia younger than 25 years for whom this therapy is approved by the us food and drug administration

supportive care

consider liberal use of growth factor support in patients without covid-19 to facilitate the recovery of neutrophil count11 and to maintain an absolute neutrophil count of more than 1000 cells per l across all phases of therapy the use of growth factors in moderate-to-severe covid-19 should be reconsidered given the potential risk of worsening the pulmonary complications related to covid-19follow transfusion contingency plansmonitor for drugdrug interactions between the drugs used to treat acute lymphocytic leukaemia and any potential therapies for covid-19
panel 4summary of treatment guidelines for the management of adult myeloproliferative neoplasms
chronic myeloid leukaemia

we do not recommend any changes in management with tyrosine kinase inhibitors at this pointpatients with newly diagnosed disease should be started on tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment as usual extending visits and mobile laboratory blood draws where available ensure patients have routine lab monitoring for cytopenias induced by treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and a 13 month supply of tyrosine kinase inhibitor to minimise pharmacy visitswe do not recommend doing trials of tyrosine kinase inhibitor discontinuation during the covid-19 pandemicin accelerated phase or blast phase disease consider non-aggressive regimens with tyrosine kinase inhibitors

philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms

patients with essential thrombocythaemia or polycythaemia vera should continue current cytoreductive treatment with hydroxycarbamide anagrelide interferon alfa or ruxolitinibensure that patients have a 3-month supply of agents to minimise pharmacy visitswhenever possible avoid stopping ruxolitinib especially in the setting of the covid-19 pandemic because ruxolitinib helps to prevent possible immune cytokine release syndromeconsider deferring the initiation of jak inhibitors because of these agents immunosuppressive effects59
continue aspirin for thromboprophylaxis in patients with high-risk essential thrombocythaemia or polycythaemia vera consider switching patients from oral anticoagulation to low-molecular-weight heparin in the setting of acute covid-19use erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and danazol to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusion on a case-by-case basisdelaying allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation might be required given the current restrictions on resource allocationconsider a hypomethylating agent with or without ruxolitinib or venetoclax in blast phase disease in the outpatient setting whenever possible with a goal of doing allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation when appropriate60

panel 5summary of treatment guidelines for the management of adult myelodysplastic syndromes and adult syndromes with overlap between myelodysplastic disease and myeloproliferative neoplasms
general recommendations

treatment decisions should be based on category in the revised international prognostic scoring systemestablished and newly diagnosed patients being considered for potentially myeloablative therapy should undergo testing for covid-19 before treatment initiation with the same considerations as for patients with acute myeloid leukaemiathe goals-of-care discussion and the importance of physical distancing should be emphasised because a large proportion of the patient population are older individuals 65 years with comorbidities who are at a high risk of mortality if diagnosed with covid-19

high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes

close observation without definitive treatment is a reasonable strategy in patients with only modest cytopenias61
start newly diagnosed patients requiring treatment on a hypomethylating agent and continue treatment in patients already receiving these agents62
consider lengthening the duration between treatment cycles and reducing dosing within each cycle for patients that have had a response maintain normal intervals until patients respondavoid a delay of more than 6 weeks between cycles of hypomethylating agentssubcutaneous azacitidine is preferred over intravenous azacitidine to decrease the time spent at infusion centres and in contact with covid-19 exposures

lower risk myelodysplastic syndromes

we recommend a watch-and-wait approach for most patientserythropoiesis-stimulating agents for patients naive to these agents and luspatercept63 should be considered to minimise the need for red blood cell transfusionsconsider deferring the initiation of lenalidomide in newly diagnosed patients with del5q disease given the risk for myelosuppression

overlap syndromes

we recommend a watch-and-wait approach for patients with proliferative chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia and mild-to-moderate leucocytosis given the likelihood of leukaemoid reactions cytokine release syndrome and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome with covid-19 in this group the careful lowering of white blood cell count in cases of extreme leucocytosis in asymptomatic patients should be done with low doses of hydroxycarbamide while monitoring for the emergence of cytopeniasearly initiation of cytokine modulators such as anakinra and tocilizumab could be considered for patients symptomatic for covid-1946 47
erythropoiesis-stimulating agents or erythropoiesis maturation agents should be used in the management of anaemia to minimise transfusion burden

supportive care

erythropoiesis-stimulating agents or erythropoiesis maturation agents should be used in the management of anaemia to minimise transfusion burdentransfusion contingency plans should be followeduse of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor should be carefully considered we do not recommend routine use in patients with splenomegaly given the associated risk of splenic rupture
 many of the mitigation strategies and risk assessments we have outlined will be similar to those for lymphoid malignancies and plasma cell neoplasms consideration must be given to dose-attenuated regimens and careful growth factor use in the older population 65 years to reduce the risk of myelosuppression and the duration of hospitalisation suitable alternative regimens suggested by the national comprehensive cancer network that can be managed on an outpatient basis might be preferred64 specific additional considerations for patients with covid-19 including the use of immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies to overcome t-cell immune dysfunction induced by therapies for multiple myeloma and lymphomas65 66 67 68 69 should be addressed a detailed discussion regarding changes to management approaches in aggressive and indolent lymphomas chronic lymphocytic leukaemia multiple myeloma and allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is beyond the scope of this viewpoint and we refer the reader to other resources in which these topics are reviewed in more detail70
 many clinical trials are underway to investigate the efficacy of vaccines and various antiviral therapies targeting sars-cov-2 but the inclusion of patients with haematological malignancies in these trials is variable early and emerging data suggest that convalescent serum samples might be beneficial either for the prophylaxis of infection or the treatment of covid-19 and it is hoped that patients with haematological malignancies will also be eligible for this intervention71 72 trials evaluating agents intended to dampen harmful inflammatory responses to sars-cov-2 such as jak inhibitors eg nct04320277 anti-il-6 monoclonal antibodies eg nct04322773 bet inhibitors eg nct03936465 and btk inhibitors eg nct04346199 are prospectively evaluating treatment responses in patients with covid-19 and a diagnosis of cancer with the emergency use authorisation of remdesivir made on the basis of early efficacy data haematological effects especially among patients receiving chemotherapy should be considered73 until effective antiviral strategies are supported by data and made available physical distancing minimising hospital and office visits telemedicine and careful tailoring of individual treatment plans are essential strategies to mitigate the potential complications from covid-19 in patients with haematological malignancies these measures can be especially challenging for older patients 65 years who might need increased assistance with daily care transportation to clinic visits or technological support with the covid-19 outbreak likely to last months and possibly recur in the future in a cyclical pattern74 epidemiological and outcome data defining populations at high risk of contracting severe covid-19 will inform the development of a framework that incorporates pre-emptive strategies such as the use of vaccines and antiviral drugs to optimise outcomes for patients with haematological malignancies identifying patients who might have immunity to sars-cov-2 perhaps from previous exposure is similarly important and reliable serological testing is therefore eagerly anticipated these important research agendas will warrant investigation under controlled clinical trial settings that will explore not only their immediate benefits but also other crucial aspects of administration such as drug interactions between antiviral therapies and leukaemia treatments delineation of the effects of sars-cov-2 on haematopoiesis will have broader implications on haematopoietic stem-cell mobilisation and the use of growth factor support75 research on the effect of the covid-19 outbreak on leukaemia outcomes including the role of delays in treatment the selection of potentially suboptimal chemotherapy regimens and complications directly related to covid-19 will become feasible with the growing pool of infected patients and ongoing efforts to centralise these data the covid-19 pandemic has severely strained the oncology community and the delivery of optimal care for patients with leukaemia and associated myeloid neoplasms with local policy makers implementing various contingency measures to minimise the potential effect of this pandemic the rationing of oncology care services has become a reality the need to treat patients with potentially lifesaving intensive chemotherapy presents an enormous challenge the populations associated immunocompromised state places an already susceptible population at even greater risk for contracting severe covid-19 setting early goals of care and discussing code status for all patients with haematological malignancies is imperative ethical issues surrounding the allocation of lifesaving interventions to critically ill patients and the determination of treatment futility among patients without viable treatment options outside of a clinical trial will need to be continually addressed we acknowledge that the recommendations provided in this viewpoint might not be generalisable because of regional differences in health-care infrastructure and individual circumstances that said the guidance we have provided in this viewpoint is adapted from available literature supporting guidelines for oncological management that minimise patientprovider interactions and inpatient hospital stays disease-specific advisory groups have started to issue guidance on how to best provide care in the face of a rapidly accelerating outbreak but these recommendations are based largely on expert consensus robust data substantiating these recommendations are currently scarce reporting of patient outcomes and epidemiological data in the context of covid-19 is urgently needed to support the evidence-based management of patients with haematological malignancies in the future now more than ever patients with leukaemia need the support of the oncological community to help balance the risks and benefits and allow for the best possible outcomes in these extraordinary circumstances 
we searched pubmed for publications related to covid-19 sars-cov-2 cancer and haematological malignancies published in english between dec 1 2019 and may 10 2020 to gather further references we searched the reference lists of articles identified from the pubmed search because the focus of cancer management is minimising inpatient hospital stays and frequent visitations to cancer centres most of the references included in this viewpoint are from previous available literature that supports the safety of such management approaches
  what should palliative cares response be to the covid-19 pandemic victoria powell d maria silveira j   although palliative care has recently experienced growth and increased penetration in the health care3 the growth of the palliative care workforce has yet to meet demand there is an existing shortage of palliative care clinicians physicians nurses and social workers with palliative care specialization as it stands many palliative care interdisciplinary teams regularly work at or near capacity4 leading many teams to operate using formal triage processes5 and consultation caps6 a massive increase in the number of palliative care consult requests is certain to push most palliative care teams to the point of exhaustion palliative teams generally consist of a physician nurse practitioner andor physician assistant case manager social worker and chaplain by design these providers have complementary roles and there is little to no overlap moreover most teams are small in number the average 2017 full-time equivalent for a consult service is two for lesser than 150-bed hospitals and 55 for greater than 300-bed hospitals7 there is little redundancy thus most palliative care teams cannot afford to lose a single team member to a prolonged illness like covid-19 to best protect this limited resource is important to keep existing palliative care providers free from covid-19 if possible the bulk of supportive care for patients with covid-19 should come from their primary teams the so-called primary palliative care is the responsibility of every provider caring for a seriously ill patient8 this responsibility is only heightened in the context of a pandemic to help facilitate primary palliative care palliative care consult teams can help create guidelines or order sets for the management of typical covid-19 symptoms whenever possible these guidelines should be developed with the cooperation of other services affected by this crisis eg critical care emergency medicine and hospital medicine palliative care consult teams should make themselves available by phone for coaching primary teams through the issues relating to seriously ill covid-19 patients they should prepare to provide crash courses in palliative medicine to providers on the front line teams should consider having talking points at the ready for needs that are likely to arise in the care of covid-19 patients such as management of cough secretions and shortness of breath communication of triaging decisions and management of family grief if primary teams become overwhelmed with patients palliative care consult services with the capacity can offset the responsibility of keeping patients families informed it is especially important to ensure families are informed when patients take a turn for the worse andor die in italy there have been instances where families were not informed of their loved ones passing for days9 to facilitate the sharing of communication responsibilities we recommend scheduled daily card flips with the directors of covid-19 units in the hospital or the intensive care unit face-to-face palliative care consultation should be reserved for only those covid-19 patients for whom primary palliative care is inadequate that is when the primary team has done their best to palliate the patient and soothe the family but efforts have failed to ensure the optimal use of palliative care consultation on non-covid-19 patients overall palliative care consult criteria may need to temporarily become stricter straightforward requests that would normally be entertained to foster good will in an institution may need to be triaged for example requests for information about hospice can be handled by unit social workers or case managers instead of palliative care team members similarly requests for early introduction to palliative care when patients needs are otherwise being met and their prognosis is robust may be deferred to a less critical time it is our practice to enter patients rooms as a team and hold family conferences in patients rooms in the context of a highly contagious illness like covid-19 it makes sense to limit the providers who have direct contact with the patient to the bare minimum ideally only one provider should enter the room of course palliative care providers should follow all standard precautions and refrain from physical touch including noninfected members of patients families whenever possible consideration should be given to interviewing patients or families by phone team members with medical conditions that may place them at higher risk eg advanced age diabetes immunosuppression pregnancy should be kept from entering covid-19 patients rooms entirely individuals with serious illness should be discouraged from coming to the hospital or any clinic during this pandemic to avoid developing covid-19 in the context of a pre-existing serious illness and advanced age the disease is highly likely to be fatal10 palliative teams should develop a plan for managing most outpatient palliative issues by phone or video chat and for encouraging enrollment in hospice earlier than would be the norm individuals with serious illness who become infected with covid-19 should be encouraged to stay at home with the support of hospice services if available if the pandemic intensifies as predicted older patients with pre-existing serious illness will be the first to be denied life-sustaining care in the event of scarcity for these patients hospitalization will provide no benefits above and beyond care occurring in the home following this logic hospice and home health agencies will see a flood of referrals like everyone else they will likely place limits on face-to-face contact with patients and encourage the use of telephone and telehealth instead this means that family caregivers will face greater burden not to mention higher risk for covid-19 if their loved one was infected palliative care providers should give caregivers of covid-19 patients anticipatory guidance about what hospice will and will not be able to do caregivers should be educated about how to avoid acquiring covid-19 themselves and how to best use their social network to limit the number of other people exposed if the current logarithmic spread of coronavirus in the us continues there will be far more people in need of critical care resources than there are resources available forcing rationing of resources similar to what occurred in italy and china11 rationing of health care is antithetical to the american mindset and is likely to provoke intense emotions among patients and families who are triaged the lack of a clear national consensus as to the criteria used to ration life-sustaining treatment will make decisions appear arbitrary further compounding the challenge palliative care providers may be asked to be the bearers of bad news in this context and will be tasked to help patients and families cope with repercussions those palliative care providers who are perceived by the patient and family as part of the death panel who decided to not offer life support will have a very difficult time establishing the trust that is necessary to comfort patients and families and help them move forward for this reason we strongly recommend that palliative care teams not participate in the crafting of guidelines to ration care or in clinical decision making about the value of life-sustaining therapies for individual patients more than ever our patients and families need to view us as neutral when there are questions regarding individual patients and the value of life support palliative care providers can encourage the use of case conferences where multiple experts discuss the specifics of an individual case and craft a recommended course and ethics consultation it is worth remembering that there is an effective evidence-based communication education curriculumvitaltalkwhich can be used in this context to coach other providers to have difficult conversations12

13 preparing front-line clinicians for how to handle negative emotions will be especially important in particular encouraging providers to express empathy and acknowledge emotions by calling them out when patients and families express strong emotions rather than responding with more clinical detail and medical jargon can sometimes help diffuse it providers should avoid terms like futility which can promote an adversarial relationship with the family providers should reassure patients and families that they will not be abandoned and that patients will continue to receive compassionate care regardless of candidacy for life-sustaining treatment  covid-19 implications for prehospital emergency and hospital care
in patients with acute coronary syndromes kurt huber patrick goldstein   pandemic preparedness is an integral part of preparedness to threats to human
health caused by any emergency for example incapacitating outbreaks of any
disease or the occurrence of natural disasters or chemical incidents pandemic
plans are typically developed to prepare for or respond to an influenza
flu epidemic12 pandemic influenza has the potential to place an
unprecedented strain on our healthcare system2 throughout history they
have led to widespread illness and death3 the newly emerged
coronavirus now called sars-cov-2 causing corona virus disease 2019
covid-19 is a respiratory disease that is much like the flu but
worse46 each
response is different even if the same basic principles apply78 planning for a community outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is
critical for maintaining healthcare services during a response flexibility is
essential to any pandemic influenza planning effort as plans will need to be
easily and quickly adapted to the specific needs of an evolving pandemic as
epidemiological and laboratory data emerge5 in the end the impact of
this epidemic depends on the number of people infected the infections
transmissibility including the role that asymptomatic or presymptomatic
infected people play in transmitting the virus to others and the full spectrum
of disease severity910 while the majority of cases up to 80 of covid-19 are
milder respiratory infections and pneumonias severe illness and death is more
common among the elderly with other chronic underlying conditions with these
risk groups accounting for the majority of severe disease and fatalities to
date1112 forecasting modelling and planning tools facilitate
dynamic estimates of pandemic virus spread burden and impact9101315 the impact and risk assessment on health system capacity can be mediated by the
application of effective infection prevention and control and surge capacity
measures9 measures taken at this stage should ultimately aim at
protecting the most vulnerable population groups from severe illness and fatal
outcomes by reducing transmission and reinforcing healthcare systems16 community
mitigation measures are the first line of defence against pandemic influenza
and may help reduce the spread of other respiratory infectious diseases and
improve awareness and implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions by the
general public and in key community settings schools childcare settings
workplaces mass gatherings to slow the spread of disease9 several
countries have demonstrated that covid-19 transmission from one person to
another can be slowed917 this critical time should allow the healthcare system
prehospital and inhospital enough time to adapt their response appropriately
to organise pre-emergency care triage and deploy a maximum hospital capacity
on healthcare units designated to care for covid-19 cases with a special focus
on intensive care because of differences among hospitals eg size of the
hospitalcommunity scope of services each hospital will need to adapt its
response to meet its unique needs and circumstances true pandemic preparedness will require engaging the entire healthcare community
including and especially our first line response ie general practitioners
and healthcare assets from across the spectrum of care will have to be prepared
to meet the increased demands18 the prevention and control
of covid-19 in hospitals and long-term care facilities separate clean areas
from dirty areas is an immediate priority in order to minimise the export of
cases to other healthcare facilities and the community to safeguard populations
vulnerable to severe outcomes of infection the non-cases and to protect
healthcare workers that provide care18 hospitals should ensure
their staff are trained equipped and capable of practices needed to prevent the
spread of covid-19 within the facility to identify and isolate patients with
possible covid-19 cases to care for a limited to a large number of patients
in the context of an escalating outbreak while maintaining adequate care for
other patients the non-cases in the aged covid-19 resources and capacity are limited19 rational
approaches should be implemented to prioritise high-yield actions including the
rational use of confirmatory testing the rational use of personal protective
equipment ppe see below and hospitalisation and ventilator
capacity1920 the highest priority for
the use of n95 respirators ffp23 is for healthcare workers in particular
those performing aerosol-generating procedures including swabbing intubation
and aspiration intensive care in circumstances with capacity shortage and
strict implementation of social distancing measures lock down surveillance
should focus on severe acute or deteriorating respiratory infections sentinel
surveillance in outpatient clinics separating cases and non-cases and
pro-active telephone consultations especially focusing vulnerable populations
eg heart failure patients immune compromised patients the elderly hospital response plans have been described and are relatively similar with
respect to the main tasks of organisation but may differ in detail depending on
the individual situation in countries and regions frontline services preferably before the patient enters the hospital pre-triage
by general practitioners emergency department serve for the early triage of
patients with covid-19 to prevent transmission to healthcare-workers and other
patients spatial area separation patient cohorting isolating cases in the same
designated unit one or ward is applied to separate acute respiratory infection
from other patients strict policies public healthcare workers patients for
access to the healthcare facilities and specific wards dedicated to covid-19
should be applied to separate flows of cases and non-cases18 only cases
that are proved negative will be transferred to non-covid-19 wards while
patients tested positive will undergo special care patients are encouraged in the use of respiratory hygiene during coughing and
sneezing and are equipped with a surgical ffp1 mask to reduce the dispersal of
respiratory secretions containing potentially infectious particles the constant availability and use of ppe much of which is disposable is
essential during an outbreak including the following n95 respirators fitted
tightly to the face certified ffp2 or ffp3 masks the latter for during
aerosol-generating procedures endotracheal intubation cardiopulmonary
resuscitation bronchoscopy if the mask gets wet or dirty with secretions it
must be changed immediately goggles or face shields long-sleeved gowns or
scrub suits and disposable gloves18 adequate supplies of
essential items required for ppe should be stocked or easily made available
healthcare workers compliance with the proper use of ppe should be
monitored clear policies and procedures are needed for putting on and removing ppe during
an outbreak staff has to be trained and educated on every aspect of
contaminated infectious diseases including the proper use of ppe risks to
themselves and their families and infection-control policies and procedures
eg train-the-trainer model quality assurance monitoring for example in the case of covid-19 before entering a patients room a staff
member wears a n95 respirator goggles face shield a gown over scrubs and two
pairs of gloves the order in which ppe is removed when a staff member exits a
patients room is exact for example inside the room by the door the first
pair of gloves is removed followed by the face shield and the second pair of
gloves next hands are washed with quick-drying antiseptic solution and the
gown is carefully removed then the hands are washed again before the staff
member leaves the room in the hallway hands are washed goggles removed and
disposed of hands washed again respirators removed and finally hands are
washed again and eventually a new n95 respirator is donned18 hospitals should respond fast to the psychological pressures on staff and
detailed psychological intervention plans should be part of the hospital
disaster preparedness tools6 after prehospital care or inter-hospital transport has been provided
follow recommended procedures for waste disposal and for cleaning and
disinfecting emergency vehicles and reusable patient care equipment avoid crowding of patients during examination and in outpatient treatment
areas notify the receiving facility as soon as possible before arrival that
a patient with suspected covid-19 is due to arrive and indicate whether
additional precautions are required it has been demonstrated that during the covid-19 infection especially following
the restrictions to leave home fewer patients than usual call for help or visit
emergency departments than before so the number of st-segment elevation
myocardial infarction stemi cases has been halved and the number of
non-st-segment elevation myocardial infarction nstemi cases is less than
one-third possible causes of reductions in presentation include mainly the reluctance of
patients to present to the emergency departments but also a delay in response
of an overloaded emergency medical service during the covid-19 pandemic with
respect to the transfer times that may occur21 further reasons have been
discussed including less air pollution due to a massive reduction in public
traffic less physical exercise at home and less stress in business by
consequence an increasing number of patients might not receive the optimal
treatment with the expected consequences of increased morbidity and mortality
it is therefore essential that patients be informed not to neglect symptoms of
heart disease during the covid-19 pandemic worsening chest pain during exercise
or chest pain at rest shortness of breath palpitations or fainting should
induce a call into the emergency services providers who then can help to decide
whether a transfer to an emergency department is obligatory circulating cardiac troponin is a marker of myocardial injury including but not
limited to myocardial infarction mi or myocarditis the clinical relevance of
this distinction has never been so clear as with covid-19 an increase of
cardiac troponins has been shown in up to 20 of patients hospitalised for
covid-19 infections consisting of either type-1 mi based on pre-existing or new
coronary disease or type-2 mi in patients with lung infection and related
respiratory distress2122 troponin elevation may
also exist as a consequence of right ventricular pressure increase in pulmonary
embolism frequently associated with a covid-19 infection due to an increased
prothrombotic milieu tachyarrhythmia coronary microvascular disease stress
cardiomyopathy or a rare case of viral myocarditis during covid-19
infection2125 the use of invasive diagnosis and treatment for covid-19-positive patients or
non-tested patients should be restricted to those in whom type-1 mi is suspected
from ecg changes andor clinical judgement patients presenting with acute stemi or very high-risk nstemi with known or
suspected covid-19 infection need an urgent invasive diagnosis and treatment
under optimal protection of the catheter personnel2627 as a result of the fact
that test results are not immediately available in stemi or high-risk nstemi
patients such patients should be managed assuming positive covid-19 status the
maximum time from stemi diagnosis to reperfusion of 120 minutes should continue
to represent the goal for reperfusion therapy primary percutaneous coronary
intervention pci should remain the reperfusion therapy of choice within this
time frame and performed in facilities approved for the treatment of covid-19
cases under optimal protection for healthcare providers and other patients only
if this target time cannot be guaranteed should fibrinolysis become first line
therapy if not contraindicated in patients with nstemi risk stratification should be based on the criteria of
the current european society of cardiology esc guidelines2628 patients
presenting with nstemi can have a stable presentation with a good response to
optimal medical treatment alone or a more severe course with clinical
instability leading to an invasive management within 2472 hours thus allowing
the time to test the patients for covid-19 infection before the intervention
criteria for very high-risk nstemi include among others haemodynamic instability
or cardiogenic shock recurrent or ongoing chest pain refractory to medical
therapy life-threatening arrhythmias acute heart failure or recurrent
intermittent st-elevation respectively in patients with out of hospital cardiac arrest prognostic assessment is
essential in order to avoid unnecessary intubation in order to avoid intensive
care unit saturation at times when the resources might be limited here again
delays to emergency medical services arrival might be increased due to the
overloading by covid-related infections in such cases the prognostic impact of
the delays is even more substantial compared to stemis if not tested before all patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome
should be tested for covid-19 as soon as possible and irrespective of
reperfusion strategy and all measures of precaution ie special wards for
suspected still unknown infections should be taken to avoid potential
infection of other patients and healthcare personnel until the result of the
test is known with an increasing covid-19 pandemic routine diagnostic and elective
interventions have to be drastically reduced and spoke and hub hospitals should
focus on patients with clinical urgency and at high risk only some healthcare
systems have identified specific covid-19 hospitals or wards in an attempt to
concentrate and isolate confirmed covid-19 patients and most importantly in
order to prevent the spread-out of the pandemic29 specific covid-19 hospitals or wards are frequently large community tertiary
hospitals serving as stemi hubs with intensive care andor coronary care units
and a 247 catheter laboratory activity after invasive diagnosis and treatment
non-infected patients are usually transferred to covid-19-free hospitals or
wards within a hub centre with a pandemic widespread attempts to distribute
patients into separate covid-19 hospitals or wards might become more difficult
in some cases even impossible as the identification of suspected covid-19
patients to date depends mostly on clinical symptoms or epidemiological
assumptions and as testing for symptom-free patients who might be carriers of
the virus is frequently not possible due to lack of material personal
resources andor time healthcare providers should use all available protective
measures in the management of patients presenting with an acute coronary
syndrome as if they were covid-19 positive until test results become available
patients should be kept in protected environments and receive the best available
treatment until contagion is ruled out this may take hours potential covid-19 transmission through asymptomatic carriers is a challenge to
containment and adds to the logistic complexity in separating covid-19 cases
from non-cases in acute cardiac care30 in general test results
occur hours after the acute intervention ie primary pci has been performed
moreover there remains an issue on test sensitivity more than specificity the
definitive test for sars-cov-2 is the real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction rtpcr test it is believed to be highly specific but with
sensitivity reported as low as 60703135 thus false negatives are
a real clinical problem and several negative tests might be required in a
single case to be confident about excluding the disease here chest computed
tomography ct to detect covid-19 even in asymptomatic patients may become an
asset3637 the sensitivity of chest ct is reported to be higher
than rtpcr 98 vs 71 respectively p0001 and may be
a valuable initial screening tool for covid-19353839 combining rtpcr with
chest ct may be an appropriate test strategy to separate covid-19 cases from
no-cases in centres performing invasive coronary diagnosis and treatment figures 1 and 2 the emergency room should be divided into areas for receiving suspected
covid-19-infected patients those with specific symptoms such as fever and
dyspnoea and for patients with other emergencies although not possible to
organise for all emergency departments a dedicated entry point and triage for
cardiovascular emergencies chest pain unit might prove advantageous to
accelerate diagnosis and treatment separate teams providing care in each of
these areas might reduce the risk of cross-contaminations as important as
maintaining separate areas throughout the hospital for both covid-19-positive
and negative patients for further care if organised differently
covid-19-positive patients should be transferred to intensive care units
coronary care units or wards in covid-19 hospitals depending on their clinical
status and presentation  strategies for rational use of personal protective equipment ppe among healthcare providers during the covid-19 crisis alexander muacevic john adler r syed mahmood uzair faine crimbly sheharyar khan erum choudry syeda mehwish   personal protective equipment ppe is an article used to prevent the wearer from coming in contact with hazardous infectious chemical radiological electrical and physical agents it contains components illustrated in figure 1 1 the surge in demand and misuse of ppe has led to an acute shortage of protective gear endangering the lives of healthcare workers 2 more than 9000 healthcare workers hcw in the united states us and more than 17000 in italy have been infected with covid-19 3-4 a total of 444 hcw in pakistan have been exposed to covid-19 as of april 29 2020 5 many doctors are performing their duty without any ppe and are at high risk of becoming infected 6 there have been peaceful protests all over the world by doctors nurses and other healthcare professionals demanding ppe in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic ppe plays a significant role with face masks and gloves being the most essential doctors nurses and other frontline healthcare responders are using them to minimize the risk of contaminated contact or droplet exposure some studies suggest that the psychological impact of ppe is such that individuals using them might feel more protected than they actually are in reality 7 it should be ensured that the wearer practices hand hygiene before wearing and after removing the protective gear also an appropriate method for its disposal should be considered is wearing ppe important the primary mode of transmission of coronavirus is known to be droplet or contact-based infected individuals are prone to spread the virus while coughing sneezing or speaking this micro virus when ejected can travel up to a distance of six feet wearing a face mask along with other precautionary measures like hand hygiene and self-isolation limits the transmission of infectious agents 8-9 initially the usage of masks among the general public was highly controversial experts discouraged healthy people from wearing masks due to the scarce supply this equipment was reserved for those in direct contact with infected patients 10 however the rapid rise in the degree of local transmission has caused many countries to allow their citizens to wear non-medicalcloth masks along with practicing social distancing 9 11 evidence-based studies reveal that the concomitant use of household non-medical face masks as well as using a proper handwashing regimen reduces the probability of local transmission thereby decreasing the death toll 12 it should be noted that according to the world health organization who guidelines medical masks and respirators should only be reserved for healthcare workers 10 factors that determine the efficiency of face masks are listed in table 1 13 types of masks the main types of masks being used are respirators medical masks and non-medicalcloth masks  respirators these are protective equipment which provides an almost accurate facial fit and effective filtration of airborne particles they provide a proper seal around the mouth and nose providing optimal protection according to the recent who cdc and fda guidelines such masks are only reserved for healthcare providers 10 13-14 the fda has labeled these masks as single-use disposable devices however in cases of shortage in supplies these can be sterilized and reused 14 while the respirator masks are highly efficient they still do not provide complete protection improper and misuse of these masks can lead to the spread of infection in the user 15 medical masks these are thin pleated and disposable masks that protect the user from inhaling dust particles contaminated liquid droplets and bacteria they are usually two layers thick and made from unwoven fabric these masks only act as a physical barrier between the users nose and mouth and the infected environment they do not possess a proper seal and are less effective than respirators these are loose masks which allow comfortable breathing and reduce transmission probability 14 non-medical masks according to recent studies asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic carriers of the novel coronavirus have been detected and can transmit the virus in the face of this discovery cdc experts recommend that the general public uses non-medicalcloth coverings to shield their mouth and nose these textile masks are made up of layers of cloth some of them also possess a paper towel layer which increases the filtration capability they do not offer full protection but along with other precautionary measures are useful to slow down the spread of coronavirus 16 ppe per clinical setting as a general safety precaution every frontline healthcare worker hcw should know which ppe needs to be used in different clinical settings 17-18 1 under any clinical setting where there is a risk of getting infected the individual should don put on a medical face mask gloves gown and eye protection 2 if the hcw is more than 2 meters away from the patient heshe should use a fluid-resistant medical face mask with or without eye and face protection depending on whether there is exposure to flashes or droplets 3 in case of an ongoing aerosol-generating procedure agp all individuals present should wear a respirator face and eye protection gloves and long-sleeved fluid-repellent gown 4 contact transmission can be avoided by wearing disposable gloves and gowns donning and doffing ppe for infection prevention it is essential that every hcw should know the proper way to put on donning and remove doffing ppe any mistake in doing so can render the individual exposed to infections agents centers for disease control and prevention cdc and the ministry of health new zealand have introduced the proper way of handling ppe 19-20 hcw should wear the entire ppe before entering a patients room steps of donning and doffing are illustrated in figures 2-3 decontamination and reuse of ppe according to standard infection prevention and control ipc guidelines ppe is a single-use disposable item however due to the current shortage of ppe health care providers are challenged to rationally use the limited supplies by decontaminating and reprocessing them it should be noted that there is no proven effectiveness of these practices and priority is given to the rapid manufacture of protective items 21 improper or inadequate decontamination of equipment before reuse is unsafe and can pose serious threats 22 when disinfecting ppe it is important to keep in mind the efficacy of the method used check for any residual toxicity and make sure that the functional integrity of the material is maintained general strategies include following the manufacturers guidelines to disinfect and reprocess the ppe routine inspection of protective material should be carried out along with the replacement of the equipment if the integrity is not maintained or it is damaged respirators and medical masks 1 usually cleaning prior to disinfection is required respirators and medical masks lose their protective property when they undergo cleaning 2 considering the current conditions these items can be worn by a single hcw for multiple shifts factors such as humidity and shelf-life limit their use 3 medical masks can be reprocessed using the environment protection agency epa-registered disinfectants 4 filtering facepiece respirators can be decontaminated using vaporous hydrogen peroxide moist heat and bleach solution 5 remember to replace these respirators if breathing is hindered gowns 1 submerge in hot water and detergent then thoroughly scrub the gown 2 afterward soak in 005 chlorine solution for about 30 minutes 3 rinse in clean water and ideally allow drying in the sun 4 gowns having small holes and tears could be mended whereas worn out gowns should be discarded disposable face shields 1 clean first the inside and then the outside surface of the visor using a detergent-soaked clean cloth 2 clean the outside of the visor with a clean cloth saturated with disinfectant 3 wipe the outside of the visor with clean water 4 use towels or dry air to completely dry the visor reusable goggles and face shields 1 immerse in warm water and neutral detergent solution 2 rinse with clean water 3 wipe with disinfectant and then again rinse with clean water 4 dry completely using towels or dry air proper disposal of ppe potentially infectious medical waste pimw such as covid 19 testing kits and ppe have a serious risk of coming in contact with infectious bodily fluids these materials should be kept safely on site hospitals testing centers in secure containers they should then transferred to storage facilities where they are disinfected and disposed of off to landfill sites 23 individuals responsible for waste management should take caution and should wear appropriate gear it is extremely critical to properly decontaminate and dispose of any waste material that could infect people who come in contact with it ppe crisis strategy the escalating demand for ppe has given rise to new state and local strategies to ensure the careful optimization of available resources this policy helps reserve the reduced amount of ppe for the most critical conditions as the situation improves and the ppe supply is sufficient again the state can return to its conventional ppe guidelines the following strategies should be observed to overcome the shortage of ppe 24 appropriate use of ppe there is a difference in the demand and supply of ppe with severe shortages in supply on all fronts it is crucial that all the equipment is used with care to prevent wastage to ensure a continuous supply of protective equipment despite limited production 1 22 1 the healthcare professionals who are working with patients of covid-19 and are in direct contact should have ppe consisting of gloves gowns masks face shields and goggles 2 the same respirator can be used while examining multiple patients at a time since the shortage of supply is a fact in most places it is recommended to keep wearing a single one for multiple patients than to not have any respirator on 3 hcw performing or assisting with invasive procedures should be wearing respirators eye protection like goggles and a face shield aligned with the gown and gloves if the gowns allow fluid to pass through an additional layer of protective coverage like an apron should be worn 4 people who are taking care of the sick at home should be provided with medical masks at home for their own protection and to limit the spread of the disease 5 individuals who remain asymptomatic or do not show any signs of illness can use non-medical masks and should not opt for medical masks inappropriate use of medical masks may increase the demand and can also impede the supply to professionals who need them the most limit the need for ppe the need for ppe can be minimized by the following interventions 25 1 limit patient contact and use alternate tools such as telemedicine for non-emergency cases 2 make sure that no personnel who is not immediately needed for the patients care should enter the premise of the covid-19 ward that should be a separated and isolated area the visitors should either not be allowed at all or should have minimal contact with the patients 3 all non-urgent proceduresappointments should be postponed 4 ppe should be reused with proper decontamination guidelines 5 ppe should be used beyond their shelf life making sure they are not worn out or damaged 6 in the case of the absolute absence of ppe alternate methods for barrier control eg glass shields should be employed these practices do not guarantee the absolute safety of healthcare professionals and their effectiveness is questionable however under the present circumstances these crisis strategies given by the cdc should be duly addressed coordination between the supply and demand of ppe the supply should be monitored and demand adjusted 21 26 this can be done using the following methods 1 use of rational quantification-based forecasts regarding ppe this helps in rationing available supplies to meet the demand 2 the request for ppe from countries as well as major responders should be monitored and controlled the distribution of ppe to healthcare institutions should be controlled and monitored 3 to avoid stock duplication a centralized request management system should be applied that takes notice of whether the stock management rules are being followed or not this helps in controlling the wastage and overstock 4 keep a check on the end-to-end distribution of ppe due to the recent ease in lockdown measures and the commencement of the holy month of ramadan in the muslim world an abrupt rise in public gatherings is feared therefore it is highly critical that ppes should be used in all clinical and non-clinical settings citizens should use a cloth barrier while stepping out of the house and public gatherings should be strictly avoided the proper protocol should be followed when healthcare professionals consider reusing ppe as pakistan is one of the major distributors of ppe throughout the world it has set an exemplary approach during this pandemic the pakistani government and national disaster management authority ndma have made tireless efforts to increase the manufacturing and distribution of ppe moreover many non-governmental organizations ngos and medical students have come forward to combat this deadly disaster and distribute ppe to those fighting on the frontline  maintaining places of social inclusion ebola and the emergency department april wright l alan meyer d trish reay jonathan staggs   building on the previous literature about place and aspects of institutional theory we conceptualize a place of social inclusion as a distinctive type of institution commonly associated with the democratic state this institution is instantiated in local geographic sites that are publicly accessible to citizens with specified human needs and are infused with meaning and values associated with normative social purpose established theory about public places focuses on the importance of being situated locally in neighborhoods towns cities states and nations francis et al 2012 parkinson 2012 because places are geographically bounded by their natural and physical location and the buildings and material objects assembled there gieryn 2000 the physicality of places affects the way in which they are resourced to accomplish normative social purposes although previous literature on public places has not stressed the characteristic of social inclusiveness to varying degrees it is inherent to discussions of public access to places such as emergency departments public schools libraries recreational parks welfare offices community centers and courts of law insights from the literature suggest the nature of human needs and the depth of association with and accomplishment of values of social inclusion involving equality dignity and human rights vary across different public places some places are explicitly created and maintained to accomplish social inclusion for groups marginalized with respect to race disability or other characteristics bolt burgers and van kempen 1998 hall 2010 brown-saracino 2017 other places fulfill a social purpose that is sometimes associated with universal access to basic human services altman and zube 1989 carr et al 1992 these studies of public places provide a foundation for considering how some particular places can be established and maintained as places of social inclusion combining the above ideas with concepts from institutional theory conceptualizing institutions as multi-level phenomena barley 2008 we posit that a place of social inclusion is nested across societal and local levels the societal level captures the regulative and culturalcognitive elements of a place of social inclusion in the democratic state and the normative values it is expected to accomplish for citizens through meeting specific needs depending on the precise nature of these needs places of social inclusion are embedded in the state and also intersect with other higher-order institutions in society such as the medical teaching and legal professions the local level reflects the specificity of the geographic places in which the institutional values of a place of social inclusion are accomplished that is human needs are met at local sitessuch as a local emergency department or public schoolthat are resourced by the state to actualize the institutional value of social inclusion because places at the local level are forever precarious and contested when they nest within societal-level systems gieryn 2000 472 a place of social institution is an inherently precarious type of institution two literature streams offer preliminary guidance on how places of social inclusion might be maintained geographers and sociologists pursue one stream focusing on how people interact with a place relph 1976 lewicka 2011 this literature posits a reciprocal relationship between people and place kaufman and kaliner 2011 places are created reproduced and transformed by the human activities and social relations that transpire in a particular locale as people experience and interpret the places historically contingent meanings values routines and resources tuan 1977 agnew 1987 cognitions and emotions shape how people interact with each other and with the material aspects of place scannell and gifford 2010 this literature conceptualizes a person who visits a public place to access its material and symbolic resources as making a claim on the place carr et al 1992 the staff of the public place must respond by striking the right balance among various claims on its use and meaning carr et al 1992 20 and ensuring place claims are    being noticed and taken seriously parkinson 2012 1 however the everyday cycle of claim-making and responding is not well understood patterson and williams 2005 molotch 2011 researchers know little about the behavioral routines that maintain the rhythm of life of a place and how they shape peoples experiences of material resources and their enduring sense of place stedman 2003 other clues about how places of social inclusion might be maintained can be found in the literature on institutional work lawrence and suddaby 2006 230 defined the work of maintaining institutions as supporting repairing or recreating the social mechanisms that ensure compliance implicit in most studies is an assumption that place is just the site where actors perform institutional work directed at other institutions researchers have highlighted how the cambridge university dining hall dacin munir and tracey 2010 and english county cricket grounds wright and zammuto 2013 offer settings where actors perform institutional work that reproduces institutions of social class nazi concentration camps have been viewed as settings where institutional work creating social oppression was undertaken marti and fernandez 2013 institutional work maintaining professional occupations goes on in museums law courts restaurants and hospitals through the everyday actions of curators blagoev felten and kahn 2018 lawyers and advocates mcpherson and sauder 2013 siebert wilson and hamilton 2017 chefs gill and burrow 2018 and physicians and nurses reay golden-biddle and germann 2006 kellogg 2009 wright zammuto and liesch 2017 place was not the focus in the aforementioned studies but lawrence and dover 2015 have drawn attention to how place influences institutional work showing how places serve as social enclosures that contain signifiers that mediate and practical objects that complicate institutional work we draw inferences from the established literature to suggest three tentative insights into how the institutional work associated with maintaining a place of social inclusion might play out the first insight concerns the institutional work of the actors who respond to claims on a place of social inclusion selznick 1957 94 argued that societal values are protected by institutional guardians professionals working inside formal organizations who are entrusted with institutional values and given autonomy to defend them from subversion by other goals while some scholars have applied selznicks concept of guardians kraatz ventresca and deng 2010 kraatz and flores 2015 others have invoked soares 1997 term custodian to designate the caretakers of values traditions and institutionalized practices dacin dacin and kent 2019 for soares 1997 1415 custodians are practitioners who have a sense of community    and a sense of custodianship for the traditions present and future prospects howard-grenville and colleagues 2013 119 used the term custodians to label community members who actively and tenaciously conserved and protected the place identity of tracktown usa taken together these studies suggest that places of social inclusion may be maintained by custodians the second insight sheds light on the processes and emotions that might be involved in custodians institutional work people are motivated to engage in maintenance work when they have cognitive and emotional investment in an institution voronov and vince 2012 while the institutional literature on emotions is still underdeveloped studies have suggested that emotions like shame and fear of punishment discourage deviations from prescribed ways of thinking acting and feeling creed et al 2014 gill and burrow 2018 other studies have shown that moral emotionswhich the psychology literature links to the interests and welfare of society haidt 2003motivate reflective action to maintain protect and defend institutional values and practices fan and zietsma 2017 toubiana and zietsma 2017 wright zammuto and liesch 2017 this emerging body of research suggests that custodians may be cognitively and affectively motivated to undertake maintenance work to protect the values of a place of social inclusion the third insight concerns the intentionality of the work involved in maintaining a place of social inclusion actions associated with maintenance may not always be obvious because the custodians who inhabit institutions are engaged in the usual day-to-day affairs of their workplace hallett and ventresca 2006 fine and hallett 2014 maintenance work may be nearly invisible and often mundane lawrence suddaby and leca 2009 1 when custodians support an institution by complying with regulations enacting normative routines and performing rituals lawrence and suddaby 2006 dacin munir and tracey 2010 although these actions are institutionally conditioned custodians are still able to engage in low-level intentional action by making small-scale incremental choices between sets of institutionalized practices and routines battilana and daunno 2009 however because breakdowns in institutionalized practices are inevitable active and intentional custodial work may be necessary for the continued stability of most institutions lok and de rond 2013 187 more intentional maintenance work involves self-conscious action and reflection by custodians battilana and daunno 2009 as well as deliberate efforts to resist change and to defend and repair an institution whose survival is threatened kellogg 2009 currie et al 2012 we bring together insights from existing literature to conceptualize places of social inclusion as important institutions of normative social purpose established by the democratic state that have so far been largely ignored identifying and conceptualizing these places is critical because further study holds potential to advance theory about the connections between place and institutions this is also important because the societal-level value of social inclusion is challenging to accomplish in publicly accessible and geographically bounded sites at the local level prior studies have suggested that places of social inclusion may be maintained by custodians and we need to know more about how such precarious institutions can survive seeking to develop a deeper understanding of how the institutional work of custodians can maintain a place of social inclusion we conducted a longitudinal qualitative study of the emergency department of a public hospital in australia emergency departments eds are compelling cases of places of social inclusion in most western countries including the united kingdom canada australia and new zealand the state funds eds as the accessible front door to the healthcare system bailey murphy and porock 2011 1131 in the us the emergency medical treatment and labor act requires eds to evaluate and treat all persons needing emergency medical care regardless of their ability to pay most americans regard having a nearby ed as equally or more important than having a nearby library public health clinic fire department or police department baehr martinez and carr 2017 229 eds are staffed 24 hours a day to provide urgent medical attention to people in need coget and keller 2010 and citizens with acute illnesses or injuries go to these universally accessible sites to receive treatment from emergency physicians and nurses kellermann 2006 wright et al 2016 we focused our investigation on an ed in australia where the state funds eds based in public hospitals in metropolitan regional and rural locations signage of white lettering on a red background recognizable to all australians denotes that a place has official status as an ed and is accessible free of charge in 20152016 over 75 million patients visited eds in australia aihw 2016 this study is part of an ongoing research project focusing on emergency physicians and nurses and their role in australias health care system data were collected at the ed of a large public hospital located in the inner city of a major metropolis each day over 200 patients arrived at our ed fieldsite through large glass entry doors that were open 24 hours a day or they arrived by ambulance patients were assigned to a category on the australasian triage scale and streamed by the triage nurse as follows 1 patients suffering imminently life- and limb-threatening conditionssuch as a heart attack stroke or major traumawere streamed to a resuscitation zone with advanced equipment and beds 2 patients with urgent semi-urgent and non-urgent needs were streamed to an acute zone of examination bed cubicles with basic equipment and 3 patients whose condition could be treated rapidly and discharged such as minor lacerations and fractures were streamed to a fast track zone about 80 percent of emergency patients were able to be treated and discharged while the remaining 20 percent were judged to be sufficiently unwell to require hospital admission we collected observational interview and archival data our primary data source was observational fieldnotes taken while shadowing emergency physicians and nurses as they assessed diagnosed treated and discharged or referred patients within the acute zone which was the focus for this study the acute zone responded to the highest volume of patients and experienced the greatest difficulties with patient flow and overcrowding suggesting that custodian work to maintain the ed as a place of social inclusion was particularly important in this zone we collected a total of 210 hours of observational data over a six-month period with observations recorded as handwritten fieldnotes and typed up after each shift these observational data were supplemented with 47 interviews with senior emergency physicians who oversaw the everyday work of the ed 15 senior emergency physicians were interviewed twice and 17 were interviewed on a single occasion interviews were semi-structured with questions designed to elicit accounts of the emergency physicians work as a custodian of the ed as a place of social inclusion interviews lasted between 60 and 90 minutes and were digitally recorded and transcribed we also interviewed nine residents who were undergoing specialty training in emergency medicine and 29 nurses about their experiences in the ed with these interviews typically lasting 30 minutes four additional interviews lasting between 60 and 90 minutes were conducted with hospital executives and we attended a number of staff meetings training sessions and strategic planning days archival documents many of which were publicly available provided background information on the organizational and professional context during our data collection the outbreak of the ebola virus in west africa created a sudden jolt meyer 1982 in august 2014 the world health organization who declared a public health emergency of international concern who estimated a possible 20000 cases from the ebola outbreak and a mortality rate of 70 percent around 10 percent of the cases and fatalities were health care aid workers the first cases of ebola transmission outside of africa occurred in october 2014 when nurses in spain and the us tested positive for ebola after treating travelers who had contracted the virus in africa during the epidemic the australian government designated our fieldsite hospital as one of australias ebola response and treatment hospitals although the ed never treated a confirmed case of ebola staff undertook preparations as the states frontline responders and dealt with several persons suspected of being infected with ebola we included probing questions about ebola in our interviews engaged in informal conversations and debriefs during observations and collected archival documents including who updates government reports and media releases data analysis followed established procedures for inductive theory building from qualitative data corbin and strauss 2008 we used nvivo 9 and excel software to assist with coding our initial focus was the observational fieldnotes which captured in real time the day-to-day activities of doctors and nurses responding to persons who presented to the ed consistent with the place literature carr et al 1992 parkinson 2012 we conceptualized each presentation as a claim made on the place-specific resources of the fieldsite ed and viewed doctors and nurses as the custodians tasked with allocating resources to satisfy claims as we read our fieldnotes we were struck by the consistent responses of doctors and nurses regarding their responsibility to ensure the ed remained accessible to all citizens as part of their approach to providing services we noticed that as they evaluated cues about each claim doctors and nurses experienced different levels of tension between the ed being an inclusive place for everyone and having sufficient resources at the local place to respond adequately to all claims1 we observed that doctors and nurses served as custodians of resources through two types of work when responding to a claim the first type was activated when doctors and nurses experienced a low level of tension between inclusion and resources and interpreted the basis for a persons claim as an immediate or recurrent health need here we noticed that doctors and nurses tended to feel emotions of low intensity after consulting the literature hoffman 2000 haidt 2003 we categorized these feelings as moral emotions because the custodians expressed a desire to do the right thing for the patient and for society when allocating resources to the claim we labeled this custodianship as resource-rationing work the second type of custodian work was activated when there was a high level of tension between social inclusion and finite resources here we noticed that moral emotions were more intense custodians felt deep compassion for patients and families and they prioritized the highest societal-level ideals of a place of social inclusion they responded by providing extraordinary access to resources which we labeled as resource-enabling work from this first analytical cycle we speculated that ordinary resource-rationing work and extraordinary resource-enabling work represent micro-processes of custodianship that resolve the inclusionresource tension thereby maintaining the ed as a place of social inclusion to probe our hunch we turned next to the interview data reading the different transcripts we noted that doctors and nurses described processes similar to those we observed in the real-time fieldnotes as we reviewed the interviews we noticed how doctors and nurses portrayed their experience of and response to the inclusionresource tension as relating to the level of the claim while also recognizing that pressure on resources built up at the level of the ed as a local place this was most evident in comments about responding to claims during busy shifts and working hard to avoid going on bypass state regulations permit australian emergency departments experiencing extreme resource pressures to declare a bypass situation temporarily closing the hospital to new patients arriving via ambulance our fieldnotes contained one instance when our fieldsite ed declared a bypass this suggested the ed could be disrupted as a local place of social inclusion when custodians efforts to respond to claims through resource-rationing and resource-enabling work failed yet custodianship associated with the inclusionresource tension only partly explained our data the jolt from the ebola crisis gave us the opportunity to investigate a second tension that arises when safety of the local place conflicts with social inclusion we were struck by the anomaly that while potential ebola claims evoked unmistakable fear among custodians other potentially harmful claims did not interviewees described how they were used to dealing with physical harm from persons who were behaving violently and with the infection risk of well-known transmissible diseases consulting the literature for guidance we speculated that ebola confronted custodians with a decision situation reminiscent of knightian uncertainty when prediction of future outcomes is impossible knight 1921 in contrast claims associated with other threats of harm presented decision situations involving risk when possible future outcomes are known and probabilities can be attached the literature also offered guidance on the differences between feara basic emotion that is immediately felt and triggers individual self-defense responses ekman 1992and the higher-order and more reflective moral emotions that we had noticed custodians experiencing toward the inclusionresource tension we sensed that being able to manage fear by mitigating risk was fundamental to custodian work that maintained the ed as a place of social inclusion in the face of the inclusionsafety tension armed with these distinctions we returned to our data for a second cycle of more refined coding our initial interest lay in elaborating custodian work for claims involving the inclusionresource tension reviewing our fieldnotes and applying trefalts 2013 1807 method of viewing every claim as an episode that constituted a unit for data analysis we extracted 336 episodes in which doctors and nurses grappled with finite resources and no tension with safety was apparent two authors independently coded 200 of these data episodes according to the level of tension between inclusion and resources low high basis of claim immediate or recurrent needs future welfare needs moral emotions low intensity high intensity and resource allocation rationing enabling inter-rater agreement was high and disagreements were resolved through discussion and clarification of the coding scheme one author coded the remaining fieldnote episodes when this was completed custodianship took the form of resource-rationing work in 316 episodes 206 claims for immediate needs 110 claims for recurrent needs and resource-enabling work in 20 episodes to verify whether these same processes were evident in the doctors and nurses accounts of their own lived experience we revisited the interview data we extracted text segments in which interviewees provided examples of specific instances of claims made by a particular patient and more general descriptions of ed responses to common types of claims producing 159 interview episodes coding classified custodianship as resource-rationing work in 108 episodes 63 claims for immediate needs 45 claims for recurrent needs and as resource-enabling work in 51 interview episodes while this coding focused on the level of the claim we also coded one instance in the fieldnotes of the ed declaring ambulance bypass in our view this was an episode of custodianship in response to extreme inclusionresource tension at the level of the local place which was supported by interview data we present a summary of the coding frequencies of episodes involving the inclusionresource tension in table 1 tables 2 and 3 which appear in the findings section offer representative data having completed our coding of how the ed was maintained by custodian work directed at the inclusionresource tension we shifted our attention to the inclusionsafety tension our initial focus was on claims that posed a threat of harm when there was a low level of tension we conceptualized these as known-risk claims from our fieldnotes we extracted 51 episodes of known-risk claims involving violence and 18 episodes involving a familiar infectious disease from our interviews we extracted a further 30 episodes of violent claims and 24 episodes of infectious claims as we assembled this dataset we became sensitized to custodians confidence in risk mitigation as a means of managing fear we labeled this custodianship work as harm mitigation coding indicated custodianship through harm mitigation for known risks ultimately ended in resource rationing in 118 episodes and in resource enabling in 5 episodes refer to table 4 in the findings section for examples of our coding at this point in our data analysis we began to conceptualize harm mitigation for known risks as an ordinary microprocess of custodian work that maintains the local place of social inclusion the ebola virus made visible an extraordinary form of custodianship when custodians experienced unknown risk claims we assembled a data set by extracting all text related to ebola in our fieldnotes and interviews and gathering the secondary documents we had collected we compared within and across these different sources of data to discern how ebola disrupted the ed our coding indicated that ebola aroused uncontrollable fear and triggered contests over whether ebola should be considered a normal risk or a special risk for which harm must be avoided a key mechanism in resolving these contests and bringing fear under control was custodians moral emotions refer to table 5 in the findings section for examples of our coding in the final stage we developed a process model that theorizes how a place of social inclusion is maintained by custodianship that connects the levels of societal institution and local place in responding to claims and managing value tensions the robustness of our model was increased by triangulating across multiple data sources using dialogue and debate in research team meetings to arrive at the most credible interpretations and debriefing with fieldsite participants to verify interpretations in the context of their experience denzin and lincoln 2000 doctors and nurses most commonly responded to claims by rationing the eds finite resources as custodians they were constantly thinking about whether the patient needs these resources fieldnotes and mulling over here are our competing demandshow do we organize our resources d46 they sought to assess claims efficiently and activate the resources that are needed d13 being very judicious in that use d4 as this example showsperson p presents to ed triage nurse asks what brings you here today p describes vomiting and abdominal pain p is assigned a bed nurse n inserts a drip and takes blood samples senior doctor dr s notices that p looks pretty sick examines p and prescribes anti-nausea medication n offers comforting words and dr s orders a ct scan to check for an obstruction a radiologist suggests using a contrast dye with the ct scan but this means p will need a bed for longer and dr s is not convinced the dye is medically warranted after the scan dr s moves p to the eds short stay unit for 24 hours with a plan that if the vomiting and pain settle down p will be discharged and given a follow-up appointment with a hospital outpatient clinic if symptoms persist p will be reviewed by surgeons for an operation fieldnotes this example illustrates how custodian work occurs through resource rationing the doctor and nurse evaluate the basis for the claim as an immediate health need perceiving that the ed has adequate resources to resolve this need they experience low tension between the institutional value of social inclusion and the local eds finite resources they allocate appropriate but not excessive resources and emotional energy to meet the need underlying the claim staff time and expertise investigation equipment 24-hour bed empathy which maximizes the eds ability to respond to other claims had this been a pay-for-service private ed rather than a place of social inclusion the doctor would not have had to think about how ordering a ct scan may delay another ct scan for another patientyou have a different responsibility d44 a doctor who worked in both the fieldsite ed and a private ed explained i will make different decisions on what i do in the public sector and private sector because i know there is different access and availability in the    resources d34 table 2 presents examples of these microprocesses in which custodians apprehend a claim as an immediate or recurrent health need experience low tension between social inclusion and finite resources and meet the need by rationing resources examples of claims for immediate needs included new symptoms that a person was experiencing such as back pain acute exacerbations of pre-existing conditions such as diabetes and diagnostic puzzles such as multiple sclerosis claims for recurrent needs involved the repetition of a past illness or behavior such as unchanged chronic illness or frequent attendance for non-emergency claims doctors and nurses responded to claims for recurrent needs by allocating the bare minimum d20 resources because they were obliged to sort out the claim enough to allow the patient to go home in some sort of safe and dignified manner d22 when a patients needs can be adequately met with the usual attention to rationing resources custodian work involves moral emotions of low intensity because custodians feel comfortable about how they can deliver care within those constraints m2 our data suggest that resource rationing balances the inclusionresource tension in a way that upholds the institutional value of social inclusion at the local place by allowing custodians to try and treat as many people as possible as well as possible d27 according to our informants who have comparable experiences of working in pay-for-service eds in private hospitals and in other departments in public hospitals this process of resource rationing is distinctive to their custodian role at the fieldsite ed participants reflected that resource-rationing work is a different reality d33 for medical and nursing professionals employed in a public ed because no other place of medicine in australia has responsibility for accomplishing the value of universal accessibility to medical care that is australian citizens know that the emergency department never shuts and know that the ed is never going to turn us away d21 eds in private hospitals which are essentially business d29 do not have this responsibility nor do other departments in public hospitals because they are not the initial point of contact for people coming from outside r8 when working in those departments participants said youre not thinking about the limited resource d32 in the same way as in the ed with totally different flow totally different drivers totally different demands d34 in a public ed than in other places of medicine resource-rationing work to balance the inclusionresource tension is distinctive to a public ed as a local place of social inclusion our analysis revealed that not all claims on the eds finite resources could be addressed adequately by custodians performing resource-rationing work sometimes custodians made judgments that a claimants needs extended beyond an immediate or recurrent health problem to future-oriented needs as vulnerable people presented to the ed seeking support to change their life circumstances when responding to these claims as custodians doctors and nurses experienced a high level of tension between the institutional value of social inclusion and the eds finite resources as a local place the ed is an opportunistic place for some of this stuff to happen    around social disadvantage but it takes a lot of health resource to do that d20 a doctor described the tension over resource allocation when responding to a future-oriented claim all of us have got this feeling of social justice but thats the problem with this sort of stuffeverything else just ground to a halt because i couldnt do everything for this one patient and all the rest in the ed but thats what it takes d8 responses to claims that custodians judged as being made by persons who were especially vulnerable went above and beyond normal allocations r10 from the eds finite supply creating heightened value tensionelderly person p presents with back pain questioning by a senior doctor dr s reveals p has had multiple car accidents and has advancing dementia a team of six peopledr s a junior doctor social workers and community servicesspend the entire day organizing a hospital admission home support and removal of drivers license for the two ed doctors the intervention to keep the most extraordinary complicated social circumstance from advancing to complete disaster dominates everything else going on in the ed where other doctors and nurses work as best they can to cover for their absence dr s who stays to resolve some issues for an extra two hours after the end of shift describes how ps family went home just sobbing because someone had made an effort to try and sort it out emphasizing the emergency department was a great site for it to happen dr s adds but it took a huge amount of work thats a lot of health resource dr s tells the junior doctor thats probably the greatest intervention youll achieve as a junior in an emergency department much more so than fixing a broken arm    this is far more important to have achieved fieldnotes d20 this example illustrates the microprocesses through which custodians reconcile a high level of tension between the institutional value of social inclusion and local resources the senior doctor judged the basis for the persons claim as a need involving social justice and human welfare this need aroused intense moral emotions with the doctor deeply concerned for the patient and family and motivated to activate extraordinary resources to accomplish the highest values of the ed as a place of social inclusion rather than the eds finite supply of resources constraining the claim response the doctor instead enacted his role as custodian by interpreting local resources bed staff time social workers knowledge community services as enablers of a more enduring intervention for the familys welfare table 3 presents other examples of custodians evaluating claims as human needs that exceed ordinary resource allocations experiencing high tension between inclusion and resources feeling intense moral emotions and activating resources as enablers examples include claims by victims of domestic violence and by other vulnerable people judged to be in crisis and in need of community services to help support them n12 claims can also trigger resource-enabling responses when custodians judge a person with an addiction as sincerely wanting help to change in their trajectory d3 finally claims for end-of-life care prompt resource enabling when the ed provides extraordinary resources to honor human dignity at the end of life for custodians the human needs underpinning these types of claims arouse intense moral emotions of empathic concern if youre not upset by grief    or a tragic story you need to go and get another job n1 some claims aroused moral emotions of such intensity that there are ones that will live with me forever d8 our data suggest that these processes of resource-enabling work are distinctive to custodianship of public eds reflecting on their experiences being employed in both public and private eds several research participants explained that there is no nave separation d16 between acute medicine and social disadvantage in the fieldsite ed as opposed to in a private ed some participants asserted that other specialist departments in the public hospital could also separate social disadvantage from medicine to some extent because the ed provided a buffer as the first port of call r3 r4 between community and hospital resource-enabling work allowed custodians to uphold the highest ideals of a public ed as a place of social inclusion for the most needy citizens rightly the community should expect more from us d37 while it was easier for custodians to allocate more resources to these types of claims when the ed was not overloaded custodians tried to keep focused on making the right decision about the persons resource needs each time    even if the place is heaving d39 as our field observations demonstrate if resource-enabling work is the best we can do for a persons needs we run around like crazy trying to achieve that n23 the data show that custodianship through resource-rationing work and resource-enabling work maintained the fieldsite ed as a local place of social inclusion in two important ways first these forms of custodianship resolved the inclusionresource tension at the level of individual claims so that local custodians could respond appropriately to a persons health needs second they managed the inclusionresource tension at the local place by ensuring that the ed remained open because the reality is we dont really have a lot of control about who comes through or how many people come through the front doors r7 there is potential for the volume of claims to completely overwhelm the ed resources available at the local place if this reaches a crisis point state regulation and associated processes permit a local public hospital to deem that their ed is full and unsafe and they will redirect ambulances to other hospitals    to allow time to just decant patients n3 while ambulance bypass safeguards the institution of the public ed as a place of social inclusion at the societal level it means the ed as a local place is temporarily closed to citizens claims our observations contained only one example of the fieldsite ed declaring bypass along with numerous examples of busy shifts when doctors and nurses said it was a badge of honor that they had worked hard to avoid bypass fieldnotes hospital managers also told us that custodians in the ed dont want to go on bypass they want to manage it m4 according to our data doctors and nurses at our ed perceived ambulance bypass as a disruption of the local place of social inclusion in their eyes by closing off the local place from its value relationship with the community d46 bypass disrupted the meaning of the ed as a universally accessible place for people with acute health needs to protect this value doctors and nurses took pride as custodians in using resource-rationing work and resource-enabling work to avoid bypass whenever possible to keep the fieldsite ed openbypassthats the thing we work hard not to do i guess sometimes when it does happen    you do feel a little angry and disappointed that    clearly you arent able to provide the service that an emergency department is supposed to be able to provide to its patient catchment population    bypass isnt something that we do very often you just keep beavering away d45our hospital very rarely does that almost never our doors are always open its like a pride thing we can handle anything n3 our data show that certain people who made claims for access to health care at our fieldsite ed posed known risks of harm to staff and other patients doctors and nurses classified the threat of harm as a known risk based on their familiarity with the threat and their confidence that the risk of harm could be mitigated the most common known risk was violence persons making claims could act violently due to physiological eg dementia brain injury psychological eg mental illness toxicological eg alcohol abuse drug overdose or behavioral causes doctors and nurses evaluated violent patients as a familiar threat because we deal with it on such a regular basis n2 and have a system that were confident to deal with them d16 risk mitigation mechanisms included security guards verbal de-escalation security cameras and patient isolation and sedation because violence was a known risk doctors and nurses reported being able to manage their fear of harm to the extent that they could respond inclusively to claims our fieldnotes show for example nurses being shaken up after being verbally abused by a patient but continuing to administer care and doctors examining angry drunk people even though they look ready to take a swing at me fieldnotes another threat of harm that custodians classified as a known risk was associated with infection persons with blood-borne viruses eg hepatitis c human immunodeficiency virushiv and diseases transmitted via droplets eg influenza whooping cough andor airborne routes eg measles tuberculosis posed the highest risk of infection for doctors and nurses custodians classified infectious diseases that had a well-understood and familiar disease process as known risks for example doctors and nurses understand the flu a bit more and have had experience with it d16 occasionally treat cases of measles and tuberculosis fieldnotes and could get a needle stick every day from a hiv patient or a hep-c patient    weve got used to those risks d11 familiar infectious diseases had evidence-based risk mitigation procedures that doctors and nurses trusted such as infection control precautions personal protective equipment warning signs quarantines and staff immunization because they knew how to deal with infectious diseases that came to the front door d4 custodians could resolve the inclusionsafety tension when responding to claimsif these patients come here seeking help you see them and you assess them properly while mitigating the known risk of harm and then you make sure that theyre okay and you activate the resources needed for them    im nervous about it when you walk in to see someone whos angry and snarling and spitting where youve got a much greater risk of actually getting a transmissible disease but you do what you have to do    are you going to refuse to see them because your chance of getting harmed is much higher of course not d13 as the example above illustrates when doctors and nurses classify a person making a claim as a known risk they perceive tension between the safety of the local place and social inclusion despite feeling slightly excited and scared about whats coming up n2 they are able to manage their fear sufficiently to perform their role as custodians by mitigating risk and then activating resources to meet the human need underlying the claim the above example also illuminates how managing fear is bolstered by custodians moral emotions related to a sense of concern for doing the right thing to meet the needs of the patient and society more broadly a nurse who had recently been cut with a knife when responding to a claim by a suicidal patient explained my achilles heel in those situations is trying to help the patient so ill put myself in a bit more danger n24 in one compelling example from our fieldnotes we observed an elderly dementia patient punch a nurse in the face sparking fear among the ed team responding to the claim and triggering a self-protective instinct to withdraw access nurses implored cant we just send him back to the nursing home tonight our fieldnotes show that moral emotions associated with not wanting to violate their custodian responsibilities to the community the nursing home cant cope and empathy for the patient its quite sad helped subdue fear the treating team resolved the inclusionsafety tension by mitigating the known risk through sedation which allowed them to safely keep the patient in the ed overnight until specialist services could provide support the next day table 4 presents other examples in which custodians classify a claim as a known risk experience low inclusionsafety tension and manageable fear and are motivated to take action by mitigating the harm and then rationing or enabling resources to meet the persons need harm mitigation maintains the ed as a place of social inclusion by keeping the local place safely and universally accessible to citizens custodianship through harm mitigation for claims that posed known risks combined with resource-rationing work and resource-enabling work usually maintained the fieldsite ed as a place of social inclusion at the local level however our data related to ebola which are illustrated in table 5 reveal that custodianship can break down when claims carry unknown risks of harm amplifying tension between the value of social inclusion and safety of the local place after the world health organization who in 2014 warned of the threat of a pandemic through international travel of persons who had lived in or visited ebola-infected regions the public hospital where we collected our data was designated by the government as one of australias ebola response and treatment hospitals thus our fieldsite ed became the local place that public health authorities who monitored arrivals from west africa and imposed home quarantines would send suspected cases of ebola for assessment the ed was also the designated local place where other unwell persons who may have come in contact with ebola through travel or contact with travelers could present for assessment government authorization of claims on the local place by persons potentially suffering from ebola carried an unknown risk of harm for doctors and nurses as custodians of our fieldsite ed the threat was unfamiliar because ebola was a new exotic disease n24 and there was insufficient experience of it in a western context to even know what the risk is d12 infection controls were unproven pointing to incidents of health care workers becoming infected doctors and nurses saw ebola as extremely contagious n15 and an illness that targets us so there is that perceived threat d17 this undercut confidence that risk could be mitigated i dont know that were confident in our systems with ebola d16 the unknown risk of potential ebola claims aroused far more intense fear than doctors and nurses customarily experienced in their everyday work theres obviously things unknown about it ebola so there is a fear factor and rightly so d17 in our fieldnotes and interviews custodians described their emotions in anticipation of persons making claims for health needs associated with ebola as fearangstbeing scaredraw emotionsterrifying and anxiety nurses noted they call it the carers disease and said its very scary for me as a nurse to be at risk from an infectious patient n16 the fieldnotes capture how doctors and nurses struggled to control the fear aroused by ebola as an unknown riskworld health authorities have just announced that a second nurse has become infected while caring for an ebola patient in a us hospital in the eds central work area doctors and nurses are alarmed that hospitals in the first-world could not prevent ebola transmission to health care workers wearing personal protective equipment ppe and following protocols recommended by the centers for disease control so how did they get sick if they were wearing the correct ppedo we really understand how ebola is transmitted throughout the shift doctors anxiously check for updates and review the eds stocks of protective clothing concerned about its effectiveness in a follow-up interview a doctor justified their fears suddenly two nurses actually catch it in america and then the staff suddenly can see weve got a right to be scared fieldnotes fearful doctors and nurses sought information to assess the real risk of harm from ebola claims information was accessible through mass media coverage and social media networks among emergency physicians fieldnotes who and the us centers for disease control and prevention disseminated information and government policymakers in australia and hospital executives sent out communications and updates these state-endorsed sources offered scientific data and projections on ebola and reported on infection control and border protection protocols conversations about ebola bubbled d8 among doctors and nurses you couldnt go anywhere without hearing the word ebola when youre in the tea room or the corridor it was just an ebola fest d17 over time evaluations of the harm posed by ebola fragmented into two risk categories among doctors and nurses as custodians of the local place the first category evaluated ebola claims as a special risk while acknowledging that australias border protection protocols would likely prevent a person in the highly infectious wet stage of the virus from reaching the local place doctors and nurses in this category noticed cues from multiple information streams that two nurses in the us had become infected and bracketed these cues as important a doctor explained if those two nurses hadnt caught it i think the perceived risk of ebola would be totally different d16 these cues focused sensemaking attention on differences between ebola and more familiar threats ebolas high transmission risk incurability and high mortality rate were interpreted as a different sort of risk from that posed by violence and other infectious diseases ascribing significance to these differences produced the evaluation that claims by persons with ebola represented a special risk the second risk category evaluated ebola claims as a normal risk these ed staff noticed cues from state-endorsed sources that controlled the hysteria of ebola is coming to kill us all d14 these cues drew attention to contextual differences between australia a first-world nation with protected borders and advanced health systems and infection controls and west africa a third-world region with tribal practices and environmental conditions that accelerated ebola transmission and mortality a nurse explained the government here has put out precautions and assessed it and worked it out and obviously youve just got to trust in them that that is going to contain it n24 by contextualizing ebola these custodians became more calm fieldnotes and less caught up in the emotion of it all d18 sensemaking concentrated on similarities between ebola and known risks fieldnotes and it became pretty obvious that this situation was nothing other than normal d24 and nothing special to be worried about n15 claims for ebola were categorized as a normal risk equivalent to violence and other infectious diseases already accepted in custodian workthe chance of you being killed or assaulted by a violent patient is much higher than if you walk into a controlled environment with full protective gear on nothing is going to be transmitted d14 fragmented risk categories created contests among custodians about inclusive custodianship for potential ebola claims categorizing ebola as a normal risk justified maintaining ordinary custodianship through harm mitigation a doctor argued why do we make a special thing for ebola patients i dont understand it d3 if the real risk of infection was negligible all staff could be trained to a level of proficiency to engage safely with ebola claims this should be no different for us than treating someone with a febrile neutropenia fever with signs of infection d7 in contrast categorizing ebola as a special risk problematized custodianship and justified custodians avoiding harm by not responding to a claim if ebola is an exceptional risk then weve got to respond in a special way d5 and respect that some people have a view they dont want to be involved at all d1 wanting to opt out of responding to ebola claims some custodians proposed covering extra shifts in the ed while a small group of doctors and nurses self-selected to be intensively trained and regularly practicing as ebola rapid responders fieldnotes our data show the contest between the normal risk harm mitigation and special risk harm avoidance approaches to custodianship for potential ebola claims disrupted the taken-for-grantedness of the fieldsite ed as a local place of social inclusion with some doctors and nurses advocating withdrawing their normal custodian responsibilities for universal access custodians of the local place were no longer fully embodying the values that defined the institution of a public ed at the societal level in ed we dont get to pick and choose our patients n6 for custodians the taken-for-grantedness of the fieldsite ed as a universally accessible place for people with acute health needs as well as their own identity as the local protectors of that institutional value was disrupted articulating this disruption a doctor said theres that real challenge to the way weve always seen ourselves in ed as well see anyone well help you well heal you d11 our data show that during the disruption of the local place some doctors and nurses felt embarrassed that custodians were not living up to the role expectations that society had entrusted to them a doctor explained hysterical responses to ebola were a little embarrassing    because my identity as an emergency physician in a public ed is that if someone needs care then you give them careyou dont pick and choose who you see d13 others noted that it was disappointing d24 and embarrassing    for people to say were not here for this arent we im pretty sure we are d14 individuals contemplating the violation of their custodian responsibilities by not responding universally to ebola claims wrestled with both fear and self-conscious moral emotions like shamei dont even know if id be walking in there to treat a person who might have ebola but by the same token thats not the way were built in the public ed we cant say come here if youre sick and well see you and well sort you out unless youve got ebola    and i think thats whats caused that real level of angst and its challenged the way you perceive yourself as a custodian much more so than anything else d11 these emotional contests over custodianship of ebola claims came to a head at a meeting of senior ed doctors a member of the hospital executive team and the infectious diseases department the ed director organized the meeting to let people vent their spleen in a facilitated forum about how the local place should respond to ebola claims fieldnotes ed doctors used the meeting as a useful tool    for having those fierce conversations d20 about their differing views of ebola risk and custodianship the meeting was emotionally charged doctors expressed forcefulness of opinions    that showed how diverse views are d18 our analysis reveals that the robust debates in this meeting which were continued in follow-up meetings among emergency staff aided recovery from the disruption by clarifying the constitutive meaning of the public ed as a place of social inclusion these debates really crystallized d4 for custodians two constitutive elements that connected the societal institution of the public ed with the local place first the ed as a place of social inclusion was constituted by the salient attributes of persons making claims if a person was acutely sick and undiagnosed with an illness then absolutely the eds the right place for them n20 second the eds societal-level meaning as a place of social inclusion was constituted by local responses to claims that upheld the general principles of people having equal access d1 custodians agreed the role of a public ed    is to treat everyone exactly the same n14 thus when someone who may be symptomatic with ebola walks in off the street d7 custodians of the fieldsite ed as a local place must uphold universal access recovery of the constitutive meaning of the place of social inclusion motivated custodians to come up with a local emergency departmentbased solution to this potential risk d5 and protect the ed as a local place through harm mitigation custodians devised procedures to mitigate risk in the ebola isolation room sought advice from infectious disease experts on protective equipment and encouraged training but respected individual choice well let those who want to participate participate d22 most senior doctors and nurses undertook training and grew more confident that the risks of ebola could be mitigated a few custodians elected not to train although australia had no confirmed cases the ed received a small number of claims by persons suspected of being infected with ebola custodian responses to these claims confirmed that the ed was restored as a place of social inclusion following the disruption claims were made by persons who turned up at the ed with a fever and who may have had exposure to ebola through international travel but whose symptoms could stem from other illnesses such as malaria mitigating the risk of harm and managing their fear doctors and nurses assessed the needs underlying each claim and activated ed resourcesstaff isolation room blood tests investigationsto respond safely and appropriately a nurse who cared for a few suspected ebola patients said if someone came in with symptoms    we made sure we did everything right n21 through this harm-mitigation work custodians preserved the societal values of the ed as a universally accessible place of social inclusion at the local levelits our role to see everything i guess there was a lot of concern initially    because in this city we are the ebola hospital    but our concerns and our emotions were contained over time you cant ban the community just because you have certain concerns    public emergency departments are a place if youre sick you can come to emergency and well look after you    its an important role d25 the theoretical model we developed from our findings is presented in figure 1 the combination of place and institution creates a nesting of geographically specific places of social inclusion at the local level within the institutional level where these places are regulated valued and given meaning in society more broadly the democratic state establishes and supports places of social inclusion as institutions to meet citizens needs for universal access to essential services our model shows how the institution of a place of social inclusion can be maintained through microprocesses of custodianship at the local level every time a citizen exercises their right to universal access and presents at a local place of social inclusion to make a claim for services custodians have a responsibility to respond custodians are also deeply committed to the institutions values of social inclusion when a custodian perceives tensions between the institutional value of social inclusion and the local places ability to actualize the value these tensions elicit emotions and motivate multiple forms of custodian work that maintain the local place of social inclusion as illustrated in figure 1 custodians of a local place of social inclusion experience tension between accomplishing the societal value of social inclusion through universal access for citizens and working with the finite resources available at the local place for responding to claims perception of an inclusionresource tension evokes moral emotions such as empathy of varying intensity motivating custodians to reconcile the tension by engaging in resource-rationing work and resource-enabling work if custodians are unsuccessful the inclusionresource tension can become so unbalanced that universal access breaks down by allocating resources in ways that are or are not inclusive of all claims custodian work at the local place maintains or disrupts the institution of a place of social inclusion at the societal level custodians of a place of social inclusion at the local level can also perceive tension between the institutional value of universal access and the safety of the local place when custodians evaluate a citizens claim as carrying a known risk of harm the inclusionsafety tension arouses moral emotions and manageable fear that motivates custodians to engage in harm-mitigating work by safely protecting universal access at the local level this work maintains the place of social inclusion as an institution in contrast when custodians evaluate a claim as carrying an unknown risk the inclusionsafety tension arouses fear that is difficult for custodians to control and motivates a desire to keep the local place safe through harm-avoiding work because failing to respond to a claim deviates from a custodians responsibilities and value commitments to upholding universal access moral emotions are also elicited if moral emotions reduce fear to a manageable level custodians find ways to mitigate harm and protect universal access at the local place thereby maintaining the institution of a place of social inclusion at the societal level but if custodians fear outweighs moral emotions they feel justified in engaging in harm-avoiding work to protect the safety of the local place in this case access is denied for some or all citizens who want to make a claim at the local place disrupting the place of social inclusion as an institution the institutions that we label places of social inclusion have been studied using other theoretical lenses scholars in institutional theory and the sociology of professions have explored how doctors nurses teachers lawyers librarians museum curators social workers and other professionals maintain and change the logics practices values identity and status of professions within public emergency departments wright zammuto and liesch 2017 public schools arum 2000 hallett 2010 drug courts mcpherson and sauder 2013 public libraries nelson and irwin 2015 public museums blagoev felten and kahn 2018 and the like an implicit assumption is that these are places of professional work inside public-sector organizations our findings challenge this assumption because typifications of profession and organization are inadequate for capturing how societal-level values inhere in places at the local level framing geographic sites narrowly as places of professional work avoids attention to the higher level of social purpose that some of these places are mandated to fulfill in democratic society selznick 1992 viewing these places as public-sector organizations prioritizes questions associated with organizational goals and management processes kraatz ventresca and deng 2010 overlooking citizens expectations and lived experience of them not as organizations but as local places to which they are entitled access conjoining profession with public organization disregards the tensions between social inclusion and local resources and safety that make places of social inclusion precarious our conceptual insights into places of social inclusion move the literature forward by elucidating a puzzle that cuts across the literatures in sociology public administration and institutional theory this puzzle asks can a social purpose that is fundamentally experiential be institutionalized at all nilsson 2015 370 and leads to contradictions such as how schools can at once be egalitarian institutions and agents of inequality domina penner and penner 2017 311 in contrast to customary explanations anchored in professional administrative and organizational failure rowan 1982 raudenbush and eschmann 2015 our findings suggest these contradictions are related to the constitution of places of social inclusion as nested societal and local institutions whether an egalitarian institution at the societal level functions as an agent of equality or inequality at the local level depends on the volume and nature of claim-makers at a local place it also depends on the subjective judgments of claim-responders with regard to tensions between universal access and the finite resources and safety of the local place by revealing how the institutional dynamics of claim making and responding to claims are tailored to local places our model gives researchers and policymakers a new piece of the puzzle of experienced inequality selznick 1992 383 which was obscured when places of social inclusion were viewed through other theoretical lenses our identification of the concept of a place of social inclusion challenges researchers to consider the implications and potential scope conditions for established theories institutional complexity is likely to manifest differently when professionals work in these special places greenwood et al 2011 our findings intimate for example that some of the public defenders in mcpherson and sauders 2013 study of a drug court may have been more willing to stray from their home professional logic and strategically hijack other logics because they identified as custodians of a place of social justice and were engaged in custodianship to manage resource and safety tensions thus our model contributes place-based insights that may help to clarify and refine theories of how professionals function as institutional agents in a different vein our study offers a theoretical avenue for reconciling conflicting results about the paradox of expertise when new technology emerges in professional work lewis 2000 notably librarians in public libraries ignored the internet as predicted by the paradox of expertise nelson and irwin 2015 while curators in public museums embraced it blagoev felten and kahn 2018 museum curators linked the emerging technology of the internet and the principle of providing universal access to their collection blagoev felten and kahn 2018 1773 implying they responded to the internet as custodians of a place of social inclusion whereas librarians responded as professionals custodian identity for librarians became activated later when free access to online information created safety threats in local libraries by exposing children to inappropriate or offensive material jaeger et al 2012 the theoretical insights from our study hint that custodianship of universal access may moderate the paradox of expertise in contributing to these literatures we recognize that processes associated with professions and public-sector organizations also occur in places of social inclusion these were clearly present in our study of a public hospital emergency department what our findings unmask is a distinctive type of custodian work associated with a place of social inclusion that complements existing accounts offered by scholars of professions and public administration this raises an obvious question if public emergency departments for example are both places of medicine for professionals administered by public-sector organizations and places of social inclusion for society how can researchers separate the institutional work directed at these different institutions our findings show that doctors and nurses working in a public ed where all citizens could receive services distinguished their professional work from that performed in private ed settings where only patients able to pay received treatment they explained that their professional work as doctors and nurses was similar in both settings but that in a public ed they were also engaged in custodian work to manage value tensions associated with universal access this custodianship of the place of social inclusion was extra work overlaid on top of the normal work of patient diagnosis care and treatment required in a place of acute medicine thus in conceptualizing places of social inclusion we do not theorize that all work carried out is custodian work what differentiates custodianship is its activation through perceived value tensions between the societal-level value of social inclusion and the local place the defining characteristics of places of social inclusion mean that place is intrinsic to their institutional constitution and reproduction in a way that has been undertheorized by existing explanations of how institutions function lawrence and dover 2015 while prior studies have typically reduced place to a site where work directed at other institutions happens siebert wilson and hamilton 2017 our study reconceptualizes places as institutions in their own right our model reveals that rather than being mere background context place is constitutive of an institution itself and consequential for the custodian work required to maintain it we thus deepen theorizing about inhabited institutions hallett and ventresca 2006 by revealing how people inhabit institutions through their interactions with and within local places that are invested with societal values our study also contributes to the literature by offering fresh insight into how custodian work maintains institutions previous research has indicated that custodians identify with an institution and are committed to upholding its values and standards selznick 1957 soares 1997 which motivates them to invest effort in custodian work to protect the institution dacin dacin and kent 2019 our findings call into question an implicit assumption in much of the custodianship literature about how custodians think about and engage with the boundaries of an institution although researchers have not focused explicitly on modes of engagement the findings of prior research suggest this can be an important aspect of custodianship studies have reported that custodians maintain and protect institutions by restricting to insiders the performance rituals at the cambridge dining hall and texas am universitys aggie bonfire dacin and dacin 2008 dacin munir and tracey 2010 closing off the outside worlds access to the scottish advocates library siebert wilson and hamilton 2017 and excluding experiences not authentic to the remembered past of oregons tracktown howard-grenville metzger and meyer 2013 as these examples highlight studies tend to assume a singular mode of engagement in which custodians work to contain the boundaries of institutional participation by separating those who belong within an institutions values norms identities and practices from those who do not our model of custodianship challenges this implicit assumption of boundary containment we reveal an alternative mode of engagement in which custodians may purposefully direct effort to keep an institutions boundaries open rather than contained our findings show how custodian work that engages with institutional boundaries as permeable entails balancing a set of value tensions not evident when the mode of engagement is containment resource demands activate a distinctive value tension for custodians when boundaries are permeable on the one hand there might not be enough resources for custodians to keep the institution open for everyone seeking participation on the other hand closing off the institutions boundaries to some or all participants to conserve resources violates values and expectations of the custodian role this value tension elicits moral emotions and motivates custodian work to ration and enable resources in ways that keep the institution open for everyone in contrast resource demands do not appear to activate value tensions of this nature when the mode of engagement for custodian work is boundary containment thus the processes of resource rationing and resource enabling we find in places of social inclusion are distinctive from other forms of custodian work because the mode of engagement is boundary permeability rather than containment by bringing attention to permeability and containment as different modes of engagement with institutional boundaries our study propels inquiry into custodianship in new theoretical directions building on our novel insight that managing value tensions associated with resources and safety distinguishes custodianship that engages with boundaries as permeable future research could examine how these value tensions play out in custodianship in other institutions and explore other potential value tensions one possibility is to investigate the power of dominant groups such as when political pressures and interest groups at local levels try to undermine custodianship that seeks social inclusion lawrence and dover 2015 lawrence 2017 while the empirical data in our study do not allow us to examine the effects of local power future research is warranted to explore power and other potential sources of tension in custodianship directed at boundaries our study contributes to the emerging stream of literature on emotions and institutional work voronov and vince 2012 jarvis 2017 we extend prior research that shows moral emotions play a role in institutional work by illuminating when and how they can activate custodian work that protects an institutions values moral emotions are feelings that are prosocial and motivate action tendencies for the interests of others haidt 2003 tangney stuewig and mashek 2007 previous studies have focused attention on how moral emotionsincluding empathy for others pride in moral rightness and shame at moral wrongsmotivate institutional work to create maintain and change institutions moisander hirsto and fahy 2016 fan and zietsma 2017 toubiana and zietsma 2017 wright zammuto and liesch 2017 adding to this growing line of research our study highlights how moral emotions motivate custodian work when actors care deeply about the values of an institution and perceive tension between those values and their accomplishment in local places moreover our findings reveal that embedded actors can feel emotional attachment to both institutions and local places thus we speculate that the intensity of moral emotions may be stronger when institutional work is targeted at maintaining institutions that are constituted as places although future research is needed to explore this possibility we also contribute to the emotions literature by casting new light on the role that fear plays in institutions prior research has offered two broad explanations first an institutions regulations norms and systemic power arouse fear among institutional actors which disciplines them to conform marti and fernandez 2013 gill and burrow 2018 second institutional actors may use fear as a motivational force to collectively create maintain and change institutions moisander hirsto and fahy 2016 wijaya and heugens 2018 both explanations are rooted in a socialized understanding of fear as being experienced in the context of institutions voronov and vince 2012 in contrast our study of ebola in a public emergency department reveals the potential for an alternative understanding in which fear is less directly connected to a persons socialization within an institution and operates at a more basic level this conceptualization resonates with the psychology literature on basic emotions in which fear is an immediate intuitive reaction to a stimulus that triggers human behavior for survival ekman 1992 1999 custodians initial fears about the ebola virus were basic emotions and the immediate instinct was self-defense to avoid personal harm this distinction between fear as a socialized and basic emotion is not trivial whereas prior research has shown that socialized fear is an important and relatively straightforward mechanism in institutional maintenance creed et al 2014 gill and burrow 2018 our study reveals that institutional processes are more complicated when institutional actors feel fear as a basic emotion our findings suggest that the impact of fear as a basic emotion is moderated by other types of socialized emotions within institutions most notably moral emotions in our study moral emotions that were endogenously embedded in the institution of a place of social inclusionincluding empathy for the needs of institutional participants and embarrassment at the possibility of failing to uphold the institutions valuesrose up to play off against fear triggered exogenously as a basic emotion by the environmental jolt of the ebola outbreak through their self-consciously evaluative nature moral emotions helped to dampen fear to the degree that custodians were able to fight against their own basic instincts for self-preservation and engage in institutional work to maintain the institution a comparable interplay of moral emotions and basic emotions appears to have normalized fears associated with custodian work in response to familiar infectious diseases and patient violence thus our model extends prior research on moral emotions by illuminating their critical role in moderating fear which otherwise has the potential to derail institutional maintenance we speculate that if a patient suffering from ebola or behaving violently caused serious harm or death to others basic emotions might overwhelm more reflective moral emotions and disrupt ordinary processes of institutional maintenance we call for further research exploring the dynamics of fear and institutional disruption which events associated with the covid-19 pandemic suggest is an issue of vital global importance for places of social inclusion interplay between basic and moral emotions in the unfolding processes of institutional work over time is a unique aspect of our study prior empirical studies have tended to ignore basic emotions possibly because they seem  priori to be less theoretically salient to institutions than socialized emotions the study of emotions in institutions has also been hampered by methodological difficulties of tracing institutional actors emotions in real time goodrick jarvis and reay 2019 our study benefitted methodologically when an unexpected environmental jolt meyer 1982 during our fieldwork cast the basic emotion of fear into sharp relief thus it is hardly surprising that the relationships between basic and moral emotions and institutional work revealed in our study have been largely hidden until now we conjecture that these relationships are generalizable to other institutions beyond places of social inclusion we suspect for example that institutional work to create canadas first safe narcotics injection sites in lawrences 2017 study and institutional work to disrupt organized crime in sicily in vaccaro and palazzos 2015 study were both enabled by moral emotions controlling institutional actors basic emotions of fear in addition to exploring the experience of fear in other types of institutions we invite investigation of other basic emotions identified in the psychology literature including anger disgust happiness sadness and surprise ekman 1992 1999 future research into institutional work could explore when and how instinctive basic emotions work with and against higher-order reflective emotions that are more closely connected with actors socialization and embeddedness within institutions such as moral anger and betrayal toubiana and zietsma 2017 wijaya and heugens 2018 shame creed et al 2014 other-suffering empathy wright zammuto and liesch 2017 and pride fan and zietsma 2017 our study brings attention to places of social inclusion as important institutions of the democratic state that provide citizens with universal access to essential human services we offer insight into how these institutions are maintained across nested societal and local levels through the purposeful work of custodians we invite research exploring custodianship in diverse places of social inclusion ranging from places with venerable histories of inclusion like public schools and museums to recently emerging places like sanctuary cities our findings about how such places endure are timely in light of the overwhelming fear and disruptions to places of social inclusion in the wake of the global coronavirus pandemic and given contested political discourse in the us and europe about what it means for nations cities and communities to be socially inclusive places we encourage scholars to explore places of social inclusion and to expand the theorization and empirical investigation of place and institutions  understanding surgical risk during covid-19 pandemic the rationale behind the decisions konstantinos blouhos konstantinos boulas andreas aikaterini paraskeva alexandros triantafyllidis maria nathanailidou konstantinos hatzipourganis anestis hatzigeorgiadis   on january 2020 the world health organization who issued a global health alert for a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 that caused an acute respiratory infection disease covid-19 which originated in wuhan hubei province china the covid-19 pandemic as declared by the who on march 2020 has led to over 770000 cases worldwide reported at the end of march 2020 spreading on a logarithmic scale in europe and the usa as the need for hospitalization among symptomatic cases is 10 globally with an increased need for intensive care unit admission and 3 mortality hospitals have started to intensively reduce elective activities including surgery to prepare for the high numbers of admissions 1 during sars outbreaks health care workers hcws have a significantly increased risk of contracting the sars-cov the risk of acute respiratory infection ari transmission through surgical care services is not fully delineated this is the reason why who guidelines recommend additional infection control measures for surgeons providing services on sars-cov-2 suspected patients furthermore the effects of submitting a covid-19 patient to surgery or general anesthesia on pulmonary functions and postoperative courses are unknown 2 the present article aims to delineate why the surgical patient constitutes a risk factor for sars-cov-2 transmission to hcws while at the same time surgery itself constitutes a risk factor for patients safety during the covid-19 pandemia it is estimated that a large proportion almost less than a half of sars-cov-2 infected patients are asymptomatic mizumoto et al reported epidemiological data among the 3063 passengers of the diamond princess cruise ship tested for sars-cov-2 with rt-pcr and reported that 634 people tested positive of the 634 confirmed cases almost half 517 were reported to be asymptomatic 3 nishiura et al reported epidemiological data among 565 japanese people who had been evacuated from wuhan china and reported that almost a third 308 of them who tested positive for sars-cov-2 with rt-pcr was asymptomatic 4 there are sufficient resources showing that there is a transmission potential from asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic patients bai et al reported a familial cluster of five covid-19 patients hospitalized with symptoms of ari that before onset had contact with an asymptomatic family member who remained asymptomatic for the entire duration of surveillance 5 zou et al reported that the viral load that was detected in the asymptomatic patient among 18 patients tested positive for sars-cov-2 with rt-pcr was similar to that in the 17 symptomatic patients the authors concluded that asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic patients have a transmission potential even during the period with modestly detectable viral rna levels in the oropharynx 5 days before the onset of symptoms and suggested that better data are necessary to determine transmission dynamics and inform screening practices 6 it is important to emphasize that surgical patients are a distinct patient category as they can be highly contagious for hcws under specific conditions during provision of surgical care services the reason why surgical patients should be treated as highly contagious is that these patients demand close contact and prolonged exposure during surgical care and all are prone to be submitted to aerosol generating procedures factors that all contribute to ari transmission the majority of surgical patients referred for surgical consultation have no symptoms of ari as referred above approximately half of covid-19 patients are asymptomatic and have a transmission potential during the pandemic it wouldnt be so rare for an asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic covid-19 patient to have a surgical problem consequently it is rational that all surgical patients even those without any symptoms of ari should be treated as sars-cov-2 positive until tested negative the main route of sars-cov-2 transmission is inhalation of infectious aerosols infectious aerosols consist of large respiratory droplets and droplet nuclei large respiratory droplets are 510 m in diameter and are involved in short-range transmission droplet nuclei are 5 m and are responsible for transmission over greater distances aerosol generating procedures are defined as procedures that result in the production of droplet nuclei that create the potential for ari transmission that otherwise may only be transmissible by the droplets during perioperative anesthesiological management intubation extubation and related procedures such as manual ventilation are considered as aerosol generating procedures tran et al in a systematic review including five case-control and five retrospective cohort studies evaluated the risk of ari transmission from aerosol generating procedures and showed that tracheal intubation non-invasive ventilation tracheotomy and manual ventilation before intubation were significantly associated with an increased risk of transmission whereas endotracheal aspiration nasogastric tube insertion nebulizer treatment high flow o2 manipulation of o2 mask or bipap mask and chest compressions were not significantly associated with transmission 7 given the significant concern of airborne transmission additional infection control measures for surgeons and hcws providing services on sars-cov-2 suspected patients are recommended 8 as discussed above the main route of sars-cov-2 transmission is inhalation of infectious aerosols according to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 expression organs with a high risk for sars-cov-2 infection are the lungs followed by kidney esophagus bladder ileum and heart which also expresses ace2 9 whether transmission is possible through inhalation of aerosols in the surgical smoke produced by energy devices during open and laparoscopic surgery to infected organs is unknown furthermore concerning laparoscopic surgery there is no evidence to rule out whether leakage of pneumoperitoneum contributes to aerosol transmission there is substantial evidence showing the presence of viable viruses in surgical smoke as activated papillomavirus and hiv smoke generated by ultrasonic scalpels has a lower temperature and is more likely to contain more infectious particles than smoke of higher temperatures energy devices commonly used in laparoscopy can easily produce large amounts of smoke in the low mobility pneumoperitoneum with significantly higher concentrations than laparotomy sudden release of trocar valves non-airtight exchange of instruments and small abdominal extraction incisions can expose the surgeon to pneumoperitoneum aerosol exposure 10 given the significant concern of airborne transmission conventional instead of laparoscopic surgery is recommended during the covid-19 pandemia 11 the effects of surgery or general anesthesia on pulmonary functions and postoperative courses in covid-19 patients are unknown aminian et al in their case series study reported four patients submitted to elective cholecystectomy hernioplasty gastric bypass and hysterectomy and who developed postoperative pulmonary complications in the first few weeks of the covid-19 outbreak in tehran iran three out of four patients died due to severe covid-19 pneumonia and ards 12 the above brief clinical report has an apparent importance because of its two key clinical messages 1 repeated proper documentation is necessary in their article it is not known whether the four studied patients who submitted to elective surgery were sars-cov-2 infected at admission during hospitalization or after discharge and 2 the effects of surgery and general anesthesia on covid-19 progression is unknown the article clearly highlights the potential fatality that unnecessary surgery can produce during the pandemic based on the above screening for sars-cov-2 in all surgical patients in order for unexpected casualties on both the patient and surgeon sides to be avoided is rational as 1 surgical patients are highly contagious 2 surgery is a risk factor for transmission and 3 the effects of surgery or general anesthesia on pulmonary functions and postoperative courses in covid-19 patients are unknown at admission to hospital the surgical patient who usually has no symptoms of acute febrile respiratory illness plus clinical and epidemiological clues leaves initial triage and is referred for surgical consultation at admission to the surgical emergency unit apart from taking the standard surgical history and making the standard physical examination surgeons should get familiarized with taking a more thorough epidemiologic history and performing a more thorough physical examination of the respiratory system in search of clues for covid-19 which should be documented as presented in the module 1 case record form crf provided by the who at admission to the surgical emergency unit apart from the standard laboratory tests serum lactate mmoll ldh ul cpk ul crp mgl troponin ngml esr mmhr d-dimer mgl ferritin ngml and il-6 pgml levels should be ordered as these markers are essential for proper documentation of patients suspected to have covid-19 as presented in the module 1 crf provided by the who regarding imaging and pathogen testing the routine use of chest ct and rt-pcr in all surgical patients for screening and early diagnosis of covid-19 during the pandemic is rational as referred above surgical patients can be highly contagious asymptomatic sars-cov-2 positive patients have a transmission potential and the effects on disease progression of surgery or general anesthesia in covid-19 patients are unknown therefore it is of crucial importance that early diagnosis or exclusion of covid-19 is established if possible before proceeding to surgery for both patient and surgeon safety except for the initial detailed documentation as in module 1 who crf it is of substantial importance that proper documentation is continued during hospitalization and at discharge or death as in module 2 and 3 who crf the purpose of detailed documentation is for early diagnosis of a misdiagnosed sars-cov-2 positive patient during initial presentation or early diagnosis of an intrahospital transmission during the covid-19 pandemic regardless of the presence of ari symptoms all surgical patients should be considered as sars-cov-2 suspected a a detailed epidemiologic history and respiratory physical examination should be added to standard history and physical examination b serum lactate ldh cpk crp troponin d-dimer and ferritin level should be added to standard laboratory testing c chest ct should be added to standard imaging testing and d rt-pcr should be performed in all patients by gathering all the above data a rapid risk assessment can be completed for patient triage and decision making based on various pandemic surgery guidelines which share common principles 13 conclusively as every surgery entails higher patient and hcw risk unnecessary exposure to general anesthesia and surgery should be avoided during the covid-19 pandemic kbo conceived the idea for

 this is due to concerns regarding the availability of hospital beds and personal protective equipment ppe skilled personnel the risk of covid19 transmission to patients and providers and the need for hospitals to provide safe care for patients with and without covid19 infection concomitantly which may further strain healthcare systems at the peak of the pandemic federal and state orders limited the performance of elective procedures to conserve human and material resources

 used the term of medically necessary timesensitive ments procedures to stress the fact that most outpatient surgeries and procedures are in fact clinically necessary and that the term elective usually refers to the timing of such procedures that can be elected without having a negative impact on the outcome of the procedure or the disease process as opposed to urgent or emergent cases they designed a scoring system to prioritize and triage surgical cases that are medically necessary but still elective incorporating elements that reflect on the use of limited resources and risk of covid19 transmission although such a prioritization system would also be helpful in the catheterization laboratory setting some of the variables used were not applicable to cardiovascular cv procedures where other patient and procedural factors may be more relevant having a triaging tool that can be applied specifically to cv procedures remains timely as government regulations and recommendations from professional societies have conditioned the resumption of elective procedures on the availability of strategies to prioritize cases

 we proposed and evaluated the use of a cv ments procedure scoring system for standardized triage of procedures performed in the catheterization laboratory the cumulative score for individual patients was reported as a continuous variable between 15 and 64 points as described above mean se and median interquartile range iqr score values were calculated categorically procedure patient and disease factors and cumulatively for both performed and deferred groups data were also stratified by type of procedure ie cardiac catheterization heart failure electrophysiology endovascular and structural scores between the two groups were compared using independent t tests for means and mannwhitney u tests for medians analyses were performed using spss version 23 a total of 109 scheduled outpatient procedures were either deferred n  58 or performed n  51 during the study period the types of procedures included electrophysiology n  23 cardiac catheterization n  39 endovascular n  18 heart failure n  17 and structural heart disease n  12 table 1 describes categorical and cumulative scores stratified by procedure type within deferred and performed categories no patients in the deferred group required unanticipated admission to the hospital the distribution of cumulative cv ments procedure scores for deferred and performed cases is described in figure 3 the median and mean cumulative cv ments procedure scores for the group of performed cases were significantly lower than for the deferred group 26 iqr 2231 vs 33 iqr 2839 p  001 and 264 se 034 vs 329 se 035 p  001 respectively we report a cv ments procedure scoring system that can be used to prioritize elective cv procedures during the covid19 pandemic based on a composite measure of resource utilization risk of procedural complications and transmission of covid19 infection and time sensitivity and clinical need in our study population the cumulative cv ments procedure score was significantly lower in the group of elective cases that were performed compared with those that were deferred during a period of time when new jerseys executive order 109 was in effect

 our findings suggest that the cv ments procedure scorecard may be a useful tool for the triage of elective cases during the time that many states in the country relax restrictions on the performance of elective surgeries and procedures the cv ments procedure score much like prachands for surgical procedures

 requires providers to consider factors that up until now were not part of any decision process when scheduling cases by providing a more objective and quantifiable way of assessing these factors the cv ments procedure scorecard can be incorporated into a transparent prioritization process that mitigates the moral and ethical burden of decisionmakers when put in the difficult situation of having to rationalize resources during the pandemic and may minimize the possibility of conflict among healthcare providers competing for such resources the importance of having and utilizing such prioritization tools is underscored by state executive orders that direct the efforts to resume elective procedures and require mechanisms to prioritize cases like new jerseys executive order 145

 also highlights the need to have plans in place that balance the benefits of offering treatment with the risk of exacerbating the spread of covid19 while ensuring reserve capacity in the event of a second surge following the values of fairness and consistency introducing a standardized and objective approach to any prioritization process using the cv ments procedure scorecard is a step in this direction our study has a number of limitations the variables included in the cv ments procedure scorecard were chosen based on supposition of relevance derived from clinical experience and plausibility and are not the product of any systematic or statistical analysis likewise in this first iteration weighing of each variable or group of variables as contributors to the cumulative score may not be proportionate to what could be if a rigorous quantitative method was applied to understand their impact on the composite measure of resource utilization risk of covid19 exposuretransmission and clinical urgency as such it is possible that some variables may be under or overrepresented given the lack of historical context and data from which to identify other relevant factors it is possible that important variables have been omitted further iterations of this scorecard could refine the variables used and their respective weight as we gather more experience in managing resources during a pandemic the utility of the cv ments procedure scorecard resides in its ability to rank cases based on the composite measure described above it is not a substitute for clinical judgment which should always prevail and should not be used as a punitive tool to justify not allowing the performance of elective cases that are medically indicated rather it should be used as part of a transparent process of prioritizing the proper timing of cases based on the availability of resources the risk of covid19 transmission and the clinical need in summary resuming cv procedures during the covid19 pandemic will require taking into account strategies that allow for the rational use of resources while protecting patients and staff from exposure to the virus factors that are newly introduced into scheduling decisions of every cardiac catheterization laboratory we propose that the cv ments procedure scorecard can be a useful tool to assist clinicians and administrators in the prioritization of cv procedures in a consistent and fair manner at a time when available capacity may be limited the authors declare no conflicts of interest  planning and provision of ecmo services for severe ards during the covid-19 pandemic and other outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases kollengode ramanathan david antognini alain combes matthew paden bishoy zakhary mark ogino graeme maclaren daniel brodie kiran shekar   the who-declared pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is causing clusters of fatal pneumonia from coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 with reports of some patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo support1 2 3 4 who interim guidelines5 for the management of suspected covid-19 recommend administering venovenous ecmo to eligible patients with covid-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome ards in expert centres with sufficient case volumes to ensure clinical expertise however its effectiveness will be influenced by the initial experience and preparedness of the health-care system6 although there are observational data on the use of rescue ecmo during previous outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases mainly in the context of influenza ah1n1 ards the real need for ecmo during such outbreaks is unclear for reference the incidence of ecmo use in patients with 2009 influenza ah1n1 ards in australia and new zealand was estimated to be 26 cases per million whereas 58 of the critically ill patients in saudi arabia were supported with ecmo for middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus-related ards7 8 therefore the overall impact of the covid-19 outbreak on potential ecmo use is currently unclear but there could be an increased need for ecmo worldwide this outbreak is occurring at a time when worldwide ecmo infrastructure and resources for education9 and research10 are considerably more evolved and organised than they were a decade ago most importantly there is now substantially more evidence to support the efficacy and safety of ecmo in patients with ards than during previous outbreaks11 12 13 14 although during the 2009 influenza ah1n1 pandemic few ecmo centres were included in the extracorporeal life support organization elso registry of active centres figure 1
15 many were urgently established during the outbreak notably despite a steady increase in elso-registered centres there are many centres that are still not registered which makes it challenging to assess the actual global ecmo capacity and capability the planning of ecmo services during an outbreak of an emerging infectious disease such as covid-19 can be broadly categorised into ensuring appropriate organisation of personnel equipment facilities and systems figure 2
16 as with any scarce resource in times of high demand a mismatch in these factors can develop during the 2009 influenza ah1n1 pandemic inadequate surge capacity highlighted the need for intensive-care reserves and improved health-care resource planning at all levels17 18 in an effort to improve ecmo preparedness19 for an outbreak of an emerging infectious disease we highlight the ten key components of an ecmo action plan panel
 based on these four categories with practical recommendations for health centres to ensure appropriate training capacity and planning depending on local priorities and resources the focus is on building sustainable systems that ensure quality care for patients and their families and staff safety and wellbeing details on the organisation of ecmo programmes have been reported elsewhere 20 21
panelkey components in the planning and provision of ecmo during an outbreak of an emerging infectious disease
ecmo resource planning and allocation
embed ecmo response into the broad epidemic response strategy identify and engage all key stakeholders maintain a log of multidisciplinary team members specifically trained in the care of patients receiving ecmo maintain a contemporaneous log of ecmo machines serviced and ready to deploy ensure supply of disposables and develop a regional tracking mechanism prepare for surge of patients
personnel assignment
establish chain of command at ecmo centre level and regional level formulate minimum and ideal staffing requirements allocate roles in the ecmo process and allow for staff attrition develop urgent mechanisms for ecmo credentials across institutions
personnel training and ecmo use
provide site-specific training and involve multidisciplinary team members ensure correct use of ppe and the handling of infected bodily secretions reinforce need for optimal conventional management of patients and review ecmo indications simulate ecmo initiation and troubleshooting scenarios
infection control measures before and during ecmo initiation
group patients into cohorts for ecmo therapy and clearly mark all areas of increased precaution ensure ppe stations are strategically placed to enhance compliance strictly enforce all infection control protocols and ppe use for ecmo processes
transport of patients receiving ecmo
devise eligibility criteria for inter-hospital transfer and share them with referral centres ensure effective communication and coordination identify and address rate-limiting steps strictly adhere to infection control protocols throughout patient transport
ecmo weaning decannulation and rehabilitation
carry out ecmo weaning decannulation and rehabilitation under strict infection control and personal protection measures use caution while predicting native lung recovery on ecmo arrange follow-up of patients who have been weaned from ecmo to ensure long-term outcomes
post-mortem care
map capacity of mortuary facilities in ecmo centres and review guidelines for post-mortem care carry out post-mortem decannulation and transport of deceased under strict infection control and personal protection measures follow national and international guidelines on disposal of infectious biological hazardous materials
staff support
routinely monitor staff for their health and wellbeing put in place protocols for contact tracing ensure provision of a team of psychiatrists psychologists and social workers to monitor and treat the psychological effects on staff ensure that sick personnel are quarantined for 2 weeks with a clear follow-up and escalation plan in place provide protocols for contact tracing of staff members
ethical considerations
use predetermined consensus criteria for rationing of ecmo if indicated reassess all aspects of a patients treatment plan regularly including the need to continue or terminate ecmo invoke distributive justice only in circumstances where rationing precludes the ability to care for each individual optimally seek opinions from hospital ethics and medicolegal committees in ethically challenging scenarios
quality assurance and collaborative research
maintain quality assurance and clinical governance frameworks with frequent ecmo quality reviews ensure collection and sharing of data to inform preparedness and patient care aim to have ethics approval in place or develop mechanisms for expedient ethics review and approval processesecmoextracorporeal membrane oxygenation ppepersonal protective equipment ecmo centres should maintain a dedicated manifest of all members of their multidisciplinary team who are specifically trained in the care of patients receiving ecmo a contemporaneous log of machines serviced and ready to deploy should be maintained although stockpiling of ecmo-related equipment in specific centres might be appropriate care must be taken not to hoard supplies hospital operations teams and regional tracking of disposables can help with the distribution of these supplies on the basis of need all ecmo centres should have designated areas for putting on and removing of personal protective equipment ppe and power air-purifying respirators papr regional planning should also predict and prepare for a surge of patients to designated expert ecmo centres clustering patients with covid-19 requiring ecmo within an expert centre should be considered for ease of resource management22 it would be desirable to have a regional outbreak response system that stratifies the extent of the disease spread the risk of extended transmission and the effect on the wider community23 to allow hospital authorities to allocate appropriate resources and reduce elective services and admissions within a suitable timeframe as supply chains might be compromised by excessive demand the components essential to operating an ecmo service should be centrally coordinated however individual centres must focus on conservation of scarce supplies to ensure readiness in case of surges in demand and to support neighbouring hospitals this strategy will require frequent reporting by centres to the local or regional organising body in the event that ecmo centres exceed their capacity a list of regional expert centres with contact details and directions that clearly delineate arrival areas with adequate infection control precautions should be readily available all ecmo centres should identify key rate-limiting factors to target in the event of a surge in demand with respect to the four key categories of resource allocation figure 2 it is probable that when all resources are stretched during an outbreak the use of ecmo might be reconsidered and available resources targeted at caring for more patients with interventions that are less resource-intensive6 expert centres might consider offering ecmo services to less experienced centres by sending in a satellite team or using telemedicine24 until resources are re-established in the expert centre a regional plan for monitoring available beds and supplies could assist in coordinating the distribution of transported patients to avoid overloading a referral site for decisions involving resource allocation and complex inter-hospital transfers a local and regional ecmo coordinator could help to strengthen this model of care the chain of command for dealing with high demand in every ecmo centre should be established and widely publicised with clear instructions allocated roles and appropriate simulation drills25 the ecmo director would lead the team in managing patients receiving ecmo at an institutional level the director should also identify teams of doctors perfusionists nurses respiratory therapists and physiotherapists who can be rostered in groups after ecmo has been initiated multidisciplinary team involvement with an infectious disease specialist should be seen as a minimum requirement to further patient management given the need for subspecialty knowledge regarding testing monitoring therapeutics and containment26 we recommend that ecmo centres formulate a minimum and an ideal staffing requirement and communicate them to the local regional and national networks to facilitate staffing allocation in case ecmo team members become ill or otherwise unavailable a dedicated ecmo team should care for all patients but ongoing training to increase the number of staff members with less experience should be encouraged whenever safe and feasible this approach has two advantages preventing burnout in the short term and improving preparation for future pandemics globally technicians and biomedical engineers could also participate in such teams as part of the clinical interdisciplinary team a surgeon or clinician with an extended skillset eg experienced intensivist with cannulation skills could be involved to enhance the safety and success of cannulation while reducing the incidence of vascular complications on decannulation personnel training is essential to ensure preparedness and success in dealing with a pandemic ensuring staff safety must be a high institutional priority training in use of ecmo should be site-specific and should involve team members with interdisciplinary experience apart from ecmo-specific training team members should become familiar with general intensive-care management practices largely supportive26 27 28 29 of infected patients during an outbreak training programmes should be led by expert members of the ecmo team with support from other specialised staff eg infection control and formulated into guidelines for clinical management such guidelines should be made available to all members of the ecmo team all ecmo team members should be educated on the eligibility criteria of patients with emerging infectious diseases to receive ecmo support from the reported clinical characteristics of patients with covid-19 thus far2 30 31 patient selection and the decision to initiate ecmo can be based on established criteria such as those for severe ards from other causes20 32
 the correct use of personal protection devices and handling of infected bodily secretions and laboratory specimens are essential skills to empower health-care workers and all other institutional staff to manage any pandemic after adequate ppe training use of all ecmo-related equipment must be practiced as a team in a high-fidelity simulation environment while wearing ppe or papr practice scenarios should simulate critical events that might be stressful even without added burdens such as accidental decannulation pump failure air in the circuit and cardiac arrest operators should be familiar with the ecmo cannula sizes and dilators and be able to deal with cannulation complications while wearing ppe or papr since verbal communication peripheral vision and vision clarity through a respirator lens or face shield are impaired simulation training should also ensure that these nuances are not experienced for the first time at the bedside although ecmo can be a viable rescue strategy for some patients32 it is not a substitute for optimal conventional ards management typically this management includes ventilation with low tidal volumes and at least moderate positive end-expiratory pressure while restricting plateau airway and driving pressures33 and accepting some hypercapnia this strategy can include a neuromuscular blockade and should always include prone positioning unless contraindicated or technically unfeasible some patients can be considered too unstable for prone positioning and might have to be administered rescue ecmo expeditiously if possible equally in unstable patients and in patients who are likely to deteriorate during transfer ecmo can be used to facilitate safe transport from a non-expert centre to an expert centre34 all infection control and personal protection measures should be followed when ecmo is being initiated for a patient in extremis as such uncontrolled situations can put team members at high risk of exposure to pathogens once the patient is safely administered ecmo it is important to ensure that an ultra-protective mechanical ventilation strategy is used11 35 36 there is no consensus on the most appropriate ventilatory strategy for ecmo two randomised trials of ventilation during ecmo for patients with ards eolia11 plateau pressure of 24 cm h2o while applying a positive end-expiratory pressure of at least 10 cm h2o respiratory rate of 1030 breaths per min and conventional ventilatory support versus ecmo for severe adult respiratory failure cesar37 peak inspiratory pressure 2025 cm h2o positive end-expiratory pressure 10 cm h2o respiratory rate of 10 breaths per min could serve as useful guides pending further evidence on ventilation strategies for ecmo in patients with ards prone positioning could be considered during ecmo although there are few data to support this practice38
 the benefits of ecmo for ards largely stem from its ability to confer lung protection which is associated with decreased adverse outcomes it should be noted that although extracorporeal co2 removal for lung-protective ventilation is feasible it is neither evidence-based nor is it universally available39 occasionally patients develop concomitant or discrete cardiac failuremainly from myocarditis myocardial infarction or sepsis-related cardiomyopathyand might need venoarterial ecmo provision of ecmo in the setting of both pulmonary and cardiac dysfunction is particularly complex and where possible requires close liaison with an expert extracorporeal life support centre before ecmo initiation ecmo-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation ecpr can be considered in carefully selected patients who develop cardiac arrest however given the likelihood of poor outcomes and the considerable risk of infection to staff responding to these patients ecpr should be undertaken with great caution routine use of steroids is not recommended on the basis of data from influenza studies that suggest potential harm40 41 although the usefulness of antiviral medications in the context of the covid-19 outbreak is unclear an understanding of altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics during ecmo42 43 will enable optimal dosing of antiviral drugs frequent ecmo simulation exercises should also be considered outside a state of emergency to develop and reinforce cannulation skills deal with circuit or pump emergencies and practise other troubleshooting exercises all with ppe or papr donned infection control precautions are essential to prevent further spread of emerging infectious diseases and to keep the treating team other patients and family members safe8 areas of increased precaution should be clearly marked and visual and audio guidance where possible should be provided to staff trying to enter these areas pre-existing security measures must be maintained eg swipe card and code access and mask users must always check the seals before entry into any patient area additional security personnel to ensure staff and patient safety in what can be a difficult and emotionally charged environment might be necessary the stations for personal protection devices must be strategically placed to enhance compliance who recommends that health-care workers performing aerosol-generating procedures such as endotracheal intubation and bronchoscopy should do them in an adequately ventilated roomie with natural ventilation airflow of at least 160 ls per patient or in negative-pressure rooms at least 12 air changes per h when using mechanical ventilation devices a controlled direction of airflow is required use of n95 or fluidfirm particle-2 masks is essential and previous fit-testing is desirable44
 ecmo centres should revisit their existing infection control guidelines and protocols and ensure that all members of the ecmo team receive adequate training44 45 if ecmo needs to be initiated at another health centre the team should either carry the ppe or papr resources with them or be familiar with using equipment at another hospital personnel performing ecmo cannulation must wear sterile attire in addition to personal protection devices to reduce the infection control resources required to transport highly contagious patients receiving ecmo ecmo centres should consider developing facility-level plans to group such patients46 it would be desirable to have harmonised infection-control practices in regional hospitals so that ecmo teams are used to a standardised approach to personal protection devices expert centres should devise eligibility criteria specific to the current outbreak for inter-hospital transfer and share them with referral centres an experienced ecmo clinician should evaluate referrals and enact retrieval plans as required if the rapidity of disease progression from dyspnoea to ards is short or unknown we recommend early transfer eg after tracheal intubation to an ecmo centre if feasible if ecmo needs to be initiated in a peripheral hospital the ecmo team should be aware of the local resources and make a concerted effort not to deplete their supplies guidance for preparing the patient and the area for cannulation on the teams arrival should be forwarded to the local hospital to shorten turnaround time any rate-limiting steps should be identified early by a dedicated ecmo retrieval coordinator effective communication and coordination will be crucial for a successful and efficient interhospital transfer47 declined referrals should be clearly communicated to the treating team patients receiving ecmo might also require transportation within the same institution to the radiology suite cardiac catheterisation laboratory or operating room the risk-benefit profile of all transports must include the possibility of disease dissemination to health-care workers and the public this risk should be meticulously assessed before ecmo is initiated strict continuous adherence to infection control policies is required with immediate disinfection of the route and transport vehicles to prevent and reduce the risk of cross-contamination the natural history of covid-19 pneumonia and the median time to resolution are currently unknown all ecmo centres should have standardised ecmo weaning protocols48 49 and team members should be trained accordingly a successful weaning trial should be accompanied by decannulation and further rehabilitation should follow strict infection control measures with use of ppe or papr ambulation of the patient outside the negative-pressure room might not be possible as long as the patient is infectious follow-up of such patients is important to ensure that their long-term outcomes are acceptable50
 weaning and decannulation simulation drills using ppe and papr should be considered possible exit strategies including maintaining ecmo until recovery transplantation or palliation should be actively deliberated in the event of a requirement for prolonged ecmo and options should be based on a realistic understanding of available resources until further evidence is available all deceased patients should be treated as infectious and appropriate precautions adopted storage capacities of mortuary facilities in ecmo centres should be mapped and guidelines for post-mortem care reviewed51 decannulation of the deceased if they were treated with ecmo might carry a strong infection risk and should be done while wearing ppe and papr waste should be disposed of following national and international guidelines on disposal of infectious biological hazardous materials flowcharts for post-mortem management of patients with covid-19 following ecmo decannulation should be considered such flowcharts should include certification of death notification of health authorities and appropriate wrapping of the body the body handlers and the immediate family members should take infection control precautions members of the ecmo team should be frequently monitored for their health and wellbeing given the risk of infection transmission to health-care providers moderate-to-high staff attrition rates as a result of increased psychological stress should be anticipated and ameliorated with provision of stress management and psychosocial support for team members51 a multidisciplinary team of trained psychiatrists psychologists social workers or psychiatric nurses would be ideal to monitor and treat affected staff a psychiatric hotline could be made available to staff members in need of urgent attention52 centres need to review policies to manage and retain staff trained in ecmo including insurance incentives sick leave and occupational health and safety personnel who show symptoms of infection should be quarantined for a duration based on the maximal incubation period of the infection eg 2 weeks with a clear follow-up and escalation plan in place if their condition deteriorates additionally protocols for contact-tracing of all non-infected patients who have been cared for by an infected staff member must be available workplace policies for management of staff wellbeing including ensuring the presence of staff support services to provide basic amenities such as meals and drinks showering facilities rest areas and a laundry service for used scrubs or uniforms could be introduced training of staff not specialised in ecmo should be considered to further support crucial roles in the ecmo teams eg credentialling of nurses16 51 institutions might consider segregating teams treating highly infectious patients receiving ecmo from other patients in the intensive care unit so that they can function independently of each other to prevent cross-infection enhanced use of tele-platforms for meetings and cancellation of educational and recreational activities that bring large groups of frontline staff together should also be considered protection of junior and inexperienced staff from involvement in the management of such highly infectious patients in the initial stages of the outbreak is usually possible however if an outbreak escalates rapidly their participation might be necessary and fast-track training programmes should be devised to ensure readiness in this instance ethical challenges53 54 55 will affect decision making when offering ecmo therapy in an outbreak there might be uncertainties regarding the potential benefit and duration of ecmo in this context which might be dynamic as the outbreak evolves and would require regular review all aspects of a patients treatment plan should be regularly reviewed including the need to continue or terminate ecmo the decision to stop treatment should not be made purely on the basis of duration of ecmo therapy but only after achieving consensus within the treating team that the patient has minimal potential to recover unprecedented situations such as too few ecmo machines might necessitate rationing of ecmo services and should involve predetermined consensus criteria formulated to empower clinicians during times of crisis while upholding distributive justice distributive justice is only invoked in circumstances in which rationing precludes the ability to care for each individual optimally56 appropriate opinions from hospital ethics social work and medicolegal committees might be required in ethically challenging scenarios57 58
 shared decision making with family members on aspects of ecmo initiation continuation and termination would be desirable surrogate decision makers consenting to ecmo do so at a time of high stress related to the disease severity the involvement of social workers and ethics committee members might help to alleviate some of the ethical hurdles encountered during the management of a patient receiving ecmo in such high-pressure settings57
 quality assurance and clinical governance frameworks must be maintained and ecmo quality reviewed frequently to measure overall outcomes of ecmo administration identify problems and formulate plans for corrective actions validated quality metrics specific to ecmo use during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases are yet to be developed lessons learned from management of previous such outbreaks might help to close any gaps in preparedness once they have been identified or to define a consistent approach for improving quality of ecmo delivery collection and sharing of data are important to ensure preparedness and patient care especially in parts of the world that have not yet been affected by the outbreak the elso registry that currently collects de-identified patient data on indication demography and haemodynamic and biochemical variables before and after initiating ecmo as well as details of patient outcomes and complications from more than 400 ecmo centres worldwide can be a useful resource during an outbreak of an infectious disease and modifications to existing data collection eg information specific to covid-19 such as swabbing details or cycle threshold values for pcr might provide valuable data for quality assurance and research research during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases can be further facilitated by global research collaborations such as the international ecmo network international severe acute respiratory and emerging infection consortium isaric and the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease ecmocard collaborative having research proposals with ethics approval in place or developing pathways for an expedient ethics review and approval are highly desirable to generate and disseminate knowledge that can benefit patients globally periodic outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases such as covid-19 are now becoming inevitable in our well connected world such global outbreaks demand a strategic global response given the propensity of these emerging infections to rapidly cause severe respiratory failure in many patients and in the case of covid-19 the high transmission rate of the virus and unclear overall case-fatality rate the critical care response should be part of a larger pandemic plan to reduce transmission and prevent deaths these preparations for the covid-19 outbreak should involve the provision of ecmo in sufficiently resourced settings careful patient selection for ecmo is needed because patient age and comorbidities appear to influence outcomes in critically ill patients with covid-19 moreover several variables such as reversibility of the pulmonary disease process risk of secondary pulmonary infections and the role of antiviral drugs and other disease-modifying factors might affect outcomes with ecmo in addition to careful patient selection strict adherence to standard intensive care management practices and infection control protocols should be among the primary goals of care outside infectious disease outbreaks ecmo for ards is an evidence-based yet resource-intensive infrequently used service that is typically available only at specialised centres although many new centres have been created and ecmo retrieval services are now increasingly available access to ecmo is restricted especially in resource-poor settings establishing hub-and-spoke models20 21 of care in which severely ill patients who are eligible for high-end intensive care support including ecmo are managed at the hub might enable improved stratification of critically ill patients well established ecmo retrieval programmes will be an important resource if patients deteriorate in regional centres building sustainable systems that can be used to rapidly transfer and group high numbers of critically ill patients would be important to provide high-quality ecmo care during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases such as covid-19 furthermore much needs to be done through global collaboration to contain the disease and to prioritise vaccine production to alter the natural history of the pathogen real-time data collection and sharing establishing global biobanks and fostering an international collaborative research culture that removes geographic boundaries is crucial to rapidly identify populations at risk the patients that stand to benefit from therapies such as ecmo and potential therapeutic targets moreover an improved understanding of ards including rapid identification of ards phenotypes could enable more precise use of therapeutics such as ecmo during outbreaks

  provision of cancer care during the covid-19 pandemic james spicer charlotte chamberlain sophie papa   according to published data from china reported by liang et al1 cancer seems to have comparable associations with an increased risk of death from coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 to those of other comorbidities such as chronic respiratory disease and hypertension however whether the multivariate analysis that suggested this association accounted for the potential confounding effects of noncancer comorbidities remains unclear conclusions thus far have had to be drawn from the analysis of data from small subgroups of patients with cancer in much larger population-based series in a correspondence2 the authors highlight that half of the patients with cancer included in the analysis by liang et al1 were diagnosed 4 years before sars-cov-2 infection suggesting that these patients might not have active cancer the observations by liang et al1 might therefore not be generalizable to patients with cancer requiring ongoing treatment andor management who develop covid-19 in comparison to those without cancer as expected the patients with cancer included in the study by liang et al1 were older mean age of 63 years versus 49 years and this might be a powerful confounder given the strong correlation between advanced age and death from covid-19 ref3 in other reports of risk factors in patients with covid-19 refs45 the authors have not analysed cancer as a comorbidity presumably owing to small sample sizes and the generally low prevalence of cancer at the population level in marked contrast to data from china a preliminary report from italy indicates that 20 of patients with covid-19 had a diagnosis of cancer in the preceding 5 years6 however in this analysis the identification of comorbidities was confined to patients who died of covid-19 therefore distinguishing between cancer as an independent risk factor for developing covid-19 or for poor outcomes is not possible analysis of incidence and outcomes specifically in patients with cancer and covid-19 will enable a clearer understanding of the associated risks the presenting features of covid-19 such as fever fatigue dyspnoea and arthralgiamyalgia are often similar to those of patients with cancer especially those receiving treatment therefore the recognition of covid-19 symptoms in such patients can be problematic guidelines provided by the uk national institute for health and care excellence nice state that if the differential diagnosis includes the possibility of neutropenic sepsis this must first be excluded as this is the most immediately life-threatening condition7 in the inpatient setting those without suspected covid-19 must be segregated from those with established or suspected covid-19 furthermore a high proportion of hospitalized patients with covid-19 will require respiratory support for patients with cancer the appropriate level of escalation of care for covid-19 symptoms is likely to be affected by the patients expected survival duration based on disease stage treatment history and pre-morbid performance status carers need to encourage their patients to discuss in advance their priorities for treatment escalation because critical care including ventilatory support is likely to be explicitly rationed in most health-care systems and is unlikely to be successful in many patients with advanced-stage cancer reduced availability of community symptom support might result in an increase in hospital admissions at a time when many health-care systems are least able to manage such increases already under-resourced palliative care teams are likely to face staffing crises just when demand increases exponentially these issues have implications for patients with cancer and their families affected by covid-19 as well as for those with life-limiting cancer without covid-19 whose symptoms might deteriorate as a result of reduced health-care provision covid-19 also presents a barrier to hospice admission and therefore oncologists are likely to be required to manage certain complex symptoms that would otherwise benefit from the involvement of palliative care teams guidance on the adaptation of palliative care to the demands of the covid-19 pandemic has been provided by the center to advance palliative care and the european association for palliative care have provided advice for non-specialists on counselling patients who have become critically unwell owing to covid-19 practical end-of-life care considerations in the context of the covid-19 pandemic include limitations of visitor access to patients even for close relatives owing to concerns regarding viral transmission these considerations might be compounded by restricted supplies of personal protective equipment in certain health-care systems and restricted mortuary and funeral arrangements enforced by capacity constraints andor public health measures thus the negative psychological sequelae of the pandemic which could lead to suboptimal care symptom management and end-of-life care might be substantial for patients with cancer their families andor their carers social distancing lockdowns and curfews are creating major long-term issues for both curative and palliative oncology care patients need to be managed as far as possible without visits to hospitals or other treatment centres in order to minimize infection risk and by applying the precautionary principle as more data on infection risks are gathered8 this aspect in addition to the re-deployment of resources to acute covid-19 care creates problems with the delivery of timely treatment the continuity of care and access to clinical trials most of which are now closed to recruitment patients with fever or respiratory symptoms need to be triaged on arrival at the cancer centre in order to reduce the risk of exposure to other patients and staff access to sars-cov-2 testing for patients can help with this triage testing of staff a problem even in the health-care systems of many economically developed countries defines a return-to-work pathway that is essential for maintenance of a stable workforce remote review by telephone or video-link can be used in routine outpatient practice when the benefits of attending hospital in person are judged to be outweighed by the risks of exposure to infection7 other methods of reducing the need for patients to travel include home deliveries of oral medicines local andor remote availability of routine clinical testing and remote consenting and rationalization of investigations increased operating hours of outpatient services and the provision of cancer-specific acute evaluation capabilities can all help in relieving the pressures placed on emergency departments blood product shortages arising from societal effects on donations are likely and can be mitigated in part by raising the thresholds for transfusion and through greater use of erythropoietin oncology inpatient activity is also likely to be fundamentally and rapidly affected both owing to the necessity of reallocating dedicated beds for general respiratory support and as a result of a proportion of the outpatient population requiring admission with the co-diagnoses of cancer and covid-19 effects on infrastructure and staffing levels in cancer services affected by covid-19 have led to some of the most difficult decisions as highlighted in the uk national health service nhs guidelines in this area constraints on access to operating theatres and anaesthetic support might be a particular problem for patients requiring surgery or brachytherapy9 prioritization of treatment for patients with cancer should therefore be formalized to ensure that those with the most important implications for oncological outcomes are preferentially delivered when resources become constrained79 prioritization of treatment implies rationing of care and these decisions should where possible be taken as a team and be discussed fully with the patient when treatment plans deviate from standard practice this should be carefully documented prioritization must also take into account and balance the relative benefits of treatment against the estimated increased risks of infection although we recognize the substantial risks of viral infection to all members of the population covid-19 will not harm every patient with cancer treatment delays the introduction of regimens requiring less-frequent administration and hypofractionated radiotherapy are all important components of a pandemic mitigation strategy for patients who nonetheless require treatment for other conditions delays in the delivery of palliative interventions which are at risk of low-level prioritization in this context might lead to worsening symptoms a loss of any possible treatment opportunities and hospital admission for symptom control at a time when inpatient resources are least available for most patients with solid tumours the survival benefits obtained with adjuvant treatments must be offset against the risks posed by regular clinic attendance for myelosuppressive therapy addition of growth factor support in this setting is now widely advocated7 prioritization of surgical interventions is also important as is the consideration of radical alternatives to surgery especially radiotherapy and safe methods of delaying the need for surgery such as in women with certain types of breast cancer using endocrine therapy or in men with prostate cancer using androgen-deprivation therapy further data are required in order to understand how best to extrapolate the current limited understanding of the immunology of sars-cov-2 to the effects of anticancer immunotherapy a systematic review revealed little evidence that immuno-modulatory agents such as steroids cytotoxic agents tacrolimus jak inhibitors and biologics including anti-tnf antibodies increase the risk of severe covid-19 symptoms10 the use of anti-pd-1 antibodies might theoretically limit the extent of t cell exhaustion and thus promote viral elimination or could potentially contribute to the excessive inflammatory response to viral infection data emerging from countries affected early in the covid-19 pandemic have thus far provided little evidence to improve our understanding of the effects of having cancer on the risk of either sars-cov-2 infection or on the outcomes of covid-19 prospective collection of data on the outcomes of patients with cancer and covid-19 across all age ranges tumour types and treatment modalities will enable more robust conclusions to be drawn these data need to be rapidly collated and shared reassessment of the relative risks and benefits of cancer therapies in the context of the covid-19 pandemic is fundamental to the continued safe delivery of these treatments at the same time the redeployment of infrastructure and personnel across a health-care system might in itself also contribute to inferior cancer outcomes every effort should be made to avoid compromising the delivery of evidence-based cancer care when infection risks are outweighed by the benefits of treatment  infection prevention partners up with psychology in a danish hospital successfully addressing staffs fear during the covid-19 pandemic bente olesen helene gyrup bjergegaard martin troelstrup winther tina marloth michael mlmer   sir in relation a recent paper risk of nosocomial transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 an experience in a general ward setting in hong kong1 we would like to share an interesting experience from denmark nordsjllands hospital noh is a 600-bed hospital situated north of copenhagen denmark the first danish covid-19 patient was diagnosed february 27th 2020 httpswwwssidk a first peak of the danish outbreak was reached around april 1 2020 and is and presently in mid-april 2020 on the way down httpspolitidkcoronavirus-i-danmarkin-english noh follows national infection control guidelines for covid-19 from national board of health wwwsstdk we have worked hard at noh hard to prepare for the pandemic building covid-19 cohort isolation wards using existing wards creating new workflows tripling the available number of intensive care beds and initiating intensive education of literally all groups of staff we pride ourselves to be used to a high standard regarding hand hygiene 2 we are well familiar with the occasional seasonal occurrence of influenza norovirus cdiff and vre 3 however covid19 is a new virus and reports of deaths among healthcare staff from italy china and spain are scary reading especially for front line healthcare personal recently the mental health care for medical staff in china during the covid-19 outbreak including various remedial actions was reported 45 the frontline staff at noh predominately expressed fear of not being sufficiently protected from infection when using personal protection equipment ppe this problem was hospital wide but particularly pronounced at the covid cohort wards since the workflow was new and unfamiliar and the exposure intense accordingly a new and unusual collaboration between an infection prevention and control nurse and a psychologist was initiated an inductive change strategy bottom-up addressing staffs fear and anxiety was used in the attempt to release defense mechanisms blocking rational thinking and change of behavior the intervention was based on edgar h scheins process consultation and how to help people change 67 the psychologist acted as a process facilitator and the infection prevention and control nurse acted as a teacher during the process facilitation was combined with psychoeducation in coping strategies towards fear and high level of stress and the education focused primarily on recalling staffs existing knowledge of infection prevention and secondly on how to use ppe correctly so far this new approach has been used in five sessions comprising 20 nurses and 15 physicians the response from staff has been overwhelmingly positive most were relieved that their worries were acknowledged and became eager to discuss different scenarios of virus transmission many were reassured of their professional ability to risk assess behavior when close to patients with covid-19 and began trusting their knowledge of infection prevention and correct use of ppe combining the professional angles of psychology and infection prevention proved fruitful addressing and acknowledging fear of health care staff might lead to reappearance of rational thinking and a professional attitude in the fearful time of a pandemic  impact of the covid-19 epidemic on a pan-asian academic oncology clinical trial eva segelov hans prenen daphne day c macintyre raina estelle foo mei raghib ali quanyi wang xiaoting wei gilberto lopes de kefeng ding gong chen john chia whay han toh chong   on january 30 2020 the who declared a public health emergency of international concern for covid-19 an epidemic novel strain of coronavirus that first infected humans in wuhan china1 over the following days and weeks governments in china and across asia started to implement drastic public health control measures and western countries began reporting patients as well2 measures have included quarantine travel restrictions social distancing such as closing schools and banning mass gatherings and personal hygiene measures including wearing masks implementing hospital infection control and use of the international health regulations3 to our knowledge the impact of the epidemic on the running of clinical trials has not been reported to date we describe the consequences of the covid-19 epidemic based on our experience with the ascolt trial clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct00565708 an academic phase iii study open in 41 sites across 9 asian countries and regions mainland china hong kong india indonesia malaysia singapore south korea sri lanka and taiwan the ascolt trial is evaluating the benefit of 3 years of aspirin versus placebo after standard adjuvant therapy for high-risk colorectal cancer if positive this could have a huge impact on reducing cancer deaths using an inexpensive and familiar medication the trial was purposefully run within the asia-pacific region and specifically sought to engage low- and middle-income countries at the start of 2020 1480 of a total of 1587 patients had been recruited from 74 centers in 12 countries a total of 447 patients were enrolled in mainland china and 617 were from other asian sites the corresponding numbers of patients with covid-19 were 78497 and ranged from 0 to 1766 respectively fig 14 there is concern that true patient numbers are higher because of under-reporting5 the rapid onset and escalation of the coronavirus epidemic triggered health systems and governments to respond quickly with public health concerns overriding standard practices however each jurisdiction enacted different restrictions making it challenging for trial oversight first it has been difficult to systematically gather information regarding restrictions at each site and how they affect trial conduct second there are no clear guidelines for trial management committees on their ethical obligations under these circumstances nor is there any guidance for investigators or trial participants third despite public safety being paramount the impact on clinical trials across all fields of medicine is potentially enormous so that rational measures to prevent throwing the baby out with the bathwater are vital clinical trials will be affected in multiple ways and there may well be a different impact and response for academic studies usually on shoestring budgets compared with large well-resourced industry-sponsored trials interestingly there has been little formal information regarding the latter recruitment may be reduced or halted perhaps for a prolonged period this will extend trial timelines and deplete already limited budgets as running costs persist even during inactivity depending on stage the viability of the trial may be threatened at that site in that country or even in its entirety logistic consequences include disruption of drug supply and increased loss to follow-up because of lockdown travel restrictions or patient preference to avoid hospitals statistical considerations include the impact of treatment disruptions on endpoints including potential alteration of event rate including death from all causes higher rates of missing data and delay in routine surveillance of endpoints which could falsely increase disease-free survival rates human resources are affected by staff illness and quarantine diversion of duties cancellation or delay of research ethics and governance processes restriction of monitoring visits and cancellation of investigator meetings biospecimen collection protocols may be affected for this particular outbreak throat swab and saliva collections are being discouraged transport of tissues across international borders could be subject to even further stringencies the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the ascolt trial has been significant the 10 chinese sites are located in guangdong beijing shandong zhejiang and jiangsu none in hubei the province where wuhan is situated since january 23 all sites have suspended recruitment from guangzhou one of the cities with the most patients with the virus outside of hubei province gc reports all clinical trials at my center have been halted since february due to the virus outbreak a total of 53 patients have been successfully recruited into the ascolt study and 19 of them are still taking the study drug all patients hospital visits are also halted instead we are using phone-call follow-up and fax-back of investigation reports6 patients need to get a new package of the study drug in february we decided to deliver the package by post expressa new icf informed consent form has been approved and signed by all patients in hong kong the study center pharmacy stopped dispensing oral research treatments and trial visits are postponed in taiwan there are no restrictions on visits but personal hygiene measures and temperature checks for staff and patients are enforced in singapore screening and recruitment for all clinical trials was halted by the national cancer centre singapore hospital administration on february 10 outpatients receiving treatment can continue scheduled visits however investigators are reporting a high rate of nonattendance nonurgent appointments are discouraged and it was recommended that they be deferred daily updates are issued from the regional health cluster singhealth and ministry of health many ascolt investigators in affected countries have reported on the emotional strain of covid-19 in their workplace including sick and overworked team members one investigator sent a poem about volunteers i send my youngest baby to the battlefield this is likely to affect trials because much of the work involved is in addition to usual duties adaptations to facilitate the ongoing running of the ascolt trial have been pragmatic based on ad hoc consultation initiated by sites with the chief ascolt trial manager practical changes such as a switch to phone or local practitioner follow-up and mailing of medication kits have so far not been submitted to a central process of protocol amendment there is concern about imposing additional burden on strained health systems a trial management committee meeting is planned to endorse and standardize advice as well as to consider the overall impact on the trial clinical trials are fundamental for medical progress but their vulnerability to external forces is highlighted by the recent coronavirus outbreak although management of the epidemic is the highest priority for affected hospitals the impact on clinical trials which themselves may lead to a major reduction in death rates from a vast spectrum of diseases raises ethical issues with regard to the special duty of care owed to trial participants the global clinical trial community has been caught without contingencies and should now start a formal process of emergency planning to endorse processes that can be applied to future unforeseen circumstances a rational carefully adapted policy encompassing operational responses to such crises would be of great utility beyond the crisis reevaluating the dated model of repeated in-person visits at 1 site for trial participation should be encouraged capitalizing on major advances in communication technology and big data finally a reluctance to pursue trials particularly academic research in any particular region of the world for fear of epidemics would be perhaps one of the most disastrous outcomes of all  covid-19 preparedness in a neonatal unit at a tertiary hospital in johannesburg south africa robin saggers t tanusha ramdin d rossella bandini m daynia ballot e   the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has spread rapidly across the world with the first case being confirmed in south africa on 5 march 2020 as of 8 april 2020 there were 1845 confirmed cases in south africa with 18 deaths1 with the increase in the number of covid-19 cases one can expect the rise to be reflected in the pregnant population subgroup2 this poses an infection risk to the foetus newborn health-care workers and other patients in obstetric and neonatal units pregnant women have a relatively immunocompromised status and physiological adaptive changes during pregnancy that could cause them to be more susceptible to covid-19 infection than the general population34 pregnant women are more likely to have complications following viral pneumonia and even progress to severe illness35 there are some concerns about the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of sars-cov-2 and its effect on newborns67 currently there is no reliable evidence that sars-cov-2 can be transmitted transplacentally from mother to newborn4810 in mothers with covid-19 analysis of amniotic fluid placental tissue umbilical cord blood and breast milk has shown no trace of sars-cov-2 however this is based on a number of small studies from china in women who developed mild covid-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy in which the majority were delivered via caesarean section26711 it is unknown whether vaginal birth or uterine contraction increases the risk of mother to child transmission4711 similarly the effects of the virus on the foetus in the first and second trimester or in patients with moderate-to-severe infection is unknown247 in one study in wuhan one newborn tested positive in 36 h of life  there is uncertainty if the newborn acquired the disease postnatally or perinatally12 infection with covid-19 can range from asymptomatic to severe respiratory distress in newborns and children though the evidence is still very limited813 fortunately children without underlying comorbidities seem to have milder disease8 respiratory distress vomiting feeds cough and fever were present in newborns diagnosed with covid-198 perinatal covid-19 infection may have adverse effects on newborns causing problems such as foetal distress and premature labour6 close

important that all areas in the labour ward caesarean-section theatre and neonatal unit are adequately prepared this article discusses the implementation of international and local recommendations as well as any additional actions the neonatal unit has undertaken in preparedness for covid-19 there are several procedures that should be put in place in order to prepare a facility and its personnel to safely care for covid-19 patients1517 standard precautions include signage at the entrance strict hand hygiene daily cleaning and disinfection of the environment and the provision of gloves masks and goggles for all medical staff18 the who provides a guideline about the rational use of personal protective equipment ppe for all personnel in a clinical environment19 furthermore screening of mothers and testing of those with high likelihood of infection is imperative in limiting the spread within the institution since covid-19 is highly contagious and outbreaks can occur even within units enhanced health education and effective prevention control measures must be taken and health-care workers need to stay vigilant against covid-19 infection themselves611 staff in all areas have been trained about the use of ppe and correct donning and doffing techniques video resources have been created by other departments within the hospital to enhance this in order to minimize staff exposure and therefore infection only essential staff should be present in the delivery roomtheatre2021 from the neonatal team only a senior registrar or consultant should attend deliveries of suspected or confirmed covid-19 mothers in order to limit the number of staff involved2122 routinely there used to be a bottom up approach where an intern would attend first and call for a registrar or consultants help if required now the opposite approach should be taken to avoid taking a complete resuscitation trolley into a potentially contaminated environment disposable resuscitation boxes were created using standard a4 paper boxes these contain ppe as well as a full array of airway equipment bagvalvemask resuscitator and commonly used resuscitation drugs a checklist of necessary equipment was created and the boxes were sealed ready for use once all the items were included the birth attendant should open the box outside the delivery roomtheatre don the ppe carry the box into the room perform the resuscitation as required then discard of all items that cannot be safely sterilized if additional equipment is required then a staff member outside the room can pass items in21 as attendance at birth may involve resuscitation of the newborn the appropriate ppe should include an n95 mask or equivalent gowns gloves eye protection and an apron817192123 no transmission events have been reported in doctors and midwives who were wearing a full set of ppe during delivery procedures of covid-19 mothers11 actions undertaken in the cmjah neonatal unit were the creation of standard operating procedures for covid-19 in the neonatal setting22 increased communication between the neonatal and obstetric teams via messaging services the reallocation of a triage area in the high-care ward to an isolation area for sick newborns of suspected or confirmed maternal covid-19 cases the training of staff on the correct donning and doffing of ppe and the creation of an online resource portal for neonatal consultants and fellows the standard operating procedures specify how to deal with examination treatment and transfer of newborns born to women with suspected or confirmed covid-19 these newborns should be carefully examined by neonatologists and monitored closely and careful attention should be paid to prevent infection in these newborns4681013 newborns should be transferred in a closed transport incubator202224 and all procedures and investigations should be carried out in a single room with a minimal number of staff present62225 potentially aerosol generating procedures such as taking nasal swabs intubating or suctioning should be accompanied by full ppe and the necessary precautions1719 testing all admitted newborns for covid-19 is not necessary25 according to the south african department of health guidelines well newborns should not be tested for covid-19 irrespective of maternal covid-19 result24 if the newborn is well and the mother can care for the newborn the newborn should room-in with the mother26 in the event that the mother is unable to care for the well newborn the newborn should await discharge in a closed incubator and be discharged as soon as possible to a suitable caregiver212324 newborns of covid-19 positive mothers who require admission to the neonatal unit should be tested immediately and considered infectious for at least 14 days after symptom resolution the newborn should be isolated in a single room for the duration nursed with full precautions and treated for any viral respiratory infection as well as other pathology18212224 while this is ideal each clinical setting should consider its capacity and adopt a flexible and variable approach to admitting patients such as designated isolation areas or cohorting of patients2125 covid-19 positive mothers and fathers are not allowed to visit their newborn in the neonatal unit2024 while we understand that this will be difficult for new parents early identification and isolation are imperative for covid-19 control9 there is currently no evidence to suggest that breastmilk from infected mothers poses a risk of infection towards the newborn3723 hence breastfeeding or expressed breastmilk donor breastmilk if the mother is unable to express or formula feeding is permissible2126 current national maternal and neonatal guidelines advise that well newborns can be breastfed by mothers with suspected or confirmed covid-19 if the mother is well enough to do so24 mothers should be advised regarding hand washing and wearing a mask while handling the newborn20212426 if the newborn is admitted then the newborn should not have any visitors but feeding is encouraged with expressed breastmilk with precautions2124 guidelines may be further updated as new evidence emerges in a neonatal intensive care unit or neonatal unit a virus outbreak will bring psychological stress to the patients parents and other family members therefore social workers and psychologists should be involved1826 cmjah has social workers and psychologists available to patients health-care workers should be cognizant of the strain this situation places on families and must refer appropriately at the same time health-care workers may be under tremendous psychological pressure due to overwork shortage of medical resources patients poor outcomes or other stressful experiences18 already nurses have been hesitant to nurse a child in the pnicu with suspected covid-19 due to fear of becoming infected themselves and efficacy of ppe staff have been encouraged to take care of themselves mentally and physically and should seek psychological support via staff clinics or elsewhere the literature and scientific landscape relating to covid-19 is changing every day and medical service providers should continually update their knowledge and skills on prevention and control of the covid-19 outbreak18 the volume of information available in academia and the media has become overwhelming to ease this burden an online resource portal was created to house reputable articles guidelines and protocols from journals and neonatal units around the world we update the portal every 3 days using the who database litcovid and pubmed amongst others and information pertaining to covid-19 and treatment in general paediatrics and specifically newborns is included the neonatal unit at cmjah stands ready to attend to the first newborns of suspected or confirmed mothers of the growing covid-19 pandemic while staff anxiety levels are high regarding nursing potential cases transmission to health-care workers and availability of ppe clear protocols and communication of the protocols is vital in allaying fears a rational approach to suspected cases and infection control in-line with local and international guidelines as well as ongoing education should diminish anxiety amongst health-care workers27 ongoing refinement of protocols and procedures is warranted as the extent of the pandemic in our setting unfolds and the available literature changes these should happen concurrently while still delivering appropriate care to the current and future patients within the unit south africa is a low-to-middle income country and the lack of resources available means we cannot increase our capacity staffing numbers or available equipment since our usual patient load will not decrease we must be as prepared adaptable and efficient as possible  new regulatory strategies to manage medicines shortages in europe umberto musazzi m domenico di giorgio paola minghetti   medicine shortages have risen worldwide straining the capability of national healthcare systems in ensuring patients access to pharmacological therapies beck et al 2019 jia and zhao 2017 schwartzberg et al 2017 the resilience of the pharmaceutical distribution chain and other stakeholders varies based on different factors such as product characteristics and the involved countries birhli 2013 the unavailability of medicinal products to patients can be due to supply-related factors eg manufacturing issues regulatory issues logistics distribution and demand-related ones eg fluctuating drug demand parallel market tendering price and reimbursement policies moreover extraordinary geopolitical events eg brexit coronavirus disease covid-19 outbreak in china can also have a strong influence on the resilience of the pharmaceutical chain and the patients access to therapies even if globalized players control the research and production of medicinal products by now the activities of regulatory authorities are still based on national or supranational ie european union eu frameworks in europe the capability of the regulatory authorities and other subjects involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services in defining suitable problem-solving strategies has been limited by the fragmentation of the regulatory framework bochenek et al 2018 de weerdt et al 2015a only in 2019 the ema and hma released the first harmonized shortage definition in the european economic area eea ema and hma 2019b although the proposed definition was relevant only for marketing authorization holders mahs and regulatory authorities it is the first step to promote the communication and the coordination among european pharmaceutical stakeholders regulators and professionals working in the different national healthcare systems for improving their resilience to shortages however the kaleidoscopic regulatory framework on shortage is not the only critical factor but the heterogenicity of the national legislation reimbursement and price policies and medicines market around europe limited the establishment of a solid european emergency plan to solve the shortage problem considering that numerous factors cause shortages a univocal problem-solving strategy cannot be established at the european level the needs of big-pharmaceutical markets such as germany said et al 2018 or italy di giorgio et al 2019 are far from those of small ones like as finland heiskanen et al 2017 moreover excessive fragmentation of the national regulatory frameworks may be itself a cause of drug shortage the relationship between the price policies and availability of medicinal products is known dave et al 2018 de weerdt et al 2015b considering the different reimbursement policies of member states who 2018 the price of the same medicinal product may vary significantly around europe in this context the exportation of drug products to more profitable markets eg parallel trade is frequently cited as one of the demand-related causes of drug shortages de weerdt et al 2015b noteworthy such a cause-effect relationship is still debated aguiar and ernest 2020 the importation of medicinal products from other eu or extra-eu countries is also the most common strategy to mitigate the adverse effects of severe shortages said et al 2018 notably small european countries might not be profitable enough for mahs to justify building new manufacturing sites and marketing medicinal products in this context for justified public health reasons the national regulatory authorities can adopt regulatory pathways to speed up the release of the marketing authorization eg art 126a of directive 200183ec and therefore to make medicines available on the national market otherwise parallel trade can be a possible solution to ensure the patients access to treatments for example besides the granting of national marketing authorizations a small english-speaking country like malta ensures its medicines supply mainly by art 126a authorizations while parallel import licences contribute only to the residual needs less than 10 farrugia 2018 indeed the application of art 126a permits the mahs of products already authorized in other english-speaking eu countries eg uk ireland to have easy access to the maltese market however brexit ema 2019a and some concurrent updates of the european regulatory framework might worsen such a delicate balance for example the new medicine traceability system introduced in the eu by the regulation eu 2016161 increased the costs of both the production and the distribution of medicinal products affecting the economic sustainability of the all actors involved in the pharmaceutical supply chain eg mahs parallel distributors the potential repercussions on patients access to treatments in the more fragile eu countries are foreseeable especially in the case of low-price medicinal products eg generics in the current situation it is evident that the same strategy may have different efficacy in shortage mitigation according to the features of european countries involved as a consequence rational and practical shortage emergency plans should originate from stronger cooperation among european countries and based on the assessment of proscons balance at a supranational level this manuscript aims to review the current upgrade of the european regulatory framework on medicine shortages and to propose a theoretical approach for 1 determining the shortageunavailability impact on the capability of the national healthcare systems and 2 rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted in function of the leading cause of shortage eg production price and importationexportation such an approach would be useful to the european regulatory authorities in the harmonization of the metrics around the union moreover it would also be helpful to other subjects involved in the national pharmaceutical distribution chains and healthcare systems eg manufacturers wholesalers hospitals pharmacies insurance companies regional healthcare authorities in this light it should be flexible enough to rationalize the risk-assessment and risk-management strategies for the mitigation of the shortage effects in different industrial and healthcare settings according to article 81 of the directive 200183ec mahs and their distributors should ensure appropriate and continued supplies to pharmacies and authorized persons to meet the needs of patients in the different european countries if a temporary or permanent disruption of the supply occurs the mah has to notify the competent authorities also providing information about the causes art 23a of the directive 200183ec the notification should be made no less than two months before the interruption of the supply is in place in some cases such deadline was extended eg to 4 months in italy italian republic 2019 moreover art 123 of the directive 200183ec leaves plenty of room to the member states in establishing appropriate measures to ensure the prompt communication among stakeholders about authorizing marketing supplying and withdrawing a medicinal product together with the reasons on which such decisions are based in the absence of specific harmonized and detailed guidance on the detection and notification of supply interruption at the european level the regulation fragmentation occurred at the national level the term shortage has taken on different meanings around europe de weerdt et al 2015a de weerdt et al 2018 the french legislation defined shortages the inability for a community or hospital pharmacy to deliver a drug to a patient within 72 hours bocquet et al 2017 in germany different words were used to identify the drug shortages at a delivery-level ie lie-ferengpass and those that compromise the patient therapies in the absence of available therapeutic alternatives ie versorgungsengpass said et al 2018 in italy the italian medicines agency aifa distinguishes between carenze which identifies all manufacturing-related shortages including also those caused by mah voluntary withdrawal temporary or permanent and indisponibilit which identifies the unavailability of a medicinal product in a specific geographical area due to inefficiencies of the pharmaceutical distribution chain di giorgio et al 2019 such fragmentation has also been evident in the communication strategies adopted by the different eu member states bochenek et al 2018 according to a survey carried out by the ema and hma in 2019 about 87 of the eu competent authorities published shortages alerts to healthcare professionals and patients whereas industries and other regulators were the alerts recipients only in the 60 of the cases ema and hma 2019b in general the information on ongoingexpected shortages have been publicly available in web-accessible catalogues periodically upgraded but other communication tools have also been used eg relevant organizations channel press releases professionalmedical journal tv newsletter social media in some cases shortage alerts have been shared in the national electronic patient health systems or the electronic prescribing systems used by physicians and pharmacists 7 however in the majority of cases 69 no specific criteria have been set by the national authorities for the publication moreover the published data vary significantly case-by-case and country-by-country improving the confusion for professionals and patients at national and european levels in this light significant efforts to implement the regulatory framework were undertaken by the european authorities single national points of contact spoc have been created to facilitate sharing of the information about nationwide medicine shortages and the coordination of emergency plans among the competent national authorities and the ema for multi-country shortages the emas scientific committees should also be involved to write harmonized recommendations to healthcare professionals in 2019 the ema and hma released two joint guidelines on shortages which provided recommendations to improve the collaboration among regulatory authorities and stakeholders ema and hma 2019a ema and hma 2019b the guidance on detection and notification of shortage of medicinal products for marketing authorization holders mahs in the union eea contained the first harmonized definition of shortage valid for all the eu ema and hma 2019a a shortage of a medicinal product for human and veterinary use occurs when supply does not meet demand at a national level according to such definition unavailability of a medicinal product can be classified as a shortage only if the mah supply is insufficient to fulfil the demand of a specific country overall at least consequently delivery-related issues due to regional supply disruption or inefficient national redistribution of stock are explicitly out of the definition leaving to national authorities plenty of room in establishing their approaches to prevent the unavailability issues according to the new regulatory provisions the mah should notify any shortages including impendinganticipated supply interruptions to the regulatory authorities of the affected european countries ema for medicinal products authorised by a centralised procedure moreover mahs are asked to provide detailed information about the product the nature and time of the shortage the availability of alternative medicinal products the population affected by shortage and the risk for patient safety or a reduction in treatment access annex to the guideline such information is then used by the competent authority to triage and assess the shortage of risks the second hmaema guideline good practice guidance for communication to the public on medicines availability issues aimed to enhance and align the european communication on a shortage to improve the awareness of healthcare professionals and patients and the cooperation among european stakeholders ema and hma 2019b several key recommendations are provided to national authorities about what should be publicly available on shortages or unavailability due to revocationcessations of the marketing authorization the guideline states for example that all nationwide shortages should be published in systematic lists which should be easily accessible and searchable by the public in all the eu countries the shortage information should also be publicly communicated as quickly as possible to ensure the continuity of care and it should remain accessible at least after six months from shortage resolution for each ongoingexpected shortage the systematic list should report details about the affected medicinal product the shortage duration and cause the adopted mitigation strategies the advice for healthcare professionals including potential alternative medicinal products and recommendation to change in clinical practicein use of medicine the best communication tool should be selected based on the shortage gravity the high-profile tools eg press release should be preferred for severe shortages with a high impact on public health following the publication of hmaema guidelines several european stakeholder associations have released position papers confirming their significant concerns on the shortages in the eu and proposing solutions to overcome criticalities still on the ground regardless of the hmaema task force interventions in may 2019 more than 30 organisations representing patients consumers healthcare professionals and public health advocates stimulated the european commission to do more in identifying the factors leading to medicines shortages and providing clear and transparent information on the root causes various associations 2019a in december 2019 the european associations representing manufacturers parallel distributors pharmaceutical full-line wholesalers and industrial pharmacists issued a position paper in which they stated their view on the root causes classification and provided suggestions to improve the european cooperation in preventing shortage impact on public health various associations 2019b in particular it has been highlighted the need to find collaborative solutions for medicine shortages to coordinate eu and national policies and communication campaigns the cooperation should start from the adoption of a harmonized shortage definition and the rational definition of a risk of shortage for essential products in the eu moreover they also underlined the importance of improving the monitoring of shortages and cooperation in the eu by the establishment of a priority ranking of shortages to address high-risk medicinal products efficiently without introducing disproportionate initiatives that could have opposite effects to the ones intended although the hmaema guidelines released in 2019 represent an essential first step to provide a harmonized solution for the shortages in europe the proposed approach seems perfectible for example the cooperation process among the concerned national authorities is not detailed since no systematic procedure on the information sharing among national spoc has been provided yet ema and hma 2019a ema and hma 2019b at the moment only emas decision tree specific for shortages due to gmp non-compliancequality defects is publicly available ema 2013 moreover no procedures to triage the shortage impact on patients health were detailed in the guidelines leaving plenty of room to the member states in defining the measures to assess the information notified by the mah and mitigate the risk of shortages however there is a strong need for proper and effective risk-assessment and problem-solving strategies to reduce nationwide shortages without wasting money and time in the absence of a harmonized triage procedure there is the risk of increasing the workload for mahs and regulatory authorities to manage shortages with a low impact on public health even though they are already mitigated and managed effectively at dispensing level as reported by the royal dutch pharmacists association farmanco platform the continuity of treatments is ensured in about 90 of the medicine shortage cases by the medicine substitution with therapeutic alternatives pgeu 2019 when more than one country is involved in a shortage the situation is even more critical for example the same medicinal product may be triaged in different matters by competent national authorities and different mitigation plan may be required to the mahs this hypothesis is particularly relevant for co-marketing products produced by the same contractor or medicinal products authorized by decentralized or mutual recognition procedures the involved spoc may not be able to assess the shortage crisis quickly and to coordinate the mitigation strategies in a useful matter consequently the efforts of mahcontractor in restoring the national supply may be slowed down by different national obligations that contrast each other for example in the presence of reduced manufacturing capacity the obligation for mah to maintain a preventive stockpiling in some countries eg switzerland may worsen the product availability in the other involved markets another critical issue which has not been adequately tackled by the guidelines yet is the management of product shortages induced by raw materials unavailability indeed the ongoingexpected shortages of raw material may cause for a ripple effect shortages of medicinal products in several countries without mahs can predict or notify them in advance economic globalization promotes the delocalization and gathering of manufacturing sites of pharmaceutical raw materials impacting on the resilience of the pharmaceutical supply chain of many medicinal products to the shortage for example between 2008 and 2009 the so-called great acetonitrile shortage caused shortages of several drug substances for which synthesis the solvent was used and drug products pda 2014 sartans and immunoglobulins give other examples in the former case after the discovery of cancerogenic impurities in sartans ie valsartan losartan irbesartan produced by some manufacturers the blockage of the drug substances production and multiple medicines recalls caused severe shortages in most of the european countries ema 2019b in the latter case shortages are due to a low-manufacturing capacity in comparison to the growing demand of immunoglobulins although the immunoglobulins use has been tripled worldwide in the past 20 years their production is limited by the availability of human plasma from which the immunoglobulins are extracted and purified carrock sewell et al 2014 in this context several national authorities eg france germany uk have published priority rankings and guidelines for the use of immunoglobulins in clinical practice to reduce the shortage risks and rationalize the patients access to therapies in all these cases the notification process proposed by the emahma guideline seems not sufficient to detect the risk of shortage since the mahs are not aware of the resilience of its raw material suppliers to shortage and therefore they are not able to monitor effectively raw materials suppliers and predict failures in their manufacturing chain for these products more centralized coordination of the risk control strategies by the ema and consequently a more efficient sharing of information among national regulatory authorities are needed to better mitigation of shortage impact at a national level and to fulfil the needs of all the patients as shown in fig 2
 the first step is to classify the medicinal products for which a shortage is expectedongoing based on the therapeutic indications level i namely a products for life-supporting life-sustaining or rare diseases b products for severe or debilitating diseases acute or chronic c products for other diseases a shortage of a life-supporting medicinal product resulted in a higher impact on patient health than one used to treat a nonserious illness such as allergic rhinitis the score assignment for a medicinal product can be carried out adopting the principles of the ven vital-essential-non-essential analysis who 2003 or other approaches alternatively an indication of how a competent national authority considers much essential medicine may be indirectly obtained from the official documentation provided to support its inclusionexclusion from the list of reimbursed medicines indeed in many european countries eg italy the seriousness of the disease is one of the most relevant criteria on which the competent national authority performs the health technology assessment hta to determine the eligibility of the medicinal product to be reimbursed for example only medicinal products considered essential and those for chronic medicinal products get access to the reimbursement after the aifa assessment italian republic 1993 if the same medicinal product is indicated for the treatment of several diseases the most serious and with the low prevalence should be considered to guarantee the continuity of care to the most fragile patient population the seriousness of the shortage impact on public health is also influenced by the existence of therapeutic alternatives that can ensure the continuity of the care pgeu 2019 therefore each class should be analysed assessing the availability of other therapeutic options level ii fig 2 table 1 a different score is assigned in decreasing order of importance based on the negative impact on public health table 1 the lower the number of therapeutic alternatives on the market the higher the negative effect of the shortage on public health the scores for the availability of treatments are a not more than two medicinal products containing drug substances in the same atc level iii same therapeuticpharmacological subgroup or iv same chemicaltherapeuticpharmacological subgroup b more than two medicinal products for the same atc level iii but not for the same atc level iv c more than two medicinal products containing drug substances in the same atc level iv but no generic products are available for the same atc level v same chemical substance or therapeutic moiety d more than two generic products for the same atc level v it is noteworthy that available treatments are those that are marketed in a european country medicinal products should not be considered in the assessment if they have obtained the marketing authorization but have not been placed in the market by the mah yet moreover medicines with negligible market share lower than 2 of the total demand of reference for the product in shortage should not be taken into account as well since their negligible impact in preserving patient access to therapies the differences among scores are based on the criticality associated with the medicine interchangeability indeed it is expectable that a shortage can be easily mitigated by the availability of therapeutically equivalent products which can be substituted in a pharmacy setting in most of the european countries wouters et al 2017 two medicinal products are therapeutically equivalent if they contain the same active substance or therapeutic moiety atc level v and clinically show the same efficacy and safety emea 2000 generic products fall in this class on the contrary the unavailability of generic products implies that in the best scenario the benefitrisk balance of the therapeutic interchangeability should be evaluated by a physician it is the case of medicinal products for which there are alternatives with the same atc-level iii eg penicillins vs tetracyclines or iv alternatives eg amoxicillin vs ampicillin in both cases the efficacysafety patterns of two alternatives may not be the same and therefore the substitution cannot be automatically carried out by the community pharmacists consequently the shortage impact is potentially higher because the patient is exposed to a higher risk of cure discontinuity if the physician is not promptly accessible the existence of therapeutic alternatives may not be enough to mitigate the negative effect of a medicine shortage indeed if the therapeutic alternative has low market shares the mahs supply cannot be enough to fulfil the patients needs during the crisis the risks of shortage for the low-market-share alternatives is also increased for a ripple effect the more monopolistic is the market of a medicinal product the higher the probability that competitors are not able to sustain the patient demands during a shortage indeed parsons and colleagues suggested the existence of an inverse correlation between the number of suppliers for antineoplastic drugs in the us and shortages occurrence parsons et al 2016 regardless of the presence of therapeutic alternatives on the market the lower the supplier number the greater the number of drug shortages therefore for algorithm level iii the higher the market shares of a medicine expressed as annual volumes in comparison to the existing therapeutic alternatives the higher the potential risks for the public health in case of shortage consequently the following scores were empirically defined table 1 1 a market share higher than 50 of the entire national market 2 a market share between 25 and 50 3 a market share lower than 25 for scores b and c of the level ii the product market shares should be estimated concerning the atc level iii or iv in which the product is included for score d of level ii the level-iii score should be determined in comparison to all the products included in the same atc level v a medicine shortage may be caused by a blockage of the production for different causes eg the unavailability of raw materials quality-failures gmp no-compliance quality defects in this context considerable efforts have been made from regulatory authorities and professional associations to improve the quality in the pharmaceutical processes to minimize the risk for the patients and improve the effectiveness of the manufacturing processes ispe 2014 pda 2014 ema 2019c various associations 2019b for example a nine-fold increase in the ema quality guidelines was observed between 2005 and 2015 to mitigate the risk of quality-failures the ema promoted the application of the quality-by-design and quality risk assessment principles to the manufacturing of medicinal products ema 2015a ema 2015b ema 2017 the rationalization of pharmaceutical manufacturing and the control strategies can be derived from a better knowledge of the product and process the traditional quality control process has been generally based on the testing of most critical parameters and manufacturing steps can impact on the quality of the intermediates or the final medicinal product the control setpoints and operating ranges are therefore fixed based on the experiments carried out in the pharmaceutical development and their change should be notifiedauthorized by a regulatory authority as post-approval change the application of a modern pharmaceutical quality system promotes a systematic and continuous evaluation understanding and refining of the formulation and the manufacturing process by the identification of the critical material attributes and process parameters and by the determination of the existing functional relationship between such factors and the responses ie quality profile of the products however effective pharmaceutical quality systems require close collaboration between the mah and their suppliers of raw materials to promote a more rational definition of the critical quality attributes of the drug product and to improve the production resilience the implementation of the quality risk management plan including shortage-specific prevention and management plan was proposed to enhance the resilience of manufacturers to shortages ispe 2014 pda 2014 panzitta et al 2017 for example panzitta and co-workers proposed a qualitative risk assessment based on a classification of different risk factors causing a shortage in the manufacturing process panzitta et al 2017 based on the resulting risk ranking the manufacturer can define proper strategies to prevent shortage eg increase of the raw material suppliers expansion of the material stocks however some measures may not apply to all the situation since their high impact on economic sustainability for example the maintenance of large material stockpiles or the expansion of the suppliers number with the relative increase of inspections and audits might be not sustainable for manufacturers of the low-price drug products for these considerations the adoption of the preventing tools proposed by the stakeholders associations pda 2014 ispe 2014 could be carried out gradually by the mahs based on both the shortage impact of a product on the treated patients and the economic sustainability for the mahs production in this context the proposed algorithm can be applied to enforce the gradual implementation of the pharmaceutical quality systems for mahs most vulnerable to shortage risks as shown in fig 3
 the obligations for mahs are determined based on the shortage impact score for products with a high shortage impact the establishment of a shortage prevention plan seemed essential to ensure an appropriate and continued supply to fulfil patients needs for such products manufacturers resilience should be improved by more onerous provisions such as the obligation for mahs to qualify at least two suppliers of drug substance the stockpiles expansion and the implementation of the manufacturing technologies and risk assessment tools in this context the establishment of ad hoc agreements between european countries and mah to conduct exceptional manufacturing activities in specific national sites can also be pursued as an example in italy national military manufacturing site has been involved in such activities to mitigate the impact of severe shortage especially in the case of old and low-cost medicinal products di giorgio et al 2019 on the other side if the shortage impact of medicinal products on the public health is low it is not reasonable to charge the mahs with additional costs and therefore affect the economic sustainability for the implementation of quality assurance systems that may have a limited positive impact on the continuity of care medicine prices are cited among the causes of shortages worldwide jia and zhao 2017 bochenek et al 2018 heiskanen et al 2017 de weerdt et al 2015b dave et al 2018 indeed especially for low-price medicinal products the market competition may affect the economic sustainability of the mahs significantly decreasing their manufacturing capacity and resilience to demand fluctuation in this context mahs may not be able to fulfil appropriately the guidance reported in the ispe drug shortage prevention plan as suggested by the last hmaema guideline ema and hma 2019a indeed especially for old medicinal products the costs of the upgrade to the required high-quality standards and risk assessment plan may be too high to maintain the mah economic sustainability in this context european associations representing manufacturers parallel distributors pharmaceutical full-line wholesalers and industrial pharmacists recently stressed the need of establishing proper reward actions by the competent authorities for supporting their activities to comply with regulation upgrades eg falsified medicines directive various associations 2019b the application of economic incentives to mahs has been proposed as a solution to prevent shortages for example jia and zhao demonstrated that a price increase of 30 results in a significant reduction of risk of shortage in the us market jia and zhao 2017 however a similar approach cannot be fully applied in the eu considering the fragmentation of the european price and reimbursement policies who 2018 economic incentives to mahs producing medicinal products can be provided as cut-off of the regulatory coststimes to implement the quality in their manufacturing process and to improve their resilience to production blockage it is not feasible to introduce economic incentives for all medicinal products since it can affect the budgets of the regulatory authorities or more in general those of the national healthcare systems therefore proper harmonized decision trees should be designed to apply regulatory incentives only to the most vulnerable medicinal products to shortages since fees and times for dossier variations vary significantly among the european regulatory authorities ega 2015 the extent of the regulatory incentives cannot be defined a priori at eu-level but they should be calculated as percentages of current fee and regulatory time to be more adaptable to the different national settings fig 4
 
fig 4 showes a hypothetical decision tree for regulatory incentives that merge the shortage impact score obtained by the constant part of the algorithm fig 2 and the product price the latter was normalized by the real-world market share indeed at the same market price the incentive impact is more relevant for low-volume medicinal products than high-volume ones however as jia and zhao demonstrated jia and zhao 2017 the efficacy of the regulatory incentives in preventing shortages is also linked to the creation or the strengthened of failures-to-supply clauses for mahs in the reimbursement agreements these strategies permit to improve mah sustainability and to ensure a proper supply for the patient demand noteworthy it is not expectable that such provisions can solve the economic sustainability of a product in a long-term perspective but there is no doubt that they can mitigate the mah situations in short and medium-term allowing the adoption of proper strategies to rationalize the production and to improve mah sustainability if a medicinal product is affected by an expectedongoing shortage in a specific country the competent national authorities can authorize its importation from other countries eu or extra-eu to ensure the patients needs a recent survey on german pharmacists demonstrated that 38 of community and about 90 of hospital pharmacies have imported medicinal products in the last three months said et al 2018 german pharmacists are allowed to import medicinal products only in presence of an order for a specific individual patient and in a small quantity when no products which are identical in terms of drug substances and comparable in strength are available in germany for the same therapeutic indications section 73 3 of the medicinal products act arzneimittelgesetz  amg in other european countries the importation of medicinal products is also permitted if the importer obtained a formal authorization of the competent national authorities eg italy for example the aifa periodically releases on its portal a list of medicinal products in shortage for which hospitals are authorized to import them 234 products are included in the list at 9th august 2019 aifa 2019a unlike the aifa list of medicinal products in shortage more than 2000 items aifa 2019a the import-authorization list includes only medicinal products for with no therapeutic alternatives are available on the italian market regardless of the procedure required at the national level the medicine importation is in most of the cases the unique possibility for healthcare professionals to ensure the continuity of care to patients if a national therapeutic alternative is not available however an excessive recourse to parallel imports from other european countries may harm medicine unavailability in other ones for a ripple effect this effect may be worsened by uncontrolled medicine movements for economic reasons by parallel trade under the art 34 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union tfeu di giorgio et al 2019 however art 36 of tfeu enabled competent national authorities to establish prohibitions or restrictions on parallel imports exports on the grounds of the protection of health and life of humans european commission 2018 consequently several european countries included specific restrictions of the product exportation to preserve the national stockpiles during shortages in their regulatory frameworks bochenek et al 2018 however restriction criteria for medicines affected by shortage are not harmonized at the eu level in france and poland the exportation ban applies to all medicinal products of high therapeutic value that are in shortages in greece the ban was first applied to vaccines and then extended to all medicinal products in shortages in spain the competent authority can restrict exportation only to medicinal products with not therapeutically equivalents in italy the competent authorities adopted a combined approach to prevent that exportations could worsen the products shortagesunavailabilities on the one side the aifa has started a preventive verification program on the exporting wholesalers and distributors to detect potential violations of good distribution practice and traceability rules causing abnormal exportation of medicinal products as reported by di giorgio et al a pilot verification project conducted showed effectiveness in reducing the distribution-related unavailability on specific tracing products di giorgio et al 2019 in particular the adopted counteracting measures seemed more efficient in preventing unavailabilities that affected community pharmacies than hospital ones on the other side the italian regulatory framework has been updated to permit aifa to impose temporary blockage of exportations to prevent or mitigate drug shortages or unavailability of a medicinal product authorized in italy art 13 decree-law n 35 of 30th april 2019 as converted by law n 60 of 25 june 2019 at the moment seven medicinal products ie four sinemet strengths levodopacarbidopa questran cholestyramine famotidina eg famotidine ongentys opicapone are included in the aifa list for exportation ban aifa 2019b aifa 2019 in most of the cases the list includes products for which the shortage has recently ended and for which there are distribution-related unavailabilities in italy ie products containing levodopacarbidopa and cholestyramine indeed the provision aims to prevent that parallel exportation may delay the wholesalers capability in restoring the supply to the italian community and hospital pharmacies during the post-emergency period the medicinal products containing opicapone ongentys 50 mg 30 capsules and famotidine famotidina eg 40 mg 10 tablets have been included for preventive purpose ongentys is the only medicinal product containing opicapone which is used to treat adults with parkinsons disease since the mah had communicated the medicine shortage from 6th november 2019 to 15th january 2020 for manufacturing issues the exportation ban was activated by the aifa to prevent any medicine depletion of the national stock that could affect the patients access to therapy famotidine is the only drug substance with the same atc level iv of ranitidine available on the italian market after the detection of a possible cancerogenic impurity ie ndma in several batches of drug substance ema required the massive withdrawal of ranitidine products around the eu ema 2019d consequently the famotidine demand has exceeded the mah production capability running out the available stocks in this context the exportation ban established by aifa aimed to preserve the national product stocks for removing as long as possible the onset of famotidine shortage here again the establishing a unique decision tree to support national decision about medicine importationexportation could be useful to reduce the fragmentation of shortage-mitigating strategies among european countries and to improve the effectiveness of the national strategic plan to satisfy the patients needs without altering the national regulatory framework as shown in fig 5
 a hypothetical decision tree may link the possibility to import or block the exportation to the shortage impact score established with the constant part of the algorithm fig 2 for highmedium impact medicinal products the importation should be allowed during an ongoing shortage in the case of high-impact products fast authorization procedures should also be adopted to speed up the importation from other eu parallel imports or extra-eu countries with similar pharmaceutical quality standards to the eu from which the medicine can be exported without any ripple effect on the other side it may not be convenient in the case of low-shortage-impact products since therapeutic alternatives are available at the national level and they may worsen the shortage situation in other european countries however the importation of medicinal products should always be allowed in exceptional cases such as a substantial reduction of the national supply of all therapeutically equivalents or specific patients needs justified by their clinical conditions eg allergies to excipients rare metabolic diseases moreover a similar decision tree can also be used to support national competent authorities in the adoption of regulatory pathways such as art 126a of directive 200183ec to ensure the availability of medicines in a specific market particularly for those with a high shortage impact on public health the blockagerestriction of exportations can be feasible as preventingmitigating strategies in specific circumstances it is the case of all medicinal products for which the shortage has recently ended and the supply is lower than a warming level and cannot adequately fulfil the national demand here again the establishment of an exportation ban can be useful for high-impact products since the maintenance of national stocks directly influence the capability of healthcare systems to ensure patient access to therapy for low-shortage-impact products such strategies may be a too restrictive provision because of the negligible effects on the continuity of the care indeed therapeutically equivalent medicinal products can be substituted with therapeutic alternatives without compromising the safety of patients for medium-shortage-impact products the adoption of exportation restrictions should be evaluated case-by-case based on the availability of other therapeutic options moreover the promising results obtained by some national competent authorities eg aifa suggested that setting up cooperation schemes between administration and other stakeholders fostering a responsible approach in managing crisis in medicines supply also allowing for instance surveillanceverification programs that may represent rational and effective preventive strategies to monitor the activities of exporting wholesalers and distributors for reducing the risks of product unavailability if such tools are strongly necessary for high-shortage-impact products their adoption as a preventive action to monitor medium- and low-impact products is also desirable however for low- and medium-impact products the development of protocols to rationalize the clinical medicine substitution or to activate importation procedures may be more effective in this context education programs should be performed by competent authorities to ensure update of healthcare professionals on these topics the shortage impact scores calculated with the constant part of the algorithm can be used to improve and rationalize how to communicate a shortage to the public and patients recommendations how to better communicate shortages to patients were introduced by the last hmaema guideline ema and hma 2019b in this context it is worth underlining that communication strategies should be carefully planned based on the level of shortage criticality for public health high medium low without any doubt the patients awareness about shortage is an important aspect that the competent authorities have to consider in every mitigation action they can adopt however it is essential to avoid alarmism in patients especially when therapeutic alternatives are promptly available high-profile communication tools eg press release social network television radio should be preferred to communicate the shortages of medicinal products with high impact score whereas drug alerts to healthcare professionals and patients associations can be sufficient for products with medium and low impact scores moreover the shortage-impact scores can be used as a basis for harmonizing the graphical formats of the communication campaigns in all the eu countries for examples red yellow and green colours can be used in the systematic national shortage lists but also in the paper communications posts on social networks alerts in the software used by physicians and pharmacists to better identify the medicinal products with high medium and low impact scores respectively economic globalization has promoted the delocalization and gathering of manufacturing sites of drug substances and medicinal products stressing the resilience of the pharmaceutical supply chain of many medicinal products to the shortages the european countries cannot face the different shortage crisis alone but the cooperation at eu-level is necessary to provide practical and rational solutions to the problem for mitigating shortages that affect the union the stronger coordination at eu-level and the harmonization of communication risk-assessment and risk-management strategies are desirable and urgent although further studies in real-world settings are needed to complete the validation of the procedure and decision trees the approach proposed in this article may contribute to improving the information sharing and cooperation among european countries indeed risk-assessment and risk-management strategies adopted by professionals eg pharmacists and other stakeholders can be rationalized and harmonized based on the medicines shortage impact scores calculated by a competent national authority moreover the structure of procedure and decision trees may be adapted and used as a model to build up risk-management strategies for local needs of a specific healthcare assistance setting eg single hospital however considering that the shortage-impact assessment is linked to the authorized therapeutic indications of medicinal products in the procedure here proposed a limitation of the latter which is also valid for other shortage-mitigation strategies is that the off-label use of medicinal products in specific patient populations eg paediatrics is not tracked and therefore the shortage impact may not be assessed adequately in this field in this context following the example of the provision adopted by several national authorities to ensure patient access to immunoglobulins treatment eg france germany uk the establishment of treatment priority rankings clinical practice guidelines and clinical records may be possible solutions for these activities the involvement of ema scientific committees can be considered an added value for supporting the efforts of competent national authorities in parallel the cooperation among regulatory authorities and stakeholders of the pharmaceutical distribution chain should also be improved to set up shared strategies to mitigate distribution-related unavailability in specific geographic regions and to prevent shortages in this context the establishment of permanent consultation or task force groups is desirable both at national and european levels for speeding up the resolution of medicine shortage emergency

xiao-sheng he kai-xiong tao qun qian ping-hong zhou guo-xin li min-hua zheng zhong-tao zhang jia-fu ji ping lan   the novel coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 pandemic is caused by an enveloped single-stranded rna virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 1 2 the ongoing covid-19 pandemic continues to be a major issue with the increasing number of confirmed cases and disease-related fatalities worldwide although sars-cov-2 spreads primarily through respiratory droplets recent evidence suggests the fecaloral route as another potential means of transmission raising concerns over gastrointestinal gi manifestations of the disease 3 4 since multiple gi disorders present with fever distinguishing between covid-19-related symptoms and other diseases can be challenging in addition asymptomatic carriers and patients with absence of or minimal symptoms during the incubation period also make diagnosis difficult and therefore play an important part in expediting the outbreak therefore the decision on when to proceed with surgical procedures and when can we safely delay procedures became one of the major challenges in this pandemic risk and benefit should be carefully considered and weighed the aim of this consensus is to share multicenter experiences from front-line gi surgeons regarding i minimizing sars-cov-2 transmission ii adjustments for diagnostic and therapeutic gi procedures in all units of the department and iii improvements in perioperative preventive care we recommend that each hospital establishes a covid-19 task force as early as possible the responsibilities of the task force include but are not limited to making in-house guidelines organizing multidisciplinary treatment mdt and managing coordinating and implementing procedures according to preventive precautions most importantly the task force should have overall control regarding the balance between the resources being used for covid-19 patients eg personal protection equipment ppe ventilators intensive care unit icu beds physicians and those that would be used for surgical patients we also recommend that each hospital should establish a group of diagnostic experts with responsibilities for risk stratification especially for patients under investigation who need urgent surgery for a patient with gi disease also infected by sars-cov-2 or at high risk for covid-19 heshe must be transferred to an isolation ward in the department of infectious disease jointly treated by infectious-disease specialists and surgeons if possible single-person single-room and level two and level three protection should take place clear notification which we proposed should be in red must be posted on the door to raise caution patients without close contact with confirmed covid-19 cases or not coming from a high-risk environment in the past 14 days in the absence of fever respiratory symptoms and radiological findings are classified as low-risk a notification sign in green should be posted on the door of the ward if there is a shortage of rooms patients in this category can be placed in the same room at a distance of 1520 meters between beds with generalstandard precautions the remaining patients should be considered patients under investigation puis they can be further classified into the following two subgroups sars-cov-2 rna was reported to be detected in fecal specimens from patients with confirmed covid-19 digital rectal examination and anoscopy are important steps of proctology examination but its use should be limited under the current situation level two precautions are taken while performing digital rectal examination or anoscopy a proportion of patients on the gi-surgery ward may require the use of nasogastric drainage or feeding tubes and so they cannot wear face masks properly this increases possibility of virus exposure and health workers should be aware and take necessary precautions during the process of the insertion and removal of the tubes as well as catheters eg nasoenteral tube transanal drainage tube foley catheter and the emptying and changing of stoma appliances we recommend taking level three precautions for confirmed or high-risk patients and a minimum of level two precautions for pui and low-risk patients diarrhea and vomiting are common in the gi-surgery department and might be the source of transmission a disinfectant with chlorine 500010000 mgl is recommended for a small amount of waste for a large amount of waste it should be fully covered with bleach powder or disinfectant powder containing water-absorbing ingredients or completely covered with single-use water-absorbing materials with a sufficient amount of chlorine-containing disinfectant 500010000 mgl and cleaned up after 30 minutes of disinfection in the setting of life-threatening gi diseases such as acute gi bleeding obstruction choledocholithiasis with acute cholangitis and biliary pancreatitis when diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopy is required gi endoscopy should be promptly conducted after the necessary preventive precautions have been taken covid-19-positive patients with gi bleeding with hemodynamic stability should undergo conservative treatments first including angioembolization before endoscopic treatment due to the high risk of endoscopy being an aerosol-generating procedure the requirement for such procedures should be risk-assessed and deferred or delayed if possible gi endoscopies for the diagnosis or treatment of previously identified malignant polyps acute enteritis endoscopic biopsy of gi cancers and nutrition-tube placement should be subjects to be discussed by the mdt team assessment of the risks and benefits of proceeding vs delaying the procedure should be discussed for confirmedhigh-risk covid-19 patients and puis diagnostic and therapeutic gi endoscopies should be performed in a negative-pressure room with level three precautions for low-risk patients diagnostic and therapeutic gi endoscopies should be conducted in a regular room with level two precautions elective surgeries in confirmed or high-risk covid-19 patients should be postponed urgent gi surgeries should be performed under severe life-threatening conditions like intestinal perforation acute obstruction with peritonitis and ongoing bleeding with hemodynamic instability 11 an emergency plan from the mdt team should be made and level three precautions should be taken for patients who present with certain symptoms of covid-19 but do not fulfill all the criteria gi surgeries should be postponed until proper covid 19 testing has been performed the date and time of gi surgeries shall be determined after the diagnosis of covid-19 has been finalized or alternatively when the patient is classified as low-risk by the group of diagnostic experts however emergency surgical management should not be delayed by pending test results with the rationale that all patients during the pandemic should undergo covid-19 testing and precautions taken accordingly surgeries for puis should be performed in a negative-pressure operating room with level three precautions the decision to proceed with surgery depends on both the type and the nature of the tumor the consequences for potential delay as well as the sufficiency of medical supplies in relation to the number of confirmed covid-19 cases in the hospital

 in general a majority of ibd surgeries could be postponed by using alternative medications with cautious observation to avoid potential exacerbation 20 ibd patients in need of surgery consider alternative therapies to postpone surgery for gi benign diseases including appendicitis diverticulitis intestinal ischemia and intestinal obstruction we recommend that conservative non-surgical management be considered first along with puncture drainage when patients show poor responses to non-surgical treatment surgery can be performed 21 as recommended for appendicitis details of the conservative management are as follows in general we recommend that the anesthesiologist and personnel involved in the anesthesia process should minimize aerosol production especially during the intubation process more detailed measures in relation to the management of the anesthesia department during the covid-19 crisis are described elsewhere 23 to minimize the exposure of the virus we recommend the following we recommend meeting all the following criteria before considering removing the patient from isolation after surgery if the patient fulfills all the above criteria they can be released from isolation and transferred to the general ward or discharged from hospital after being discharged from hospital patients should be isolated at home for 14 days during which the body temperature is monitored and recorded daily in general as long as the prognosis has not been affected follow-up visits can be postponed accordingly we also recommend onlinetelehealth appointments and appropriate outpatient-clinic visits at locations closest to the patient if needed adjuvant therapy should be started 4 weeks after surgery but no later than 8 weeks if intravenous chemotherapy is not available due to the covid-19 pandemic oral capecitabine for colorectal cancer and tegafur for gastric-cancer monotherapy could be considered the therapy should be switched to combination treatment after the pandemic is under control during the times of the covid-19 crisis it is essential to establish science-based rational and practical strategies to ensure the safety and benefit of both caregivers and patients considering that the objective and subjective conditions may vary between hospitals the combating strategies should be individualized our experience and recommendations are worth sharing and may help to minimize infection jk nl tw jjw zh and xsh involved in acquisition of data analysis of data and drafting of the manuscript kxt qq phz gxl mhz ztz jfj and pl involved in study design and critical revision of the manuscript all authors read and approved the final manuscript none  managing older adults with presumed covid19 in the emergency department a rational approach to rationing tony rosen lauren ferrante e shan liu w emily benton a mary mulcare r michael stern e kevin biese ula hwang martine sanon   the american geriatric societys ags position paper on agerelated considerations in resource allocation strategies during the covid19 era

 emphasizes the importance of not using age as a categorical exclusion during the allocation of scarce resources using age primarily may violate the ethical principle of justice as well as imply age discrimination older adults are heterogeneous in baseline activities and functional cognitive and medical status prior research has demonstrated that other vulnerability factors such as frailty

 and multimorbidity

 are more strongly associated with death and poor outcomes than chronological age alone though research on covid19 is just beginning we are likely to find in this disease as well that these vulnerability factors are more predictive of poor outcomes than is chronological age as a result making rationing decisions informed primarily by chronological age is extremely problematic and we believe unethical the ags position paper outlined additional important considerations for the allocation of scarce resources these include discussing goals of care creating triage teams devoted to operationalizing rationing decisionmaking and using a multifactor strategy to assess both inhospital mortality and conditions that would limit life regardless of the acute illness in the primary triage scoring algorithm we recognize that many initial decisions about allocation of ventilators intensive care unit icu beds and hospital beds as well as decisions about how to treat critically ill patients are occurring and will likely continue to occur in the emergency department ed given this we describe our current experience and reflect on how ideas from the ags position paper may be operationalized in the ed much of what we discuss is also highly relevant for decisionmaking later during a hospitalization the ed is often the first location where decisions about care for older adult patients with presumed or confirmed covid19 are made these commonly include decisions about intubation and resuscitation after cardiac arrest geriatricians and other outpatient primary care providers have been managing patients at home attempting to keep them out of the hospital unless absolutely necessary unfortunately the course of covid19 is unpredictable particularly for older adults who may be managing well with the disease for several days and then acutely decompensate therefore when patients arrive to the ed the severity of their illness is often high and they may already be in respiratory distress requiring swift decisionmaking the ed might seem at first glance to be an ideal place to make decisions about rationing providers working in eds are trained in disaster medicine triage and resource prioritization and are comfortable rapidly caring for multiple critically ill patients simultaneously the setting requires bedside collaboration with intensivists hospitalists and other specialists routinely comanaging patients in the ed also social workers and nurses contribute significantly to patient care as part of an interdisciplinary team unfortunately however there are many reasons why making rationing decisions in the ed is far from ideal ed decisions are complicated by lack of critical data insufficient time for careful consideration new or existing cognitive impairment and barriers to effective communication care in the ed is often provided with limited knowledge of the patient their history their prognosis their values and other factors that may inform a rationing of care decision in many cases even with significant effort this information is difficult to obtain from charts and telephone calls in addition decisions may need to be made quickly before these details can be reviewed carefully and thoughtfully covid19 similar to other infections may cause acute delirium in an older adult
6
 particularly in the setting of hypoxemia this might impact the patients decisional capacity and be incorrectly interpreted by the care team to be baseline cognitive impairment many older adults with hearing and visual impairment may have difficulty communicating with providers who are wearing masks goggles and other personal protective equipment ppe therefore even thoughtfully designed rationing strategies such as those described in the ags position paper may be difficult to operationalize effectively in the ed this process is made even more challenging during the pandemic because many eds have implemented limitations on visitor policies to minimize spread of infection fortunately eds and hospitals have recently begun to recognize that caregivers and advocates for patients with cognitive impairment are a critical part of the care team and they should be permitted to accompany patients after taking proper infectious disease precautions they can also help provide valuable information about the patient to make more informed clinical decisions what is nearly always known though is a patients chronological age unfortunately the team caring for the patient in the ed may not know critical facts does the 83yearold patient breathing at 28 breaths per minute in front of them have advanced cancer and mild cognitive impairment or no medical problems and recently ran a half marathon without access to other information the team may use chronological age consciously and subconsciously to guide clinical management decisions a recent study examining the effectiveness of rapid scoring systems in predicting mortality from covid19 presented findings separately for patients aged 65 and 65

 negatively reinforcing the perceived importance of age in prognosis another piece of information typically known immediately on patient presentation to the ed but often misinterpreted is that they were transferred from a facility skilled nursing facilities snfs often house older adults who are frail chronically ill and living in long term care residence however many of these facilities also house otherwise healthy older adults receiving shortterm rehabilitation after a surgery or hospitalization there is also a distinction between longterm snf residents and those largely independent older adults who reside in assisted living facilities or senior housing unfortunately teams providing care in the ed may inadvertently presume a patient from a facility has impaired baseline functional cognitive and medical issues whenever possible the care team in the ed should not be making the decision about whether to intubate or resuscitate a patient independently the ags position statement advocates for triage teams who are not involved in clinical care to support and assist with the decision making if rationing is necessary health systems should be developing these teams and related protocols immediately in preparation for potential resource shortages decisions about activating these teams should be made at the administrative level since hospital and health system leadership may have knowledge that frontline providers dont have regarding when resource demand exceeds supply it is possible however that such teams may not be available and frontline providers may still be responsible to make decisions about rationing of resources if decisionmaking by frontline providers is necessary these decisions are ideally made collaboratively between disciplines in many eds pulmonary  critical care physicians hospitalists anesthesiologists geriatricians palliative care clinicians and other specialists have become more involved in ed patient care during this pandemic this interdisciplinary approach which allows for integration of different viewpoints and expertise has been formalized with protocols in some hospitals pulmonary  critical care specialists in particular are likely to be aware of current and future resource availability they have experience with longerterm treatment strategies and prognosis of critically ill covid patients in larger eds we recommend that whenever possible providers discuss cases with other professional colleagues who are not part of the patients care team for another perspective and support reducing the burden on any individual also the ed care team should consider reaching out to the administrator on call who can give advice and activate the hospitals ethics and legal teams protocols procedures and resources change frequently during the covid pandemic and health system and hospital leadership should ensure that providers from all disciplines including trainees are aware of any updates geriatricians and other outpatient providers have an important role to play assisting ed clinical decisions that are appropriate and patientcentered the ags position statement recommends that widespread and urgent advance care planning discussions are critical and if possible should be initiated before patients are exposed to or contract covid advance care planning acp is not rationing but proactively identifies patients who do not wish to receive aggressive invasive interventions the patients acp directives should be clearly documented in an easily accessible location along with family phone numbers as providers may need access to this information quickly to make appropriate decisions and avoid inappropriate intubations for patients coming from a skilled nursing facility a medical orders for lifesustaining treatment molst or physician orders for lifesustaining treatment polst as well as a health care proxy form should be included with the transport paperwork the care team should be aware of these documents and they should be reviewed to guide clinical care snfs and emergency medical services ems transporting the patient may assist the ed by having this information easily accessible these forms do not supplant a conversation with the patient and family care teams should not automatically assume patients who already have advanced directives in place do not wish aggressive care to manage covid it is possible that the advanced directive envisioned a very different scenario far in the future rather than a potentially survivable acute viral infection in the setting of severe illness or disease progression patients may also change their minds advanced care plans even if previously documented should be reviewed and affirmed throughout the disease course many older adults will present to the ed without existing advanced directives the ed is not the ideal location to set goals of care but during the covid crisis it is commonly necessary to initiate ed goals of care discussions providers should be prepared to have discussions to facilitate clinical decisionmaking aligned with the patient and familys wishes vital talk wwwvitaltalkorg and the center to advance palliative care httpswwwcapcorg both have helpful resources to guide clinicians in these challenging conversations providers should also consider discussing goals of care with older adults with mild illness even those who do not require hospital admission as many may experience deterioration of clinical trajectory a potential resource to assist with these goals of care discussions is a palliative care or geriatrics consultation if available geriatricians and palliative care providers are accustomed to navigating difficult conversations in seriously ill and vulnerable patients many hospitals have already deployed palliative care teams to the ed or expanded their existing role to assist with these conversations additionally palliative care can contribute by providing guidance on symptom management for patients and developing or expanding existing palliative care and hospice units for patients who opt for noninvasive supportive care as the covid crisis has increasing numbers of cases in rural areas with less wellresourced hospitals it will be important to consider the telehealth availability of geriatrics and palliative care services to help with these challenging clinical scenarios the decision whether or not to intubate a patient is the core decision most likely to drive rationing during the covid crisis ventilators the personnel and expertise to manage them and the icu beds required for care are the scarce resources during this pandemic therefore understanding the evolving approaches to intubation during covid is important at the height of an outbreak an ed can expect many patients in respiratory distress to arrive over a short period of time intubating patients early or determining if they do not want or should not be offered intubation reduces the number of patients needing very close monitoring additionally many of the tools typically used to temporize and potentially avoid intubation in patients with respiratory distress or respiratory failure such as nebulized medications high flow nasal cannula and bilevel positive airway pressure bipap can aerosolize the virus and are therefore may be discouraged during this pandemic further successfully intubating a patient puts their respiratory system into a closed ventilatory circuit protecting providers and other patients from aerosolized virus initial experience suggested that patients did not improve on other therapies and early intubation improved outcomes
11
 
12
 rushed emergent intubations while not ideal for a patient under any circumstances often increased the risk of covid exposure to providers due to inadequate time to don ppe properly while racing to save the patients life as a result of this early intubation strategies were adopted initially in the covid crisis management in the us
13
 thus the decision about whether to intubate a patient was often made early in the ed evaluation sometimes minutes after initial arrival these circumstances made it often very difficult to involve multiple disciples have informed goals of care discussion or to assess adequately the patients prognosis and the risk vs benefit of intubation as ed and critical care providers have learned more about covid19 and its initial management it has been recognized that many of these patients may actually be maintained with external oxygen procedures such as proning previously reserved for intubated patients are now recognized to be effective for nonventilated covid patients who are able to selfmonitor
14
 and have been adopted into medical care these treatment strategies have increased the amount of time available for interdisciplinary decisionmaking about whether intubation is necessary older adults should be considered as candidates for these additional procedures and respiratory strategies attempting to resuscitate a patient after cardiac arrest which may require emergent intubation and also involves aerosolization of secretions during chest compressions is a highrisk procedure for providers during the covid pandemic as a result part of rationing involves decisions about whether to initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr and what is considered acceptable duration of these resuscitation efforts the decision to initiate and continue cpr requires the care team to weigh the risks and benefits to the patient while also considering the potential risk to providers health systems and hospitals should have clear guidelines about circumstances in which cpr should be performed and how medical futility should be determined these protocols should include the outline of specific steps to minimize the risk to providers from aerosolized particles during cpr it is concerning that age may be used even subconsciously as a determinant when these decisions are made at the bedside age is only one small factor that informs likelihood of survival with a positive outcome after cardiac arrest finally several strategies have been implemented to avoid the need for rationing these include increasing ventilator access by developing safe splitventilation strategies and using anesthesia machines as ventilators icu capacity may be expanded by transforming operating rooms postanesthesia care units and other spaces into icu space and setting up field hospitals health care providers may be recruited from other lessimpacted regions furthermore even proactive upstream advanced care planning conversations may help avert the need for any rationing we strongly endorse and encourage these efforts as they are likely particularly to help older adults who may be among the first groups to suffer from rationing as interdisciplinary health professionals we wish to offer all of our patients regardless of age any and all treatments aligned with their goals of care without ever having to make clinical decisions limited by resource scarcity  pharmacy administration and pharmaceutical care

the wuhan convention and exhibition center in wuhan china this is 1 of the first 3 module hospitals practice description one thousand eight hundred forty-eight patients were admitted to the jianghan module hospital and 1327 cases 7181 of the total number were cured and discharged pharmacists have successfully completed the tasks of purchase storage and free distribution of drugs worth 103 million approximately 146000 reviewed about 20000 electronic orders provided one-on-one online medication consultation for 484 patients and held 5 lectures on rational drug use knowledge which could help reduce irrational drug use and minimize the risk involved practice innovation the new covid-19 module pharmaceutical care model is equipped with new features such as pharmacy emergency command group organizational structure for pharmacy administration electronic control of drug prescription and zero contact pharmaceutical care relying on the new media platform wechat this platform provides relevant pharmaceutical care for patients such as ensuring drug supply setting up critical care drug trolleys designing specific drug packaging bags creating a module radio station to broadcast rational drug use information to the patients and other aspects evaluation with the continuous improvement of the module hospital and the progress in in-depth knowledge about covid-19 some aspects such as patient admission criteria and variety of drugs need to be adjusted depending on the actual situation results the pharmacists provided pharmaceutical care for 1848 patients with mild covid-19 disease they not only ensured the timely supply of the drugs but also reduced the incidence of drug-induced risks through medication review and guidance thereby improving patient compliance and helping the patients rebuild their confidence in overcoming the disease conclusion the new covid-19 module pharmaceutical care model has played an important role in overcoming the epidemic situation of covid-19 in china and thus can be implemented on a broader scale hua xiaoli  gu ming  zeng fang  hu huiping  zhou tao  zhang yu  shi chen covid-19 diffusion and its impact on dental practice in distant countries with similar ethnic background marco meleti diana cassi luis bueno ronell bologna-molina bologna-molina ronell   epidemiology of covid-19 and diffusion patterns of the novel coronavirus sars -cov -2 are still poorly understood as they differ substantially among countries and even in neighboring regions within the same country it is not clear if differences in viral spreading depends on population age genetic influences specific environmental factors eg season of the year socioeconomic conditions or a combination of these some authors hypothesized that differences in models of sars -cov -2 diffusion may be explained also on the basis of ethnic influences pareek bangash pareek pan sze minhas hanif khunti 2020  under such perspective it seems rational to compare the italian experience to that of uruguay these two countries have completely different geographical and socioeconomic conditions but they share similar ethnic background in fact about 40 of population of uruguay has some degree of italian ancestry particularly deriving from piedmont veneto and lombardy which are among the italian regions with highest prevalence of covid-19 diffusion of sars -cov -2 in italy and impact on dental practice it is still debated when the novel coronavirus started to actively circulate in italy zehender et al 2020  the first two cases a couple of chinese travelers from the hubei region arrived in italy on january 23 rd  which were thought to be isolated cases were confirmed on january 31 st 2020 in the following 2 months italy faced the most tremendous socioeconomic and health crisis since world war ii according to the civil protection the italian surveillance system for the novel this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved coronavirus outbreak as of may 7 th  215858 persons in italy were infected and 29981 patients died for covid-19 mortality rate 1388 italian civil protection 2020 the impact on the public health system has been dramatic with 4068 patients in intensive care units and 28748 patients allocated in other departments at the moment of highest emergency april 4 europost 2020 all in all after only 44 days from the diagnosis of case 1 32816 patients were hospitalized for covid-19 causing an amount of health needs which could barely be sustained in some regions italian civil protection 2020 very surprisingly not all italian regions were affected by the sars-cov-2 diffusion in the same way the northern part lombardy emilia-romagna veneto and piedmont being more affected both private and public dental activities were profoundly affected by the outbreak on one side the lockdown measures and the diffuse fear of infection prevented most patients from seeking dental cares on the other hand guidelines developed by national dental associations suggested to strictly limit dental activities to emergency cares eg abscesses acute pain etc encouraging management via telemedicine izzetti nisi gabriele graziani 2020  also measures for preventing sars -cov -2 spreading eg use of specific dpi spatial and time distancing between patients etc were recommended to be strongly implemented as dental settings were classified among places at higher risk of viral diffusion because of procedures generating aerosols and droplets this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved the convergence of these factors led to a previously unfaced radical crisis in the dental field a confidential survey performed by one of the authors on 10 dental private practices in the province of parma highlighted a dramatically low number of accesses average of 3 per month it is worthy to mention that in specific regions eg emilia romagna most dentists working for the public health system were employed in the management of patients with mild manifestations of covid-19 through various activities such as performing oropharyngeal and nasal swabs andor telephone surveillance a possible short-term effect of the outbreak strictly related to the lockdown period specifically concerns oral medicine it is highly probable that patients with chronic inflammations potentially malignant disorders and undiagnosed malignant lesions of the oral mucosa will receive a somewhat late diagnosis which can profoundly impact on treatment on march 14 th the country was declared in phase 2 risk

aiyun jin li yang shan fu jianfeng zhou lugui qiu xi zhang aibin liang hongmei jing yuhua li didier blaise mohamad mohty arnon nagler he huang   since december 2019 the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is rapidly spreading worldwide 1 as of april 15 2020 cumulatively more than 1354400 cases and 127400 deaths were reported globally in more than 195 countries in order to fight the covid-19 pandemic a focus has been building a global community to allow for a shared future for humankind strengthening international cooperation and fostering more significant synergistic relationships between countries as this novel coronavirus continues to spread across the world healthcare systems are under unprecedented pressure as healthcare systems become overwhelmed treatment for patients with relapsedrefractory rr malignant diseases might be inevitably affected chimeric antigen receptor t-cell car-t therapy has proven to be a successful therapeutic strategy for improving clinical outcomes of patients with rr hematologic malignancies 23 empirically patients requiring car-t therapy are those with highly aggressive or progressive diseases and to a certain extent car-t therapy is the sole option for those with high-risk hematologic malignancies and rapid disease progression requires the timely manufacturing and infusion of car-t cells into these patients unfortunately car-t treatment strategies are encountering unexpected complications and challenges amid the covid-19 pandemic hence weighing the risks and benefits of car-t therapy and improving the practical efficiency of treatment during this critical period is of utmost importance in this review we aimed to summarize the status quo of car-t therapy and to provide suggestions for the administration of car-t treatment during the covid-19 pandemic based on our clinical experience currently the food and drug administration fda of the united states has approved two cd19-targeted car t-cell products tisagenlecleucel and axicabtagene ciloleucel for the treatment of b-cell malignancies in addition to these two fda-approved products other car-t products are under investigation in ongoing clinical trials as of may 29 2020 1015 clinical trials of car-t therapy have been registered at clinicaltrialsgov meanwhile there are currently 370 chinese clinical trials underway fig 1
a the surge of car-t studies undoubtedly represents the rapid development of this novel treatment strategy in china since december 2019 sars-cov-2 has been transmitted rapidly throughout central china with a total of 84548 confirmed cases and 4645 deaths recorded across china as of may 29 2020 the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases are listed in fig 1b despite the challenges the administration and execution of car-t treatments have not been significantly disrupted during the covid-19 pandemic for instance twenty patients received car-t treatment in the first affiliated hospital zhejiang university among whom six patients with rr multiple myeloma rr mm received b-cell maturation antigen bcma car-t therapy and nine patients with rr acute lymphocytic leukemia rr all and five patients with rr lymphoma received cd19 car-t therapy indeed car-t therapy was widely administered in hospitals in many countries with 11 8 4 6 1 7 11 and 11 patients treated in tongji hospital tongji medical college huazhong university of science and technology institute of hematology  blood diseases hospital chinese academy of medical science  peking union medical college the first affiliated hospital of nanjing medical university jiangsu province hospital xinqiao hospital army medical university shanghai tongji hospital peking university third hospital zhujiang hospital of southern medical university chaim sheba medical center israel and institut paoli-calmettes marseille france respectively detailed information about these treatments is shown in table 1
 it is worth mentioning that none of the patients or medical staff in these trials contracted sars-cov-2 however in wuhan the center of chinas coronavirus outbreak the car-t treatments have been severely affected in fig 1c we summarized the number of patients receiving car-t therapies in various car-t centers of wuhan from january 2019 to march 2020 from the chart it depicted the drastic reduction of car-t administration in the first quarter of 2020 the sharp decline of the car-t administration coincided with the covid-19 outbreak period in wuhan city following the initial success of car-t therapy in treating rr all its indication was expanded to treat multiple hematologic malignancies including b-cell non-hodgkins lymphoma b-nhl and mm patients with rr all often develop cytopenia as well as elevated levels of c-reactive protein crp enzymes including alanine aminotransferase aspartate aminotransferase and creatine kinase and d-dimer a fibrin degradation product these conditions are quite similar to the clinical laboratory manifestations of sars-cov-2 infection furthermore rr all patients usually present with a high tumor burden leukopenia and suppression of normal myelopoiesis by proliferating lymphoblasts these clinical presentations pose significant challenges in the diagnosis of comorbid hematological malignancies and sars-cov-2 infection moreover patients with rr b-nhl and mm often manifest fever of unknown origin since patients with rr hematological malignancies are mainly immunocompromised with a high risk of viral infection they would present with clinical signs and symptoms such as fever ground-glass opacity in the lungs or patchy bilateral shadows under chest computed tomography ct scans in addition there is a possibility of overlapping of chest radiographic findings in covid-19 and lymphoma patients for instance the chest imaging of the covid-19 patient might be misinterpreted as tumor progression it should be noted that some regions have a limited capability of conducting car-t therapy so car-t candidates from other hospitals might be a source of inter-hospital transmission of covid-19 this approach would increase the difficulties of covid-19 prevention and complicate the identification of coexisting sars-cov-2 infection from hematological malignancies thus prior sars-cov-2 screening tests are compulsory when transferring patients to designated hospitals or car-t centers to avoid cross-infection the patients must be tested negative for covid-19 before admitting to the hospitals for further treatment to date there are only dispersed data regarding the impact of covid-19 in these vulnerable patients patients requiring car-t cell therapy are usually those with extremely aggressive diseases and at high risk of rapid disease progression hence the manufacture and infusion of car-t cells in these patients requires a tight and precise manner as timeliness could eventually affect the treatment response rate during the covid-19 pandemic constrained transportation resources are the most critical challenges for the delivery of car-t products and accessibility to this therapy has sharply decreased therefore local medical facilities and available resources should be adequately evaluated before commencing car-t treatment if a patient is in a country region or community with a high prevalence of covid-19 and local transportation is wholly blocked car-t treatment should be deferred or replaced with an alternative treatment to reconcile with available healthcare system resources nonetheless if the local prevalence of covid-19 is low and the transportation system is not blocked the car-t therapy or clinical trials should proceed in large university hospitals or car-t centers where all activities such as the manufacturing and car-t cell infusions take place on the same site resources such as blood product supplies and intensive care units should be prioritized for covid-19 patients at this critical time in unaffected areas or areas of the low prevalence of covid-19 high-risk areas with sufficient relevant medical resources areas where covid-19 outbreak has been controlled andor areas where the government has lifted social confinement or traffic restrictions the timing of car t-cell infusion should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis as recommended by the european society for blood and marrow transplantation ebmt 4 and the american society for transplantation and cellular therapy 5 in case of close contact with a person diagnosed with covid-19 transplant procedures shall not be performed within at least 14 but preferably 21 days from the last contact moreover patients must be tested negative in pcr tests prior to any transplant procedures and should be kept under close observation for the presence of covid-19 we also suggest that for car-t therapy candidates who have been in close contact with individuals who are infected with or suspected to be infected with covid-19 as well as those who have traveled to high-risk areas medical procedures including lymphocyte apheresis and lymphodepletion should be deferred for at least 14 days in addition patients should be quarantined physical distancing should be maintained and they should be closely monitored for those with two consecutive negative results based on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr testing or genomic sequencing for sars-cov-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs sputum or other samples taken approximately one week apart covid-19 infection in these patients can be ruled out entirely clinical conditions should be further evaluated to determine whether the patient is an appropriate candidate for car-t treatment during the covid-19 pandemic car-t treatment might be reconsidered for advanced patients at high risk of complications due to healthcare resource scarcity such as situations where intensive care units icu dialysis machines and ventilators are being prioritized for severely ill covid-19 patients if patients with hematologic malignancies are suffering from relapsed or refractory diseases and require urgent treatment timely car-t treatment might be beneficial if the epidemiological and clinical assessments rule out the possibility of sars-cov-2 infection presently viral nucleic acid testing is a preferred method for confirmation of sars-cov-2 infection however among patients who have tested positive based on samples collected from the respiratory tract approximately only 30 40  of patients will have detectable levels of viral nucleic acids in blood samples 67 furthermore patients with mild symptoms or asymptomatic cases remain significant challenges for mass screening due to the possibility of false negatives in nucleic acid testing and the existence of an infected but asymptomatic population combined testing of different types of specimens sputum nasopharyngeal swab fecal specimens or lower respiratory tract secretion serum immunoglobulin m igm and immunoglobulin g igg against sars-cov-2 along with lung ct scans should aid in improving the diagnostic sensitivity of suspected cases 5 expert consultation would be warranted in those conditions in situations where a patient has symptoms such as fever fatigue dry cough or gastrointestinal manifestations an extensive and thorough test should be conducted immediately to exclude the possibility of sars-cov-2 infection as soon as possible since specific lung ct imaging has shown various features of covid-19 pneumonia screening for covid-19 is necessary when lung ct suggests typical changes associated with viral pneumonia such as multiple small patches interstitial changes and ground-glass opacities however in some countries ct is used as the diagnostic method for covid-19 patients additionally many patients were diagnosed incidentally based on ct scans without any clinical symptoms hence ct scans should be done on every patient with hematological malignancies to rule out sars-cov-2 infection before hospital admission in summary car-t treatment should be either reconsidered or delayed in cases of equivocal imaging findings as the sensitivity of the nucleic assay has yet to be clearly defined the detailed admission procedure for receiving car-t treatment during the covid-19 pandemic is displayed in fig 2
 genetically engineered car-t products are mostly mass-produced in good manufacturing practices gmp laboratories of local hospitals or related facilities while others are manufactured in centralized laboratories requiring a transfer from standardized laboratories to hospitals currently most patients undergoing car-t therapy receive car t-cells derived from autologous t-cells whereas those patients who have received allogeneic transplantation allo-hsct may receive infusions of car-t cells derived from allogeneic donors during the covid-19 pandemic restricted transportation and travel bans have resulted in enormous challenges for the timely delivery of manufactured car-t products and have been the main factors limiting the accessibility to this cellular therapy consequently pre-emptive cryopreservation of manufactured car-t products prior to car-t cell infusion is a promising solution to help ensure timely administration of scheduled car-t infusions after the completion of lymphodepletion conditioning chemotherapy without any delay in treatment however for patients receiving donor-derived car-t cells the donors possible covid-19 exposure statuses may affect the safety profiles of the car-t products recently sars-cov-2 has been proven to be transmitted through the respiratory tract and close contacts 8 although rna of sars-cov-2 can be detected in blood samples of infected patients it remains unclear whether sars-cov-2 can be transmitted through blood transfusion or whether its viremia period could be a threat to car-t recipients 9 based on the us-fda recommendation for human cells tissues or cellular or tissue-based products hctp donors with a confirmed or suspected covid-19 infection are advised to delay t-cell donation for at least 28 days 10 so we suggest deferring cell donation for at least 28 days for donors who have a history of traveling to coronavirus-affected areas have had close contact with suspected covid-19 cases and of course for individuals with covid-19 infection nonetheless concerning some patients might be in urgent need of treatment and the treatments could not be deferred for 28 days autologous t-cells car-t therapy is suggested on the contrary for those patients whose treatments could be deferred for 28 days allogeneic car-t cell treatment is suggested for axicabtagene ciloleucel immunotherapy products fresh leukapheresis is shipped from europe and other parts of the world to america for manufacturing while for another commercial product kymriah the leukapheresis is cryopreserved before shipping thus we recommend kymriah as the preferred choice during the covid-19 period considering the vast majority of patients who might be infected with sars-cov-2 who remain asymptomatic 11 it is necessary to prudently establish screening of the epidemiological history of the potential donors and to perform sars-cov-2 testing before apheresis also the donors body temperature should be closely monitored before and after apheresis to exclude donors with pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic infection next to assure the safety profile of car-t products antibody detection for igmigg against sars-cov-2 should be conducted if available the screening procedures of car-t donors are shown in fig 3
 in this regard ongoing clinical trials with universal off-the-shelf car t-cell ucar-t products manufactured from third-party donors are emerging as an attractive new concept and it may be an ultimate encouraging solution 12 this allogeneic ready-to-use car-t product holds great promise in providing a more readily available choice which as well as shortening manufacturing turnaround times would bypass complicated donor screening procedures during the covid-19 pandemic based on previous experiences patients with hematologic malignancies could be severely affected by sars-cov-2 infection mainly because of immunosuppression 13 for immunosuppressed car-t patients standardized management procedures and strict infection control measures must be implemented to minimize the risk of nosocomial infections and to ensure zero transmissions among patients and medical staff moreover patients should receive car-t infusion in a ward equipped with laminar airflow facilities all medical staff must adhere to strict preventive measures and rules during ward rounds to avoid cross-infection and the use of personal protective equipment ppe such as disposable caps surgical masks and other garments is imperative apart from ppe proper handwashing methods and disinfection with alcohol or hydrogen peroxide should also be practiced by every staff member and patients 1 it is also necessary to conduct health monitoring including body temperature and respiratory symptoms in all medical workers who are involved in the administration of car-t treatments if anyone shows any relevant signs or symptoms of infection such as fever cough fatigue nasal congestion runny nose or diarrhea social distancing should begin immediately and undergo nucleic acid testing should be conducted during this pandemic it is crucial to minimize the number of ward visits and patients and caregivers should not be allowed to leave the ward during hospitalization like medical workers patients vital signs like body temperature should also be closely monitored 14 it is recommended that for some departments the ward rounds and patient visits should be held via remote electronic communicating devices and software such as zoom or skype for example in some departments only two physicians a senior and a junior doctor and a nurse should make up the group conducting rounds and all doctors and nurses should be divided into a few groups working different shifts to minimize person-to-person contact this would minimize the likelihood of a doctor or nurse becoming infected which would require the whole department being quarantined and leaving vulnerable patients without medical care the most common adverse effect of car-t therapy is cytokine release syndrome crs which is triggered by the binding of chimeric antigen receptors with their target antigens 15 16 17 generally crs is reversible and only requires supportive therapy but in some extreme cases it can be life-threatening 18 crs is characterized by the activation of epithelial cells which may result in pulmonary edema eventually leading to acute respiratory failure in severe cases 19 previous studies have explored the correlation between cytokine profiles and the severity of crs after car t-cell infusion early elevated serum levels of multiple cytokines including interleukins il-6 il-8 and il-10 monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory protein-1 mip-1 and interferon- ifn- are associated with the development of severe crs 2021 as il-6 plays a vital role in crs the fda has approved tocilizumab an il-6il-6r interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor for the treatment of crs in car-t patients crs also occurs in many patients with severe covid-19 symptoms 21 resulting from the infiltration of sars-cov-2 in alveolar epithelial cells through activation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor interactions between these factors might induce activation of immune responses and the release of many pro-inflammatory cytokines according to a multicenter retrospective study some patients with sars-cov-2 infection showed higher levels of il-1 interleukin-1 receptor antagonist il-1ra il-7 il-8 il-9 il-10 ifn- macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha mip-1 tumor necrosis factor-alpha tnf and mcp-1 than those in the normal healthy population 21 22 23 in addition the concentration of il-6 in covid-19 patients was reported to be significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors 8 therefore early monitoring of il-6 and il-10 concentrations in serum would help identify critical cases and provide a basis for potential treatment strategies some shreds of evidence suggest that early control of the cytokine storm might benefit severe cases for instance a multicenter trial is evaluating the efficacy of tocilizumab in patients with covid-19-related pneumonia and elevated il-6 concentrations chictr2000029765 in the latest analysis this study has used tocilizumab to treat 21 severe or critical covid-19 patients with a baseline il-6 concentration of 13238  27854 pgml treatment with tocilizumab has significantly improved both the symptoms and imaging manifestations of these patients 9 recently zhang et al reported successful treatment with tocilizumab in a patient with mm complicated by a severe covid-19 infection 24 nonetheless further data from large-scale randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to confirm the efficacy of tocilizumab in these settings intriguingly an artificial liver treatment is recommended to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade in these critically ill patients the indication for an artificial liver support system is based on the concentration of inflammatory factors in the blood for example an il-6 concentration  5 times the upper limit of normal or an increase in concentrations occurring at least once per day 10 as for patients with respiratory symptoms or abnormalities on lung imaging after car t-cell infusion it is crucial to differentiate covid-19 pneumonia from car-t-related pulmonary changes rapid and repeated covid-19 rt-pcr testing should be conducted in suspected cases of covid-19 considering that both car-t therapy-related crs and covid-19-related crs would benefit from immunosuppressive interventions the pre-emptive use of tocilizumab might serve as an effective therapeutic option for patients with elevated il-6 concentrations before a final diagnosis is confirmed before discharging patients from the hospital adequate verbal instructions must be provided in-person to educate the individuals on covid-19 prevention strategies pamphlets with clear instructions and steps showing how to wear a face mask properly along with correct handwashing methods should be distributed patients should also be reminded to practice social distancing and avoid gathering in crowded places with the rapid evolution of the covid-19 pandemic telemedicine is now becoming a safe strategy as it reduces the frequency of close contact and the potential risk of infection especially in immunocompromised populations as an indispensable communication platform in china wechat allows for smooth online video calling at affordable prices while whatsapp and zoom are commonly used for multidisciplinary meetings in israel and other countries these social media platforms serve as a valuable alternative to replace in-person patient follow-ups 25 therefore we recommend routine online follow-ups for outpatients after car-t therapy if accessible nevertheless if the patients are presented with acute or worsening symptoms they should seek medical care from nearby hospitals or non-covid-19 hospitals for each discharged patient the first online follow-up should be arranged within 48 h by the primary doctor who should be available at any time if necessary the outpatient follow-ups should be performed at two weeks one month two months three months six months and twelve months after hospital discharge to reduce the risks of public transportation patients can complete follow-ups with physical examinations and blood tests at local hospitals such as community hospitals and family health services in addition to routine examinations sars-cov-2 rt-pcr testing of sputum and fecal specimens pulmonary function tests and lung ct scans are also required it should be noted that after car-t treatment patients might experience prolonged b-cell or plasma-cell aplasia and concomitant hypoimmunoglobulinemia if applicable intravenous immunoglobulin ivig replacement should be administered to these patients every two weeks at local hospitals most car-t patients experience extremely aggressive disease states and are at risk of disease progression which tends to postpone therapeutic schemes and can significantly affect clinical outcomes of high-risk patient populations to date safety profiles of car-t treatment in those recovering from a covid-19 infection have not yet been confirmed however the risk of conservative suspension of car t-cell therapy to avoid the theoretical risk of viral reactivation outweighs any advantages therefore we recommend that car t-cell therapy should commence once patients have clinically recovered from covid-19 these patients must have no symptoms symptom remission for at least 14 days show noticeable improvement in lung imaging improvement in pulmonary function test and have two consecutive negative results of nucleic acid tests with a sampling interval of more than 24 h what is worth highlighting is that the treatment of covid-19 should be prioritized over car t-cell therapy under any circumstances and car-t cell therapy should not be administered to a covid-19 patient or patients with hypoxemia car-t therapy is often the only treatment option for patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic diseases as recommended by the expert opinion of the ebmt and the american society for blood and marrow transplantation asbmt bridging chemotherapy should focus on disease control rather than remission induction to minimize organ toxicity or the risk of infections 26 furthermore we also recommend low-dose daily or weekly maintenance chemotherapy for patients under car-t deferment but systemic steroids should be stopped for three days before leukapheresis to preserve functional t-cells cytotoxic drugs should also be avoided before leukapheresis as recommended by experts from the ebmt and asbmt 26 although there is limited data on the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of covid-19 in car-t patients malignant comorbidities have been reported as a risk factor for poor clinical outcomes in covid-19 patients according to a retrospective study4 furthermore car-t patients are usually immunocompromised due to characteristics of rr hematologic malignancies per se previous histories of chemotherapy other immunosuppressive agents or allo-hsct or prolonged b-cell or plasma-cell aplasia and concomitant hypoimmunoglobulinemia after car-t treatment 27 hence it is rational to assume that patients receiving car-t treatment are populations that are inherently more vulnerable to sars-cov-2 infection if car-t patients complain of fever temperature 375 c cough or any other respiratory symptoms after car-t treatment they should be quarantined as soon as possible and be examined for respiratory viral pathogens including sars-cov-2 a lung ct scan is also recommended of note these patients might present with atypical and delayed clinical manifestations such as mild fever and nonproductive cough with atypical radiologic patterns 28 and even negative igm and igg tests so conventional sars-cov-2 screening should therefore be performed in these patients it might be necessary to repeat nucleic acid tests if a patient who has completed car-t treatment is confirmed to have a covid-19 infection we recommend he or she be treated based on well-acknowledged guidelines 45 and local medical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 on the other hand high-dose steroids should be avoided as it could disrupt car-t cell persistence and affect the outcomes of car-t therapy also tocilizumab or artificial liver treatment is recommended for severe covid-19 cases with elevated cytokine levels in conclusion this report is aimed at providing practical strategies for rational decision-making of car-t treatment in patients with hematological malignancies amid the covid-19 pandemic we advise that the recommendations described above should be updated and refined continuously as additional information about the pandemic become available moreover our recommendations should be applied with flexibility based on local resources governmental policies and the severity of the covid-19 outbreaks no competing interests to declare  mitigating the impact of covid-19 on childrens surgery in africa dennis mazingi george ihediwa kathryn ford adesoji ademuyiwa o kokila lakhoo   an outbreak of the disease known as covid-19 which originated in wuhan in the hubei province of china has rapidly spread to all continents of the globe1 first detected via local hospital surveillance systems as a pneumonia of unknown aetiology in late december 20192 the disease has since been declared a public health emergency of international concern by the who and reached pandemic status it is uncertain what the eventual toll of the pandemic will be in africa however there has been a suspicion that the looming pandemic may hit harder than it has the rest of the world3 4 africa has baseline weaknesses in healthcare resource allocation and her fragile healthcare systems are particularly vulnerable to being overwhelmed by this illness5 6 available statistics to date however seem to show that the pandemic has been slow to begin as of 26 may 115 346 cases and 3471 deaths have been reported across the whole african continent constituting 2 of all cases in the globe7 african nations have had an opportunity to prepare for the coming onslaught learn from the experience in other countries3 and choose interventions that are tailor-made for the unique socioeconomic context6 while old age has consistently been associated with a higher risk of poor outcome children appear to have escaped the worst of the disease8 in a recent series from the chinese center for disease control and prevention less than 1 of the 73 314 cases were children below 10 years of age9 children of all ages may be affected but they typically manifest mild or asymptomatic disease10 11 this has important implications for the african pandemic sub-saharan africa is the youngest continent in the globe with 63 of its population below the age of 25 years12 the demography of africa appears to portend a favourable course through the pandemic however it is unknown how the high prevalence of hiv infection tuberculosis malnutrition and the scourge of poverty will affect the human impact of the disease13 the covid-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented strain on health services around the world and paediatric surgical services are no exception14 15 responses from surgical societies around the world thus far have focused on maintaining provision of emergency and urgent elective services while protecting healthcare workers hcws13 16 there is a risk of healthcare resources being diverted away from surgical care potentially impeding progress towards global surgery goals for 203017 paediatric surgical care may only be tangentially affected by this pandemic however there are unique considerations that deserve special attention this article explores the wider implications for childrens surgery in africa drawing lessons from the past and giving recommendations for the current pandemic and future table 1 non-essential surgical and non-surgical activities should be curtailed to provide surge capacity for the expected pandemic-related influx this is consistent with guidelines from many surgical societies worldwide13 16 however heavy-handed shutdown policies have been discouraged in the african context because they risk exacerbating the already formidable surgical disease burden with disastrous consequences13 18 elective surgical activity has been postponed in zimbabwe19 south africa20 kenya21 and malawi among many other countries negative effects should be anticipated if the past is anything to go by during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus sars-cov-1 outbreak in toronto stringent restrictions on non-essential surgical services were thought to have aggravated precipitous declines in surgical volume with only small increases in surge capacity for the outbreak22 postpandemic waiting lists for paediatric cancer are also expected to be sizeable4 a recent modelling study from the covidsurg collaborative paints a grim picture twenty-eight million surgical operations are estimated to be cancelled and low-income and middle-income countries lmics such as africa will be hardest hit23 the expectation that surgical volumes will bounce back rapidly is implausible particularly in countries where there was already baseline fragility and it may take longer than the 45 weeks forecast to make up the backlog23 current surgical rationing policies are based on a classification of the urgency of the patients intervention such as the national confidential enquiry into patient outcome and death system19 24 paediatric surgical services in africa are characterised by significant delays in health-seeking and within the referral chain25 the mobility restrictions imposed on patients by shelter-in-place measures as well as reduced income during the pandemic will presumably cause further delays in presentation that may adversely affect outcomes the change to non-operative treatment in eligible patients for certain conditions for example appendicitis that is being contemplated may find less success in africa where a higher proportion of patients have complicated disease not amenable to non-operative treatment26 it also has the potential to prolong hospital stay27 which increases the chances of nosocomial transmission of the virus perinatal transmission of sars-cov-2 has not yet been demonstrated in recent small case series and a systematic review2830 this is consistent with findings during the sars-cov-131 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov epidemics32 and should reassure surgeons working with neonates however neonates can still acquire infection from an infected mothers respiratory secretions33 also xu et al reported on eight infants who tested positive on rectal swabs even after having tested negative by nasopharyngeal swabs34 this was thought to potentially represent faeco-oral viral transmission and has implications for surgeons of the gastrointestinal tract sars-cov-2 has also been isolated in peritoneal fluid35 larger studies are needed to determine the significance of these findings airborne and contact precautions are indicated in all hcws working with children of all ages experience from previous pandemics has demonstrated that hcws are the lynchpin of resilient surgical systems during an outbreak during the ebola outbreak the unfortunate death of 25 of the surgeons in one institution has led to a 97 reduction in surgical volumes36 while trepidation on the part of hcws and lack of personal protective equipment have led to a reluctance to work during the sars-cov-137 mers-cov38 and ebola39 outbreaks this is particularly damaging in africa where hcw morale is already low40 hcw should be first in the minds of policy-makers because the axiom that there is no health without a workforce is as true during a pandemic as it is at any other time41 children have been called the link in the transmission chain because of their importance in facilitating and amplifying viral transmission42 paediatric care in africa is typically characterised by significant involvement by guardians and other family members who support the child during hospital admission assist the overburdened healthcare workforce and act as care advocates43 44 they frequently live on the hospital grounds because of long distances from home and prohibitive transportation costs43 a study from malawi showed that overcrowding in the hospital was a major issue due to the large population of guardians in the hospital45 this is at odds with social distancing policies and has the potential to accelerate nosocomial transmission guardians should be limited to the minimum practical number per patient table 1 guardian policy should also take into account parental presence at induction of anaesthesia a common practice that facilitates administration of anaesthesia but potentially places the parent at risk during an aerosol-generating procedure hospital visitors have been implicated as vectors in pathogen transmission during the sars-cov-1 outbreak of 2002200446 47 and hospital visitor policies were changed accordingly48 the evidence linking restrictive visiting policies with prevention of nosocomial transmission during outbreaks is scant however it is a rational approach until better evidence comes to light expert guidelines from the society for healthcare epidemiology of america give recommendations for guardian and visitor policy based on a systematic review of the literature and are incorporated in our recommendations49 table 1 experiences from this and past epidemics show that in health emergencies children the most vulnerable members of society suffer disproportionately50
51 52 the agenda for action recently announced by unicef is a timely intervention aimed at preventing the pandemic from becoming a childs-rights crisis the incidence of family violence53 and accidental household trauma for example burn injuries are anticipated to rise during the pandemic and is associated with shelter-in-place measures54 paediatric surgeons have a unique role in management of the traumatic injuries protection of children from a dangerous household and in tertiary prevention minimising the effects of child physical abuse and preventing recurrence52 55 56 churches schools and shelters which would otherwise be safe havens may be closed and healthcare facilities may be the option of last report bringing a child into a potentially hazardous hospital environment with the risks of nosocomial infection brings up difficult choices surgical training programmes are an additional casualty of the social distancing measures and surgical rationing the reduction in elective surgical cases and clinics as well as contact between teachers and trainees has brought challenges in the delivery of surgical education worldwide5759 academic training programmes have had to adapt rapidly to maintain the integrity of training programmes ensure trainee welfare and comply with local laws postgraduate qualifying examinations of the west60 and south african61 colleges of surgeons scheduled for april and july respectively have been postponed however the examination of the college of surgeons of east central and southern africa cosecsa scheduled for november have not yet been impacted a recent global review of paediatric surgical workforce density showed that a minimum of four paediatric surgeons per million children under 15 years of age would be required to achieve a survival of 80 for a group of four bellwether paediatric surgical conditions62 this translates to a deficit of 6967 additional paediatric surgeons in lmics required to attend to the almost 1742 billion children living there62 the paediatric surgical workforce deficit in africa is particularly large63 and disruption of training programmes is likely to significantly affect achievement of workforce goals the pandemic has also presented opportunities for surgical education virtual didactics are poised to increase the size of the classroom and to allow easier collaborative learning between teams in different hospitals or countries this is occurring all over the continent and the practice may persist long after the pandemic is over the inexorable spread of covid-19 around the world continues unabated and threatens to affect every clinical specialty children have unique needs and suffer disproportionately during health emergencies and therefore require enhanced protection paediatric surgeons in africa have an important role during times such as these and should use tailor-made context-appropriate strategies to minimise the impact on our patients and hcws protection for hcws should be the foremost in the minds of policy-makers as they are a precious and irreplaceable resource  proposed modifications in the 6-minute walk test for potential application in patients with mild covid-19 a step to optimize triage guidelines srinivas mantha sudha tripuraneni lakshmi michael roizen f lee fleisher a   health care systems worldwide are currently focused onthe management of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 an ongoing infectious syndrome caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 virus1 there is arapid change in basic clinicaland public health sciences in confronting the problem a recent viewpoint has expressed the need to accelerate the development of new protocols and prognostic tools for better clinical care1 typical manifestation of the infection is pneumonia with resultant hypoxemia that may require advanced clinical care depending on the severity given the millions of patients infected globally with covid-19 new reliable cost-effective screening measures need to be identified to risk stratify those likely to recover uneventfully from those most likely to require advanced medical care the confirmed cases are typically classified as mild severe andor critical from a management standpoint the majority of covid-19 patients 81 have uncomplicated or mild illness nonpneumonia or mild pneumonia about 14 develop severe illness with blood oxygen saturation spo2 falling below 93 and requiring oxygen therapy approximately 5 develop critical illness with respiratory failure septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction requiring intensive care unit icutreatment2 patients with mild disease can quickly deteriorate to severe or critical cases the median time from symptom onset to the development of pneumonia is approximately 5 days and that from symptom onset to severe hypoxemia and icu admission is typically between 7 and 12 days3 therefore there is a window of opportunity albeit for a short period of a few days before the onset of severe symptoms to allow for risk stratification severity of the illness and mortality are related to advanced age underlying respiratory disease cardiovascular disease hypertension diabetes cancer and patients with decreased immunocompetence3 obesity is now recognized as an additional risk factor for the severity4 chest computed tomography ct imaging abnormalities occur even in asymptomatic patients with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities5 emerging data indicate that the mean viral load in severe cases is around 60 times higher than that of mild cases suggesting that higher viral loads might be associated with severe clinical outcomes6 prediction of the trajectory of illness from symptom onset is difficult and prognostic tools and biomarkers are urgently needed3 as the world transitions from the acute mitigation to a more chronic mitigation with the resumption of elective surgery it is of increasing importance to be able to ration scarce hospital andor critical care resources the world health organization who described the clinical syndromes according to severity of the covid-19 infection and provided triage guidelines to optimize health care resources that are applicable in different countries worldwide7 briefly they are advocating triaging the patients with laboratory-confirmed cases as mild severe or critical with infection prevention and control ipc measures instituted early all patients are required to wear a mask and these measures also include airborne precautions for the clinicians when performing aerosol-generating procedures at higher levels of care the triage guidelines differentiate between pneumonia and severe pneumonia the former is a case of an adult in whom no supplemental oxygen is required and the latter is a case in whom there is respiratory distress and oxygen saturation is 93 patients with mild disease do not require hospital interventionsbut isolation is necessary to contain virus transmission as per national strategy and resources the mild cases are observed for progression to the severe stage whereby they are transferred to higher level of care as required those guidelines that were adopted as applicable to india are available in reference8 in india with an estimated population of 137 billion there are essentially 3 types of covid dedicated facilities covid care centers dedicatedcovid health centers and dedicated covid hospitals the covid care centers are makeshift facilities that can include hostels hotels schools lodges etcand care for mild cases mild cases are defined as those presenting with fever andor upper respiratory tract illness and influenza like illness these covid care centers are staffed by ayush alternative medicine doctors and supervised by allopathic doctors there are also nursing paramedical and support staff they have a dedicated basic life support ambulance equipped with sufficient oxygen support on a 247 basis for ensuring safe transport of a case to dedicated higher facilities if the symptoms worsen the dedicated covid health centers are hospitals that deal with moderate cases the criteria for defining a moderate case are pneumonia with respiratory rate 1530min and spo2 9094 but without respiratory distress the dedicated covid hospitals are equipped with advanced facilities for respiratory care and icu care for severe cases and beyond such cases include severe pneumonia with respiratory rate 30min andor spo2 90 in room air or acute respiratory distress syndrome or septic shock the who has provided guidelines on the rational use of personal protective equipment ppe for covid-19 the government of india has adopted those guidelines as applicable for different levels of care based on risk profile9 the 6-minute walk test 6mwt is a validated clinical test to assess the cardiopulmonary reserve and fundamentally designed for use in adults with chronic respiratory disease1011 and therefore may be an appropriate test to triage covid-19 patients the test involves having the patient walk as far as possible on a straight track ideally 100 feet in length for example corridor or hallway the total distance walked is the primary objective of the test and is compared with reference standards for interpretation the relationship between the distance walked and peak oxygen uptake on a progressive incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing cpet was moderate to strong11 in addition sinclair et al12 found that the test also predicts the anerobic threshold obtained from the cpet in patients awaiting major noncardiac surgery the authors obtained oxygen consumption at the anerobic threshold from cpet and recorded the distance walked during a 6mwt the regression-based lower and upper 6mwt distance cut-points were 1400 and 1847 feet respectively the anerobic threshold is a marker for combined efficiency of the lungs heart and circulation and marks the onset of anaerobic metabolism as a result of inadequate oxygen delivery we propose to utilize the 6mwt with the modifications of using continuous finger pulse oximetry for spo2 monitoring and wearing a surgical mask table in laboratory-confirmed adult patients with uncomplicated or mild illness availability of 100 feet track is not mandatory as the total distance walked is important alternatively step counters 1 step equals to about 25 feet pedometers and software applications for use with smartphone are available to measure the distance walked we propose to perform the modified 6mwt test on the fourth or fifth day of clinical illness based on the viral load patterns in mild cases compared to severe cases6 the consistent recommendation that symptomatic patients in health care settings should wear a mask cannot be ignored for this test the suggested definition for abnormality that is the single-point cutoff for distance walked that is 026 mile 1400 feet or 427 m is related to anerobic threshold12 elevated lactic dehydrogenase is common about 40 in hospitalized covid-19 patients1 and is considered a prognostic factor the prior probability of severe and critical illness states is about 02 as opposed to 08 for mild illness and there could be potential problem of having false positives hence a threshold value of 1400 feet is suggested in terms of metabolic equivalents mets walking 1400 feet in 6 minutes will be equivalent to 3 mets supplemental digital content document httplinkslwwcomaad115 formulato estimate mets from the 6mwtdata another definition of abnormality11 a fall in saturation by more than 4 was not considered in the present context because of possible effect of mask-induced rebreathing and thus could increase false positives the exclusion of patients aged 70 years is based on the fact that the case-fatality ratio is about 8 in that group12 and may qualify for higher level of care without further testing in addition such exclusion is expected to improve the safety of the test similarly pregnant women even with mild disease should be prioritized to enable access to specialized care because of the associated cardiovascular and respiratory physiological changes any type of provocative test even at submaximal level may not be safe in pregnant women the finger pulse oximeters may not very accurate when compared to saturation values obtained from blood gas analysis of arterial blood when the entire range from 70 to 100 is considered13 however in the range of saturation values applicable in the present context that is 90100 the limits of agreement is clinically acceptable14 hence the use of finger pulse oximeters in the potential application of the 6mwt test should not pose a problem a screening tool particularly one which can be utilized in low- and middle-income countries must be cost effective in the context of the scenario in india the mild cases managed at covid care centers are suitable for this test based on the inclusion criteria the test could be administered by a nurse or paramedical staff with overall supervision and oversight of a physician the inclusion and exclusion criteria are best evaluated by a physician including the decision to transfer to higher levels of care as demanded by the test results and other comorbid conditions this is more pertinent initially since there is no prior experience with the test for covid-19 in the context of covid care centers in india that take care of mild cases they are staffed by physicians and paramedical staff hence there should be no extra financial burden imposed by their requirement all personnel medically supervising these infected patients during the test must wear complete airborne ppe that should include a face shield triple-layered medical mask or n-95 mask disposable gown with head cover gloves finally the test is not intended to be self-administered by the patient and to be done only at the health care center under supervision early identification of cases that are likely to progress to severe disease gives an opportunity for high level of care that has better facilities for respiratory care including the icu coupled with advanced laboratory services some of the findings known to be specific to covid-19 infection and could aid in prognosis include lymphopenia elevated prothrombin time lactic dehydrogenase d-dimer c-reactive protein and serum ferritin early therapeutic interventions such as antiviral drugs like remdesivir and convalescent plasma therapy potentially decrease the viral load or illness burden obviously such interventions are subject to local regulatory permissions the decreased viral load and resultant viral shedding could also limit the chances of human-to-human transmission15 and hence potentially could reduce chances of transmission to health care workers hcws which area serious problem with covid-19216 also the hcws taking care of mild cases may not be as equipped with ppe as much as they do at higher centers of care17 hence early identification and transfer to locations of higher level of care of those who are expected to have severe disease due to high viral load and shedding could also decrease the chances of hcwrisk at locations dealing with mild cases this approach to limiting the potential risk of hcw transmission may appear very optimistic but represents pragmatic additional solution to a serious problem in summary the proposed use of a modified 6mwt isbased on the dynamics of the illness to limit false positives improve the margin of safety economic viability and practical applicability the rationale is to identify those among mild cases that are likely to progress to severe illness and transfer them to a higher level of care if the logistics relevant to a local area preclude testing all the mild cases then one could consider targeting high-risk groups such as higher age and those with comorbid conditions the proposed strategy could help strengthen the existing triage guidelines for optimizing the rationing of health care resources needless to say strict adherence to other guidelines related to contraindications10 eg acute coronary syndromes uncontrolled asthma etc and safety and isolation measures are expected to be followed patients with severe known underlying chronic respiratory disease also not suitable for the test for fear of unreliable test results moreover such patients are suitable for care at a higher level without testing the proposals are not intended to be rigid or dogmatic as they are based on the best guesses given the current understanding of the dynamics of the disease instead they may be regarded as preliminary suggestions for practical use of a simple yet valuable test that could potentially be used in the risk stratification of mild cases of covid-19 the views expressed may be limited by lack of data but field experience from prudent application of the modified test in the real-world situations may help to further refine the proposed algorithm that typically relies on the application of bayesian principles in clinical care the initial field experience could be in the form of a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility ofa wider application mobile phone pulse oximeter technology is already in the evolutionary phase18 for example a prototype of such monitoring monal 2020 remote health monitoring system has been developed by electronics corporation of india limited ecil hyderabad india and all india institute of medical sciences aiims rishikesh india19 it consists of an indigenously developed intelligent wearable instrument for measuring vital parameters of corona patient like body temperature spo2 heart rate respiratory rate along with patient location and a novel application software that remotely displays these parameters on a mobile phone laptop or desktop computer for monitoring by doctors from any location if the 6mwt with required modifications as applicable for risk stratification of mild cases of covid-19 proves useful then such smartphone applications could be developed to integrate the scheme of the modified test with required alerts hopefully such development may prove useful for public health authorities to gather useful clinical and epidemiological data from remote monitoring the authors thank venkat r

for using face masks among health-care workers and the general public we compared face mask use recommendations by different health authorities panel
 despite the consistency in the recommendation that symptomatic individuals and those in health-care settings should use face masks discrepancies were observed in the general public and community settings1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 for example the us surgeon general advised against buying masks for use by healthy people one important reason to discourage widespread use of face masks is to preserve limited supplies for professional use in health-care settings universal face mask use in the community has also been discouraged with the argument that face masks provide no effective protection against coronavirus infectionpanelrecommendations on face mask use in community settings

there is not enough evidence to prove that wearing a surgical mask significantly reduces a healthy persons risk of becoming infected while wearing it according to who wearing a mask in situations where it is not recommended to do so can create a false sense of security because it might lead to neglecting fundamental hygiene measures such as proper hand hygiene
 however there is an essential distinction between absence of evidence and evidence of absence evidence that face masks can provide effective protection against respiratory infections in the community is scarce as acknowledged in recommendations from the uk and germany7 8 however face masks are widely used by medical workers as part of droplet precautions when caring for patients with respiratory infections it would be reasonable to suggest vulnerable individuals avoid crowded areas and use surgical face masks rationally when exposed to high-risk areas as evidence suggests covid-19 could be transmitted before symptom onset community transmission might be reduced if everyone including people who have been infected but are asymptomatic and contagious wear face masks recommendations on face masks vary across countries and we have seen that the use of masks increases substantially once local epidemics begin including the use of n95 respirators without any other protective equipment in community settings this increase in use of face masks by the general public exacerbates the global supply shortage of face masks with prices soaring9 and risks supply constraints to frontline health-care professionals as a response a few countries eg germany and south korea banned exportation of face masks to prioritise local demand10 who called for a 40 increase in the production of protective equipment including face masks9 meanwhile health authorities should optimise face mask distribution to prioritise the needs of frontline health-care workers and the most vulnerable populations in communities who are more susceptible to infection and mortality if infected including older adults particularly those older than 65 years and people with underlying health conditions people in some regions eg thailand china and japan opted for makeshift alternatives or repeated usage of disposable surgical masks notably improper use of face masks such as not changing disposable masks could jeopardise the protective effect and even increase the risk of infection consideration should also be given to variations in societal and cultural paradigms of mask usage the contrast between face mask use as hygienic practice ie in many asian countries or as something only people who are unwell do ie in european and north american countries has induced stigmatisation and racial aggravations for which further public education is needed one advantage of universal use of face masks is that it prevents discrimination of individuals who wear masks when unwell because everybody is wearing a mask it is time for governments and public health agencies to make rational recommendations on appropriate face mask use to complement their recommendations on other preventive measures such as hand hygiene who currently recommends that people should wear face masks if they have respiratory symptoms or if they are caring for somebody with symptoms perhaps it would also be rational to recommend that people in quarantine wear face masks if they need to leave home for any reason to prevent potential asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission in addition vulnerable populations such as older adults and those with underlying medical conditions should wear face masks if available universal use of face masks could be considered if supplies permit in parallel urgent research on the duration of protection of face masks the measures to prolong life of disposable masks and the invention on reusable masks should be encouraged taiwan had the foresight to create a large stockpile of face masks other countries or regions might now consider this as part of future pandemic plans

sabatino   internal medicine has been immediately involved in the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 epidemic in italy which started in late february 2020 the first few covid19 cases were suspected and diagnosed in internal medicine wards including amongst others a young adult male from codogno referred to as patient 1 who was later transferred to the intensive care unit of our hospital the rapid spread of the disease has put much pressure on the general population patients healthcare professionals and on the healthcare system as a whole which was not prepared to face such an unpredictable event especially in terms of number of patients needing admission to hospital all at once 1 the san matteo hospital foundation pavia italy an academic tertiary referral hospital is located close to the first outbreak of codogno and also relatively close to nearby cities in lombardy which were later hit by the epidemic such as bergamo brescia and cremona the division of infectious disease the molecular virology unit the anaesthesia  intensive care unit the emergency department the pulmonology unit and the risk management unit dedicated all their efforts in order to overcome the growing epidemic undergoing a rapid process of reorganization and expansion 2 internal medicine was also called to the front line and has proactively responded with great flexibility to the growing number of cases transforming its divisions into departments dedicated to the care of covid19 paradoxically a discipline that has chronicity as the main object of study found itself at the forefront of an acute epidemic at our hospital two entire internal medicine units in a few days were transformed into covid wards patients who were already admitted for reasons other than covid19 were either transferred to noncovid hospitals or when appropriate discharged home within twothree days during the first 20 days since ward transformation 129 patients with covid19 have been admitted three quarters of them requiring noninvasive ventilation this number is quite impressive considering that the total number of beds in the two internal medicine units is 76 and that the intensity of care markedly increased one quarter of patients were discharged home after a mean time of nine days whilst less than one in ten required to be transferred to the intensive care unit from a clinical point of view the internist was not floored by this viral event as the management of pneumonia and respiratory failure still pertains to herhis field of expertise further covid19 due to its heterogeneity can be considered an internal medicine condition as it is more than a singleorgan disease being the gastrointestinal tract the central nervous and cardiovascular systems all possible targets this disease can onset with varied and nonspecific symptoms such as cough muscle pain ageusia anosmia and diarrhoea and can be complicated by myocarditis acute hepatitis and kidney failure 3 the internist is already prepared to treat this type of patients as the management of complex diseases is the norm rather than the exception important ethical and pragmatic principles are called into question pointing at the need for transparency and inclusivity as it has been recently stated 4 suffice it to say that italy has one of the worlds most aged populations and multimorbidity is the main clinical feature of the elderly population ageing and multimorbidity are certainly the most important determinants of frailty which is related to adverse health outcomes in this scenario internal medicine adaptability spacing from a primary to a tertiary care setting could also act as a link between hospital and territory medicine especially for patients with multiple chronic conditions who cannot be left abandoned the paucity of resources deriving from covid19 including medications ventilators available beds and physicians forces us to carefully evaluate who to treat and how to treat the elderly population is the most affected by covid19 according to preliminary data reported daily by the italian ministry of health and the civil protection the overall mortality rate is roughly 10 and most deaths occurred in individuals aged more than 65 years old whether these patients died from or died with covid19 will need to be ascertained even if the bidirectional relationship between acute and chronic conditions cannot be dissolved our first reaction to all these abrupt changes was that of frustration for the sense of helplessness deriving from the absence of specific therapies the enormous workload under stressful conditions and for the fear of the risk of being infected after the first moments of loss the proactive implementation and the rapid reorganization of the department into dirty and clean pathways and the availability of novel experimental therapies certainly raised doctors morale the use of monoclonal antibodies  such as tocilizumab which has the rational to counteract the cytokine storm underlying covid19  is not uncommon in an internal medicine setting also given the relatively small window of opportunity for the use of tocilizumab a careful riskbenefit profile assessment should be made taking into account patients age comorbidities and overall clinical presentation despite the aforementioned corrective actions the risk of burnout amongst physicians still remains high above all incommunicability is the most relevant feature when coping with covid19 before entering the ward physicians must wear protective clothing including suit or gown apron head covering gloves mask and goggles most patients also require oxygen therapy which constitutes another barrier to communication in such a scenario empathy can be transmitted only through eye contact or a quick touch of patients hand so to create a sort of healing bond which will continue even after discharge the role of the internist does not end with patients discharge as organ injuries induced by covid19 might be irreversible thus predisposing to the development or worsening of chronic diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis and chronic kidney disease hence the internist could be in charge of the management of these patients since the onset of covid19 until the occurrence of late complications in summary internal medicine has responded promptly to covid19 italian epidemic due to its holistic attitude  the sick patient as an individual rather than the disease is the object of the study  and its methodological approach 5 bill gates with regard to covid19 stated that leaders have two equally important responsibilities solve the immediate problem and keep it from happening again 6 paraphrasing this sentence we may say that internal medicine could solve the immediate problem and could prevent it in the future first it has considered clinical reasoning prior over technical ability and technological instruments secondly it has proved capable of adapting in relation to the various clinical settings and to the changing burden of disease finally internal medicine has deemed humanism as an essential part of clinical practice 7 hence this crisis may represent a great opportunity to rethink the

infection and control of ventilation in healthcare antonio esquinas m mark todd cohen marco belteton vinicio   experience with the recent viral pandemics has generated a renewed interest in the study of the transmission modes of respiratory pathogens it not only provides better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease but also of the rational design of infectious-control strategies hospital-acquired infections still account for many hospitalizations and deaths around the world with many of these infections being transmitted via aerosolized microorganisms to patients and healthcare workers hcws the generation of such infectious aerosols of human respiratory pathogens can occur via three modes of transmission which are not mutually exclusive aerosol transmission transmission by large droplets and self-inoculation of the nasal mucosa by contaminated hands the aerosol mode is arguably the most important because of its impact on hospital infection control safety of the hcws requiring specialized isolation rooms personalized protective equipment and caution with certain procedures growing evidence supports that from the classic early studies by wells regarding air borne transmission and spread of diseases in the hospital environment and its hcws 1 many of these infections can be prevented in this chapter we discuss the biological and mechanical factors involved in the transmission of respiratory pathogens and their consequences 101007978-3-7091-1496-431 discusses preventive measures to decrease airborne transmission of infections 
airborne transmission passage of microorganisms from a source to a person through aerosols resulting in infection of the person with or without consequent diseaseaerosols solid or liquid particles suspended in the air the size of the particles 0001 to 100 m allows them to remain airborne for a variable amount of time infectious aerosols contain pathogensshort-range airborne infection route transmission between an infected source and the susceptible host within a short distance generally 1 mlong-range airborne infection route transmission of infected particles carried from the source for a long distance to the susceptible host by airflow within rooms between rooms distant locations generally 1 m
 when studying bio-aerosols generated by humans it is important to distinguish between the initial particle diameter and the final diameter after evaporation of water in ambient air these droplet nuclei are involved in the long-range transmission route but can also cause infection in the short range once infectious droplets are released the main factors that determine how they are transported are their size type with or without structural lipids airflow patterns humidity and temperature humidity alters the evaporation rate of the droplets and therefore affects droplets size knight estimated the time taken for particles to fall to the floor in a 3-m height room particles of 13 m in diameter remain suspended almost indefinitely 10m droplets stay in the air 17 min 20-m droplets remain for 4 min and 100-m droplets fall to the ground after 10 s 2 the droplet size thus affects how airflow patterns distribute their deposition temperature changes also greatly influence the exchange flows between rooms both temperature and humidity affect the lipid envelope and protein coat affecting the period of survival temperatures above about 24 c appear universally to decrease airborne bacterial survival transport of such airborne droplets is driven by various other environmental factors such as the local ventilation airflow windows doors ventilation systems the movement of people and their clothing and thermal and airflow gradients produced by various pieces of equipment another important consideration for the pathogenesis of aerosolized transmitted infectious diseases is the penetration and deposition of these infected particles in the respiratory tract particles 20 m rarely penetrate below the trachea particles 510 m have 50  penetration of the tracheobronchial tree and particles 5 m have less penetration of the alveolar region 30  3 receptors are required for some infectious agents to initiate successful infection and eventually disease whereas bacteria and fungi can exist independently of host cells viruses require specific receptors to which they can bind before entering and replicating within particular host cells this requirement has been offered as one of the explanations for why certain individuals were infected with avian influenza a h5n1 and perhaps why others were not differing receptor distribution patterns in the upper and lower respiratory tracts among individuals can affect the ease with which inhaled airborne viruses can cause infection and disease 4 5 finally the nature of the infecting agent and the human respiratory activity itself may cause a different variety of organism to be expelled with differing effects on secondary cases the physiology of a cough suggests that it is more likely to bring up and expel deep-seated organisms from the lower respiratory tract eg influenza staphylococcus and streptococcus bacterial speciesthan the sneeze or normal speech both of which are more likely to expel organisms inhabiting the upper respiratory tracteg rhinoviruses and coronaviruses the infectious risk of transmission is critically affected by parameters such as the pathogenicity of the infectious agent its infectious dose rate of biological decay and environmental interaction of the infectious agent table 301 6 7 the infectious dose varies among individual pathogens and their hosts not only are immunocompromised hosts more susceptible to infection even with low infectious doses they become more effective source spreaders because the pathogen is poorly controlled leading to super-spreading events knowledge of the infectious dose can help estimate the number of air changes required in an indoor environment to reduce the pathogen concentration to a safe level

generation of infectious aerosols of human respiratory pathogens can occur by aerosol transmission transmission by large droplets and self-inoculation of the nasal mucosa by contaminated handsmain factors that determine how infectious droplets are transported are their size type with or without structural lipids airflow patterns humidity temperature local ventilation airflows and thermal and airflow gradientsthe risk of transmitting infection is critically affected by parameters such as the pathogenicity of the infectious agent the dose the rate of biological decay and environmental interaction of the infectious agent including the hosts immune statusaerosol-generating procedures associated with an increased risk of transmission to hcws include tracheal intubation niv tracheotomy and manual ventilation before intubationendotracheal aspiration suction of body fluids bronchoscopy nebulizer treatment high-flow o2 administration manipulation of the o2 mask or the bipapcpap mask defibrillation chest compressions insertion of a nasogastric tube and collection of sputum are not associated with aerosol transmission
  treating the sarscov2positive patient with cancer a proposal for a pragmatic and transparent ethical process subha perni michael milligan g anurag saraf todd vivenzio amy marques meghan baker a tara kosak sarah bartlett michelle physic a monica batchelder r sean mcbride jeremy bredfeldt daniel cail w meghan kearney c colleen whitehouse peter orio gerard walsh daphne haaskogan a neil martin e   the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 pandemic has dramatically transformed the delivery of health care within the united states over the course of a few weeks hospitals across the nation are preparing to cope with a shortage of health care workers and scarcity of lifesaving resources such as intensive care unit beds and ventilators
1

 this has prompted unprecedented largescale consideration of the rationing of such resources for those who care for patients with cancer the decisions are equally stark cancer care rarely is deemed elective forgoing or delaying diagnosis or treatment often leads to decreased cancer control this may result in reduced survival or in some instances loss of the potential for cure however patients with oncologic diagnoses who become infected with sarscov2 have an increased likelihood of severe events including mortality
3
 
4
 health care workers also have a high risk of infection and may have an increased risk of severe disease
5
 therefore there must be a careful balance weighing the harms of postponing or cancelling treatment against the risks of infection and morbidity for patients health care workers and larger communities in cancer care resources may not currently be strictly lacking in an initial phase the values of rationing are applied as departments work to flatten the curve by decreasing their clinical volume however as the prevalence of sarscov2 increases fewer skilled staff may be available to deliver treatments thereby necessitating rationing based on scarcity emanuel et al have proposed a framework of 4 values that should guide the rationing of health resources such as ventilators during the sarscov2 pandemic including 1 maximizing benefits saving more lives and years of lives 2 treating people equally 3 giving priority to the worstoff individuals and 4 promoting and rewarding instrumental value benefit to others
1
 this framework considers frontline health care workers prioritizing them for critical resources due to their instrumental value and for the high risk of their work and for the pragmatic reason of discouraging absenteeism however it does not consider the nature and severity of risks to health care workers as morally relevant to the treatment decisions themselves indeed to the best of our knowledge there has been only limited discussion of these unique considerations in the literature to date
6

 similar to others the department of radiation oncology at the study institution now is creating a formalized process for optimizing the management of these ethical considerations when determining how to treat patients who test positive for sarscov2 the american society for radiation oncology and several institutions have published excellent evidencebased guidelines that aid clinicians in determining which patients to prioritize for oncologic treatments including radiation

 there is a moral obligation to apply these guidelines equally to patients with sarscov2 so that the presence of infection is not used as justification for withholding needed cancer care for example a patient with a curable head and neck cancer who has tested positive for sarscov2 and is minimally symptomatic should be prioritized to proceed to care without delay in the same way that another patient with head and neck cancer with similar features and who is negative for sarscov2 might be however the details are vitally important when determining how to provide such patients with the care they need while being cognizant of the community of health care workers and the moral organizational duty to protect them the as low as reasonably achievable or alara principle is the ethical principle that guides the minimization of radiation exposure we would argue that an analogue alara principle exists with regard to the infection risks of health care workers within the context of this pandemic ie that infection risk should be minimized as much as reasonably achievable while respecting obligations to patients in radiation oncology frontline health care workers who are at high risk include the radiation therapists who treat patients daily in medical or surgical oncology frontline staff may include infusion nurses or scrub nurses however physicians are the ones who primarily make treatment decisions to address this gap our institution has adopted a novel clinical process that includes frontline staff as ethical stakeholders in determining optimal treatment decisions for individual patients a flow chart of our approach is shown in figure 1 the process begins when an individual patient currently on treatment or a new treatment initiation tests positive for sarscov2 infection the primary radiation oncologist then is prompted to complete a standard electronic form that aggregates pertinent data including a brief description of the clinical scenario and treatment urgency current andor proposed radiation course including technique fractionation and positioning and specific patient factors that might affect the delivery or risks of treatment these data then are sent to the departmental sarscov2 radiation oncology treatment prioritization committee tpc for discussion the tpc was established for the sole purpose of discussing the competing risks and benefits of treatment for each individual patient who tests positive for sarscov2 and providing a decision regarding whether to provide continue andor modify treatment the tpc meets on an ad hoc basis as patient need dictates the challenge of balancing ethical values has led to specific priorities for the tpc namely that the decision process should be transparent and include all affected parties in this vein membership in the tpc was made intentionally broad in addition to the department chair clinical director and executive director leaders from nursing physics and radiotherapy as well as the physician lead of the applicable disease site are invited furthermore representatives from the hospitals infectious disease and ethics departments participate in the tpc and serve to provide context and clarification regarding the risks to and duties of our clinical staff the primary radiation oncologist intentionally is left out of the tpc to reduce potential conflicts of interest and legal risk as suggested in other guidelines

 conversation during tpc meetings is structured to elicit the perspectives of all parties for example the disease site lead physician discusses the expected impact of radiotherapy and the potential risks to the patient of delaying or missing treatment leaders from nursing and radiotherapy assess the practical considerations of treatment including the number of staff required and their degree of likely patient exposure for example patients requiring ventilation or other oxygen supplementation may have an increased risk of virus aerosolization those with limited functional status or a higher body mass index may require more staff to perform a transfer physics leadership considers whether special planning or patient positioning is needed the tpc then seeks to synthesize all relevant information and come to a consensus decision regarding whether to treat the patient if consensus is not achieved the final decision ultimately rests with the department chair a guiding principal was adopted for initial conditions of accepting up to a 5 decrement in cancer outcome to reduce risk to staff by either treatment delay andor altered fractionation this transparent threshold for treatment decisions will be adjusted with changing conditions such as the availability of personal protective equipment and other resources there also may be patientspecific factors that result in an alteration of the risk threshold in a setting with fewer resources available and more sarscov2positive patients a higher threshold may be set conversely this threshold could be decreased if data are collected demonstrating that infection risks to our specific departmental staff are lower than initially estimated if the tpc decides against offering radiotherapy the primary radiation oncologist is informed and is instructed to notify the patient and the rest of the clinical team of the decision however it is important to note that departmental leadership is available to support this communication as needed if treatment is deemed appropriate the clinical director and disease site lead physician discuss whether the treatment could be reasonably modified together they determine a final treatment recommendation and inform the primary radiation oncologist of the decision who then relays this information to the patient and clinical team prior to initiating treatment an onsite point person is tasked with ensuring that best practices are followed to reduce staff risk specific tasks include training frontline staff on the proper use of personal protective equipment identifying a super user to ensure all infection control protocols are followed planning the physical flow of personnel and equipment and zoning contaminated areas the point person also convenes a discussion with all frontline staff to elicit any additional information or concerns finally once radiotherapy commences all sarscov2infected patients are batched on a single linear accelerator and treated at the end of each day so as to further minimize exposure to other patients patients remain in their vehicles until the time of treatment and then are escorted to the treatment machine a treatment checklist see supporting fig 1 and patient intake form see supporting fig 2 are used to standardize these processes this 2pronged approach to a transparent process for reducing the number of fractions delivered to patients with cancer who test positive for sarscov2 and committing to best practices for reducing staff exposure during treatment reflects the ethical balance the department aims to achieve there are limitations to this approach it is a deviation from the typical model of treatment decision making there is considerable uncertainty in terms of quantifying possible harms to patients and staff members both with regard to cancerrelated outcomes and infection risks this approach also requires an investment of time from several staff members which might become more cumbersome should the number of sarscov2positive patients receiving treatment increase finally the patients voice is not independently represented by an advocate which we potentially will incorporate as decisions with greater possible patient harm are considered however despite these caveats we believe this approach allows us to efficiently optimize the competing risks and duties inherent in each treatment decision and ensures that we are protecting staff and patients alike as stated by emanuel et al the the questions is not whether to set priorities but how to do so ethically and consistently rather than basing decisions on individual institutions approaches or a clinicians intuition in the heat of the moment
1
 we have strived to create an ethical consistent and transparent decisionmaking process and believe that our approach could be reasonably applied in many other oncologic settings in which there is disparity in risk between the physicians making the decisions and frontline staff our process accounts for the tremendous difficulty in balancing obligations to individual patients with the epidemiologic necessities of the moment it enables frontline staff to be ethical stakeholders in treatment decisions providing a rationale for treatment and the knowledge that it is not due to individual biases and therefore improving morale and discouraging absenteeism furthermore the tpc has become an accepted decisionmaking body within our department and stands ready to make potentially challenging recommendations if patient need increases or resources become even more constrained even in the midst of this pandemic emergency we cannot abandon organizational and personal ethical

michael bourke mbbs j  we would like to thank ms stephanie todd for her valuable comments we would like to thank ms stephanie todd for her valuable comments  in response to the covid-19 pandemic many jurisdictions and gastroenterological societies around the world have suspended nonurgent endoscopy subject to country-specific variability it is projected that with current mitigation measures in place the peak incidence of active infections may be delayed by over 6 months although this aims to prevent the overburdening of healthcare systems prolonged deferral of elective endoscopy will become unsustainable herein we propose that by incorporating readily available point-of-care tests and conducting accurate clinical risk assessments a safe and timely return to elective endoscopy is feasible our algorithm not only focuses on the safety of patients and healthcare workers but also assists in rationalizing the use of invaluable resources such as personal protective equipment in december 2019 a novel coronavirus termed sars-cov-2 emerged from a suspected zoonotic source in wuhan china driven by its ability to spread through respiratory droplets including by asymptomatic individuals sars-cov-2 has rapidly traversed international borders to infect over 15 million people in over 200 countries 1 now termed as coronavirus disease-19 covid-19 by the world health organization who it is the first coronavirus to be declared a global pandemic and carries a mortality rate of 1 to 10 12 in order to curtail the spread of covid-19 restrictive measures have been implemented worldwide this has included the closure of international borders country-wide lockdowns limitations on gatherings social distancing and the quarantining of any suspected or confirmed covid-19 cases 3 the overarching intention of these measures is to flatten the curve ie reduce the peak incidence of active covid-19 infections and hospitalizations so that healthcare systems are not overburdened unfortunately healthcare workers hcws remain up to 3 times more likely to contract covid-19 than the general population 4 with up to 20 having contracted the disease within certain geographical regions 5 accordingly jurisdictions and gastroenterological societies around the world have recommended the suspension of non-urgent endoscopy 6 7 8 9 in this article we discuss the risk of covid-19 transmission associated with endoscopy and the implications of a reduced endoscopy service we propose that by incorporating readily available point-of-care poc tests and conducting accurate clinical risk assessments a safe and timely return to elective endoscopy is feasible our algorithm not only focuses on the safety of patients and hcws but also assists in rationalizing the use of invaluable resources such as personal protective equipment ppe endoscopy is currently limited to emergency or urgent procedures including the treatment of gi bleeding foreign body removal acute luminal obstruction and cholangitis furthermore the endoscopic diagnosis staging or resection of advanced lesions and malignancy may be performed on a case-by-case basis however as peak sars-cov-2 viral loads are reached in the presymptomatic phase of disease there are concerns that upper gi procedures including gastroscopy ercp and eus may aerosolize virus particles that are shed from the nasopharynx of infected individuals 10 this risk may be further enhanced if a patient dry retches sneezes coughs or requires endotracheal intubation although data on sars-cov-2 transmission via aerosol-generating procedures are lacking prior studies on sars-cov revealed that hcws exposed to such procedures were 466 times 95 ci 313-694 more likely to become infected than nonexposed hcws 11 with the detection of live sars-cov-2 virus in stool surpassing that of respiratory samples in up to 23 of patients 12-19 the risk of fecal-oral transmission during colonoscopy is also plausible this concern is not unfounded with tissue samples from the oesophagus stomach duodenum and rectum of covid-19 patients all demonstrating the presence of sars-cov-2 rna 16 additionally as microbial dissemination can occur up to 6 feet away from a patient undergoing endoscopy 20 and bodily fluids may splatter when manipulating devices in and out of the working channel of an endoscope there is also a risk of fomite and environmental transmission this risk is extended to clerical and cleaning staff because sars-cov-2 has been demonstrated to easily contaminate a patients surroundings including sinks light switches and doors 21 and is viable on plastics and stainless steel for hours 22 thus because endoscopy is viewed as a high-risk procedure for covid-19 transmission current guidelines recommend the use of ppe for all emergency and urgent procedures including a fullsleeve gown eye protection hairnet gloves and respirator mask 23 although there was an initial concern over a potential shortage of ppe in the united states with over 500000 cases by mid-april 2020 this is looking less likely due to a smaller than projected case-load and increased ppe procurement 1 24 25 another byproduct of current mitigation measures is the delay of the projected peak by a further 6 months 2425 it should also be noted that the active case-load will take time to subside and the eventual relaxation of mitigation measures may also result in disease resurgence 26 these additional challenges may result in a further delay to the re-institution of elective endoscopy the importance of recommencing routine endoscopy is reflected by its economic and health impacts in the united states 177 million endoscopic procedures are performed annually accounting for 56 of the population 27 furthermore over 136 billion usd is spent on gastrointestinal disease annually exceeding that of heart disease trauma and mental health 27 similar trends exist in less-populous countries such as australia where over 850000 endoscopic procedures are performed annually accounting for 35 of the population 130 of all same-day separations from healthcare facilities and 72 or 5 billion aud of all public and private hospital expenditure 29 29 in the united states alone a hypothetical suspension of elective endoscopy for 6 months is predicted to result in the delayed diagnosis of over 2800 colorectal cancers and 22000 high-grade adenomatous polyps with malignant potential 27 the 6 month mortality rate for those eventually diagnosed with colorectal cancer would increase by 65 30 just as ominously with over 600000 cirrhotic patients in the united states over 1500 may have a terminal variceal bleed that may have been otherwise prevented by endoscopic surveillance  31-34 thus it is clear that the longterm suspension of routine endoscopy is unsustainable and therefore imperative that we resume elective endoscopy as early and safely as possible a deeper understanding of available screening tools and the host-immune response to sars-cov-2 is valuable in working toward achieving this goal an animal study using a covid-19-recovered rhesus macaque model raised the possibility of immunity to sars-cov-2 after the virus remained undetected in nasopharyngeal and anal swabs after an intra-tracheal re-challenge with sars-cov-2 35 furthermore a promising study on the plasma of recovered patients identified the presence of neutralizing antibodies the activity of which was transferred to recipients after plasma infusion 36 contrastingly epidemiological data from china suggests that covid-19 re-infection or re-activation may be possible with a minority of recovered hcws who experienced symptom resolution and had 2 consecutive negative pcr results subsequently yielded positive pcr results up to 13 days later 37 moreover these recovered hcws were only re-screened due to their need to recommence healthcare work however because the quality of the screening tests used is unclear there is a possibility that the negative pcr results may have been false negatives this is reflected in other studies that reveal that despite a median seroconversion time of 7 days and rising antibody titres viral shedding and the clearance of sars-cov-2 rna from sputum and stool could take up to 3 weeks including in asymptomatic individuals 153839 hence given the limited body of knowledge pertaining to sars-cov-2 immunity it would be prudent to currently assume that re-activation re-infection and viral shedding can occur despite seroconversion with the aforementioned concerns of aerosol-generation spread by asymptomatic individuals and the possibility of re-infection we believe that rapid point-of-care poc tests are a vital component of any algorithm proposing a return to routine endoscopy current testing methods for covid-19 include reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr isothermal nucleic acid amplification tests inaat clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat crispr assays enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisa and lateral flow immunoassays lfa although lab-based rt-pcr performed on nasopharyngeal swabs is limited by a complex and expensive protocol that can take up to 4 hours to yield a result the food and drug administration fda in the united states has recently approved a poc test that can yield a result within 45 minutes 40 now commercially available it carries a 95 sensitivity for diagnosing acute infection although it is unreliable beyond week one of disease as nasopharyngeal viral loads may reach undetectable levels 1540 although rt-pcrs can detect sars-cov 2 rna in blood this usually occurs in the setting of clinically severe disease 14 and thus unlikely to be useful in assessing asymptomatic patients presenting for endoscopy both inaat and crispr can also be performed on nasopharyngeal swabs and are highly specific 95 to sars-cov-2 41-44 unlike rt-pcr inaat does not require multiple heating cycles and therefore can provide results within 15 minutes with a sensitivity of 95 45 a fda-approved inaat poc test is readily available and has already been procured by clinics and hospitals across the united states crispr relies on the cas13a protein to form a complex with amplified rna product which then cleaves a fluorophore-quencher probe to produce a fluorescent light signalling disease although it can yield a result in 60 minutes with a sensitivity of 90 and specificity of 100 there is currently no poc test available 43 stratified risk based on the proposed endoscopic procedure although recommend use of respirator masks in all cases we believe that a safe return to routine endoscopy is possible by using a strict protocol that stratifies risk by combining an assessment of epidemiological and clinical risk-factors with the use of highly sensitive rapid poc tests figure 1   population-screening data from iceland suggests that up to 43 of covid-19 patients are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis 55 hence with over 500000 cases in the united states and a current symptomatic prevalence of approximately 015 the rate of asymptomatic disease can be estimated as 011 or 370000 persons this information can be assessed against the sensitivity of available poc tests to determine the number of false negative results expected per 10000 asymptomatic individuals tested figure 2  for example in an endoscopy unit that serves 10000 patients annually in the united states a poc test with 95 sensitivity would result in only 1 false negative result comparatively in a higher-prevalence population of 2 there would be 10 false negative results per 10000 patients this of course would evolve with changes in disease prevalence and test sensitivity if each endoscopy unit establishes a false negative threshold deemed acceptable to them a 3-tiered system for the precautionary measures required during endoscopy can be used table 1  for example in a low-risk patient with no risk factors and a negative poc result should the false negative threshold be satisfied then standard precautions may be used over enhanced precautions the key difference here is the use of a surgical mask over a respirator mask and may help preserve valuable ppe as transmission of the small sars-cov-2 virus 3 m is via larger respiratory droplets both masks may offer adequate protection this is reflected in a previous study on sars-cov which revealed marginally better protection by respirator masks odds ratio 086 56 however studies on sars-cov-2 are lacking by the very nature of emergency endoscopy for life-threatening procedures poc testing should not be performed the decision regarding the level of precautionary measures required should be determined through a clinical and epidemiological risk assessment however for urgent procedures which we defined as requiring endoscopy within 3 days poc testing rt-pcr or inaat offers the ability to further stratify risk  table 1  for example a patient with a low pre-test probability and positive poc result will require maximum precautions whereas a patient with a high pre-test probability and negative poc result can proceed with enhanced precautions to minimize unnecessary contact all patients requiring maximum precautions should be kept isolated outside of the endoscopy unit and taken straight into their allocated procedure room once endoscopy staff is ready after the procedure they should be moved into a dedicated covid-19 recovery bay for the safe and gradual re-introduction of elective endoscopy cases should adhere to guidelines for the appropriate use of endoscopy and be triaged on their clinical merits 57 patients with a low pretest probability should proceed to a serological igg test to assess for previous covid-19 exposure whereas higher-risk patients should be isolated for further clinical assessment and only undergo serological testing once cleared as viral shedding and viral rna detection can occur up to 3 weeks postseroconversion a positive serological result requires deferral of endoscopy for this time period 15 in the future with greater clarity of a patients immune status this delay may no longer be required although we acknowledge that false positive results may delay endoscopy by up to 3 weeks the alternative would be no endoscopy on the day of endoscopy patients should present to an independent screening bay located outside of the endoscopy unit upon arrival a dedicated staff member using enhanced precautions should re-assess patient risk factors and perform a poc test rt-pcr or inaat to rule out acute infection patients satisfying all criteria would be allowed to enter the unit with accompanying individuals remaining outside those with newly identified risk factors or a positive result would be isolated and re-triaged if still deemed necessary to proceed maximum precautions would be required if deemed nonurgent the procedure would be deferred until the patient is well and exposure to the risk factor has passed upon discharge patients would be met by their accompanying individual at a separate exit to the unit follow-up should be organised with the referring physician by telehealth consultation if possible to reduce the spread of covid-19 staff should use correct hand hygiene 58 and follow local recommendations for the donning and doffing of ppe in critical shortages the re-use of respirator masks is possible after decontamination with ultraviolet light hydrogen peroxide vapour or moist heat 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 although the effect of these methods on sars-cov-2 is yet to be established prior studies demonstrate effective inactivation of coronaviruses 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 to further conserve supplies it is possible to conduct the donning of a respirator mask up to 5 times before fit factors consistently drop to unsafe levels 466 in such cases great care would need to be exercised to avoid accidental contact with the front of the mask anecdotally the use of a surgical mask over a respirator mask may help preserve it for longer although further studies are required 67 however these measures are unlikely to be required as the fda has taken steps to increase procurement of ppe by providing clear guidelines for importers and manufacturers to follow  68 social distancing should be practiced by staff with work conducted using designated chairs computers and phones as a contingency measure endoscopy staff should be split into 2 teams who work nonconcurrent shifts each endoscopy department should have a detailed plan addressing the systematic cleaning of all surfaces in the procedure room including the chemical agents required to inactivate coronaviruse 6970 if it is deemed that seroconversion confers immunity to sars-cov-2 then hcws within the endoscopy unit should also be tested for covid-19 at set intervals with serology-based tests this may enable seroconverted staff to perform endoscopy in high-risk patients or those with confirmed covid-19 however at present the duration and protective antibody thresholds after sars-cov-2 exposure remain unclear furthermore if it is deemed that fecal-oral transmission is not viable then colonoscopies in patients with a negative poc result may be able to be performed with standard precautions irrespective of the false negative threshold amid the covid-19 pandemic in order to conserve resources and reduce the risk of transmission jurisdictions across the world have suspended elective endoscopy with mitigation measures projected to increase the duration of the pandemic elective endoscopy may be delayed for an unsustainable period of time our algorithm proposes a return to elective endoscopy in a safe and timely manner through a multifaceted approach to risk-stratification this requires an assessment of epidemiological and clinical risk factors rapid poc testing and evaluation of a predefined false negative threshold based upon the prevalence of asymptomatic disease in the community and the sensitivity of the poc test used this maximizes safety for patients and hcws whereas rationalizing the use of valuable resources such as ppe ultimately herd immunity or vaccination may be required to reduce risk of community transmission and enable endoscopy units to reach full capacity once again   disaster preparedness triage and surge

fig 1 11 the 181 patients evaluated over the first week at these hospitals represent an approximately threefold increase in volume this increase in case volume stressed the resources only at the hospital nearest to ground zero nyu-dh to complicate matters nyu-dh was partially disabled by simultaneous internal disasters impaired access to the hospital loss of electricity and poor air quality on october 23 1983 a suicide truck bomb destroyed the us marine barracks in beirut lieutenant erik frykberg a general surgeon was the chief medical officer on board the uss iwo jima with limited resources and staff dr frykberg managed all 112 injured survivors the explosion generated 346 casualties of whom 234 immediately died of the 112 survivors 96 were injured only 19 survivors were critical defined by an injury severity score iss of 15 or greater the 77 lightly injured survivors iss15 created an overtriage rate 7796 of 80 among the 112 initial survivors there were 7 additional deaths all among the 19 critically injured frykberg realized that the overall mortality of survivors 7112 or 63 did not tell the whole story he concluded that a better gauge of the medical response in a disaster would be the critical mortality or those deaths occurring among the critically injured as a proportion of all critically injured because all 7 late deaths in the beirut bombing occurred among those with an iss greater than or equal to 15 the critical mortality was 719 or 37 a statistic undiluted by the majority of survivors who did not have significant injury of note within this definition moribund victims with nonsurvivable injuries are not counted as initial survivors frykberg reviewed multiple terrorist bombing events and noted a fascinating trend as overtriage increases so does critical mortality r  092 7 12 the explanation for this relationship is twofold first sorting through numerous victims to find the few critically injured takes valuable time second an excess of patients who have minor injuries or no injuries prevents the dca from functioning optimally predictably radiology becomes a bottleneck laboratory results are lost or delayed phone lines are overloaded medications are not properly dispensed charts are incomplete and staff become stressed and tired consequently although individuals working in the dcas may be under the impression that they are providing appropriate care all of these seemingly inconsequential inadequacies conspire to increase the mortality of those patients whose lives hang in the balance and require immediate uncompromised definitive care for survival thus while the treatment of noncritical victims is not the direct responsibility of a dca the consequences of their presence significantly impairs efforts to care for the critically ill and injured often during a disaster caregivers adopt a siege mentality consequently the insidious distractions and delays that overtriage causes are not overtly obvious to those working in the ors and icus and are virtually incomprehensible to others eg the local officials hospital administrators prehospital providers and emergency physicians who are largely responsible for planning the management of the medical response upstream from dcas the relationship between overtriage and critical mortality appears to have been demonstrated again on september 11 2001 surgeons from nyu-dh the facility nearest to the world trade center and bh analyzed and calculated their overtriage and critical mortality rates 2 because of its proximity nyu-dh was flooded with psychologic casualties the uninjured seeking refuge people looking for missing colleagues and critically injured victims brought in by bystanders as well as by ambulance at bh many ambulatory victims also arrived for evaluation but the critically injured were mostly transported by emergency medical services ems at bh the overtriage rate was 80 and the critical mortality was 28 which was similar to the beirut bombing at nyu-dh overtriage was 95 and the critical mortality was 44 which are the highest values reported from any disaster to date placing these data points from september 11 2001 on frykbergs graph the linear relationship is maintained 
fig 2 the challenges at nyu-dh arose from both sides of the demandsresources equation first mainly as a consequence of victims presenting to the nearest hospital while bypassing the ems selection process the resulting overtriage placed excessive demands on hospital resources second because of its proximity to the tower disaster nyu-dhs critical hospital infrastructure failed causing an internal disaster that compromised available resources dr tara otoole 13 director of the center for biosecurity at the university of pittsburgh medical center emphasized three key response areas related to the state of preparation for a bioterrorist attack 1 public health system vulnerabilities eg limited united states laboratory capacity for processing huge volumes of specimens 2 inability to provide adequate doses of vaccinations and medications to treat major bioweapon agents and 3 lack of hospital surge capacity or inability to expand services primarily due to financial constraints subsequent to global terrorism on american soil references to disaster preparedness surge capacity have increased 14 for example in us senate testimony dr elaine kamarck 15 stated recent trends in medicine in the us have resulted in less capacity to deal with a surge in demand for serious medical care than ever beforethe absence of surge capacity is serious when contemplating a high number of injuries resulting from a terrorist attack involving explosives the absence becomes even more dangerous when contemplating the number needing medical care that could arise from a bioterrorist attack an early and clearly relevant use of the term surge capacity with regard to terrorist-related disaster threat was introduced by smithson and levy 16 in 2000 these authors reported that several cities plan to establish a surge capacity at the hospitals as well as medical outposts away from them the idea of medical outposts referred to the creation of overflow capacity for temporarily managing excessive numbers of noncritically injured or ill victims at buildings other than the hospital such as field centers large indoor arenas stadiums schools mobile field care centers and so forth 16 rational and appropriate management of such noncritical casualties is an integral component to instituting surge capacity at any level excessive casualties inappropriately triaged will have a powerful adverse effect on critical mortality outcomes the casualty data from the lower manhattan hospital response to september 11 2001 is illustrative of several aspects of disaster preparedness on that date new york city was not prepared to respond to a sudden disaster that yielded nearly 2000 casualties where 90 of victims did not require the resources of the citys trauma centers chelsea piers converted to a medical outpost was ill-designed for critically injured patients 7 and received few if any injured victims it has been suggested that the united states shortfall in medical preparedness for such a disaster has yet to be corrected 15 17 before disaster planning can take place it is important to understand the relevant characteristics of disaster events causes casualties victims resources and how they interrelate planning must acknowledge that the pinnacle of the medical response to any disaster takes place in definitive care areas thus a critical component of disaster planning must be preservation of dca capability and effectiveness a simple and relevant classification scheme for dca preparation is to consider the disaster event location internal or external and the speed of onset rapid or slow 
fig 3 fire 18 electrical failure 19 20 and flooding 21 22 are examples of internal disasters that affect hospital infrastructure examples of external disasters would include st vincents hospital and bh on september 11 2001 or the israeli experience in terrorist bombings 23 24 combined internalexternal disasters present particularly difficult challenges examples include the nyu-dh experience on september 11th 2001 and an earthquake occurring in an urban area 25 slowly evolving events include infectious epidemics 26 and hurricanes 27 with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars for example the worldwide surge in patients peaked at 56 days following initial case reports 28 the delay in the surge of casualties allows administrators to implement plans adjust resources and request and obtain outside assistance in contrast rapidly evolving disasters require pre-event plans frequent drills and a self-sufficient local response that can be rapidly mobilized failure to have such capabilities leaves the seriously ill or injured victims most vulnerable because the scope of variation in event types is so diverse rational planning either involves generalization in broad terms the all hazards approach or identification of a hypothetical list of high-risk events to guide training the hazard vulnerability analysis approach or a combination of the two strategies 14 while unique in proportion and precedent the september 11 2001 attacks were illustrative of the casualty spectrum identified in most rapidly evolving disasters 21 22 there were victims who were immediately killed were not immediately killed but moribund were critically injured with the potential for survival others who required medical evaluation but were not critical walking wounded and those who experienced psychologic effects only worried well frykberg 7 was among the first to describe the deadinjured ratio for a variety of terrorist bombings he observed in beirut a deadinjured ratio of 21 a reversal of the 12 to 15 ratio of conventional war frykberg further noted that the deadinjured ratio of the september 11 2001 attack would be 51 or higher and in fact it may have approached 101 in most reports from various mass casualty events deaths and injuries can be tabulated the deadinjured ratio is proving to be a recurring statistic that correlates to the amount of physical energy released by the event the american college of surgeons 29 recommends that trauma centers maintain a 50 overtriage rate for the management of casualties from physical injury under routine circumstances ie half of the patients triaged to a trauma center are found not to have sustained major trauma as defined by an iss15 thus prehospital protocols are designed to encourage a degree of overtriage the intent is to capture all serious injuries while minimizing the opposite result of undertriage and having seriously injured trauma patients inappropriately treated at nontrauma centers frykberg recognized that in disaster scenarios the dead may vastly outnumber the injured and only a minority of those injured are critical 1015 so overtriage above and beyond the 50 mark was possible with potentially deleterious consequences to the survival of the critically injured in response to multiple or mass casualty the most basic distinction is between those casualties who are critical versus noncritical as one follows the path of the victim from the scene to field evacuation to a casualty collection area to transportation to a medical facility through the diagnostic areas and finally to transfer to a dca an ongoing process called triage takes place the etymology derives from the french to sort the decisions surrounding sorting however are highly situational initial sorting of patients attempts to identify their injury or illness and route them to appropriate care in addition when resources are inadequate to meet needs triage performs a second function rationing rationing is the process by which scarce resources are distributed ideally in a prioritized manner to the most needy rationing is a charged topic for health care in the united states but it is a long-recognized function of triage however rationing is seldom employed because resources are rarely unavailable rationing decisions may occur at each of multiple points between the scene and the dca evacuation first aid transport decontamination admission transfer and treatment if resources at each step are adequate no rationing takes place however in a disaster the closer one is to the scene when evaluating resources relative to needs the more likely that rationing must take place during rapidly evolving events in the field in transit or on arrival to the hospital a triage officer will attach a color-coded classification tag to each victim black tags designate dead or moribund victims victims who have serious injuries requiring immediate treatment are tagged red yellow tags identify patients who will eventually require treatment green tags signify ambulatory patients who have minor injuries in addition most casualties arrive from the scene untagged and with no obvious injury however the untagged patients may require decontamination and counseling all affected victims must be observed and re-evaluated because their condition may deteriorate finally several people arrive at the hospital untagged media family bystanders well-meaning volunteers and following a terrorist event potentially people with nefarious intent the absolute and relative numbers of each type of victim triaged for any event will vary the biggest variable in explosive urban events is the untagged mass which depends on the number of people present location and time of day different mechanisms generate reproducible patterns of death injury and illness some examples include closed-space versus open-air explosions 5 and food-borne versus airborne infectious agents familiarity with these patterns enables clinicians to anticipate victim type timing acuity and treatment needs 6 14 the immediate focus must be on the victims with red and yellow tags these victims lives hang in the balance with timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment in functional dcas most of these victims will live without it many will die 30 dca managers must assess medical resources based on whether they can or cannot maintain normal standard of care resource categorization focuses on the ability to maintain standard of care and integrates with event characteristics and victim categorization resources can be categorized as normal surge and overflow normal resources define the standard of care the authors propose a definition of surge resources as alternate equipment locations and personnel that can be used in the treatment of additional patients while maintaining the standard of care in contrast overflow resources are equipment locations and personnel that can be used in the treatment of additional patients but which compromise the standard of care as casualty loads increase normal surge and overflow resources are engaged and eventually exhausted once all overflow resources are consumed the system is overwhelmed only at this point should rationing victims access to definitive care take place the surge capacity of a facility is defined simply as the total number of patients that can be managed with only normal and surge resources overflow capacity is likewise defined as the absolute number of patients who can be accommodated with the addition of overflow resources in reality as casualty loads increase during a disaster not all resources will be exhausted while treating the same number of patients thus each resource ventilators monitors nursing staff and so forth has its own normal surge and overflow capacity for planning purposes once a single resource of the next level must be employed the patient should be considered as being treated within the next levels capacity for instance managing a critically ill patient in the postanesthesia care unit pacu a surge resource with a 14 nursing care ratio overflow strategy would be considered as using the hospitals dca overflow capacity the rationale behind distinguishing these types of resources is to clarify resource management in the face of escalating needs from this perspective the system can be considered to be functioning continuously along a spectrum from normal to surge to overflow to overwhelmed many institutions use their surge capacity on a regular basisfor example institutions that hold patients overnight in the pacu because the icus are full once surge resources are consumed substandard practices or resources must be used to accommodate additional patients these overflow resources are acceptable and appropriate to treat the large numbers of noncritical victims of any disaster and may be necessary even for critical victims in extreme circumstances however the more surge capacity maintaining standard of care that can be identified beforehand and quickly mobilized for critically ill and injured victims the greater the impact will be on overall survival from the event the size of an event must always be placed in the context of the medical facilitys normally available resources a small event is defined as one that results in a casualty load manageable by using the involved facilitys normal resources at the opposite end of the spectrum an extra-large event is defined as one that overwhelms the facility by generating a casualty load that cannot be accommodated even with overflow resources the absolute numbers of casualties accommodated at each level are higher for a large urban trauma center 
table 3 than for a freestanding rural surgical center neither small nor extra-large events benefit from dca planning small events are routinely managed with available resources whereas extra-large events are overwhelming by definition a truly overwhelming mass casualty event mce mandates a triage strategy that involves rationing access to definitive care rationing entails difficult ethical decisions the priority becomes saving as many victims as possible given the available resources how to render care in these austere circumstances is not in the authors area of expertise or within the scope of this paper but difficult decisions must be made until outside assistance arrives contingency planning for an overwhelming scenario does not fall on individual departments or hospitals but rather is done regionally rubinson and colleagues 31 published recommendations for establishing such planning to include pre-event legislative action public transparency and regional rather than single hospital implementation plans developed at the dca manager level are designed to prevent or at least postpone being overwhelmed if clinicians are overwhelmed they will have to do their best with what is available until outside help arrives if care providers are overwhelmed they should plan on providing only basic first aid and rationing access to definitive care resources 32 33 34 35 regarding an overwhelming event the treatment of critically injured victims is quickly superseded in priority by public health needs which include provisions for food shelter proper sanitation facilities and clean water 36 the focus of dca planning efforts is on medium and large events medium events are those in which the critically ill or injured can be managed while maintaining standard of care with surge capacity resources large events can be handled only by using auxiliary substandard overflow capacity see table 3 fire electrical failure and flooding are internal disaster events that affect hospital infrastructure the medical and clinical response is to maintain patient care for the most part plans for internal disasters are already in place the challenges are largely administrative and logistic the major decision during an internal disaster is whether or not to evacuate the facility 37 38 39 40 plans for internal disasters and evacuation must be protocol-based formulated in advance activated automatically and drilled periodically 41 regarding external events from the perspective of the dca upstream triage decisions serve to screen and select from the patients who will benefit from surgery or critical care rationing at this level will unfortunately deny care to precisely those patients whom the triage system has selected as most likely to benefit from dca interventions provision of care without rationing is the goal of dca disaster preparedness planning once the system identifies patients as critical and delivers them to a dca triage ceases to function as routing ors and icus are the best of what medicine has to offer in a dca rationing is employed only as a last resort it may be appropriate to offer less than optimal care to green tagged victims they can be triaged to a cafeteria or gymnasium for observation and delayed treatment the impact on the outcomes of these patients will be minimal but when resources are compromised or withheld from those routed to dcas mortality will increase 30 special attention must be paid to patients already under treatment in dcas 42 the first impulse when a disaster strikes is to curtail surgery and to discharge stable patients from icus however patients are in these areas before the disaster for good reasons published experience indicates that even in rapidly evolving disasters there is adequate time 24 hours 6 with a preordained plan for these areas to be prepared and expanded to accommodate the incoming surge of casualties tabletop exercises are planned rehearsals of mcis or mces organized to challenge the community and responders involved in the management of the disaster the degree of sophistication of a tabletop exercise can range from simple to very complex the simplest form is when a few individuals literally sit around a table and discuss the sequence of their responses to events of a hypothetical disaster based on a written scenario more complex variations of exercises can be from the hospital 43 or regional level which includes first responders communication systems and local agencies 44 45 to national or multinational disaster rehearsals 46 47 common to all of these exercises are a careful pre-event plan some degree of reality simulation anticipation of relevant participants responses often a group of observers and most importantly a post hoc analysis of how the response was executed identifying the response problems and implementing the solutions are critical components of any tabletop exercise tabletop exercises for dcas are performed by appropriate administrative and clinical leadership and represent the fundamental process by which surge and overflow capacity planning occurs the most likely disaster scenario from a hazard vulnerability analysis 48 is considered first the process begins by identifying all the components necessary to provide care to a typical victim once normal resources are identified participants identify surge and overflow resources at each level of care normal surge overflow the care-limiting resource is identified participants then explore ways to expand that specific resource the process continues by analyzing the subsequently exposed care-limiting resources then the exercise is repeated assessing the next most likely scenario and so on when this process is completed the group will have generated an inventory of all normal surge and overflow resources needed to provide each level of care in the ors and icus within each category a sequence of resource use is defined for instance the sequence of locations at bellevue hospital bh where emergency surgery can be performed with capacity in parentheses is as followssurgery normally performed in ors 15surge to day surgery 2 then ob 3overflow to cystoscopy suites 2 angio suites 2 pacu 12 and icu 18
 we describe the analysis of the surgical intensive care unit sicu capacity at bh to illustrate the process bh recently opened a new 10-bed sicu and an 8-bed step-down unit in 2001 during the design phase the team decided to build the 8 step-down rooms identical to interchangeable with and adjacent to the 10 sicu rooms consequently we can now immediately increase our icu capacity from 10 to 18 beds by simply providing additional staffing we consider these 18 beds our initial icu surge capacity achieved through the dual usage of our step-down beds once those 18 beds are full the resources listed in
table 4 are necessary to provide critical care with the additional surge capacity alternatives we would use anesthesia machines for ventilators wall oxygen would be augmented with oxygen tanks additional icu beds could be located in other icus the pacu and ors and we have cooperative transfer agreements with neighboring and affiliated hospitals housestaff would be reassigned from ambulatory and elective rotations nursing administration would provide overtime use agencies and tap float pools to maintain staffing with these measures nurse staffing is our surge capacity-limiting resource in fact this is often our normal capacity-limiting resource we have the physical capacity equipment and medical staff to care simultaneously for 96 critically ill patients with up to two thirds of these patients ventilated our nursing department estimates capacity to care for only a maximum of about 50 patients with a 21 icu staffing ratio consequently our surge capacity expansion efforts have endeavored to increase nurse staffing we enter the overflow capacity phase substandard alternatives for each of these resources as they are consumed
table 5 describes our response for each resource bag-valve-mask resuscitators would substitute for ventilators supplemental oxygen would be abandoned for room air and patients would be located wherever there was space housestaff work hour regulations would be violated and the nursestaffing ratio exceeded in our overflow capacity scenario it is the number of actual beds that limits our capacity using these resources we estimate being able to care for about 200 critical patients for at most 48 hours at which time outside relief would be required this assistance would be expected from either regional cooperative arrangements or from strategic national stockpile resources it is important to involve all clinical services and areas in these exercises to anticipate problems where surge resources overlap an anesthesia machine in a cystoscopy suite cannot serve to expand icu ventilator capacity at the same time that surgeons are planning on using that room to expand trauma surgical capacity in addition it is imperative that all clinical support services radiology blood bank laboratory services pharmacy dietary sterile supply and so forth collaborate in these iterative tabletop exercises during the 2003 electrical blackout at bh we discovered that our sterile equipment processing was not on the emergency backup generator and bh no longer supports gas sterilization because the blackout began at 4 pm on a thursday most surgical instruments were either in use or dirty consequently capacity to perform multiple operations was severely curtailed fortunately only two patients required emergency operations during the blackout the process of continuously identifying the capacity- or care-limiting resource is crucial expansion planning can then focus on that weak link it makes no sense to devote time and energy to expanding one resource like ors when their usage will be limited by lack of sterile instruments the advantage of defining relevant aspects of events victims and resources as described and of adopting the tabletop system for developing resource expansion is that the resulting plans can be considered to be in daily use it is likely that several times per year surge and even overflow resources may be needed simply due to the normal variations in admissions and acuity incorporating disaster preparedness vernacular and algorithms into daily clinical usage maintains preparedness at a continuously high level a number of concepts regarding the medical dca response to disaster have been presented the goals are threefold the first goal is to define an understandable vocabulary and to create a usable framework to simplify and focus planning of the tasks at hand the second goal is to provide tools and strategies to use in developing plans for a clinical response to disaster the final goal is to present some of the remaining challenges that seriously threaten the ability to care for patients in dcas and which have major consequences on overall mortality following any given event by exposing these challenges we hope to inspire dca clinicians to become involved in departmental hospital and regional planning  learning opportunities from covid-19 and future effects on health care system karthikeyan iyengar ahmed mabrouk vijay jain kumar aakaash venkatesan raju vaishya   the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 covid-19 pandemic began in wuhan china in december 2019 and spread worldwide 1 it has now spread to over 200 countries and the latest world health organisation who reports there are over 4 million confirmed cases of covid-19 with more than 300000 deaths may 17 2020 2 predominantly a respiratory illness the novel coronavirus respiratory spreads predominantly by droplets and is highly contagious 3 serious illness requires hospital admission 4 to prevent the spread of this contagious virus national governments have introduced lockdown measures with infection control strategies including social distancing and self-isolation guidelines which severely restricts the movement of people and affects their daily life 56 lockdown and strategies to prevent covid-19 viral transmission has caused significant economic geopolitical and health consequences all over the world 7 covid-19 has had significant effect in normal working of health care organisations fig 1
 it has made patients staying away from accident and emergency departments and reaching out for urgent medical conditions such as heart cancer illnesses acute care-as the pandemic expanded the way different medical departments function had to be re-organised to deliver a continuity of care but also take steps to prevent viral transmission and protect both patients and staff patient administration systems pas have been updated to accommodate different clinic templates eg telephone clinics video clinic rooms for remote consultations radically different from the traditional face to face consultations this is going to be a model of care in the future and the current experience is going to be helpful in the future of acute care delivery eg triaging of acute hand and wrist injuries in the trauma and orthopaedic department redeployment opportunities-doctors and health care staff have accepted this challenge and learning new skills in a new environment this pandemic has given the opportunity to many doctors to experience the work environment in different specialities team working has improved these skills may be helpful to individuals in the future if a career change is thought of or for trainees can learn new skills to apply in the future clinical medicine it has proven the versatility of the medical careers 8 staff on the frontline even with concerns of infection personal protective equipment ppe shortage have been working hard on the coronavirus frontline to treat and save patients doctors nurses carers and paramedics around the world are facing an unprecedented workload in overstretched health facilities this resilience should be a blue print for the future with appropriate protection of the staff on the frontline 910 this probably will be one of the most significant changes as we progress in the post- covid-19 phase to reduce the number of face to face consultations the way out-patient services are delivered has completely changes during the pandemic remote consultations including telephone and video platforms have evolved significantly to provide a continuity of care 11 eg trauma and orthopaedic departments have set-up rapid access one stop clinics set up where patients have everything completed in a single environment for their injuries minor injuries and day case procedures are organised in a way where further follow-up face to face appointments are kept to a minimum with patient centred self-care 12 in chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension it allows remote monitoring and provides a continuity of care for the patients 13 14 15 during this pandemic there was a surge capacity in mass critical care which means an expansion of intensive care units ability to care to as many patients as possible the 4 necessary components of surge capacity are staff supplies space and structure eg multiple hospital units over the last few months during the pandemic to increase capacity of intensive care beds and ventilators eg nhs nightingale hospitals this increased capacity will help deliver the post-covid-19 strategy to resume elective surgery 16 nhs has built a backlog and storagestockpile of ventilators  will be useful for the current nhs and future pandemic a team of engineers from ucl the university in london and formula one engine maker mercedes-amg hpp have been working flat out to manufacture large numbers of a continuous positive airway pressure cpap devices within one month 10000 devices have been delivered to meet the uk government target 17 this has shown the versatility and the spirit of support and unity of all community sectors to help out during a disaster covid 19 has exposed health care system of many countries including india in india public health-care system in grossly under-funded and patchy while private health-care sector is unregulated the indian governments expenditure on health as a percentage of gdp is around 15 there are several gaps in indias preparedness for covid-19 pandemic 18 this pandemic could be the much-needed wake-up call to the necessity of long-term changes to indias health 19 recently taking in account during pandemic the indian government has increased expenditure in the public health system to reboot healthcare the government has launched an ambitious project aatmanirbharbharat to become more self-reliant with investment in acquiring and building lifesaving equipments like ppe ventilators building hospital infrastructure icu beds oxygen supply in hospitals strengthening of laboratories hiring of additional human resources which were scarce before pandemic 2021 all this will improve the health care system and facilities in india in covid-19 organisations have accepted that telemedicine has a key role developed their departments to facilitate telemedicine 11 current and evolving telecommunication technologies play a key role in exchange of valid information for diagnosis and management of diseases and injuries the main modalities for remote consultations include telephone consultations virtual fracture clinics and video consultations 22 23 24 these innovations are going to be main-stay in how we deliver health care in the future recently telemedicine or delivery of health care services using information or communication technology is evolved in india due to covid 19 telemedicine set to transform healthcare in a post-covid-19 world the government of india has recently launched the e-sanjeevani opd a national tele-consultation service as mandatory for health-care providers through e-sanjeevani opd patients can medical advice through audio and video with this service people living in the remotest areas will also be able to get their health-related consultation 25 recently the indian medical association has adopted the necessary regulatory frameworks for supporting wide adoption of telemedicine and issued an advisory for its use in few situations when the pandemic will end doctors will prefer to see patients directly but at the same time due to increased experience in tele-medicine will help them to see patient if they skip the doctors visits there is a myriad of medical conditions that are self-limiting eg traditionally orthopaedic doctors have been receiving referrals before the pandemic and had to counsel patients regarding these conditions eg patellar tendinitis ganglion swellings 26 during the pandemic patients with those conditions were given advices over the phone and guided to online resources by which they were satisfied we believe patients with those conditions would benefit from the education and positive message that can be provided by accessing designated online websites and online physiotherapy services this saves plenty of consultation time and help offload our health care systems and outpatient services teaching is a mandatory part of medical training in all specialities different online applications have been used to continue delivering teaching sessions to trainees at variable levels this has proven to be more convenient flexible and bringing education also this has given us the chance to meeting international interesting people and gain real world skills at our homes smartphone technology allows conferences seminars workshops and other forms of online teachings 152728 webcams captured hospital rounds 3d images replaced cadavers zoom classes virtual simulators webcasting online chatrooms virtual dissection e-anatomy with virtual reality 29 30 31 the global lockdown during this pandemic has given a unique opportunity to the researchers and clinicians to complete their pending paper publications and research works there have been an unprecedented number of publications during the peak of the covid-19 pandemic across all the medical journals of the world 32 this positive trend might continue in future and help the healthcare industry to benefit from these research and innovations including finding effective means of dealing with the future epidemics and pandemics human crisis like covid-19 pandemic has also offered some unique opportunities for the healthcare sector it has allowed us to revisit the healthcare delivery rationalizing and optimizing the available resources during such crisis are some of the most import lessons learnt from this crisis although there has been severe disruption in the healthcare delivery during this time globally but several positives have also come out of it viz the effective use of telemedicine importance of personal hygiene and the importance of infection control the virtual means of teaching educating and sharing knowledge has now become popular and acceptable the research and publications have also seen a significant rise during these difficult times none  universal do-not-resuscitate orders social worth and life-years opposing discriminatory approaches to the allocation of resources during the covid-19 pandemic and other health system catastrophes thomas bledsoe a janet jokela a noel deep n lois snyder sulmasy   deciding to not attempt resuscitation for all patients with a particular diagnosis like coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is deeply problematic the physicians obligations to avoid harm act in the patients best interests and respect the value of each individual require thoughtful balancing of likely burdens and possible benefits of this and any intervention for some patients with or without covid-19 the likelihood of harm is so high and that of benefit so low that resuscitation is not clinically indicated a blanket approach however is not consistent with an individualized evidence-based clinical assessment clinician health and safety also require attention clinicians should not be asked to participate in resuscitation efforts that are not clinically indicated and policies and procedures should help ensure best practices and availability of personal protective equipment recent guidelines from spain recommend that social worth be considered in rationing decisions 2 recalling the god squads that made dialysis determinations in seattle in the 1960s 3 this is not ethically defensible it entails judgments in which some categories of persons are deemed less socially worthy than others appreciation of the value and dignity of every individual the humility necessary for making triage decisions and acknowledgment of social factors that limit opportunity for many persons strongly argue against using social worth or its perception to determine resource allocation some state guidelines about crisis standards of care and some journal articles promote a life-years approach to rationing sometimes called a life-cycle or fair innings approach it is far from fair systematically disfavoring older patients disabled persons and potentially other groups fair approaches evaluate medical need prognosis and the effectiveness of treatment for the individual in a pandemic the critical question is the ability to survive the acute event not long-term survival one recent article claims concern about discrimination noting upfrontcorrectlythat categorical exclusion of large groups from ventilator treatment violates the ethical principle of justice by applying additionalcriteria to some patients but not others without making clear what is ethically different about the patients that would justify doing so 4 but just because a plan does not set an arbitrary age cutoff or automatically exclude patients with certain disabilities does not mean that it is unbiased this articles life-years approach proceeds to systematically disadvantage disabled persons and older adults the authors support their proposal by asserting that people intuitively prioritize the young without evidence or recognition that intuitions can be prejudiced for example the public once widely supported racial segregation of hospital wards moreover the authors cite an article 5 on organ transplantation that they say provides a precedent for rationing based on life-years but it is misapplied that article 5 considered age to determine short-term survival of 1 year that is clinical effectiveness of the intervention not longer survival life expectancy or life-years also the contexts are very different older patients once were believed to be unlikely to survive the procedure itself they were not denied a transplant because they had too few life-years to be deserving in fact transplants for recipients aged 65 years and older have increased dramatically for
lungsand overallover the past 30 years 6 crisis triage protocols that contravene ethics are troubling those doing so while claiming to be ethical and to oppose discrimination against groups are particularly troubling the office for civil rights of the us department of health and human services says that laws about civil rights are still very much in effect during the pandemic noting that treatment considerations should not include stereotypes assessments of quality of life or judgments about a persons relative worth based on the presence or absence of disabilities or age decisions by covered entities concerning whether an individual is a candidate for treatment should be based on an individualized assessment of the patient based on the best available objective medical evidence 7 californias health department has also issued guidance 8 the aforementioned issues are not theoretical everything that can be done must be done to ensure that rationing of resources such as ventilators and intensive care unit beds is not necessary during the covid-19 pandemic redistributing ventilators from less affected to shortage areas and using new surge facilities like converted convention centers to increase bed capacity can help boosting production of personal protective equipment and ventilators and mobilizing retired health professionals can bridge projected resource gaps public health initiatives including social distancing hand hygiene face masks and self-quarantine can mitigate spread of the coronavirus resource allocation approaches that advocate disadvantaging older adults disabled persons or other groups on the basis of diagnosis perceived social worth or predicted life expectancy send a message to all patients that some lives are valued more than others this will engender distrust in the medical professionnow when trust is most needed as well as into the future the american college of physicians has said that fairness and ethics require that allocation decisions during resource scarcity should be made based on patient need prognosis determined by objective scientific measures and informed clinical judgment and effectiveness ie the likelihood that the therapy will help the patient recoverto maximize the number of patients who will recover 9 the challenges and sadness of this pandemic are widespread and deep and include a disproportionate burden for communities that already experience health care disparities pitting generation against generation patient groups against each other patients against physicians or physicians against institutions is harmful we are all in the same boat when things get toughespecially when things get toughwe must all row in the same direction  imaging findings in covid-19 pneumonia lucas de farias de eduardo fonseca kaiser daniel strabelli giunchetti bruna loureiro melo yuri neves costa thiago rodrigues potrich rodrigo chate caruso cesar nomura higa mrcio sawamura valente giovanni cerri guido   in december 2019 an outbreak of a highly contagious pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in the city of wuhan china with many infected patients presenting severe acute respiratory syndrome sars it quickly spread to other countries and was declared a pandemic in march 2020 by the world health organization 12 the etiological agent identified from epithelial cells of infected patients airways was a coronavirus sars-cov-2 belonging to subgenus sarbecovirus and subfamily orthocoronavirinae the seventh member of the coronavirus family that is known to infect humans 1 the infection was named coronavirus disease covid-19 covid-19 pneumonia shares etiological and clinical similarities to other contemporary syndromes also caused by coronaviruses including the middle east respiratory syndrome mers identified in 2012 and sars in 2003 3 similar to other viral infectious diseases covid-19 is not restricted to the pulmonary parenchyma with reports of myocarditis hypercoagulability status acute renal failure mesenteric lymphadenitis and encephalitis 4 this article aimed to demonstrate the chest imaging findings of covid-19 on different modalities to review national and international recommendations on imaging assessment of covid-19 5-9 and to discuss the use of a structured chest computed tomography ct report for the disease chest imaging should be carefully indicated in patients with suspected covid-19 infection not only to reduce the patients radiation exposure but also to reduce unnecessary exposure of other patients and healthcare workers and to rationalize the use of personal protective equipment and resources for disinfecting the patient care equipment 9 the use of chest imaging in covid-19 suspected cases does not replace specific diagnostic tests such as the detection of viral rna by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr and serological detection of antibodies to sars-cov-2 moreover most medical societies do not recommend the use of imaging as a method of disease screening 5-810 in general it is not indicated for asymptomatic patients or those with mild symptoms of the disease imaging should be reserved for those with moderate to severe symptoms those with risk of progression presence of comorbidities and those with worsening of the respiratory condition figure 1 in environments with limited resources imaging can eventually be indicated as a method for medical triage of patients with moderate to severe clinical features and a high pre-test probability 9 in whom urgent decision-making is of primary importance notably there is an overlap of chest imaging findings in covid-19 and other diseases 8 in addition pulmonary imaging features can persist for weeks to months and should not be an objection factor for patient discharge 5 nor should it be considered as a treatment control method 6 in general the resolution of the imaging findings is observed at approximately the 26th day of symptom onset in patients with covid-19 pneumonia 6 but in some cases it can take even longer chest radiography is a quick and easy method frequently requested due to its wide availability and low cost the advent of portable devices has allowed its use in intensive care units and field hospitals 7 radiologists and clinicians should be aware of the radiography limitation of covid-19 pneumonia due to the low sensitivity estimated at 25 11 especially in initial cases figure 2 therefore it should not be considered as a screening method 7 it is recommended for selected populations such as hospitalized patients to assess disease progression figure 3 or to assess associated complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia pleural effusion or pneumothorax 9 the main radiographic findings are lung opacities with bilateral distribution and predominance in the periphery and lower pulmonary fields 12 the disease extension can be quantified utilizing adapted scores according to the percentage of pulmonary opacity extension 12 it is noteworthy that such information can be either under-detected or underestimated when compared to ct thus limiting the disease monitoring capability of radiography 11 in the context of the covid-19 pandemic the use of ct has increased significantly despite the aforementioned national and international recommendations it should be performed in hospitalized and symptomatic patients with clinical worsening andor patients who have comorbidities 5-810 in these patients ct is indicated mainly to assess the extent of the disease and to identify complications such as pulmonary thromboembolism or overlapping bacterial infection and to evaluate differential diagnoses 6 when compared to the reference diagnostic test rt-pcr ct has high sensitivity 97 but low specificity 25 13 and hence cannot replace it 7 the tomographic findings considered typical of covid-19 are ground glass opacities ggos consolidations and crazy-paving pattern figure 2 with bilateral and multifocal distribution and a peripheral and posterior predominance 14-16 such findings are not exclusive to covid-19 and can be found in other viral pneumonias connective tissue lung disease and drug-induced lung disease 8 therefore clinical data and temporal correlation with radiological findings are extremely important as well as correlation with previous examination findings in addition to these findings ct of patients with covid-19 may also show signs of organizing pneumonia reversed halo sign reticular pattern subpleural curvilinear lines parenchymal bands pseudocavities and nodules sometimes configuring the halo sign 17-19 airway centered disease such as bronchial wall thickening centrilobular and tree in bud opacities pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy are not frequently encountered at the initial presentation of covid-19 17 ct findings also vary according to the days of symptom onset ggos are more common in the first few days of symptom onset and can evolve to consolidations reaching a peak in pulmonary opacities between the 9th and 13th days after symptoms onset 615 the dissociation between laboratory and tomographic findings may be seen in patients with positive rt-pcr and absence of imaging findings and those with extensive imaging findings and negative rt-pcr 720 during a pandemic a more assertive interpretation of ct findings related to covid-19 has become necessary to assist patient management therefore some groups 821 have proposed the elaboration of structured reports this type of report offers advantages in the context of high demand of examinations and the need for prompt decisions for the radiologist it helps in the elaboration of the report decrease the reporting time and variability and reduce uncertainty in reporting findings for the referring physician it improves the understanding of the radiological findings and the quality of the information transmitted allowing better clinical management 22 among available classifications the proposal by the consensus of specialists of the radiological society of north america 8 has been widely used they propose four groups of ct findings typical indeterminate atypical and negative for covid-19 figure 4 and suggest ways to report them in our hospital we adapted this classification with small reporting language changes table 1 the typical ct finding for covid-19 consists of 1 peripheral bilateral ggo with or without consolidation or visible intralobular lines crazy-paving pattern figure 5 2 multifocal ggo of rounded morphology with or without consolidation or visible intralobular lines crazy-paving pattern figure 6 or 3 reversed halo sign or other findings of organizing pneumonia figure 7 these findings are suggestive of pneumonia and viral etiology must be included in the etiological differential diagnosis particularly covid-19 the indeterminate ct appearance for covid-19 consists of diffuse figure 8 perihilar or unilateral figure 9 ggo with or without consolidation lacking a specific distribution patients with few very small ggos with a non-rounded and non-peripheral distribution figure 10 are also included in this group in these cases the imaging findings are nonspecific and can be observed in several diseases of non-infectious and infectious origin including viral pneumonia although these are not a suggestive tomographic appearance the possibility of covid-19 should not be ruled out especially in severe clinical cases with extensive pulmonary opacities or in mild cases with isolated pulmonary opacities patients with pulmonary infection findings different from those previously described above can be categorized into the atypical appearance figure 11 such as isolated lobar or segmental consolidations discrete small nodules centrilobular and tree-in-bud appearance lung cavitation and smooth interlobular septal thickening with pleural effusion 8 in this group imaging findings are not usually reported in covid-19 infection and other etiological agents should be considered initially the last group is that of patients without features suggestive of pneumonia as already discussed a normal chest ct does not exclude the diagnosis of covid-19 especially in the initial days of symptoms onset in addition to this classification the structured report may also contain an estimate of the extent of pulmonary involvement eg describing whether it involves more or less than 50 of the lung parenchyma information that has been used as one of the criteria for hospitalization 23 and is also related to admission to intensive care units and mortality 2425 such quantification may be performed visually or automatically through specific software several imaging scores by lobes or pulmonary fields have been proposed 14232627 but all of them are difficult to apply in clinical practice and more studies are needed to validate the correlation of these quantification methods with the clinical course of the disease as previously mentioned covid-19 alterations tend to predominate in the lung periphery which makes lung ultrasound an option in the follow-up of hospitalized patients especially those in intensive care units where transfer to a ct scanner is impossible or difficult however this method should not be used as a substitute for ct 5628 its potential use as a serial assessment tool through established protocols such as the 12-site scanning technique 2930 figure 12 allows the evaluation of the progression of inflammatory involvement of the parenchyma and identification of mild findings such as pleural thickening and even small subpleural consolidations figure 13 it also reduces environmental exposure as only a single doctor is needed to perform the examination at bedside 528 lung ultrasound is based on artefactual lines and their patterns in patients with covid-19 there are irregularly spaced vertical artifacts known as b-lines which may coalesce consolidations with or without air bronchograms may also be found in these patients 28 figure 13 b-lines represent the interlobular andor intralobular septal thickening most associated with pulmonary edema and interstitial disorders when coalescent with several b-lines grouped they correspond to ggo at the periphery of the lungs as observed on ct 3132 imaging should be wisely indicated in the evaluation of patients with covid-19 to avoid unnecessary exposure of other patients and healthcare workers and rationalize the use of personal protective equipment imaging should be reserved for patients with moderate to severe respiratory symptoms risk of progression presence of comorbidities or worsening of the respiratory condition it should not be indicated for asymptomatic patients or those with mild symptoms in environments with limited testing resources imaging can eventually be indicated as a triage method for suspected patients with high pre-test probability chest ct is the main imaging method used in the evaluation of covid-19 pneumonia typical findings include ggos with or without consolidation crazy-paving pattern with bilateral and multifocal distribution peripheral and posterior predominance multifocal ggos of rounded morphology and reversed halo sign additionally ct can help evaluate the extent of pulmonary disease presence of complications and differential diagnosis despite typical ct findings in covid-19 rt-pcr remains the gold standard for the diagnosis structured chest ct report standardizes the imaging findings and optimizes communication with the referring physician thus being a useful tool in the pandemic scenario farias lpg fonseca ekun strabelli dg loureiro bmc neves ycs and rodrigues tp were responsible for

we are providing this version to give early visibility of the article please note that during the production process errors may be discovered which could affect the content and all legal disclaimers that apply to the journal pertain  every inhabited continent accordingly it has stressed health systems the world over leading to 4 the cancellation of elective surgical cases and discussions regarding healthcare resource 5 rationing it is expected that rationing of surgical resources will continue even after the pandemic 6 peak and may recur with future pandemics creating a need for a means of triaging emergent and 7 elective spine surgery patients 8 9 methods 10 using a modified delphi technique a cohort of 16 fellowship-trained spine surgeons from 10 11 academic medical centers constructed a scoring system for the triage and prioritization of 12 emergent and elective spine surgeries three separate rounds of videoconferencing and written 13 correspondence were used to reach a final scoring system sixteen test cases were used to 14 optimize the scoring system so that it could categorize cases as requiring emergent urgent high-15 priority elective or low-priority elective scheduling 16 17 results the devised scoring system included 8 independent components neurological status underlying 19 spine stability presentation of a high-risk post-operative complication patient medical 20 comorbidities expected hospital course expected discharge disposition facility resource 21 limitations and local disease burden the resultant calculator was deployed as a freely-available 22 web-based calculator httpsjhuspine3shinyappsiospineurgencycalculator 23 24 conclusion 25 here we present the first quantitative urgency scoring system for the triage and prioritizing of 26 spine surgery cases in resource-limited settings we believe that our scoring system while not 27 all-encompassing has potential value as a guide for triaging spine surgical cases during the 28 covid pandemic and post-covid period 29 in acute respiratory distress syndrome ards andor death 1 2 since that time it has spread 4 rapidly to affect nearly every country placing significant stresses on the global healthcare 5 system 3 in order to mobilize resources to combat this pandemic the centers for medicare and 6 medicaid services cms 4 the centers for disease control and prevention cdc 5 and multiple 7 professional organizations 67 recommended the cancellation of elective surgical procedures in 8 spite of this it was recognized that there were cases many of them neurosurgical which required 9 urgent or emergent intervention to minimize patient morbidity and maximize the chances of an 10 optimal outcome 8 in response several centers have presented frameworks for the management 11 of neurosurgical patients presenting during the covid-19 pandemic 8 9 10 11 additionally a triage 12 scoring system has been previously developed in an attempt to guide spine surgery consults 1213 13 however to date there has not been a systematic multi-institutional scoring system that 14 includes resource availability and disease burden to aid in triaging spine surgery patients during 15 this crisis though certain symptoms referable to chronic spinal conditions may not necessarily 16 be life threatening these can cause significant pain and disability prompting the challenge of 17 determining who and when to operate in times of crises 18 19 it is recognized that effective triaging of these cases in the post-covid era will be essential to 20 prevent the healthcare system from being overwhelmed by the backlog of elective spinal cases 21 that have been deferred because of the covid-19 pandemic 14 15 16 recently a scoring system 22 aimed at triaging such cases has been published in the general surgery literature 17 however no 23 comparable system has been described for spine patients here we present an applicable example 24 of such a system assembled based upon input by a multi-institutional collaboration this scoring 25 system is designed to assist in two ways first it may assist spine surgeons and administrators 26 with triaging surgical patients during the covid-19 pandemic second the scoring system may 27 help health systems triage elective cases in the post-covid crisis which is likely to also see a 28 relative shortage of surgical resources and has been described by some as a potential collateral 29 pandemic 15 30 31 methods 32 scoring system development 33 to generate this scoring system the first author proposed an a priori scale highlighting those 34 elements thought to be pertinent to the triaging of an operative spine patient in the setting of 35 limited resources the elements applicable to the spine patient included the patients current 36 neurological status rapidity of progressive severity the presence of underlying spinal 37 instability and radiographic evidence of neural element compression several general elements 38 were added that could be used to triage any surgical patient including general patient 39 healthcomorbidities expected resource utilization current resource availability and local 40 disease burden medical comorbidities were pulled from the charlson comorbidity index 18 and 41 from previously published series describing comorbidities associated with increased symptom 42 severity in patients infected with the sars-cov-2 virus 2 19 20 21 22 23 after identifying these elements 43 weights were initially assigned based on input from surgeons at the lead institution using a 44 modified delphi approach that included both neurosurgical and orthopaedic spine surgeons 45 component weighting of the preliminary scale was tested using ten example spine patients 46 3 testing the assessed urgency of the patient as determined by the scoring system against the 47 consensus opinion of the group of surgeons 48 49 after identifying a preliminary scoring system a multi-institutional group was convened 50 including neurosurgical and orthopaedic spine surgeons from multiple institutions with varying 51 levels of experience a modified delphi approach was again used to alter the weights assigned to 52 the categories to refine the preliminary score three rounds of written communication polling 53 and electronic teleconferencing sessions were used to solicit input example cases were again 54 devised to test the degree of agreement between the scoring system and the consensus opinions 55 regarding the urgency of the hypothetical patients issue supplemental data the final scoring 56 system was then deployed as a freely available web-based calculator figure 1  57 httpsjhuspine3shinyappsiospineurgencycalculator 58 59 details of the multi-institutional panel 60 the study group was comprised of 16 spine surgeons representing 12 the degree of impairment that their deficit causes in ambulation or the ability to perform 75 activities of daily living adl 76 77 the scoring system runs from -19 lowest priority elective case to 91 highest priority emergent 78 case and classifies cases as emergent urgent high-priority elective or low-priority 79 elective as identified in table 2  additionally in they have not provided an algorithm for the prioritization of such cases in the setting of potential 106 resource shortages here we present a scoring system devised by a multi-institutional 107 collaboration that aims to assist with these triage issues the ability to assist with both 108 populations is a strength of this scoring system which we feel may be a useful tool for health 109 systems both during the covid pandemic and in the post-crisis period as they struggle to 110 accommodate the large volume of non-emergent surgical cases additionally though we hope 111 such a need does not arise the present scoring system could also have value in the triaging of 112 patients if a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic occurs which may lead to further 113 resource limitations 26 such a wave occurred during the 1918 spanish influenza pandemic 27 and 114 many experts have speculated that a similar phenomenon could occur during the present 115 pandemic 26 28 furthermore the framework of the proposed scoring system could apply to future 116 pandemics where healthcare resources are similarly stretched as the current covid-19 117 pandemic 118 119 prior examinations of triaging in neurosurgery 120 there have been several broad descriptions of triage strategies presented in the neurosurgical 121 literature 29 30 and guidelines from the american college of surgeons acs currently divide 122 surgeries into five levels based upon apparent acuity 11 however a large proportion of spinal 123 cases require emergent or urgent addressal 29 in addition to a perceived lack of granularity neurosurgical triage systems published in the pre-130 covid era have predominately focused on emergent surgical issues triage amongst non-131 emergent cases has been largely overlooked one exception to this is the accountability for 132 reasonableness a4r framework described by ibrahim and colleagues 32 to emphasize 133 scheduling fairness and minimize operating room downtime at an academic center seeing a 134 mixture of emergent and elective cases unlike the present scoring system however their 135 framework was purely qualitative -triaging was performed by a single stakeholder without an 136 obvious means by which surgical cases were ranked another exception is the calgary spine 137 severity score proposed by lwu et al 12 that assessed spine referrals based on the clinical 138 pathological and radiological aspects similar to the a4r framework however this score was 139 not intended for implementation in the setting of a crisis or the acute resource shortages that are 140 expected in the post-covid era 15 constituted an urgent case namely a surgical issue requiring treatment within 2 weeks that was 155 not identified in the emergency list elective cases were similarly identified as all cases that did 156 not fall into the above two categories unlike the system presented here however no formalized 157 system was identified for the prioritization of cases within the urgent or elective categories neuro-oncology sno made recommendations to prioritize adjuvant therapies eg 167 chemotherapy and radiotherapy over earlier surgical intervention for spinal and intracranial 168 malignancies as this will decrease the risks posed by hospitalizing oncologic patients in the 169 same facility as covid-19-positive patients 33 however the groups acknowledge that this is not 170 always possible and that care deferral may cause some elective cases to progress to the point of 171 requiring urgent operative management the european association for neurosurgical societies 172 has attempted to address the question of how to prioritize elective neurosurgical cases through an 173 adapted elective surgery acuity scale unfortunately while this scale provides some 174 guidance the three tiers it employs are quite broad and there are no guidelines for prioritizing 175 cases within a category or a given diagnosis eg degenerative spinal pathology 34 176 consequently we feel the need for a means of triaging both emergent and elective spine cases 177 remains unmet 178 179 while there have been several general frameworks highlighting those cranial pathologies 180 requiring emergent management 8 10 11 there has only been one description of a framework for 181 triaging emergent spine surgeries 25 derived from the experiences at a single italian center tasked 182 with treating cord compression and spinal instability the framework of giorgi and colleagues is 183 a care pathway intended to expedite the identification treatment and safe discharge of patients 184 with spine emergencies priority within the system was based upon american spinal injury 185 association asia grade and radiographic evidence of instability though good results were 186 described for the 19 patients treated under the framework the pathway is non-quantitative and 187 seemingly lacks the granularity to prioritize between two or more emergent patients similarly it 188 is not equipped to triage non-emergent cases 189 190 a more quantitative approach was described by jean and colleagues 35 based upon nearly 500 191 respondents to an internet survey asking respondents to assign an urgency score to each of nine 192 hypothetical cases the authors found mild-to-moderate agreement regarding the extent of 193 surgical urgency for each case range 228-370 however their acuity index was simplistic 194 in that it was based solely upon the perceived case risk and case urgency assigned to it by 195 respondents case risk was graded on a 1 to 4 scale no risk and cannot postpone and case 196 urgency on a 1 to 5 scale leave until after the end of the pandemic and case already done 197 the scale itself did not incorporate neurological status patient comorbidities or local resource 198 limitations all of which are likely to influence the timing of operative management because of 199 this lack of granularity it is unclear that this acuity index can be generalized to other case 200 scenarios thus limiting its potential utility relative to the multidimensional scoring system 201 described here 202 203 204 limitations 205 as with scoring systems published in other domains of neurosurgery the present scoring system 206 is not intended to be prescriptive in its guidance rather we present it as a potential tool to aid 207 surgeons and healthcare systems when triaging patients in times of national crisis or global 208 resource shortages as with the triage frameworks presented to date the present scoring system 209 is derived from expert opinions consequently the scoring system is limited by the biases of the 210 surgeons recruited and their respective institutions we attempted to address this by recruiting 211 surgeons at multiple levels of training at academic centers spread across a large geographic 212 region subjected to varying covid-19 burdens furthermore by only including surgeons into 213 the decision-making process of the urgency of spine patients there is potential that additional 214 points from the non-surgical and administrative personnel could have altered the final scoring 215 system additionally in an effort to maximize the usability of the scoring system it was 216 necessarily simplified and is consequently not all encompassing for example the broad term of 217 new neurologic deficit was included under the high-risk postoperative complication 218 category however this leaves it up to the treating surgeon whether this new deficit is high-219 risk therefore while it can assist in determining surgical priority final disposition should be 220 based upon the clinical judgment of the treating surgeon and institution nevertheless we believe 221 that it can be an effective tool for informing clinical stakeholders as to how each patients case 222 may be triaged at peer institutions our scoring system is also limited by the fact that it operates 223 on the assumption that the patient desires surgery at the same time recommended by the treating 224 surgeon this is not always the case and the ultimate timing of surgery must therefore rely on an 225 in-depth discussion between provider and patient finally the present scoring system was 226 devised with the covid-19 pandemic in mind consequently it could be argued that it may not 227 be applicable to other resource challenging situations and future pandemics may limit resources 228 in a manner not assessed in the current work however we feel that the modular structure 229 employed could easily be adapted to other crises that cause a shortage of medical resources 230 therefore the present system may have utility beyond the present crisis and any second wave 231 that may arise 232 233 conclusion 234 here we present a scoring system for the triaging of spine surgery patients during times of crisis 235 and severe resource scarcity our system was developed by a multi-institutional panel using a 236 modified delphi technique and has the potential to assist surgeons hospital administrators and 237 other clinical stakeholders in assigning priority to both emergent and non-emergent spine surgery 238 patients while not intended to be prescriptive this scoring system may prove useful as a guide 239 during both the covid crisis and the post-covid period to help prioritize patients with the 240 greatest surgical needs though determining the urgency of an individual procedure should be left 241 to the operating surgeon additionally we believe the modular structure of the scoring system 242 implies that it may potentially be adapted to other crises resulting in an acute shortage of medical 243 resources 244 245 tables  table 1 spine surgery urgency scoring system  table 2

lili ma hongwei wang chao wang zhaoguo wang yanli you shuhua liu hongyun wang   the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a newly discovered ribonucleic acid coronavirus isolated and identified from patients with unexplained pneumonia in wuhan china in december 20191 before it was named by the international committee of viral classification on 12 february 2020 it was called 2019-ncov sars-cov-2 mainly causes respiratory and digestive tract symptoms2 with symptoms ranging from mild self-limited disease to severe pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome septic shock and even systemic multiple organ failure syndrome the infection source of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is mainly patients with sars-cov-2 infection asymptomatic infected patients may also become the source of infection mainly via aerosols from the respiratory tract but also through direct contact3 elderly people with underlying diseases are more likely to be infected with the virus and develop severe disease and children and infants are also at risk at present there are no specific drugs for this disease the treatment and nursing mainly include antiviral and traditional chinese medicine treatment isolation symptomatic support and close monitoring of disease progression3
 since the first case of unexplained pneumonia in wuhan 52 countries in the world have confirmed cases by 28 february according to who data of which about 94 are in china4 on that day in china there were 37414 active confirmed cases including 7664 severe cases in 31 provinces 39002 recovered and discharged cases 2835 deaths amounting to 79251 confirmed cases as well as 1418 suspected cases5 a total of 658587 close-proximity interactions were tracked including 58233 close-proximity interactions under medical observation although china experienced sars in 2003 and h1n1 in 2009 the outbreak of covid-19 as a new infectious disease severely tested the countrys public health system in this context medical workers as the main force in the battle against the epidemic bear the monumental task unfortunately many front-line personnel have sacrificed their own well-being and have been infected or died which causes increasing psychological pressure according to the chinese center for disease control and prevention by 11 february over 3000 health care personnel in china were suspected to be infected with sars-cov-2 among them 1716 were confirmed cases and 5 had died6 previous studies have shown that during sudden natural disasters and infectious diseases nurses will sacrifice their own needs to actively participate in the anti-epidemic work and make selfless contributions out of moral and professional responsibility7 at the same time nurses would be in a state of physical and mental stress and feel isolated and helpless in the face of health threats and pressure from the high-intensity work caused by such public health emergencies8 previous studies have shown that when nurses are in close contact with patients with emerging infectious diseases such as sars9 mers-cov10

 due to the sudden outbreak of the epidemic nurses from the department of infectious diseases had to enter the negative pressure ward to care for the patients after only undergoing a brief training on covid-19 nurses from other departments were required to go through three training stages before starting nursing duties for patients with covid-19 pre-job training adaptive training by nursing other patients in the infection department and negative pressure ward training this process occupied about one week nurses who entered the negative pressure ward would work for 05  3 months before being transferred to other non-anti-epidemic positions because covid-19 is a new disease and the medical system and culture of different countries varies further research is needed on the psychological experience of frontline nurses fighting against covid-19 currently published studies have highlighted the disease prevalence17 clinical characteristics diagnosis and treatment2 some reports have paid attention to the severity of psychological problems in medical personnel18 and the urgency of providing psychological care19 however no qualitative studies have been published on the psychological experience of nurses therefore our study aims to understand the subjective experience of nurses participating in nursing covid-19 patients through semi-structured interviews and to analyse the data using phenomenological methods20 providing fundamental data for the psychological experience of nurses our research used the colaizzis phenomenological method to qualitatively analyse the psychological experience of nurses caring for patients with covid-19 colaizzis phenomenological method focuses on the experience and feelings of participants and finds shared patterns rather than individual characteristics in the research subjects this scientific approach guarantees the authenticity of the collected experience of participants to adhere to scientific standards by using a purposeful sampling method we selected 20 nurses caring for patients with covid-19 in the first affiliated hospital of henan university of science and technology from 20 january to 10 february 2020 the inclusion criteria included 1 nurses who entered the negative pressure ward and provided nursing care for confirmed covid-19 patients and 2 volunteers who participated in the study the exclusion criteria were inability to conduct two or more interviews during the study period we determined the number of required respondents by interviewing nurses who met the inclusion criteria until the data was saturated and no new topics were generated we determined the interview outline by consulting relevant literature seeking experts opinions and selecting two nurses for pre-interview the main interview questions posed to the participants are the following 1 what are the main psychological feelings of nursing care providers for covid-19 patients 2 what are your coping strategies and 3 what are your insights in the face of the epidemic in addition we asked the following sub-questions 1 how did you feel when accepting the anti-epidemic task 2 how do you feel when you are working with covid-19 patients 3 what has changed in your life 4 how do you cope with changes in your work and life 5 what are your thoughts and feelings about this anti-epidemic task we communicated the purpose and significance of the study with the participant in advance and scheduled the interview time at their convenience the interviewer possessed a master of science in nursing with experience in qualitative interview and had worked as a head nurse in the sars isolation ward and was experienced in epidemic prevention and control with 20 years of clinical nursing teaching and scientific research experience and 5 years of psychological consultation experience the researcher obtained a second level psychological consultant certificate the highest level in china issued by the ministry of human resources and social security of china therefore the researcher was able to carry out this research independently the one-to-one interviews were conducted in a separate room in a quiet manner without interruptions the interviews were recorded which were kept strictly confidential the interviews took 40  60 minutes per person if the participant exhibited emotional problems during the interview adequate psychological intervention was provided to prevent secondary psychological harm the study subjects were allowed to withdraw consent at any time the researchers remained neutral in collecting the data and established good relationships with the participants we used techniques such as unconditional acceptance active listening and clarification to promote the authenticity of the data and to avoid bias for each participant at least 1  2 face-to-face interviews and 1  2 telephone interviews were arranged as needed to ensure data collection at multiple time points within 24 hours of each interview the recording was transcribed and analysed by colaizzis phenomenological analysis method two researchers independently reviewed the interview materials summarized and extracted meaningful statements and formulated the themes present conflicting opinions on the contents of a theme were discussed and resolved by a research group composed of a master of nursing a doctor of nursing and two chief nurses this study was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the first affiliated hospital of henan university of science and technology ethics code 2020-03-b001 all participants signed informed consent the authors promise that there will be no academic misconduct such as plagiarism data fabrication falsification and repeated publication all study subjects experienced a significant amount of negative emotions in the first week especially in the period from the first pre-job training to the first time they entered the negative pressure ward as the number of patients continued to rise the workload of all nurses n  20 increased proportionally with 15  2 times normal work hours and workloads nurses were required to conserve protective clothing by reducing the number of times they wear it since protective equipment was in short supply resulting in fatigue and discomfort failing to meet physical and psychological needs brought a sense of helplessness all participants n  20 expressed their fears which peaked when they entered the negative pressure ward for the first time which then gradually declined similarly outsourced support nurses n  12 also experienced a strong sense of fear when they first entered the department of infectious diseases but gradually eased as their work adjusted most nurses n  11 expressed concerns about patients in an isolated environment with relatively few caregivers and many patients they were mainly concerned about the unknown conditions of the patients severe emergencies and the patients psychological state as with any emerging infectious disease work processes and nursing routines need to be explored while working most of the participants n  15 felt different levels of anxiety under the challenges of changes in working environment and team members 50 of nurses said they felt anxious most nurses in this study were between 25 and 40 years old some came from a single-child family and have elderly and children in their family all nurses expressed concern about the impact of the outbreak on the health of their families they also said that their families were also worried about their health those who did not live with their parents n  9 chose to hide the fact that they work in isolation ward from their parents after separation from their families they felt helpless and guilty the nurses n  4 with the elderly and children at home were particularly worried of their families all nurses n  20 activated psychological defence mechanisms such as speculation isolation depression distraction self-consciousness humour rationalization etc nurses used existing knowledge and new knowledge of psychological decompression communicated by colleagues or the internet to adjust themselves and actively or passively used psychological techniques such as writing diary and letters breathing relaxation mindfulness music meditation and emotional expression and venting most nurses n  14 chose to adjust their sleep when stressed by work some nurses will increase their food intake and some will exercise regularly and maintain physical strength to ensure normal work ability during times of stress nurses n  13 cared and helped each other and showed support for stress relief most nurses said that they felt the collective power and the team cohesion was stronger some nurses n  9 took the initiative to process information and use medical knowledge for analysis their attitudes were calm and rational nurses also took the initiative to compare situations find favourable information and encourage themselves all participants n  20 mentioned their gratitude for the support from colleagues relatives friends and all sectors of society they also realised the importance of health and family most nurses n  15 said that they would work and live with a state of appreciation and gratitude in the future more than 70 of the participants mentioned that professional responsibility prompted them to participate in the mission to contain the epidemic most nurses n  9 reviewed the value of the nursing profession and identified more with their chosen profession half of the nurses n  10 conveyed that although the epidemic prevention work was hard they started to self-reflect for example they strengthened their will discovered their potential and increased their courage to face life although most nurses had negative emotions such as fear anxiety and worry positive emotions appear synchronously or progressively after a week positive emotions prevailed in 70 of the nurses while fear and anxiety were brought on by the epidemic nurses also evaluated the epidemic prevention and control progress and felt confidence in the medical capability of the government and its subunits at the same time they felt confidence in self-prevention and control ability after training and practice all nurses actively accepted anti-epidemic tasks and most n  11 volunteered most nurses n  16 showed calmness when receiving these tasks although as mentioned earlier there were negative emotions such as fear and anxiety in the early stages these subsided after the pre-job training and environmental adaptation most nurses n  14 said that after entering the negative pressure ward to care for patients they felt calm and relaxed despite difficult conditions and challenges in the fight against the disease 60 of the nurses reported feeling happy firstly the nurses felt the patients goodwill respect active cooperation and gratitude secondly family and team support brought happiness contact with family was a key factor in our study in addition the hospital has a reward and welfare system in place to support and motivate nurses the encouragement of colleagues also brought happiness to nurses other forms of social support were important to the nurses feeling of appreciation most existing qualitative studies are retrospective studies in contrast this study established a good relationship of consultation and visit with the participants in an early stage when the participants just accepted the anti-epidemic tasks we collected the psychological experience data of the participants over time through multiple interviews this led to a deep understanding of their work experience resulting in comprehensive and authentic data diverging from the results of many studies on the experience of negative emotions during outbreak stress we found that positive emotions coexist with negative emotions as well as psychological adjustment and growth under pressure and preliminarily discussed its impact on nurses mental health due to the characteristics of qualitative research the sample size of this study was limited firstly most of the participants were nurses including three nursing managers the experiences of other health care workers and administrators besides nurses need to be further explored secondly due to the nature of outbreak prevention and control we were unable to conduct focus group interviews and did not collect data from multiple centres in order to avoid potential cross-infection in addition this study was a short-term study long-term experience of the research subjects would be a valuable avenue to explore in the future this study provided a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the psychological experience of caregivers of patients with covid-19 through a phenomenological approach we found that during the epidemic positive and negative emotions of frontline nurses against the epidemic interweave and coexist in the early days negative emotions were dominant and positive emotions appeared simultaneously or gradually self-coping style and psychological growth are important for nurses to maintain mental health this study provided fundamental data for further psychological intervention  preparing for the perpetual challenges of pandemics of coronavirus infections with special focus on

 it is a non-pharmaceutical infection prevention and control intervention to avoid or control contact between infectious and uninfected individuals to rein the disease transmission in a community eventually culminating into decreased infection spread morbidity and mortality the individuals infected with cov-2 shed the virus from their respiratory tract during the early infection stage when there are minor clinical manifestations leading to the extensive community transmission while practicing social distancing each healthy individual behaves like an infected individual self-restricting contact with others the main advantage is gleaned when an individual in incubation periodearly infectious stage of covid-19 restricts coming in contact with other healthy individuals this strategy involves the policymakers and strict advisoriesorders are issued under the pandemic action plan to restrict public gatherings and events shutting down of educational institutesofficesrestaurants avoiding nonessential travel and use of public transport maintaining a distance of 1 m at least between two individuals restricting visit to hospitals and avoiding online shopping additionally the

virus nucleic acid from pharyngeal swab samples the asymptomatic cases did not present any obvious symptoms while nucleic acid screening about 208 developed classical symptoms of fever cough and fatigue during hospitalization 500 presented ct images of ground-glass chest and 208 presented stripe shadowing in the lungs 292 cases presented normal ct image and had no symptoms during hospitalization comprising the younger subset median age 140 years none developed severe covid-19 pneumonia and no mortality was observed however epidemiological investigation indicated at typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members which even caused severe covid-19 pneumonia this study puts a spotlight on close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests case isolation and continuous nucleic acid tests are also recommended hu et al 2020 de-isolating of suspect cases where the first confirmatory test has returned negative is also an emerging issue of concern and needs improvement in testing capacity as well as strict implementation of social distancing during pandemic scenarios tay et al 2020 approaching january 13 2020 the daily

of sciences used daily incidence data of covid-19 outbreak from china from december 8 2019 to february 15 2020 as well as airline network data to predict the number of exported cases with and without measures of travel restriction and screening the group put forth that the lockdown of wuhan and 15 more cities in hubei province on january 2324 2020 averted export of 779 more covid-19 cases by mid-february however it is to be highlighted that these travel restrictions and lockdown measures only slowed the rate of infection exportation from china to other countries the global spread of covid-19 was based on most cases arriving during the asymptomatic incubation period the authors recommend rapid contact tracing at the epicenter and at importation sites to limit human-to-human

 we first examined the annual consumption of ckrt fluids and estimated the current usage in the 8 publicly-funded acute care hospitals in singapore based on routine rates and a total capacity of 9404 hospital beds 5 we factored in another 586 acute-care beds in the national centre for infectious diseases which attends to the majority of hospitalized covid-19 cases in singapore we projected incident covid-19 cases per week based on current epidemiology 6 and inferred a corresponding ckrt incidence of 11 with an average 6 days of ckrt 7 this allowed us to estimate the assets and consumables for standard ckrt support and to predict the critical threshold of incident covid-19 cases beyond which the ckrt capacity would be exceeded table1
 we have diversified our sources of ckrt machines from multiple vendors to ensure a continuity of supply in singapore these include the prismaflex baxter lund sweden multifiltrate fresenius medical care fmc homburg germany omni bbraun melsungen germany aquarius nikkiso langenhagen germany and hf440 infomed geneva switzerland oversight of national demand is maintained to avoid disproportionate hoarding with respect to service load among institutions different types of ckrt machines utilize different protocols and fluids for rca these include the 05 citrate solution diluted citrate concentration of 18 mmoll paired with an isonatremic calcium-free low bicarbonate solution 8 and 4 trisodium citrate concentrated citrate of 136 mmoll paired with a low sodium low bicarbonate and calcium-free solution 9 in the event that the fluids for either rca regimens become depleted an alternative in the form of anticoagulant-citrate-dextrose-a acda solution containing 75 mmoll of citrate and 38 mmoll of citric acid is available 10 in our experience acda at low volume is circuit-compatible with conventional isonatremic solution the latter runs as a post-filter replacement if it contains calcium prescribers need to draft new protocols on alternative rca regimens and initiate immediate clinical training in preparation for use of new machines most machines allow common connector compatibility and cross-usage of fluids from various vendors without special adaptors but there are exceptions in that certain machine types require specific fluids limiting flexibility conventional ckrt fluids are mostly used in non-rca circuits and contain physiological concentrations of electrolytes including sodium 140 meql chloride 109 meql calcium 3 meql magnesium 1 meql and bicarbonate 35 meql 11 some fluids include low quantities of organic anions such as lactate ckrt fluids contain potassium at either 0 2 or 4 meql interchangeable conventional fluids should be actively sourced to maintain supply and connector compatibility to available machines it is best to keep a consistent practice with regard to fluid potassium content to avoid its misadministration attention should be given to the glucose content because it affects caloric calculation and nutritional management during ckrt 12 pharmacy-compounded ckrt fluids reduce the dependency on commercially available options but intensive safety checks are essential 13

14 ckrt filters and lines may be specific for certain machine types based on unique connectors this restricts their diversification most current filter membranes are synthetic and high-flux prismaflex utilizes a filter made from a copolymer membrane of acrylonitrile and sodium methallylsulfonate an69 that is conjoined with lines fmc and nikkiso machines incorporate filter membranes made from polysulfone the filters come separate from the lines making the connection less restrictive but the priming time may be longer filter membrane surface areas range from 09 to 19 m2 for adult ckrt and institutions must work with the vendors to ensure a supply of filter sizes that correspond to the commonest range of body weight encountered in their practice certain filter membranes putatively aid immunoadsorption of cytokines 15

16 it is unknown if these would be beneficial in covid-19 patients and their use should be reserved for specific indications or clinical trials administrative oversight is vital to ensure adequate diversified stocks of both tunneled and non-tunneled vascular catheters for krt as well as catheter sizes appropriate for various venous sites different catheter guidewire rigidity or dilatation techniques may affect the end-user competency in catheterization experienced proceduralists should be tasked with handling new catheter types so as to allow trainee operators to use catheters that they are familiar with a common procurement process for icus and dialysis centers within the same institution would avoid duplication of efforts and excessive demand to ensure service sustainability all domains of ckrt practice must be reviewed to ensure that adequate but rational care is delivered to current patients with minimal compromise in service box 2 vascular access is an important determinant for delivery of efficient ckrt a good access minimizes complications during insertion limits the risk of catheter-related infections and thrombosis and provides adequate uninterrupted blood flow for ckrt clinicians should optimize each vascular access to conserve resources but remain mindful of unexplained leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers that suggest catheter-related infection given that ckrt may mask fever 17 it is prudent to ensure at least 7 days of use per non-tunneled vascular catheter within which period the catheter colonization or infection rate is low 18

19 systematic vascular catheter change in absence of complications is best avoided as there is no clear threshold duration beyond which the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infection increases significantly in the icu 18 choosing the most appropriate catheter site and size upfront minimizes downstream catheter dysfunction and interrupted ckrt especially in covid-19 patients on prone ventilation for extended hours daily femoral venous access does not necessarily worsen the risk of malfunction during prone ventilation as compared with internal jugular venous access 20 but the latter would be easier to monitor for bleeding or dislodgement evidence of fibrinolytic therapy with alteplase or urokinase for catheter malfunction is extrapolated from maintenance hemodialysis and tunneled catheter studies 21 while safety and efficacy is unclear in the context of ckrt fibrinolytic therapy may provide rapid salvage of dysfunctional catheters is non-invasive and arguably leads to fewer vascular complications and lesser use of consumables than new catheterization extended femoral venous catheterization for ckrt and guidewire exchange of dysfunctional vascular catheters over an optimal sterile field can be performed with very low colonization or infection risk 19 this helps conserve central venous sites which is important because krt may continue for weeks in aki survivors 22 additionally ckrt circuits may be combined in parallel with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients 23 for patients without covid-19 who could be readily transferred for fluoroscopy an initial tunneled vascular catheter over traditional non-tunneled-first approach is feasible and more efficacious for krt 24 this helps conserve non-tunneled catheter stocks for covid-19 patients existing arteriovenous access may be used for ckrt in patients with kidney failure vigilance is advised for needle dislodgement extravasation and access hematoma 25 measures to improve efficiency of ckrt fluid usage could potentially save 30 of cumulative consumption and help counter-balance the increase in demand table 1 and fig 2
 the accepted intensity of ckrt is 25 mlkgh for most aki patients in the icu 26 this is subject to individual variations due to illness severity catabolism and acid-base and electrolyte derangements there is a general consensus to prescribe approximately 30 mlkgh to achieve the desired ckrt dose in view of circuit downtime 27 a higher initial ckrt intensity may be associated with greater improvements in patients hemodynamics and vasopressor requirements 28 concerns about the ckrt fluid supply however should prompt clinicians if not required by severe hyperkalemia or acidosis to order relatively lower dialysate andor replacement fluid rates initially and up-titrate to achieve the desired intensity rather than the reverse furthermore the net ultrafiltration augments the effluent rate which determines the clearance as ckrt progresses over days and the patients kidney function improves adequate clearance could be maintained at a ckrt intensity under 20 mlkgh 29 replacement fluid rate could also be reduced in tandem with increased ultrafiltration rate to maintain a constant effluent dose antibiotic and antiviral drug dosing need to be correspondingly adjusted with the changes in intrinsic kidney function and krt dose to optimize the antimicrobial efficacy with adequate drug clearance individualized treatment goals and frequent reviews of the prescription could further reduce unnecessary fluid consumption anticoagulation-free ckrt allows 1216 hours of filter-life on average 30

31 in conditions of shortage this represents dangerously excessive use of filters particularly given that dedicated filters are often needed for each machine type the currency of contraindications to circuit anticoagulation must be actively reviewed and the longevity of filter targeted to a minimum of 2 days in singapore most icus adopted the rca protocol that uses 05 citrate solution which also serves as a replacement fluid contributing to at least half of the ckrt intensity and buffering capacity with conventional blood flow settings and a citrate dose of 30 to 35 mmol per liter of blood citrate consumption exceeds 15 lh the paired bicarbonate-based solution that contains potassium and magnesium is often maintained in proportion to the former for biochemical equilibrium the resulting ckrt intensity usually exceeds 30 mlkgh to avert citrate accumulation reducing the blood flow towards 100 mlmin attains a more favorable citrate dose over total citrate delivery and reduces the metabolic burden but a diffusive based therapy is preferred to avoid a high filtration fraction fig 2 in non-covid-19 patients citrate dose may even be lowered to 25 mmoll which is non-inferior to higher citrate dosing for an optimal filter life in general 32 in addition we suggest a balance between rca and heparinization to allow proportionate consumption of both importantly premature filter clotting is commonly observed in covid-19 patients 33 this is postulated to be in part due to a hypercoagulable state and systemic anticoagulation is frequently necessary to prolong filter life and manage thromboembolic complications 34

35 monitoring anti-xa activity is suggested during treatment with unfractionated heparin due to the numerous interactions with inflammatory proteins that interfere with activated partial-thromboplastin time prolongation 36 a combined anticoagulation strategy with rca-ckrt deployed concurrently to heparinized extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been described in critically ill patients with good filter life and no increased bleeding events 37 non-anticoagulation measures such as a predominant diffusive-based ckrt versus convective clearance would reduce circuit failures 38 the optimal blood flow for circuit patency is unclear 39 but needs to be adjusted for an appropriate filtration fraction in hemofiltration purchasing ckrt machines is limited by supplier inventory and the substantial cost the continuous nature of ckrt implies a ratio of one patient to one machine which becomes unsustainable as demand surges it may be possible to treat 2 patients per machine within a 24-hour period by compressing the run of krt to 1012 hours at correspondingly higher clearance to compensate for efficacy 40

41 this accelerated krt could be run as hemodiafiltration to optimize both dialysate and replacement fluid pumps and to accommodate the doubled fluid consumption rate admittedly such therapy would consume at least one filter per patient-treatment moreover the higher ultrafiltration rate could induce hemodynamic instability although the strategy saves on the nursing hours and machines avoids prolonged circuit anticoagulation and reduces cumulative heparin consumption it does not save on effort filters and fluids antimicrobial administration would need to be staggered to be delivered post treatment and the dose moderated with transition from ckrt therapy may even be staggered according to pre-determined treatment goals as not all patients would require an augmented solute clearance even if the duration is shortened and krt could be terminated once targets are reached such as the case for targeted correction of hyperkalemia and acidosis in patients with kidney failure ultrafiltration could be geared towards a projected negative balance required for the day and achieved in the initial hours of therapy this approach can be adopted in patients with relatively improved stability lower vasoactive drug requirements and less complex metabolic derangements clinicians could allow an earlier transition to intermittent hemodialysis using online generated dialysate but the latter will also be subject to resource constraints including water supply drainage and reverse osmosis machines the nursing requirement with intermittent hemodialysis is less compared with that of ckrt table1 in selected patients with aki peritoneal dialysis pd may be advantageous over extracorporeal krt 42 similar mortality has been reported in both 43 technical simplicity minimal infrastructural requirements lack of requirement for anticoagulation and less nursing time make pd especially attractive in pandemics flexible pd catheters are preferred over rigid catheters due to a higher risk of complications and peritonitis associated with the latter and the high dialysate flow rates achieved with the former 44 high primary success rate and efficient use of resources are reported in tunneled tenckhoff catheter insertions by trained nephrologists using the seldinger technique bowel injury and early peri-catheter leak are recognized complications but uncommon 45 fluoroscopy mini-laparotomy or laparoscopic catheter insertion occurs in routine practice but would be challenging in covid-19 manual pd exchange remains an option but pd is best delivered using an automated cycler to optimize staff time and usage of personal protective equipment icodextrin dwell during prone ventilation alternating with cycler usage when supine may meet fluid removal and clearance targets whilst overcoming drainage issues and alarms while recognizing the difficulties in clearance measurement in the context of a pandemic titration to best possible solute and volume balance is essential weekly ktvurea of 35 which matches the dose of daily hemodialysis is recommended 46 with a dialysate to plasma urea ratio of 06 in one hour 47

48 3040 l of daily pd exchange volume may be required in a 70 kg patient in some patients weekly ktvurea of 21 may be acceptable 46

49 non-pd trained aides or volunteers could also be trained specially to deliver manual pd exchanges in service exigencies 50

51 a ckrt program cannot be implemented without the integral contribution of nurses projections of staffing needs in tandem with increasing ckrt demand is detailed in table1 and the training needs to start pre-emptively nursing staff have to monitor circuit dynamics titrate volume management ensure metabolic stability during rca and perform infection control 52 the complexity increases with diversification of machines platforms filters fluids and rca protocols a close collaboration between critical care and nephrology nursing is highly desirable it may be more efficient to have a core group of nursing supervisors to oversee machine assignments perform the initial setup and train a larger pool of bedside nurses to monitor ongoing ckrt involvement of the lead nurses along with physicians in drafting new protocols would provide concurrent education to rapidly increase everyones domain knowledge if physicians and nurses from departments other than the icu and nephrology will be needed particular care should be given to developing easily accessible and simplified protocols as well as audiovisual learning aides that are accessible in the icu or hospital intranet many large hospitals run several icus and ckrt machines are often forward-allocated to individual icus for routine deployments in the context of a pandemic demands may become unpredictable and there is a need for responsive allocation and re-distribution of machines to areas experiencing a surge in patient load it is vital to share information across institutions regarding patient-level ckrt needs as well to understand the supply chain that vendors employ so as to pre-empt threats to resource availability at the national and regional level a centralized machine and patient census would help administrators coordinate track and optimize utilization to minimize therapy downtime due to technical issues pre-emptive machine maintenance is necessary despite the movement restrictions in force the usage of consumables and resupply should be tracked weekly to allow a greater lead time to respond to any supply chain disruptions it is imperative that critical care and nephrology teams work together to address shortfalls in life-saving medical treatments exposed by the pandemic ckrt provision is only a part of the end-to-end management of patients with critical illness and kidney diseases upstream management to optimize volume balance and lung-protective ventilation may help moderate aki severity in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and prevent deterioration to the point that krt is required many survivors of krt-requiring aki develop chronic kidney disease 53

  covid-19 through the lens of gerontology david le couteur g rozalyn anderson m anne newman b   the case-fatality rate for covid-19 increases dramatically with age from 3 to 5 between 65 and 74 years 4 to 11 between 75 and 84 years and 10 to 27 above 85 years and people aged 65 years and older account for 45 of hospitalizations 53 of intensive care unit icu admissions and 80 of deaths 1 the first infections with the coronavirus sars-cov-2 were recognized in december 2019 in wuhan china and since then over 80000 people in china contracted covid-19 with more than 3000 deaths 2 the united states has seen an exponential increase in the number of cases with the vast majority of deaths also occurring in people aged 65 years or older older people in residential aged care facilities and nursing homes have even greater risk of death given their age and comorbidities confounded by the lack of capacity for social distancing from staff and other residents it must be a difficult and frightening time for many older people indeed for all of us young and old there is a widespread perception in the community that the impact of covid-19 is confined only to older people with underlying illnesses this is not correctsevere infection and significant mortality occur across the life coursealthough the risks for older people are very high however we need to be cautious about the narrative linking this pandemic to older people the reframing aging initiative 2 is particularly relevant for understanding the importance of inclusive language when communicating about covid-19 the dichotomization of covid-19 patients by age has been painfully apparent when decisions are being made about who should be prioritized for ventilation when icu beds and ventilators are limited the field of gerontology has long advocated for alternatives to chronological age to personalize prognosis and treatment choice in italy where the health care system has been overwhelmed by covid-19 this has mostly come down to decisions based on age with a cutoff age as young as 65 years in some regions 3 the united kingdom has promoted using frailty assessed using a 9-point pictorial scale to allocate critical care interventions 4 similar decisions will soon face doctors in the united states 5 a survey of lay people about who to prioritize for icu admission in the setting of a viral pandemic found that the most favored response was that the decision should be made by a senior doctor 6 adding a huge burden to doctors working in an overstretched acute hospital system icu admission and ventilation may be futile in some frail older people with multimorbidity however there is a very big ethical difference between decisions made on the basis of futility versus those based on rationing 7 withholding and rationing potentially life-saving ventilation just on the basis of age is not acceptable arguments have been made that potential years of life lost should be considered if care is rationed yet perhaps more critical to consider is the experience and wisdom of older adults a case in point is dr anthony fauci director of the national institute of allergy and infectious disease in the united states his experience with previous epidemics is priceless to us now therefore it is important that now more than ever our communities advocate for our older people and listen to their advice apart from the threat of a severe and often fatal viral infection the covid-19 pandemic is influencing people of all ages through a wide range of downstream societal consequences many countries have introduced socialphysical distancing and self-isolation in an attempt to reduce the numbers of people infected and to slow the rate of infection although this will reduce the spread of the virus these interventions exacerbate the social isolation of many people and emphasize the importance of maintaining interactions across our communities the prioritization of health care for covid 19 means fewer resources will be available for other medical problems 8 and the financial impact of covid-19 is widespread we note that in the rush to publish covid-19 papers concerns have been raised that the same patients have been reported in different publications with the risk of misleading the medical community 9 while making every effort to prevent this issue the journals of gerontology series a biological sciences and medical sciences will fast track any appropriate manuscripts about covid-19 to stimulate advances in the prevention treatment and management of covid-19 and how to address the social and economic consequences of this virus we will publish them free to view in this way our journal can contribute to the international effort to overcome this pandemic  acrylic window as physical barrier for personal protective equipment ppe conservation connie gan cr tseng yu-chi kuan-i lee   as covid-19 cases increase the global supply of personal protective equipment ppe is becoming insufficient particularly for medical masks and respirators followed closely by gowns and googles the world health organization who released in february 2020 an interim guidance 1 on the rational use of ppe for coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 the guidance state that to minimize the need for ppe who recommends the use of physical barriers to reduce exposure to the covid-19 virus such as glass or plastic windows we therefore would like to present the one set-up barrier which can be transformed in a hospital area where patients will present first such as triage areas the registration desk at the emergency department or at the pharmacy window where medication is collected the construction of this barrier ensures that the hospital will be able to conserve their supply of ppes the constructed barrier is made of an acrylic window designed to separate the clinician and the patient it also features two fixed gloves through which the clinician can place both hands and be able to collect throat or nasopharyngeal swabs the full diagram of the barrier is provided in fig 1
 according to the who guideline on infection prevention and control 2 the hospital should perform standard contact and airborne precautions during the collection of respiratory specimens from patients with severe symptoms suggestive of pneumonia this also includes placement of patient in a single room with negative pressure air handling if available and clinicians use of ppe including respirator n95 or ffp2 standard long-sleeved fluid-resistant gown gloves and eye protection if a negative pressure room is not accessible we need to place the patient in a single confined room the isolation device is the design of tseng yu-chi and tseng kai-chen the design shows that a negative pressure room is not required but it needs to ensure that air does not circulate to other areas the whole specimen collection process involves two persons 1 clinician a performs the swabbing fig 2
 and 2 clinician b donned in standard ppe is located outside the exam room to check on the fixed gloves regularly and delivers the specimen to a designated location for further examination all surfaces that are possibly contaminated especially the examination area including the fixed gloves will then be wiped with disinfectant with the use of this barrier the use of ppe for clinician a will be significantly reduced a standard ppe for clinician a includes a long-sleeved fluid-resistant gown gloves disposal face shield n95 respirator hair caps and shoe covers the barrier ensures that ppes are preserved and can be used several times as ppe supplies might not be able to keep up with the surge of covid-19 patients 3 and witnessing hospitals around the world struggle with the use of their daily allotments with some even rationing their ppe to units or departments implementing and constructing this cost-effective approach can assist healthcare facilities in reducing their use of ppes and not be burdened with a possible shortage in the future  efficacy and safety of withholding antimicrobial treatment in children with cancer fever and neutropenia with a demonstrated viral

with cancer have been bacterial and fungal pathogens viral infections particularly respiratory viruses have been increasingly recognized as significant aetiological agents of fn in this population 6 7 respiratory viral infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompetent children 8 9 in paediatric patients with cancer respiratory viruses can be detected in up to 57 of episodes of fn 6 7 10 11 12 13 14 15 in a previous study we determined the frequency and clinical outcome of respiratory virus-positive fn episodes 6 respiratory viruses were the most common agents detected and clinical outcomes of these episodes were significantly better than episodes with single bacterial infections or viralbacterial co-infections children with respiratory viral infections had fewer days of hospitalization a lower probability of haemodynamic instability and lower rates of admission to the paediatric intensive care unit picu 6 for children with fn most research efforts have focused on management of bacterial and fungal infections mainly in proposing models of risk prediction for invasive bacterial and fungal infections 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 improvements in the molecular diagnosis of infections 24 25 and selective antimicrobial management in children with high-risk and low-risk fn episodes 18 26 in contrast with the increase in studies of bacterial and fungal infections in this population studies of viral infections are scarce and have been recognized as a research gap in the field 1 a rational approach towards the management of a potential infection in children with cancer and fn requires a comprehensive analysis of all microbiological agents involved implementation of a systematic study and early detection of respiratory viral infection in children with cancer and fn might help to optimize their management by reducing hospitalization and antimicrobial use in this study we aim to determine the efficacy and safety of withholding antimicrobial treatment 48 h after admission in children with cancer and fn with a demonstrated respiratory viral infection and a favourable clinical course from july 2012 to december 2015

 overall the most common respiratory virus was rhinovirus 41 followed by rsv parainfluenza virus and influenza virus with no differences observed between groups these four viruses represented 88 of the identified respiratory viruses in both groups we detected 23 and 22 cases of viral co-infection in each group in 4345 cases 96 viral co-infection included two respiratory viruses three of the four children requiring antimicrobial re-instalment had rsv and one of them had a rhinovirus the child that developed a klebsiella pneumoniae sepsis had a positive parainfluenza virus detection respiratory viruses were detected as sole pathogens in one-third of children with cancer admitted because of a febrile neutropenic episode of which almost half met study criteria for favourable evolution at 48 h allowing their randomization overall 95 of the episodes in which antimicrobials were withdrawn had an uneventful resolution we previously demonstrated that it was possible to apply selective management proposing ambulatory therapy in children with low-risk fn defined according to the following parameters type of cancer haemodynamic stability crp values platelet count and number of days since the last chemotherapy 26 in this study we advance a step further including the possibility of stopping antimicrobial therapy 48 h after admission in children with a positive respiratory viral infection a negative bacterial infection and a favourable clinical course including episodes with low and high risk for invasive bacterial infection knowledge on the epidemiology of respiratory viral infection in immunocompromised children is scarce with few systematic studies aimed to determine their clinical impact 6 rsv influenza virus parainfluenza virus adenovirus and picornaviruses have been the most common aetiological agents detected in this population 6 7 12 the increasing detection of viruses highlights the relevance of optimizing viral diagnosis in children with fn 1 children with cancer and high-risk fn require immediate hospitalization and aggressive intravenous antimicrobial treatment we observed an uneventful resolution in 96 of all randomized fn episodes despite the fact that 50 of them were classified as high risk at admission considering these data systematic evaluation for respiratory viruses at the time of hospital admission could be helpful to establish a more rational treatment in a selected group of patients miedema et al
18 recently reported that it is safe to shorten antimicrobial treatment to 72 h in selected medium-risk children with fn antimicrobials were stopped in 50 episodes and no failures were observed however no high-risk episodes were included in this study approximately 79 of episodes of fn do not present a serious bacterial infection 28 therefore a more extensive assessment with multiplex blood and respiratory pcr assays could increase pathogen detection 6 24 29 facilitating a tailor-made therapy and reducing unnecessary antimicrobial exposure 3 this study had limitations including that the intervention was not double blind we decided not to conduct a double-blind study because the majority of these children received antimicrobial therapy using their central venous catheter we preferred not to use the central venous catheter in children with antimicrobials withheld to avoid unnecessary manipulations another possible issue is that not all children randomized in this cohort with respiratory virus detection presented an upper or lower respiratory tract infection at the time of admission although positive pcr detection is not always necessarily related with respiratory disease 30 the majority of children in this study 75 presented respiratory symptoms suggesting a role for the respiratory viruses detected by pcr in conclusion we suggest incorporating molecular respiratory viral study in the initial evaluation of all children with cancer and episodes of fn the reduction of antimicrobial use in children with fn with a demonstrated respiratory viral infection based on stringent clinical and microbiological molecular diagnostic criteria could favour the adoption of evidence-based and more rational management strategies in this population this work was supported by the national fund for scientific and technological development fondecyt chile grants numbers 1120800 1130911  covid medication comet study protocol for a cohort study roos sablerolles s freija hogenhuis e melvin lafeber bob van de loo p sander borgsteede d eric boersma jorie versmissen hugo van der kuy m jacomien aleman fiona nagele gunar stemer jos tournoy lorenz van derlinden irena krusteva zohreh safipour anne bengaard kathrine morten houlind baltzer nathalie kerjean pons jennifer grand le carito zenico silvia berlinghini francesca caruso manola peverini fabio pieraccini katia bini marco candela marco dicarlo roberto grinta fausto salaffi anna schimizzi maria marika tardella federica verri roberto tessari francesca marchesini paola chessa marco gambera isabella martignoni giovanna rametta francesco pappalardo lucia rossi laura fantini elisa maria giorgia gambarelli sivlia berlinghini gabriella martini simone pagliarino elena loche laura agnoletto manola peverini gloria boni margarida falcao helena farinha dina mendes joao rijo ines carmo fatima falcao joana soares mariana solano erica viegas marta miarons maria queraltgorgas cristina yubero garca laura horcajada portillo kim keijzers silke lim ingrid van haelst louise andrews ferdi sombogaard roland van den berg firdaouss boutkourt marleen kemper elise slob erikvan kan annemiek helmers otten margreet filius wietske hemminga caroline ghazarian doranne hilarius mariette kappers ronald van etten hein van onzenoort peter van wijngaarden jeroen diepstraten eveline roelofsen edm meuwese roobol peter wierenga ingrid de graaf hoogendoorn judith verdonk marieke ebbens linda hendriksen paul van der linden kristel crommentuijn hugo de wit kaylen guda suzanne van dijk tessa bosch lisanne krens monique slijfer kim hurkens dennis wong debbie deben marieke ezinga kees van nieuwkoop loes visser ebbie boemaars barbara maat luc derijks paddy janssen arjan bulsink peter ter horst glenda fleming nicola goodfellow michael scott helen bell joanne hanley francine de stoppelaar   understanding the pathophysiology of the covid-19 pandemic is key to develop strategies for both prevention and treatment to improve clinical outcomes it is known from the previous outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov that cell invasion is accomplished by binding of a viral spike protein to ace21 recent reports show that this is the same for sars-cov-22 3 this binding leads to ace2 downregulation which may contribute to lung injury since less ace2 is available for potential protective effects as shown in acute respiratory distress syndrome ards4
 aces are regulatory proteins in both blood pressure and inflammation ace1 the key enzyme in the reninangiotensin aldosterone system raas converts angiotensin i to angiotensin ii which by binding to the angiotensin ii receptor type 1 leads to vasoconstriction resulting in a rise of blood pressure fibrotic and proliferativeinflammatory effects ace1 is targeted for reducing blood pressure by ace inhibitors angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs lead to similar effects by blocking the effects of angiotensin ii ace2 degrades angiotensin i to angiotensin-1-9 and angiotensin ii to angiotensin-1-74 this pathway involving the mas receptor is thought to be counteracting the effects of angiotensin ii and is associated with protective effects for heart lungs and kidneys5 however studies targeting this pathway have not led to beneficial effects in cardiovascular and renal diseases including hypertension6 7 in addition to its role in raas modulation ace2 is also involved in degrading several other substrates such as apelin bradykinin and opioids recently involvement in degrading bradykinin has also been suggested as playing a causal role in the development of severe ards since downregulation of ace2 as a consequence of virus binding may enhance the proinflammatory bradykinin receptor leading to local vascular leakage8
 the fact that patients with previous cardiovascular disease cvd hypertension and diabetes have an increased mortality risk due to sars-cov-2-induced infection could be explained by the common factor of use of ace inhibitors or arbs9 10 this was suggested by several authors and also reached the mainstream media including cnn11 12 however well-designed studies on the effects of ace inhibitors arbs and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on ace2 expression are scarce show conflicting results and have not been conducted in humans6 1315 this has led to statements from several societies including the european society of cardiology and the european society of hypertension emphasising the lack of evidence and the importance of not withdrawing ace inhibitors and arbs considering their major role in blood pressure lowering nephroprotection and cardiac protection5 in reply to these first rumours other authors including versmissen et al argued that raas inhibition might even be beneficial once infected1618 other authors suggested that arbs might be beneficial while ace inhibitors might not19
 based on these theoretical grounds intervention studies either starting or discontinuing ace inhibitors or arbs are currently recruiting patients with covid-19 clinicaltrialsgov however observational data in humans are urgently needed to address the real effect of medication and the clinical course of covid-19 before starting potentially harmful interventions based on only theoretical and conflicting evidence from animal studies therefore the comet study aims to evaluate the relationship between use of certain drugs starting with ace inhibitors and arbs on clinical outcomes of patients with covid-19 the main objective is to describe the correlation between use of ace inhibitors or arbs and clinical outcome defined by admission to the hospital duration of stay intensive care unit icu admission and survival in patients with confirmed covid-19 secondary aims are to address the effect of other drugs such as immunomodulatory agents including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids to allow urgent analysis data entry will be undertaken in two phases for quick data entry the number of collected parameters will be minimised and with a special focus on medication the following subject parameters will be collected for all patients year of birth sex international classification of primary careinternational classification of diseases 10th revision medical history

smoking history clinical frailty score20 logistic course presentation at edtransmission fromto another hospital clinical course no admissionadmission to hospital 48 hours48 hours no icu admission icu and survival if easily accessible laboratory data at presentation will also be entered in the second phase additional parameters may be included such as more specific clinical outcomes such as pulmonary embolism or more extensive laboratory parameters since the medical history may be incomplete at the ed as recorded by the collaborating researchers medication data will be used to confirm cvd diabetes heart failure and hypertension or to correct when medical history appears to be incomplete cvd including coronary artery disease cerebrovascular disease and peripheral arterial occlusive disease will be considered present when entered as items in the medical history and when a patient is using antiplatelet therapy to prevent bias of misdiagnosed cvd especially in the case of angina diabetes will be considered present when antidiabetic medication is used even in the absence of a note in the medical file to prevent bias of undiagnosed diabetes hypertension will be considered present when entered as an item in the medical history and antihypertensive medication is used or when a patient is using one or more antihypertensive drugs without other indication heart failure will be considered present when entered as an item in the medical history or when a patient is using an ace inhibitor or arb a beta blocker and a loop diuretic in the absence of severe renal insufficiency clinical outcome will be assessed during 2 weeks after the date of covid-19 diagnosis and scored as no hospital admission hospital admission 48 hours hospital admission 48 hours without icu hospital admission 48 hours with icu in addition survival data will be collected the relation between ace inhibitorsarbs and clinical outcomes will first be assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses adjustments will be made for the following potential confounding factors sex age and presence of cvd diabetes and hypertension a doseresponse analysis will be performed to support a causal relationship since only patients visiting the ed will be included they might not be representative for the larger population not visiting the hospital therefore the aim is to compare the use of ace inhibitorsarbs in the dutch patients with the general dutch population of similar age age group of 10 years stichting farmaceutische kengetallen foundation pharmaceutical key numbers in addition use of other blood pressure-lowering agents and other drug classes such as lipid-lowering drugs will be compared between patients with most severe outcomes and no hospital admission or a short stay 48 hours the medical ethical committee of erasmus mc and brabant concluded this research does not fall under the scope of the medical research involving human subjects act non-wmo because of its retrospective nature and full anonymisation investigators from each hospital will fill in anonymised data sex and birth year and all will sign a data transfer agreement each patient will be assigned a study number known only by the investigator who will keep a coding list in the own hospital each hospital can only see their own patients in the system data will be collected in a database digitalisnl on an external server and then stored using open clinica all data will be treated according to the privacy regulations applicable for europe and the erasmus mc privacy regulations collected data will be secured against unauthorised access and will be stored and secured by the department of hospital pharmacy no data that can identify a patient will be processed on this database to protect and respect the privacy of all patients the main research team including the principal investigator can see all anonymised data the main article will be submitted to a general medicine journal follow-up articles focusing more deeply on certain drug classes might be submitted to pharmacological journals or journals in the specific area of disease for instance cardiovascular currently clinical trials targeting ace2 raas and the bradykinin pathway are initiated while the evidence that this might be beneficial is still weak the results of this study may contribute to more rational choices for randomised controlled trials in addition when any negative effect of use of ace inhibitors or arbs is identified changing medication might be an easy intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality from covid-19 for instance ace inhibitors and arbs are used by over 10 of the dutch population gipdatabanknl almost half of these users are aged above 70 years the most serious limitation of this study is the selection bias especially when ed registration of unhospitalised patients is incomplete however for comparing ace inhibitors and arbs the indications are similar preventing a bias by indication in addition other antihypertensive drugs and lipid-lowering drugs will be analysed due to the urgency of need of this data time to enter clinical data will be limited potentially leading to incomplete data especially the medical history however by using detailed medication data this can largely correct for incomplete medical history data  a bioethical perspective for navigating moral dilemmas amidst the covid-19 pandemic alexandra dunham m travis rieder n casey humbyrd j   in a global pandemic we are challenged to apply a different set of rules to healthcare delivery as we work to manage the evolving complex dilemmas in care table 1 these rules have a different focus than our daily clinical ethics which tends to focus on what each clinician is called to do for each patient prioritizing nonmaleficence autonomy of both patient and clinician and prominently features shared decision-making7 public health ethics asks what we as a system institution or hospital are called to do to serve the needs of the many the goal of public health ethics is to serve many rather than the individual patient in front of you and stewardship of resources is key yet there is also a tension in public health ethics if we only focus on saving as many lives as possible eg rationing care based on comorbidities we will perpetuate disparities because good health is not equally distributed throughout society for example increasingly poor health is associated with poverty lack of education and racial minority status89 thus efficiency of resource use must be balanced by considerations of justicethat is of fair and equitable resource use during the covid-19 crisis there is a scarcity of personnel manufactured materials machined resources and perishable resources210-12 in an effort to maximize availability of healthy personnel various redeployment schemes have been developed where clinicians may be called to practice in an unfamiliar environment13 personal protective equipment ppe shortages have placed frontline workers and the patients they care for in precarious situations214 a diminishing stockpile and limited production have made perishable resources precious commodities including blood products sedation and pressor medications and some antibiotics21112 shortages of ventilators has brought about difficult rationing decisions in some cities101415 the formal recommendations to curtail elective surgical procedures is rooted in the current and impending need to allocate this collection of high-demand high-value resources to surging demands in critical care required by the presence of covid-1916-18 understanding the perspective of collective ethics helps the clinician understand system-based decisions however a clinician still is called to serve their specific patient and must still apply clinical ethics to everyday practice which can result in significant distress when institutional restrictions prevent a clinician from doing what they think to be their obligation to a particular patient collective ethics work best within a consensus framework where governments and hospitals create sound advice on how to allocate resources if clinicians are forced to allocate resources at the bedside they betray the values that have dominated their clinical practice the individual patient-physician relationship is the foundation for bedside clinical ethics7 clinicians serve as advocates for their individual patient providing them with the resources needed for that specific patients care rather than considering the greater cohorts demands as patients we want our physicians to advocate for our best interests and the patient-physician relationship requires that we think our caregivers will do so if we are critically anemic we do not want the physician at the bedside considering whether to transfuse us or another patient at another hospital the shifted priorities in collective ethics require a level of impartiality and consensus for this reason the dilemmas that demand a perspective of collective ethics should be brought to a separate impartial triaging committee that makes consistently just and equitable decisions based on the consensus values1920 current generalized guidelines work to provide a framework for such decision-making however the vague nature of these guidelines has caused confusion and permitted significant variability in interpretation for example there are diagnoses and conditions that are generally agreed to be emergencies that require urgent if not emergent surgical care-compartment syndrome knee dislocation with vascular injury open injuries cauda equina syndrome and some acute fractures just to name a few in the case of hip fractures studies have consistently shown reduced mortality and morbidity when surgery is performed within 24 hours2122 however all acute injuries do not need to be surgically addressed with the same urgency if at all what about the acute clavicle fracture the acute ligamentous elbow injury in situations of clinical equipoisethat is where surgical intervention will yield similar results to those of nonoperative managementwe should choose the path of decreased resource utilization this is clearly different from usual times where shared decision-making would instead be pursued to answer the question as to what we ought to do23 in the context of a pandemic surgeons are most knowledgeable about what injuries are equally amenable to nonoperative management for example according to american college of surgeons guidelines acute achilles tendon ruptures fall under a recommendation to schedule even under phase 3 conditions where the recommendation is to also eliminate elective practice24 studies have shown equivalent plantar flexion strength and insignificant differences in re-rupture rate with treatment of function rehabilitation compared with operative management25 in this situation of clinical equipoise where nonsurgical and operative treatment approach similar outcomes the principles of stewardship and maximizing benefit for the collective public suggest that an initial treatment of nonoperative management is the most prudent course given the scarcity of ppe sedation medications and personnel as the crisis wanes the ethical landscape will shift again as times return to a new normal we will again pursue shared decision-making in situations of clinical equipoise in contrast to the current model where physicians are determining surgical need applying collective ethical principles regarding operating room allocation is even more complex when we must consider other specialties how does the urgency of an open fracture compare with that of a symptomatic aortic aneurysm in a stable patient or a dialysis patients malfunctioning fistula in need of revision or the oncologic surgery that will treat but not cure the malignancy of a high-risk immunocompromised patient who may require postoperative intensive care monitoring and extended ventilator use in situations where direct comparisons are unfair and the metrics for measuring the value of an intervention are relative an independent surgical review committee should make triaging decisions1920 this removes decision-making from individual physicians who will rightly be advocating for their own patients best interests following recommendations from the american college of surgeons an interdisciplinary team with representatives from surgery anesthesia and nursing can provide transparent equitable oversight and act as steward in the best interest of the patient cohort1920 we would recommend that bioethicists also be considered a valuable addition to the committee a systematic approach can also help to maximize efficiency for example increased use of nerve blocks to prevent the need for intubation equipment and medications and reduces aerosolization risk public health ethics requires us to take a collectivist approach regarding our obligations to the greater cohort does the foregrounding of a pandemic-focused public health ethic likewise require a shift in our professional ethics what are we as individual clinicians morally required to do given the circumstance every clinician has their own set of personal and professional duties and obligations that each come with their own burdens and risks is it ethical to expect all clinicians to serve the public during an emergency the american medical association26 code of medical ethics opinions related to physicians responsibilities in disaster response and preparedness specifies an obligation to respond during disasters indeed specialists generalists intensive care unit clinicians interns and attendings alike are all called to serveserve the patients in most need continue to serve their usual patients and serve their colleagues however the duty to serve is not endless clinicians also have a responsibility to practice safely protecting their own health to ensure future patients are able to receive care special obligations to protect family members are also relevant particularly when family members have a high risk of poor outcomes should they contract covid-19 in a pandemic this means a duty to provide care in safe working conditions and being stewards of available ppe similarly healthcare organizations have a responsibility to provide their clinicians with appropriate ppe however for some clinicians the environment of a pandemic may not be safe at all there are diagnoses and medical factors eg increased age history of heart disease or immunocompromise that increase the risk for a clinician to practice and may create a protected class27-29 guidelines regarding work exemption for protected classes are vague and may be unrealistic in some settings the centers for disease control and prevention addresses the question of covid-19 patient care for pregnant healthcare workers by placing the burden on facilities to consider limiting exposure to confirmed or suspected covid-19 especially during higher risk procedures but acknowledges challenges of staffing availability29 the limited staffing ability of many health systemsbecause of long-standing understaffing or clinician illnessis going to require the use of redeployment strategies clinicians will be practicing in the areas outside their usual practice13anesthesia clinicians who have primarily worked in the operating room will be tasked with managing intensive care units orthopaedic surgeons will be tasked with functioning as floor medical clinicians and psychiatrists will be tasked with screening patients in the emergency department practicing at the edge of ones competencyor beyond itwill be uncomfortable for clinicians does this discomfort represent bad ethics how can we step up to the challenge to serve during the pandemic but also maintain one of our main ethos of nonmaleficence do no harm and give patients the good care that they deserve and trust us to deliver all clinicians can be part of the covid-19 response but all clinicians do not have to do the same job usual medical needs such as heart failure exacerbations and diabetic care still exist trauma call and arthritis pains still exist not all frontline covid-19 work is specifically medical in nature orthopaedic surgeons have skills that can be uniquely and creatively appliedclinicians can become quickly trained as proficient proceduralists for line access are familiar with the intricacies of safe prone positioning and are adept at identifying emergencies such as abdominal compartment syndrome for the patient in shock or axial compartment syndrome for the patient with failed access not all responders to the pandemic need to do the frontline covid-19 work with the proliferation of telemedicine and electronic medical records even protected classes can continue general orthopaedic clinical care via virtual clinics or virtual rounds musculoskeletal specific clinics can be repurposed for urgent musculoskeletal care with non-covid-19 patients diverted for evaluation and management to offload overwhelmed hospitals and emergency departments these changed practices due to the covid-19 pandemic is inevitably going to result in many of the following tensions individual clinical ethics versus public health ethics best medical practices versus resource scarcity and expert practice versus practicing at the edge or beyond ones competencies these tensions will all generate moral dilemmas with a high likelihood of causing moral distress moral distress occurs when external or internal constraints preclude the performance of an ethically appropriate choice or action3031 multiple experiences of moral distress can result in moral residue or a build-up of unresolved conflicts within the clinician that makes future scenarios that create moral distress even less tolerable3032 the combination of moral distress atop moral residue can ultimately lead to moral injury which occurs when individuals are perpetrating failing to prevent or bearing witness to acts that transgress deeply held moral beliefs and expectations33 moral dilemmas and moral distress are likely inevitable within a pandemic we will want to give more units of blood than we are permitted by the blood bank we will want to consent the patient with an intra-articular distal radius fracture for surgery but we will instead reduce and splint we will be unable to practice as we do in normal times yet moral residue and moral injury need not be similarly inevitable resilience can be cultivated as a way to avoid developing moral residue one simple exercise is to write down three good things that happened during the day before bed at night34 humans are predisposed to remember negative experiences rather than positive ones and amidst a global pandemic the negative is likely to drown out the positive unless there is a deliberate effort to refocus we can also work to try to mitigate moral injury the covid-19 crisis creates multiple potential risks factors for moral injury35 if a clinician is unable to provide unlimited blood products or unable to perform fracture surgery when a patient requests it it is likely to feel like the perpetration of a wrong a failure according to ones moral beliefs about the right way to practice medicine to minimize or eliminate clinicians feeling that they are violating their moral beliefs wherever possible the health system should create protocols and guidelines to direct the allocation of scarce resources this will permit physicians to advocate for their patients avoid bedside rationing and still be part of a system that is working toward the greater good furthermore the health system and government must be transparent with clinicians about the available resources so that the crisis is appropriately framed according to triage principles clinicians are taught during training rather than a disorderly ad hoc approach ensuring that clinicians do not feel that they are part of acts that transgress their deeply held moral beliefs and expectations33 the goal of this study was not to provide an exhaustive overview of the ethical issues likely to be raised in orthopaedics during the covid-19 pandemic nor have we sought to solve all of the issues we raised the fact is and will remain that massive public health threats raise difficult ethical challenges that often do not admit of tidy solutions instead our goal was to provide a framework for considering how a global pandemic changes our moral responsibilities in nonpandemic environments clinicians operate within a framework of what we can think of as standard clinical ethics their duties and responsibilities most often arise from the clinical encountera clinician a patient and often a family pandemic environments however bring challenges that can only be addressed by moving to a public health ethics frame the standard question of what i ought to do is modified to what we as a cohort ought to do hospitals healthcare systems and governments must make decisions about how resources are allocated this incorporation of collective obligations does not however eliminate individual clinical responsibility but rather has the capacity to change it the hospital needs more floor medical clinicians so clinicians inherit a responsibility to step into that role or a fracture that might normally be treated with surgery is not deemed urgent enough to spend surgical resources on so surgeons inherit a duty to nonoperatively manage injuries in all such cases there is a disconnect between ones pre-covid-19 sense of responsibility and the one that is developing now and that disconnect is ripe for moral distress residue and injury our hope is that by identifying that likelihood and the way in which it is a function of changing moral frameworks we can put ourselves in a better position to mitigate it finally institutions not only have obligations only to the broader cohort but also to the clinicians serving that cohort failure of institutions to meet its duty to provide clinicians with adequate ppe increases the presence of terrible moral dilemmas faced by the individual clinicians in this way moral failure begets moral burden the importance of institutional responsibility to its healthcare workers cannot be overstated sufficiently dark days lie ahead from the burden of covid-19 itself we must take every opportunity not to increase the difficulty and darkness unnecessarily  
covid19 use of the clinical frailty scale for critical care decisions edward chong mark chan huei tan nuo wee lim shiong   
to the editor amid the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 pandemic crisis doctors are now faced with tough ethical decisions in determining who would benefit most from intensive care and ventilator support
1
 covid19 has the potential to cause serious lifethreatening complications in both the young and old however it is especially detrimental among older adults with multimorbidities2 3
 given the scarcity of resources faced by many areas critical care triage becomes ethically complex and challenging this dilemma has led to countries across the globe rapidly preparing triage guidelines to aid doctors in making the difficult decision on the appropriateness and potential benefits of admitting patients especially older adults to critical care
4
 however le couteur and his coauthors highlighted concerns regarding allocating critical care interventions based solely on age cutoffs and that a frailtybased approach prioritizing on an individuals functional abilities multimorbidities prognosis and treatment preferences may prove more valuable
5

 the national institute for health and care excellence nice recently published covid19 rapid guidelines for critical care in adults
6
 it recommends the use of the clinical frailty scale cfs in patients aged 65 years and older and states that decisions about admission to intensive care units icus should be made on the basis of the potential for medical benefit we refer to nice guidelines and wish to share our concerns about the use of a cfs score of 5 as the pivot point to define a more frail state where uncertainty exists regarding the likely benefit of icu care we recently published data on acutely hospitalized older adults mean age  894  46 years n  210 where we compared patients with a cfs score of 1 to 5 nonfrail to mildly frail against those with a score of 6 to 8 moderate to severely frail
7
 our data revealed that being in the latter group was independently predictive of mortality and institutionalization following hospitalization using the same data set we separated our cohort into five groups cfs scores 13 4 5 6 and 78 and compared them against the risk of mortality and institutionalization during hospitalization and 6 and 12 months after enrollment we performed the fisher exact test for a comparison between the groups and incident mortality and institutionalization we then performed logistic regression analysis adjusted for age sex and severity of illness to investigate the independent association between increasing frailty using a cfs score of 5 as reference point and the adverse outcomes of interest we found mortality rate during hospitalization to be higher in cfs 6 47 and cfs 7 to 8 86 patients with no mortality recorded among cfs 1 to 3 cfs 4 and cfs 5 patients table 1 at 12month followup the mortality rate in cfs 5 patients was low 83 in comparison with cfs 6 292 and cfs 7 to 8 600 p  001 this was similarly observed for institutionalization logistic regression analysis revealed that increasing frailty when compared with cfs 5 was independently predictive of mortality cfs 6 odds ratio or  452 95 confidence interval ci  1611273 p  004 cfs 78 or  1799 95 ci  5366034 p  001 and institutionalization andor mortality cfs 6 or  511 95 ci  1971327 p  001 cfs 78 or  1587 95 ci  5044995 p  001 at 12 months after hospitalization even as we make our case for a thoughtful consideration of the cfs we wish to acknowledge that the lower 12month mortality and institutionalization rate in our oldestold population with cfs 5 scores comes with the caveats of good geriatric care supported by a multidisciplinary team and a healthcare system that was not overwhelmed we also acknowledge that clinical outcomes may well be dissimilar in older adults hospitalized with covid19 nonetheless our data in an indirect way demonstrate what is possible with good geriatrics care and even during our battle with covid19 unplanned admissions for illnesses unrelated to covid19 still need to be managed adequately we note that previous studies reported poorer icu outcomes in frail older adults that include hospital and longterm mortality and reduced likelihood to be discharged home8 9 however what was noteworthy in the study by darvall and his coauthors
9
 as highlighted in an editorial by mudge
10
 was that the outcomes for critically ill frail older patients were reasonably good with 91 surviving icu admission 82 surviving to hospital discharge and fewer than 5 discharged to new nursing home care in many ways our data support findings from darvall et al and corroborate the concept of frailty mildly frail older adults may still have enough intrinsic capacity to withstand the stressors of hospitalization and make a good recovery
11

 thus although there is a pressing need for clear critical care guidance during this pandemic frailty assessment should not lead to automatic disqualification of less frail individuals eg with a cfs 5 score from the potential benefits of icu care especially if critical care capacity remains sufficient in conclusion we wish to emphasize that frailty identification should not simply result in a label but rather impact management in a meaningful contextappropriate way that is used to make care rational and not to ration care

  inpatient and outpatient case prioritization for patients with neuro-oncologic disease amid the covid-19 pandemic general guidance for neuro-oncology practitioners from the aanscns tumor section and society for neuro-oncology rohan ramakrishna gelareh zadeh jason sheehan p manish aghi k   the coronavirus sars-cov-2 pandemic first identified in wuhan china in december 2019 has fast spread throughout the globe with nearly 200 countries affected 1 the relatively easy spread of this virus combined with the higher morbidity and mortality of symptomatic infection as compared to influenza have resulted in overwhelmed hospital systems in china italy and the united states to name just a few 2 3 as a result elective medical care has been necessarily de-prioritized to meet the demands of this public health crisis in the face of this unprecedented situation a rational framework to adjudicate patient prioritization in the context of severely constrained resources is urgently needed 4 there have been some guidelines recently promulgated by the american college of surgeons based on surgical acuity that are generally sound 5 similarly a recent article by burke et al articulated an approach towards case prioritization for neurosurgical cases specifically 6 in addition centers for medicare and medicaid cms guidelines list neurosurgery and most cancers as tier 3a cases and as such recommend that these cases not be postponed if possible given their high acuity 7 neuro-oncology cases are unique in that the brain or spine tumors which may not be urgent now will become urgent in due course for malignant central nervous system cns tumors this time course will likely occur in the near future when the coronavirus pandemic may still be ongoing here we present a framework to assist in determining case priorities in patients with neuro-oncologic disease we divide the framework between resource-constrained some hospital resources available for non-covid disease and no resource settingsall hospital resources directed towards covid patients in many centers affected by the pandemic outpatient access has been significantly curtailed to the extent possible patients and health providers should be given access to their providers through telemedicine appointments given the importance of imaging in neuro-oncology patients for diagnosis and surveillance it is critical that outpatient radiology remain accessible for patients and providers radiology and radiation oncology centers should establish protocols to limit patients in waiting areas and provide masks for patients finally for those patients requiring infusions patients should be appropriately separated with masks given ill patients should of course remain home and home health care including infusions at home should be considered for ill patients that are covid discussions between patient and provider should occur to discuss whether their treatment surgery chemotherapy or radiation can be reasonably postponed until recovery if it cannot appropriate evaluation and treatment of these patients should occur in isolated settings with staff provided the appropriate personal protective equipment ppe departments and health care institutions should create panels to help fairly adjudicate health care resources these panels should be blinded to providers to ensure fairness it is imperative that health care providers with expertise in neuro-oncologic decision making neurosurgeons radiation oncologists medical neuro-oncologists be part of the process hospital administration should provide transparent reporting on available resources locally and regionally based on available real-time information for procedures the bare minimum of staff and graduate medical education gme trainees if any should be permitted into the operating room both to minimize staff exposures and to conserve ppe patients should receive covid testing prior to their procedures so that discussions about relative risks to patients and providers can be thoughtfully discussed for example a patient who tests positive for covid-19 even if asymptomatic should delay their procedure until their infection clears given risks to care providers and other hospitalized patients procedures in covid-19 positive patients should be done only for true emergencies we recommend that to the extent possible preoperative testing or labwork be performed on the day of surgery for outpatients to minimize patient exposure to hospital settings patients with significant cytopenias from their cancers or their therapies should be evaluated in detail to determine whether a surgical intervention is advisable given their potential poor ability to recover from a hospital acquired covid-infection in terms of operating room dynamics minimal or staff should be present during intubation and extubation frozen section diagnoses should only be utilized when the information will change intraoperative management to help minimize staff exposure to the hospital setting tissue banking procedures should be either temporarily suspended or modified such that the minimal necessary staff are required to complete tissue procurement activities intraoperative neuromonitoring should be utilized only if absolutely necessary again to minimize staff exposure postoperative otherwise uncomplicated craniotomies should consider non-icu settings for convalescence so these resources icu beds and ventilators can be more appropriately deployed 8 all efforts should be made for patients to go home rather than subacute nursing facilities or rehabilitation centers given the likely increased covid risk in these health care settings considerable attention should be paid to reducing length of stay for hospitalized neuro-oncology patients to help reduce in-hospital patient exposure and reduce strain on health care institutions for patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent high grade gliomas urgent surgery should be performed with 12 weeks of diagnosis followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapies per established standards in cases where hypofractionated radiotherapy could be used to limit patient exposure in the hospital this should be considered for non-enhancing lesions that likely represent lower grade gliomas these should be watched closely until clinical resources are more widely available while it is understood that many of these lesions may behave more aggressively based on molecular phenotype under the current pandemic situation close outpatient monitoring will stratify those patients who need more urgent intervention based on relevant imaging changes versus those whose treatment can be postponed until the direness of the situation improves for patients with brain metastases surgery should be offered only to those patients with large lesions causing symptoms related to mass effect and vasogenic edema and whose survival is expected to be greater than 3 months for grey zone patients who might be treated with surgery and radiosurgery versus radiosurgery alone we encourage providers to lean towards radiosurgery alone until hospital access improves recognizing that in a subset of patients salvage therapy may be required for patients who do not require surgery radiation therapy in the form of either radiosurgery or whole brain radiation therapy should be offered at the discretion of the treating providers radiation therapy departments should establish protocols to minimize patient flow and provide masks to patients for use during clinical care for patients where targeted or immunologic therapies are available as either a primary or neoadjuvant strategy this should be considered ie lung canceregfr alk ret high pdl1 breast her2 melanomapdl1 and brafmek inhibitors renal cellpazopanib sunitinib etc this is by no means an exhaustive list but meant to provide examples of where systemic agents may be both efficacious and less resource intensive than surgery or radiation therapy for patients with spinal metastases conventional radiotherapy or radiosurgery should be offered where appropriate to prevent local growth and neurologic symptoms triaging based on symptoms amongst this population will of course be necessary for patients with progressive deformity neurologic deficits and significant epidural spinal disease surgery or emergenturgent radiotherapy ie spinal lymphoma should be offered where appropriate 9 for patients where targeted therapies or immunologic therapies are available as either a primary or neoadjuvant strategy this should be considered while it is impractical to describe the appropriate management of all the lesions encountered in neuro-oncologic practice we believe we have discussed the most common lesions encountered especially complex given their multi-disciplinary nature in general patients with progressive neurologic symptoms from brain and spine tumors should be managed expeditiously to prevent irreversible neurologic deficits even if the tumor is considered benign disease for example pituitary tumors or skull base lesions with rapidly worsening vision should receive treatment more chronic vision loss cases can and will likely need to be delayed similarly acoustic neuromas meningiomas etc with hydrocephalus or other symptoms of brainstem compression should be managed expeditiously tumors associated with slow but progressive symptoms should be evaluated on a case by case basis these decisions can adjudicated fairly by departments and resource allocation panels based on available hospital resources and patient needs across the hospital system finally as previously mentioned radiation therapy or systemic therapy should be considered as an alternative to surgery if possible during this crisis many clinical trials have suspended accrual given the current pandemic which is appropriate it is crucial that health institutions and industry work diligently to serve current trial patients to avoid lapses in care institutions should explore the feasibility of telemedicine for trial related follow up visits to the extent that any trials are opened prioritization should be given to late stage trials assessing efficacy rather than trials assessing safety visitors to inpatients with neuro-oncologic disease should be minimized andor even prohibited until epidemiologic data indicate it is safe to lift this burdensome restriction it is important that providers educate patients on the ramifications of the covid19 pandemic they must also reassure them that they will be monitored as closely as possible and that their treatments will be delivered as soon as is practicable we believe that governments should let individual health systems manage their prioritization schema without rigid guidelines however we do believe that governments should establish civil immunity for health care providers who must make tough treatment allocation decisions in this extraordinary current pandemic crisis 10 governments should also increase production and availability of personal protective equipment ppe production especially for health care workers so they remain safe and effective for their patients in certain neuro-oncologic procedures like endoscopic endonasal procedures for skull base lesions there is a risk of viral aerosolization with subsequent infection of surgeons and operating room staff 11 these patients should be tested for covid-19 infection even if asymptomatic for patients who are or who may be infected aerosol generating procedures should only be performed with powered air purifying respiratory parp equipment neuro-oncologic patients who cannot self-isolate from their medical appointments in facilities affected by the pandemic should be provided masks to the extent practicable that said procurement strategies for ppe are outside the scope of this article a governmental response coordinated at all levels federal state and local with dynamic allocation based on need would be preferred in contrast to current efforts in the united states in the event of all hospital resources being functionally devoted to treatment of covid patients neuro-oncologic treatments surgery radiosurgery chemotherapy or radiation therapy should be focused on truly emergent situations these indications might include impending demise relative to mass effect in the brain impending paraplegia from mass effect in the spine hematomas and infections the covid-19 pandemic has forced an unpleasant conversation with regards to judicious use of health care resources the current crisis has forced hospital systems to carefully review and at times postpone medical care so that covid-19 cases can be triaged and managed and so ppe and other infrastructure eg ventilators icu beds can be saved for covid-19 patients the inevitable consequence of this will be a backlog of semi-urgent cases across all of medicine and in neuro-oncology the best way to manage this disruption is to thoughtfully consider when and how neuro-oncology care both interventional and outpatient must be delivered while simultaneously considering both risks to patientsstaff and burden on health care systems we recognize the burden this pandemic has placed on our neuro-oncology patients and their families and hope this framework provides a rational approach to prioritize patient care we recognize the ethical burden placed on providers which others have discussed at length 4 in this current crisis neuro-oncology providers will have to be especially cognizant of the risks to patients and providers if aggressive in-hospital treatments are pursued moreover these recommendations for treatment will have to be contextualized to current health system capabilities ie icu and ventilator availability finally societal utilitarian concerns may have to be considered with perhaps younger patients or patients with better prognoses favored for intensive resources relative to older patients there are no easy ways to manage these clinical scenarios and there is certainly no universally applicable algorithm but depending on the severity of the pandemic at individual hospitals these considerations may well be necessary we recognize the extraordinary implications of this case prioritization framework given the high acuity of many neuro-oncologic patients the challenges to providers in selecting appropriate cases for treatment in this pandemic crisis are substantial that said we hope this document provides a framework that can guide clinicians in neuro-oncology practice as they adjudicate which patients to concentrate limited healthcare resources we further recognize that our patients exist in a vast ecosystem of medical need that said we feel it is our duty in the neuro-oncologic community to advocate for our patients forcefully but responsibly as good citizens in the healthcare workforce  epilepsy self-management during a pandemic experiences of people with epilepsy wendy miller r jane von gaudecker andrea tanner janice buelow m   the 2020 novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 and subsequent coronavirus disease-19 covid-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented societal disruption worldwide social distancing mandates combined with extreme stress on the united states us healthcare system have rendered daily life in the us nearly unrecognizable while most americans daily lives and routines have markedly changed during the pandemic americans with chronic disease including epilepsy are at unique risk for health-related disruptions both federal and state mandates put in place to quell the spread of covid-19 and the risk of contracting the virus have potentially created unique barriers for those with epilepsy first reported in china covid-19 is caused by a novel virus that leads to respiratory illness in varying degrees of severity from asymptomatic to respiratory failure and death nearly 3 million cases of covid-19 have been confirmed globally with the us currently having the most at nearly 1 million confirmed cases nearly 200000 people 1 including more than 50000 americans 2 have died from covid-19 given its novelty covid-19 has been especially difficult to contain with public health experts scrambling to determine details about the virus spread and ability to live on surfaces the unknown aspects of the highly contagious virus spread and effective treatment have caused federal- and state-level government action on a scale not seen since some states enacted social distancing during the 1918 spanish flu pandemic 3 president trump has ordered the nation to follow drastic social distancing guidelines which include staying at least six feet apart from others outside of family only leaving the house for essential purposes and working from home whenever possible universities and schools across the nation have halted in-person classes transitioning to online learning and 80 of americans are under governor-enacted lockdown orders a majority of states have restricted gatherings and prohibited all but essential travel outside the home some states have formal shelter-in-place orders in effect 4 even in states beginning to open daily environments are far from normal in the midst of a personal protective equipment and ventilator shortage governors have halted nonemergent surgeries and procedures and many health clinics are closed or only seeing patients in the event of an emergency 5 these necessary precautions have resulted in not only economic collapse but also extreme alterations in a healthcare system on which 3 million americans rely for treatment and management of their epilepsy a condition which the centers for disease control and prevention cdc has indicated increases the risk for serious covid-19 infection 6 in the midst of a healthcare crisis focused on preventing and treating covid-19 another question ariseshow does the pandemic affect the health of patients not affected by covid-19 and especially those managing chronic diseases like epilepsy this question is especially important to consider given that the nation will likely have to engage in additional rounds of social distancing until a vaccine for covid-19 is available 7 epilepsy self-management is key to achievement of epilepsy-related outcomes 8 and refers to a patient managing the treatments and day-to-day lifestyle changes associated with epilepsy specifically epilepsy self-management is the process during which patients incorporate multidimensional strategies that meet their self-identified needs to manage and cope with epilepsy within the context of their daily living successful management of both functioning in day-to-day life along with management of chronic illness requires the individual to continually monitor health and functional status and take appropriate actions during acute phases and this management often involves a familial caregiver 9 the covid-19 pandemic creates a rare opportunity to explore how epilepsy self-management is altered when societal economic and healthcare structures do not exist in their usual forms in the us the purpose of this descriptive study was to from the perspective of adult people with epilepsy pwe and caregivers of pwe explore the effects of the current pandemic and resulting societal changes on epilepsy self-management specifically we sought to explore how mandated isolation social distancing orders closure of many businesses and covid-19 infections have affected pwe and their caregivers ability to self-manage control seizures access medications manage triggers and communicate with providers further we explored the frequency and severity of affective symptoms as well as other pwe- and caregiver-identified difficulties that have arisen during the pandemic the study was submitted to the indiana university irb and deemed exempt using social media an advertisement for the survey was shared via various epilepsy-related facebook pages and via twitter with the appropriate hashtags to render it searchable covid-19 epilepsy pandemic and research organic sharing of the advertisement from members of these groups also occurred all participants self-referred to the study via the link embedded in the online advertisement inclusion criteria were the following age 18 years or older a person diagnosed with epilepsy taking antiseizure medication or the caregiver of a childloved one with epilepsy currently taking antiseizure medication for epilepsy fluent in english reliable access to the internet and currently living in the us participants lacking these criteria were excluded and automatically directed to the end of the survey the survey included a total of 65 questions 50 of which were relevant to this manuscript and included questions related to demographics perceived changes in epilepsy self-management social distancing and affective symptoms since the pandemic began the data were collected over a three-day period from march 27 to march 30 2020 during this three day period 31 states were under some version of stay-at-home orders using spss version 26 descriptive statistics were run on all quantitative variables paired t-tests were used to detect statistically significant differences on items that involved respondents providing a pre- and postpandemic score qualitative comments were analyzed using traditional content analysis the survey was accessed by 112 people five surveys were discarded because of high recaptcha scores on qualtrics indicating high likelihood of bot completion these five surveys were manually reviewed and found to contain unreliable data thus 107 completed the survey and 94 participants completed every single survey item the final sample size was thus 94 table 1

includes additional results related to respondents experiences with social distancing we asked various questions aimed at determining how respondents epilepsy and epilepsy self-management have been affected by the pandemic more than one-third 35 n  33 of respondents indicated that they or their loved ones have experienced increased seizure frequency since pandemic onset of those who indicated worsening seizures during the pandemic on a scale of 010 with 0 being seizure frequency has not increased at all and 10 being seizure frequency has increased very much the mean score was 688 sd 098 range 38 respondents were asked to rank the degree to which several epilepsy self-management-related activities ability to control seizures ability to get seizure medication from pharmacy when needed ability to reach healthcare provider ability to takegive seizure medication at the correct time ability to manage stress ability to stay in a normal sleeping routine and ability to track seizures and medication were affected by the pandemic ability to get medications from the pharmacy was most affected by the pandemic with 73 of the sample indicating that this area of epilepsy self-management was made much more difficult by the pandemic more than 40 of the sample indicated that managing seizures managing stress and reaching their epilepsy healthcare provider were made much more difficult by the pandemic fig 1

one participant stated i live alone so grocery shopping and pharmacy are all on me others reported having to continue to report to work or other volunteer duties which threatened their ability to social distance i work at a post office and sometimes we are not six feet apart wrote one participant while another stated i work part time at a church with a food pantry which is essential while a lot of practices have been put in place to help social distance while doing this there is still some interaction i also do not drive due to my seizures so i need to rely on others for transportation which has limited my ability to social distance another participant remarked i have to report to work where 50 people are daily others noted that the ability to work from home has been very helpful in social distancing with the ability to telework 100 we were able to prepare early by stocking food supplies to limit trips out of the house and obtain 90 day supplies of antiseizure meds and critical vitamins and minerals for health stability if we were not able to telework we would suffer with caring for our daughter and providing a safe situation for seizure monitoring nine of 33 respondents who indicated a worsening of seizure frequency andor severity left comments about how the pandemic has directly affected their seizure frequency and severity according to one respondent im having a lot more complex partial seizures this week i had one every day they usually only occur 1 to 3 times per month and i had a tonic clonic that was almost 8 minutes  the vns didnt seem to help like it usually does caregivers reported similar seizure increases with one stating he has had more seizures in the past weeksince all this started others responded with the exact numbers of seizures they have experienced since the onset of the pandemic with respondents reporting an increase by 3 two respondents 4 two respondents 5 and 10 three respondents seizures beyond their normal seizure frequency since pandemic onset some respondents reported changes that directly affected their ability to self-manage their epilepsy or that of their loved ones respondents reported difficulty with maintaining a normal sleep routine managing stress obtaining prescriptions and reaching healthcare providers as one respondent explained it is more difficult to obtain medications from the pharmacy due to reduced hours living alone and not having adequate transportation without ride sharing which has been greatly reduced in this area currently doctors are not accepting appointments except for sick patients so follow ups are nonexistent currently there is added stress from work which also makes a normal sleep routine more difficult all of these things ultimately lead to poor seizure control over time another respondent noted with social distancing it has been more difficult to get the medications when needed stress has also been a factor just worrying about if you were to have a seizure that we would need to go to the hospital and being exposed there another respondent found that family members being home most of the time also affected self-management its changed my daily routine  that of the people i live with for instance my brother being out of school so my sleep has changed hes a teen  sees this as a longer summer vacation so hes staying up late  keeping me up stress has been the hardest one respondent explained the inability to get epilepsy-related questions answered during this time stating you cannot get help for things that are not life or death right now including small seizures or questions about medicationsits not clear when or if i am allowed to call them with a question if its not an emergency similarly a caregiver shared i feel guilty calling to ask anythingwe have only been dealing with this about 7 months and i still have tons of questions but am afraid to ask right now because i know everyone else has it far worse several respondents spoke of being fearful of contracting covid-19 or having care rationed in the event they or their loved ones needed hospitalization related to seizures as one respondent explained i dare not go to the hospital for regular testing because i am worried that the hospital will take in many patients infected with the virus i also dare not go to the pharmacy which makes me feel panic one respondent with epilepsy explained fear regarding covid-19s effect on epilepsy stating i have fear of getting the virus i have seizure clusters with fevers so im worried what will happen if i get it hearing some kind of comforting word from a neuro that i wont die if i get it would be helpful a caregiver of a child with epilepsy noted being concerned about rationing of ventilators stating worried that if she needs any kind of hospital care she will be less likely to receive a ventilator  not likely if she get co-vid to get a venther cognitive function is greatly delayed and if care is rationed she is in a group that will be at the bottom of the list that worries me greatly this study is not without limitations first we were not able to collect data on important variables affective symptoms for example prior to the pandemic rather we had to rely on respondents memories asking them to answer questions considering both normal and present pandemic circumstances second our sample represents mostly white middle-class people with college degrees it is important to recognize that our results may not be as generalizable to populations less well-represented in our sample finally our sample of 94 is somewhat small if possible similar research should be repeated with a larger more diverse sample in the event of a similar situation the covid-19 pandemic has upended normal life and current findings demonstrate that it has also disrupted epilepsy self-management for pwe and their caregivers during this unusual time most medical care is understandably directed at managing covid-19 and saving lives of those affected while there has been and will be a future need to put off nonurgent healthcare during subsequent local and state shut downs those citizens with chronic diseases including epilepsy have daily management needs that do not go away during a pandemic or other life-altering change conversely these needs are heightened physicians and nurses who provide care to pwe should prioritize making plans with pwe and caregivers in the event of significant disruptions members of our sample would have benefitted greatly from clear-cut guidance from epilepsy providers regarding how to communicate with them and that they were allowed to do so in light of current results the professional epilepsy community should consider treatment and management guidelines for pandemic-like societal and health system disruptions in addition prioritization of robust self-management skills upon epilepsy diagnosis and continuing throughout the disease course remains necessary for pwe and the caregivers who assist them the authors declare that they have no known competing interest  report from the covid-19 virtual summit disaster experts speak out march 31 2020 james phillips p luca ragazzoni w burel greg frederick burkle m mark keim   this manuscript represents the transcript of a webinar-virtual summit1 originally presented on march 31 2020 to an audience of over 1000 many listeners world-wide requested the written transcript this represents an edited version of the presentations the panel was comprised of the following disaster experts from italy and the united states 1 luca ragazzoni md phd - emergency and disaster medicine physician and faculty at the research center for emergency and disaster medicine in novara italy very close to the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 epicenter 2 james phillips md facep - emergency and disaster medicine physician section chief and fellowship director of disaster and operational medicine at the george washington university school of medicine and health sciences washington dc usa also a medical analyst on the cable news network cnn atlanta georgia usa 3 greg burel - public health administrator and former director of the us strategic national stockpile office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response aspr washington dc usa now president and principal consultant at hamilton grace llc consulting group 4 frederick skip burkle jr md - retired professor and now senior fellow and scientist at the harvard humanitarian initiative th chan school of public health boston massachusetts usa and global scholar at the woodrow wilson international center for scholars washington dc usa the four panelists were asked three questions regarding the current pandemic as follows1what do you see as a particular issue of concern during the current pandemic2what do you see as a particular strength during the current pandemic3if you could change one thing about the way that the pandemic response is occurring what would you change
 panelists responses were collected transcribed and minimally edited for grammatical flow not content this is a manuscript of that transcription the summit was moderated by dr mark keim ceo disasterdoc llc and adjunct assistant professor emory university rollins school of public health atlanta georgia usa covid-19 is now a pandemic that has reached over 100 countries in a matter of weeks italy despite having an advanced health care system is almost at point break the situation here is very critical patients are being treated in hospital corridors hospital departments have been converted to treat only covid-19 patients many doctors and nurses are working outside of their field of expertise and we are not able to provide the same quality of care as we usually do of course now we know that the intensive care unit icu is one of the most stressed hospital units however what is concerning me is that there is not enough attention on the prehospital setting primary health care family doctors and emergency medical services ems have key roles to alleviate the burden at the hospital before the admission additionally so many doctors and nurses are working outside of their field of expertise that we are not able to provide the same quality of care as we usually do we cannot expect that africa would respond like china us and europe we cannot ask all the countries to buy ventilators where there are no icus and there are a maximum two intensivists in the whole country we need to differentiate the response and allocate the right resources according to the country what we do after we discharge patients from hospitals is really important in italy we need to increase the importance of the role of the prehospital setting how do we continue care unfortunately currently there is little known about how long the patients need assistance and for how long they remain covid-19 positive we need to plan in advance for home care for the patients or at least create a new health facility to admit patients that are not able to stay at home alone and of course what is concerning me apart from the specific issue of the prehospital setting is the global lack of personal protective equipment ppe in italy were having issues trying to find enough ppe for the family physicians for the prehospital setting and the hospital staff everyday there is a critical lack of ppe as well as a misunderstanding of the importance of this issue these are in my opinion my concerns currently there are several things that i see as particular concerns right now ppe is a critical one not only in the united states where its talked about constantly on every major network but around the world we talk about europe and china and the united states ad nauseam but lets not forget africa lets not forget south america these are places where some of this equipment doesnt even exist i saw somewhere today that theres an african country liberia that has only three ventilators so equipment represents a major concern globally but in particular ppe is key in the united states where we are rationing it in every hospital also i must emphasize that we are using ppe in a manner that is not consistent with the standard of care what this means is not that patient treatment is suffering necessarily but that provider protection is suffering i go into work and i put on a mask and i wear it for eight hours i take it off halfway through one time to have an energy drink to keep going it smells bad after you eat or drink something and after hours it becomes hard to breathe through it makes you very fatigued and it sometimes makes you breathless to have a conversation with your patient you cant understand what anybody is saying in your work area which has been problematic during critical interventions we have seen an outpouring from people who are trying to make ppe for us but i dont even know how to begin to advise them as we cannot wear most of it i get emails daily from people trying to manufacture cloth masks for us some are using 3d printers and girl scout troops to make face shields for us its incredible and heartwarming and is one of the small bits of hope that we have right now as health care providers especially when theres so much disappointing and disheartening news i do not understand how we can assemble all the power and wealth of the united states to go to the moon or to develop the manhattan project yet we havent even considered doing the same thing to manufacture ppe and ventilators there are a lot of people working hard on this pandemic but i still think that we havent pulled out all the stops the defense production act is a useful tool but i think if i were in charge i would be a little less worried about the economy in the short term id be more worried about immediately cranking out millions of masks from every textile manufacturer in the united states we need to raise the curve on ppe production while we try to flatten the curve on the spread of this infection and if we end up with surplus thats what makes us great - because then we can share it with other countries while the production process for ppe and ventilators is obviously a concern for us we are additionally concerned about the ethical decisions that we as physicians may be facing as resources run short - when we start talking about rationing italy has certainly started that conversation its anesthesiology society published its concerns and guidelines and that has generated talk here in the united states i think it was new york university nyu new york usa hospital whose rationing policy was leaked to the media raising publicly the potential need for us choosing who gets a ventilator this distressing issue is why we as physicians need to have our professional societies medical organizations and perhaps even the centers for disease control and prevention cdc atlanta georgia usa weigh in and provide us ethical guidelines so my colleagues and i are not making ad hoc decisions in the heat of the battle we may be forced to decide which one of three patients needs the last remaining ventilator a policeman a mother or the priest  how do we decide as it stands now i alone must choose who gets that ventilator we need help so that were not burdened the rest of our lives by having to make those terrible decisions crisis leadership matters once you lie you lose your credibility and its hard to get it back i turn to my television to watch the president and the task force every single day and i am disappointed our incident commander the president is failing in his ability to communicate the issues at hand instead i find myself simply waiting to hear from dr fauci every day so that way i at least hear something i can believe we need better crisis leadership at the very top and so i think that one of the lessons we learn from this is the importance that at the highest levels it cannot be about politics its about crisis leadership we also need to address and include all-cause mortality theres a lot of people who are going to die from covid-19 who are never infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars cov-2 virus instead they will die as a result of the burden on our health care systems the implications of delayed ambulances and reduced resources could mean dying of a disease or trauma process that when in non-pandemic times they would otherwise have been saved heroin overdoses that didnt get narcan in time severe pediatric allergic reactions that dont get epinephrine trauma in general all those events may happen and were not including those victims right now in the death rate from this pandemic but they should be counted these are my biggest concerns that i wish we could address i echo the concerns about the availability of ppe today i remain concerned about the availability of other material we will need as we move forward in this event for example if there is a vaccine that becomes available or if there are therapeutics that become available were going to need additional needles and syringes - far more than we normally need during the seasonal flu campaign there are limitations on all products but let me go back to the ppe i agree that the fact that we have limited ppe available for our front-line personnel trying to deal with this problem is just unconscionable the reason i see behind this dilemma is that the medical supply chain is very fragile and people dont really understand that its fragile within all links of the supply chain what we know about that supply chain is evident for most products such as chronic disease medications and ppe  from the point of dispensing all the way back to the manufacturer there is never more than about 30 days of projected need for the entire market available its a very cost-effective system i think its great when you do that for auto parts i think its great when you do that for other materials that are not essential to protect and save lives but when we talk about the medical supply chain we begin to recognize that problem number one is there is no safety stock there is no back stock there is no margin for error in that just-in-time delivery of product at any link in the supply chain - all the way from the point-of-care to a distributor or to a manufacturer that has caused a lot of the problems we have today about getting this vital materiel coming out of this on the other side were going to have to really rethink the entire health care supply chain do we need to optimize so much for cost or do we need to consider optimizing the costs so that we dont ever have this kind of a problem in the future but there are other problems with that supply chain we are reliant on so many products that are made offshore that are no longer available for manufacturers or have very limited manufacturer availability in the united states and this is something that many of us have been discussing for years theres been congressional testimony around this problem as well as at the national academy of sciences washington dc usa and many other fora weve got to find a way to get more of this materiel made in the united states maybe not all of it but weve got to find a way to protect ourselves better from that supply chain perspective i think another particular issue of concern goes back to misinformation there is misinformation and confusion about what the government is doing and not doing what the strategic national stockpile can and cant do and a variety of other issues too weve got to get better about controlling information so that people see the right thing up first and credible one there was and remains a distinct difference in how countries ruled by authoritarian regimes initially managed the early evidence of the pandemic versus democratically ruled countries and as one further investigates this it becomes obvious that in great part this is a symptom of how both define public health in democracies public health is defined by priorities to improve protect and provide services public health infrastructure and programs in authoritarian regimes public health services prevention preparedness and response are inextricably seen and practiced through political and economic imperatives always leading to compromises in health and public health security currently the world has the fewest democracies ever recorded and the united states is currently defined as a flawed democracy and is becoming more authoritarian every day with this pandemic i believe it is fair to say that there is a general lack of confidence among health care providers world-wide because for most this is their first experience in population-based care for the most part they never studied them in medical or nursing schools in past decades with lower population densities infectious disease outbreaks epidemics and pandemics were rare and driven almost exclusively by large natural disasters predatory animals and war mine was in 1968 vietnam with an epidemic of bubonic plague that not only stopped the war on both sides it emptied the city and village streets of people for many weeks while it was the worst plague epidemic of the 20th century it was politically kept quiet once rare zoonotic spread that is between animal reservoirs and human animals through outbreaks epidemics and pandemics now make up 71 or more of new diseases globally they have grown because of massive growth in population numbers and density which are accelerated further by rapid unsustainable urbanization biodiversity loss and climate change and for the first time we have an increasing number of vulnerable populations that are suffering from chronic deficiencies in food water and energy we have never seen those numbers before and lastly which i will introduce you to in more depth in discussing the next question the loss of the world health organization who geneva switzerland and the international health regulations treatys independent leadership established under the united nations has been devastating what they were initially organized to do decades ago globally is now absent they have given their previous leadership role over to political powerhouses across the world because they are monetarily dependent on them to me in the long term this is the most telling issue of concern for us as practitioners and for the future of global public health this current webinar is an example of what i see as a particular strength during the current pandemic we are sharing knowledge we are sharing experience and we can teach others and explain to others how to prepare in advance ill give you an example when we had the first cases here in novara we started to prepare and to convert the hospital to assist covid-19 patients we were treating the first patients in icu and expecting the waves and we had a discussion with colleagues everywhere in the world for example from sweden we had a long talk with johan von schreeb - karolinska institutet solna sweden and health officers there and according to our suggestions they prepared in advance few days ago i received a message from johan saying thanks a lot luca and professor della corte to help us in preparing ourselves and to increase the icu capacity and we had other webinars like this one to help others i think to share knowledge is a real strength right now and of course the science we need to remember everyone disaster medicine is a science and we need to follow the sciences that are now available in the literature and in my opinion now there is real added value for everyone and of course i have to echo what james said the willingness of the health care professionals to respond is amazing right now here in italy it is spectacular we had a call for physicians for nurses to help in hospitals we called 300 physicians and nurses and we received 9000 responses the willingness to help is unbelievable i have to start with the front-line providers - the doctors and nurses at the local level are stepping up and showing their courage you know as we say in the disaster medicine world all disasters are local - and while i emphasize the fact that were lacking in leadership at the federal level the good news is locally thats not the case i know that every hospital is different theres nothing even remotely one-size-fits-all about this pandemic there are differences between academic hospitals non-academic hospitals and critical access hospitals but where i work at george washington university hospital we have a robust disaster medicine program that was in place long before i joined a faculty team including anthony mcintyre bruno petinaux dan hanfling and joe barbera - so our hospital is very well-versed in preparing for these crises im able to watch our emergency manager our local leader provide great leadership getting our hospital prepared both behind the scenes and in public im able to interact with our nurses and technicians both in the emergency department and the icu who are all preparing however as is being shown in the media we see courage knowing that many have been told to wear ppe in a way that is not consistent with the standard of care yet they do not hesitate to go in to treat the most ill of patients but it is taking toll on us i received an email a few minutes ago saying that we need coverage for tonight at one of our hospitals because one of my colleagues is now sick with covid-19 symptoms we are just at the tip of what were going to see here in washington dc evident when we see the incredible evidence of whats taking place in new york but i am encouraged witnessing planeloads full of medical workers flying into new york to volunteer to work its absolutely incredible i also appreciate governor cuomo displaying what i think is very good crisis leadership and this will be proved true when we look back through the long list of after-action reports following this pandemic i think one of the things were going to see as a silver lining is the expertise provided through telemedicine i think that the world will never be the same in relation to the telehealth system allowing doctors to provide care remotely and in a more efficient manner  and now without a financial loss which is critical also reducing associated regulations has been key as the former director of the strategic national stockpile i guess somewhat selfishly that the first thing i see that we do have is the strategic national stockpile in the united states while currently theres a lot of criticism that it doesnt have enough of everything the strategic national stockpile is the most-ready of any global stockpile that were aware of its one of the crown jewels in our preparedness system no its not perfect but every other country looks at us and asks us what we do and how to create their own however admittedly the problem that is facing us right now is that the strategic national stockpile has been chronically underfunded for years and we hope we see that improve i think another particular strength that were seeing and its been alluded to before is the way that people all across the united states and in other countries as well are coming together to try to help solve some of these problems there are limitations to what you can do but the fact that people are willing to step up and try is a major strength i think were seeing more people trying to abide by the remain in place and isolate yourself policy to a certain extent than what we might have thought we would weve got people doing some crazy things out there but youre always going to have that a final strength i see right now is the decision that the federal emergency management agency fema washington dc usa can respond to biological events in 2009 when we responded to h1n1 they didnt have that capability so i think fema leading the national response framework and bringing together the whole of government to try to address this problem puts us in a better position than we would have been otherwise we must remember its their first experience there are going to be hiccups and theyre going to be things that we need to go back and look at as many of us know as these after-action hot washes go well beat ourselves to death for several years over it but i think that this is good i think its brought new capability to a table that might not have been there before this whole of government response i think is going to be important to us moving ahead first i guess would be to see the health care providers speaking up first against chinas delays and inexcusable political decisions that violate public health dictums and similar concerns raised by health care providers in other countries remember the virus was known as early as last october not the december date the chinese first claimed the delay was inexcusable second clearly the manner in which health care providers volunteered and had to quickly learn the nuances of population-based care my one published study on triage categories in pandemics was the first and only triage structure that had a category for the non-survivable i believe italy was the first compelled in population-based care to use this category this has been listed as the most difficult of decisions and the first ever except in war that health care providers have had to make lastly i would offer that the pandemic and all its management deficiencies gives global public health some needed recognition it cannot turn back but the changes that must take place globally will be resisted in draconian ways by authoritarian regimes this pandemic will of course challenge globalization which is totally failing because it only focused on economics - never public health - and it should fail but we must ensure that this pandemic will strengthen what we now know as global public health i would say three main aspects stronger containment measures stronger coordination between health sectors and more just-in-time training no health care system can sustain an uncontrolled outbreak and stronger containment measures are now the only realistic option to avoid the total collapse of any health care system all governments must act now implementing traditional public health response tactics isolation quarantine social distancing community containment and aggressive lockdown also all people must know the basics of infection prevention and control measures and all precautionary measures aimed at avoiding the collapse of your health care system and an unnecessary loss of lives also from my perspective in italy we need more and stronger coordination between the different health sectors from the prehospital to the hospital more coordination between family doctors between ems and hospitals to contain the admission of patients in-hospital and to continue the care at home after the discharge and i would like to spend a little bit more time on training since its my field of expertise i would say we need more training more just-in-time training not only on donning and doffing ppe so i echo what skip said we are lacking of education in training in the medical schools in the nurses schools at any level so right now we need to act and to improve what we didnt implement before we need to increase the knowledge about triage about ethical dilemmas in this difficult situation its not just about donning and doffing ppe and also on basic principles of infection prevention and control again its not only because youre wearing a mask that youre protected so we need to teach everyone we need to educate health professionals on how to protect themselves and then also on how to react and to respond to difficult situations for example again how to expand the hospital how to triage patients at the admission and how to triage patients to decide which one needs icu needs intubation and which one not i think these are principles that are extremely important right now i mentioned ppe before and you know on an individual level as a physician on the front lines that is our major need but to think in terms of population health and a crisis management framework we can change the ppe issue and we can change ventilators those are things that we can improve and improve quickly but we talked about crisis leadership - and thats not something we are able to change right now we are getting messaging from the president that is very difficult to hear as a front-line health care provider i dont feel like he has my back and thats unfortunate this is not a political issue the coronavirus is neither a democrat nor republican and neither am i but we look to the president as the incident commander in a time of crisis like this the president has a choice of two ways to lead one can either lead by inspiration and rally the troops into battle or you can confuse them via mixed messaging even accusing us of stealing masks and selling them out the back door like what happened recently it is completely demoralizing we have to rely on our governors and our local experts we know we need containment and that the president has the power to enact national containment but wont our governors are going to finally have to reach a decisional critical mass before the president would ever decide to make a national decree if he will at all as the number of states where we have lockdown procedures grows like maryland and my home of virginia declared yesterday only then will we possibly see a federal change more personally crisis communication is one of the things that inspired me into disaster medicine i was 16 when the oklahoma city bombing occurred 1995 oklahoma usa - it rattled my window i heard the boom my father was one of the first firefighters in the building going straight into the nursery minutes after detonation since that time i knew this is what i was supposed to do as a career i recall that every night we would come home and there on tv was the excellent oklahoma city fire department public information officer pio named jon hanson jon was on every single night at the same time telling us what they knew what they didnt know and how they were going to find out when he was on the air we all felt that things were going to be okay because the people in charge were honest and informed thats what america needs now and because were americans the world looks to us i dont mean to be an american exceptionalist but i think we have missed a critical opportunity to provide global leadership at that highest level so if i could change one thing it would be the quality of our national leadership i would say crisis leadership again and i look at that from a couple of different lenses the first is we learned a long time ago that you must be first and you must be credible and im afraid that weve missed that boat to a certain extent i think back to 2009 and h1n1 we had a late-night phone call when we were beginning to see these cases and we began to understand what it might mean to the united states the cdc director was on camera the next morning first thing talking about what we knew talking credibly about what needed to be our concerns and we didnt see that here and that bothers me another issue we need to think about from a crisis leadership perspective is beyond just whether were going to send these things out or are we going to award some contracts or whatever we need to be taking better control at the federal level of these supply chain problems i was horrified to hear the comment that states should just go out and try to get their own things all at the same time the federal government is trying to do the same weve set up a competitive environment between the states and the federal government there is no room for that kind of competitiveness when we all need to be pulling together to respond to this event nation-wide i have never been a strong proponent of rapidly running out the door and placing orders under the defense production act because that puts the federal government first in line but in this particular case with some of these particular commodities like ppe that it is absolutely harming our response i believe that the government must order under the defense production act  put itself first in line bring in other capabilities to bear that are not normally engaged in this production field and then make those allocations as difficult as that might be across the country versus having every health care facility in every state and every locality and the federal government all competing with each other for these scarce products its creating an issue across this entire supply chain including placing equipment that is not needed as of this writing supplies are going where it is not needed and not going to where it is desperately needed now so back to the crisis leadership whereas i wanted to give you something different i think this is the most important issue we need to see changing and need to see immediate improvement i trust dr tony fauci first we need to change the medical and public health curriculum globally to include zoonotic diseases or those that are spread from reservoir animals to human animals currently this has not been a priority in education and health delivery medical efforts must not be directed at response phase alone but across the entire disaster cycle prevention preparedness response recovery and rehabilitation health must take ownership this applies to all health populations as well as being supported by the societies and the governments they live in the who and its international health regulation treaty organized to manage population-based diseases such as influenza sars h1n1 mers hiv and ebola have failed to meet population-based expectations in part this is due to influence from powerful political donors which the who is totally dependent on for their existence and which has become most painfully evident in the current covid-19 pandemic the who must exist solely as a treaty-based organization sanctioned and totally funded by the united nations and all its members it cannot be dependent on outside financial assistance to do its work the global community can no longer tolerate an ineffectual and passive international response system nor tolerate the self-serving political interference that authoritarian regimes and others have exercised over the who and expect to do in the future in a highly integrated globalized world both the who and its treaty have the potential to become one of the most effective mechanisms for crisis response and risk reduction world-wide practitioners and health decision-makers must break their silence and advocate for a stronger treaty a return of the whos singular global authority and support a highly coordinated population-based management as sir william osler who was the father of zoonotic diseases recognized his concept of one medicine one health first written in the early 1900s defines what global public health is striving for today public health and public health infrastructure and systems in developing countries must be seen as strategic and security issues that deserve international public health resource monitoring again this must cover the entire disaster cycle from prevention preparedness response recovery and rehabilitation also all six who regional offices must have similar multidisciplinary professional assets in support of zoonotic sciences which of course would be further resourced from who global assets during any epidemic or pandemic the goal is to identify and begin the containment process as early as possible i must say that america is going to do poorly the 50 states are performing as 50 different countries - it is insane the individual states departments of health are all run by political appointees and differ greatly in capability capacity and containment decisions some departments are excellent models of efficiency while others do not even have a department building to call their own lastly collectively we must begin now to think and plan for a new generation in every country of the credentials of health care managers and scientists who are trained across the entire disaster cycle to anticipate and manage population-based crises epidemics and pandemics are not the only entities that have the potential to devastate societies nuclear war climate change and biodiversity loss alone can lead to global devastation however i am aware that my italian colleagues before this pandemic occurred have seriously addressed and requested funding for a phd-level training program for professional health care managers and scientists within the european union this must be supported to fuel the expertise of a future who and international health regulation globally as well as in individual countries there is no excuse the three questions posed to the expert panel moderated and summarized by dr keim in real-time are summarized here in toto particular concerns the members of the panel expressed focused on the scarcity of ppe and the fragility of the supply chain for our health care system as well as the strategic national stockpile two members felt the defense production act was being under-utilized in regard to emergency manufacturing of resources and there is concern this could force physicians to make life or death resource rationing decisions without guidance the italian system is currently stressed in terms of space staff and equipment and more focus should be placed on the outside of the hospital setting including ems primary care and post-discharge care disaster response is certainly made more complicated by the type of government philosophy and attitude in different countries deficiencies in medical education in global health are also being seen the second question prompted answers that uniformly praised the response of the individual health care worker and the general public response across western countries similarly knowledge sharing between countries has been a strength the strategic national stockpile has been used to address shortages and has saved lives however its limitations have been now made apparent fema has been granted the authority to respond to pandemic events which is new and is also seen as a positive global public health is also having its moment in the sun and showing its value the final question generated enthusiastic answers in regard to failures in leadership at the highest levels it was stated or implied that the president and the who have extremely valuable roles during times of crisis such as this and it was universally believed among the american panelists that there has been a failure by both in regard to crisis leadership and communication better pandemic response education and communication within hospitals was also highlighted  introducing a new algorithm for classification of etiology in studies on

alfvn   respiratory infection is a common reason among children for seeking care 1 the majority of respiratory infections in children are caused by viruses 2 nevertheless viral and bacterial infections are hard to distinguish clinically causing many children with viral infections or self-limiting bacterial infections to receive unnecessary antibiotic treatment which contributes to the development and spread of antibiotic resistance 34 there is a need for new biomarkers that better distinguish viral infections from antibiotic-requiring bacterial infections in children presenting with clinical community-acquired pneumonia cap and that assist health care workers in decision making and improving the rational use of antibiotics 5 c-reactive protein crp procalcitonin pct and white blood cell wbc count are the most commonly used inflammatory markers in clinical practice for the management of children with suspected cap 67 there is increasing evidence that pct is superior to crp as a screening test for serious bacterial infection given the favorable kinetics including a more rapid response to inflammation 8 however neither of the biomarkers have been proven to be reliable in differentiating between mild or moderate bacterial and viral cap 910 a wbc count of 15000l has been suggested as a cutoff to differentiate between viral and bacterial etiologies however critically ill patients with neutropenia will not have an increased wbc count and certain viruses such as influenza and adenovirus can elicit a strong immune response with a high wbc count greater than 15000l 11 neither is a complete blood count reliable in differentiating between bacterial and viral cap in children 6 to date most biomarkers used in clinical practice have been selected for their ability to identify serious bacterial infections and there is a need for novel biomarkers that can reliably detect viral infections 12 myxovirus resistance protein a mxa is an intracellular protein that is upregulated upon activation of the antiviral defense system increased blood mxa has been reported to be specific for viral infection 13-15 there is a commercially available rapid diagnostic test febridx that qualitatively detects mxa and crp at cutoffs of 40 ngml and 20 mgml respectively the test has been reported to have 85 2934 sensitivity and 934 183196 specificity to rule out a bacterial infection in patients adults and children with febrile respiratory infection 16 however no studies have focused on mxa in children with cap it was previously shown that virus-positive asymptomatic children had lower mxa levels as compared with virus-positive symptomatic children with respiratory symptoms 14 as current viral real-time polymerase chain reaction pcr testing of upper respiratory specimens ie the routine method for diagnosing respiratory tract infections is complicated by frequent asymptomatic detection mxa has the potential to facilitate the interpretation of viral pcr positivity in terms of clinical relevance in children with cap 17 defining etiology in childhood cap is complex 18 until recently our conception of cap etiology has largely relied on early lung-aspirate studies from the 1970s to 1980s 19 vaccination against streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae type b the 2 major causative agents in childhood cap has been introduced in most parts of the world during the last two decades coinciding with a global decrease in childhood cap mortality 20 this has also contributed to a shift in the etiology of cap 2122 other important factors include a globally improved socioeconomic and nutritional status a sharp decrease in the incidence of measles and the emergence of hiv 5 recently new cap etiology studies including the large-scale pneumonia etiology research for child health perch study have been conducted mostly with a low-income country focus 21-24 these have pointed toward an underestimation of viral and mixed viral-bacterial etiologies which is likely explained by the aforementioned shift in etiology but also by the recent advances in viral diagnostics 25 moreover bordetella pertussis and bordetella parapertussis the causative agents of whooping cough have been associated with cap 2126 these bacteria are highly contagious and can cause severe disease particularly in infants 27 recent studies have reported an increasing incidence of b pertussis and there have been several deaths in previously healthy infants associated with whooping cough in sweden over the last 10 years 2829 consequently there is a need for new updated studies on cap etiology in various settings current treatment options with antivirals for respiratory viruses are limited however there are several new antivirals that are being developed 30 and furthermore there is a value in diagnosing viral infections to predict the clinical course and infectivity and to give confidence to withhold the prescription of antibiotics real-time pcr is a sensitive molecular-based method that is currently considered gold standard for the detection of respiratory viruses in children with respiratory tract infection 25 nevertheless as pcr usually has to be run in central laboratories and requires complex instrumentation the turnaround time can be long and the test results are rarely used for decision making regarding treatment at the point of care there are currently several new antigen-based point-of-care tests for respiratory infections on the market one is the multianalyte point-of-care antigen detection test system maripoc respi arcdia international oy ltd that uses a 2-photon excitation assay technique to detect 10 different respiratory viruses influenza ab respiratory syncytial virus rsv adenovirus bocavirus coronavirus human metapneumovirus hmpv and parainfluenza virus piv 1-3 31 the advantage of the test is that it gives a preliminary result of strongly positive samples already after 20 min and a final result including negative results within 2 hours which potentially allows for immediate treatment considerations in children the maripoc respis sensitivity for rsv and influenza virus has been reported to be as high as 90 as compared with pcr but the sensitivity for less common respiratory viruses such as hmpv and piv and the newly included coronavirus and bocavirus has been insufficiently investigated 3233 recombinase polymerase amplification rpa is a nucleic acid amplification technique that does not require thermal cycling an rpa-based point-of-care test could combine the advantage of high sensitivity with short turnaround time an rpa-based test using a paper-based vertical flow microarray technique is currently being developed by our partners at the science for life laboratory scilifelab 34-37 as the test reaction is carried out at room temperature it is an interesting method for resource-limited settings where the need for new diagnostic tests is particularly high 3839 studies on the long-term outcomes of radiologically confirmed bacterial cap have indicated that the disease is associated with later development of asthma and decreased lung function 4041 however most of these studies have followed children who were born more than two decades ago and the risk might therefore not generalize to a modern setting given the reported shift in etiology of pediatric cap 42 hence there is a need for new studies of long-term complications from pediatric cap such as the development of asthma and the risk for future respiratory infections in summary there is a need for 1 assessing the diagnostic accuracy of mxa as a biomarker for viral childhood cap 2 new studies on clinical cap etiology in children 3 evaluating the antigen-based point-of-care test maripoc 4 evaluating a novel rpa-based point-of-care test developed at scilifelab and v assessing long-term complications from cap including the risk of developing asthma and the risk for future respiratory infections the overarching aim of the trial of respiratory infections in children for enhanced diagnostics trend study is to improve the differential diagnosis of bacterial and viral etiologies in children aged below 5 years with clinical cap the specific objectives of the study are as follows the trend study is a hospital-based prospective observational study of children with clinical cap and asymptomatic controls the study will take place at sachs children and youth hospital stockholm which has one of the largest pediatric emergency departments in sweden with over 30000 visits each year the study is planned to be conducted from november 2017 to december 2019 the study is registered at clinicaltrialsgov id nct03233516 july 28 2017 children aged 1 to 59 months with clinical cap both severe and nonsevere according to the world health organization who criteria are enrolled as cases figure 1 the inclusion criteria all inclusion criteria to be met to be eligible for participation in the study are as follows age 1 to 59 months reported or observed breathing troublescoughing observed age-adjusted tachypnea 50 breathsmin in children aged 1-12 months 40min in children aged 1 year or

bronchodilator 1 dose in children aged 2 years and 3 doses in children aged 2-4 years will be administered to children with wheezing and chest indrawing to improve the specificity of the who clinical cap criteria as suggested by the perch study team 43 resolved chest indrawing after bronchodilator challenge will be recorded but not considered as an exclusion criterion to be able to exclude these patients in a subanalysis as well as to analyze these patients separately children aged 1 to 59 months treated for a minor orthopedic elective eg hand surgery or acute or minor surgical disease for example minor trauma excluding appendicitis major burns major trauma etc are enrolled as controls no formal matching will be performed but age and season will be considered in the analyses the exclusion criteria are symptoms of respiratory disease 7 days before enrollment previous inclusion as a control in the study or hospitalized during the previous 14 days the guardians of the controls will be contacted by emailtelephone 1 to 2 weeks after enrollment to collect information regarding the potential respiratory symptoms developed after discharge cases and controls will be included in the emergency unit and additional controls will also be included in the hand surgery unit of the hospital capillary blood samples and nasopharyngeal aspirates and swabs will be collected from all study subjects for the mxa analysis 20 l of blood will be collected using a heparinized plastic end-to-end capillary and then immediately diluted in a prefilled tube containing an in-house buffer 14 the nasopharyngeal swabs for the maripoc respi analyses will be diluted in 13 ml of a commercial buffer as advised by the manufacturer arcdia international oy ltd the nasopharyngeal aspirates for the pcr analyses will be collected in a standardized manner as has previously been published but mixed with 13 ml of saline to mirror the protocol for the maripoc respi 17 all samples will be taken within 24 hours from arrival at the emergency unit and the time of blood and nasopharynx sampling will be recorded it will also be noted if antibiotics have been given before sampling samples that are not analyzed at the point of care will be stored at 80c and shipped on dry ice to minimize degradation of the analytes of interest all samples collected in the study will be stored according to the swedish act biobanks in medical care sfs 2002297 real-time pcr analysis based on the taqman technique will be performed in batches on the nasopharyngeal aspirates at sahlgrenska university laboratory gothenburg using previously described methods 44 the pcr detects the following respiratory agents influenza ab rsv ab adenovirus bocavirus coronavirus hku1 nl63 oc43 and 229e hmpv piv 1-3 rhinovirus enterovirus s pneumoniae h influenzae

test detects the following respiratory agents influenza ab rsv adenovirus bocavirus coronavirus hmpv piv 1-3 and s pneumoniae analyses of mxa will be performed in batches at the institute of biomedicine university of turku finland using an in-house enzyme immunoassay as previously described 14 crp will be analyzed using the alere afinion as100 analyzer commercial point-of-care kit at the emergency room at sachs children and youth hospital if multiple crp tests are performed the highest value less than 48 hours from arrival at the emergency unit will be recorded 45 a small amount of

national health and population registers to collect information regarding deaths previous immunization and discharge diagnoses according to the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems 10 icd-10 as well as anatomic therapeutic chemical classification system codes for prescribed drugs the algorithm for classifying etiology in the trend study is based on the current literature and will classify children into viral bacterial atypical bacterial mixed viral-bacterial and undetermined infections based on clinical microbiological radiographic and biochemical findings figure 2 a second stricter algorithm only considering microbiologically confirmed diagnoses will be used in a complementary subanalysis figure 3 long-term complications asthma and number of hospital-requiring respiratory infections will be assessed by linking to the national patient register asthma will be classified according to the icd-10 diagnosis andor prescriptions of asthma medication in the swedish prescribed drug register using a previously validated algorithm 48 a total of 300 cases and 120 controls are estimated to be included in the trend study for the sample size calculation we focused on the assessment of mxa levels in cases with viral cap as compared with cases with bacterial capcontrols study i overall 2 power calculations were made 1 for viral cap versus bacterial cap and 1 for viral cap versus controls the following assumptions were made 1 a difference in mxa level of 500 gl between the groups was considered clinically relevant 2 a standard deviation of 1000 and 300 was assumed in cases with viral cap and bacterial capcontrols respectively based on previous studies on mxa 1314 using an alpha level of 05 2 sided at an 80 power with an additional 20 to account for nonparametric testing and multivariate analyses 42 children in each group viral cap bacterial cap and controls would be needed to ensure that enough of the included cases would fulfill the study definitions for viral and bacterial cap the proportion of children with viral and bacterial cap trend definition was calculated in our previous study that assessed swedish children with x-rayverified cap 47 by doing this the prevalence of viral and bacterial cap was estimated at 45 and 14 respectively hence 300 cases and 42 controls would be needed to ensure sufficient collection of cases with viral and bacterial cap respectively we also would like to compare viral cap cases with controls testing positive for 1 or more viruses by pcr in our previous study 354 of asymptomatic children tested positive for 1 or more viruses hence to include a sufficient number of virus-positive controls we aim at including 300 cases and 120 controls in the trend study a clinically relevant difference in mxa levels will be compared between cases with viral and bacterial clinical cap as well as between cases with viral clinical cap and controls using appropriate statistical methods according to the number and distribution of data points sensitivity and specificity for different respiratory viruses with maripoc respi and the novel rpa-based test will be calculated as compared with real-time pcr the difference in asthma prevalence and the difference in the number of hospital-requiring respiratory infections between cases and controls as well as between cases and the general child population will be assessed after 3 7 and if deemed necessary 10 years data will be presented with 95 ci and a p value of 05 will be considered significant the study will be conducted in accordance with the latest version of the declaration of helsinki and the fundamental principles of respect for the individuals article 8 right to self-determination and to make informed decisions articles 20 21 and 22 regarding participation in research both initially and during the course of the research we estimate that the benefit of knowing more about viral respiratory infections with the aim of improving diagnostics of cap overweighs the discomfort for the individual study participant in terms of extra sampling for all the participating children a minimal reduced amount of blood will be collected and accordingly the analysis of pct and crp will not routinely be performed in control children for the following reasons 1 data on these biomarkers in the controls are not necessary for the study objectives 2 to get a sufficient amount of blood for running these analyses it would require a larger lancet andor additional punctures and 3 these children would likely not have been subject to capillary puncture were they not enrolled in the study results from point-of-care tests will be provided to guardians and treating physicians other test results will not be provided as they will be analyzed in batches and thus not influence management written informed consents will be collected from the guardians by the study nursephysician before sampling to ensure confidentiality for the participants samples will be given a study id and results will only be presented at a group level data of personal identities will be stored in a password-protected data file at sachs children and youth hospital and will only be available to the study researchers good clinical practice and good laboratory practice will be followed the study was approved by the regional ethical review board in stockholm ref 2017958-31 the study was approved by the regional ethical review board in stockholm in june 2017 ref 2017958-31 a pilot study was performed from june to august 2017 to evaluate the study protocol from a logistical and methodological point of view overall 6 out of 9 invited cases and 1 out of 3 invited controls were included valuable information was retrieved during the pilot study which has led to alterations and improvements in the recruitment process the questionnaire and other study documents as well in the logistics and handling process of the samples enrollment of study subjects started in november 2017 results are expected by the end of 2019 the trend study aims to improve the differential diagnosis of bacterial and viral etiology in children aged below 5 years with clinical cap presenting at an emergency unit in a tertiary pediatric hospital in sweden this is the first study of children with clinical cap that evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of mxa as a biomarker for viral cap previous studies on mxa have shown promising results on the role of mxa as a biomarker for viral infection but have been smaller in size 14 or have included more heterogeneous groups of study subjects 131516 the trend study aims to add further information on the role of mxa as a marker to improve the interpretation of viral pcr positivity and to differentiate between viral and bacterial infections with a specific focus on children with cap further aims are to validate the findings from recent pediatric cap etiology studies including the epic and perch studies as well as to assess the long-term complications of pediatric cap 21-24 one major weakness in the studies of diagnostic biomarkers in pediatric infectious diseases is the lack of a reliable gold standard for the microbiological diagnosis 549 the gold standard for assigning bacterial etiology has traditionally been the detection of bacteria in cultures from normally sterile sites lung blood and pleura however as sampling from the lungpleura is infeasible in most cases and blood cultures have limited sensitivity this approach is of little use in clinical studies of cap 5 previous studies assessing the performance of diagnostic tests in terms of distinguishing bacterial infections from viral infections have used either an independent expert panel or a laboratory-radiological-based approach to classify disease etiology 12-15 both approaches have their advantages and limitations using a strict microbiologically confirmed diagnosis as the reference has the advantage of high specificity but the generalizability of the findings is hampered as the majority of children in clinical practice will not have a clear microbiologically confirmed diagnosis in addition for a diagnostic test to be useful it is more important to distinguish between etiologically less clear cases of respiratory infections rather than to identify the school book examples of bacterial and viral infections in the trend study we chose a more pragmatic approach favoring generalizability for microbiological accuracy however given that doctors in expert panels rely on microbiological and biochemical findings we reasoned that it still would be more stringent to create an algorithm for the classification of etiology in the trend study a diagnostic algorithm has been created a priori to serve as the reference based on the current evidence for the classification of cap etiology detection of rsv hmpv influenza virus and piv has in previous case-control studies been highly associated with cap furthermore these viruses appear to be rarely detected in asymptomatic individuals and hence detection will be considered to be a definitive indicator of etiology 2122475051 for other respiratory viruses as well as for the atypical bacteria m pneumoniae the clinical significance of pcr positivity is less clear owing to frequent detections in asymptomatic children 1752-55 for that reason pcr positivity will not be considered enough for establishing etiology virkki et al reported that a crp level of more than 80 in children aged less than or equal to 2 years and more than 120 in children aged 2 to 5 years was specific 85 for bacterial etiology whereas a crp level of less than 20 was specific for viral etiology 78 56 these cutoffs will be used to aid in the definition of probable bacterial and viral infections in less clear cases hence detection of viruses other than influenza rsv hmpv and piv will be considered as viral infections only if the crp value is less than 20 given that adenovirus has been associated with high crp this rule will not be applicable for adenovirus 11 however adenovirus detections will not be considered in the strict algorithm as asymptomatic detection of the virus is common 17 finally given that crp levels depend on the disease duration and to avoid false-negative test results ie low but rising crp values an additional criterion of reported fever duration of more than 24 hours will be applied in the trend study when considering crp levels 45 as discussed above there is no optimal reference standard for the classification of cap etiology neither clinically nor in research however we believe that much is to be gained if we use an algorithm instead of an expert panel the decisions taken by expert panels differ between different studies over time and between different settings when using an algorithm this can be controlled for we look forward to comments and inputs on our algorithm so that together we can develop it further the who criteria for clinical cap lack specificity and will result in the inclusion of a significant proportion of children who will not have true cap including children with bronchiolitis and asthma 57 to improve the specificity of the who criteria for clinical cap a rapid-acting bronchodilator will be administered to children with wheezing and chest indrawing as suggested by the perch study team 43 other clinical parameters from the perch study will also be included and used for further subanalyses 43 conducting research in the pediatric emergency department is difficult 58 high patient flows and long waiting times create a stressful environment for all personnel categories motivating nursesdoctors to spend the extra time and effort it takes to recruit patients is therefore challenging continuous educationinformation about the research project interpersonnel teamwork nurse and doctor and incentives are all key success factors recruitment of healthy controls in this age group is an obvious challenge as the sampling blood and nasopharyngeal sampling causes discomfort to the child therefore attempts have been made to include patients who will undergo elective hand surgery and thereby be sedated during the sampling certain clinical parameters can be deceptive if not recorded correctly which is a potential source of bias in children where peripheral oxygen saturation and heart rate are measured continuously data will still only be recorded at certain time points when the children are at rest transcriptomic studies have shown promise in differentiation between different infectious agents but currently require advanced instrumentation with a long turnaround time and are hence more suitable for an intensive care unit setting than for routine testing at pediatric emergency units 59 however given the complexity of the host immune response elicited by respiratory pathogens it is possible that a single biomarker will not be sufficient to accurately differentiate between viral and bacterial cap however mxa could be valuable in a rapid combination test of biomarkers and selected microbiological testing if it proves to be specific for viral cap such commercial combination point-of-care tests of inflammatory biomarkers are already being developed and some such as febridx and memed bv have shown promise 1560 improved near-patient differential diagnosis is a prerequisite for rational antibiotic use and decreasing unnecessary antibiotic treatment furthermore easier identification of the pathogens causing acute respiratory infections makes it easier to advise guardians to care for their sick children and for better disease surveillance in the society hence the findings from the trend project can be an important step toward the improved care of children with clinical cap at this stage the methods are developed and evaluated in a swedish context but might have wider implications for example to resource-limited settings where the need for similar tests is even higher than in a high-income context such as sweden  guidelines for balancing priorities in structural heart disease during the covid-19 pandemic jaffar khan m nauman khalid evan shlofmitz brian forrestal j charan yerasi brian case c chava chezar-azerrad anees musallam toby rogers ron waksman   during the global novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic resources are being redirected toward treating patients infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 virus in order to meet the challenges of the pandemic hospitals have been directed to cease elective work especially elective surgeries that utilize valuable ventilators and occupy intensive care unit icu beds structural heart disease interventions particularly transcatheter aortic valve replacement tavr for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis as and transcatheter mitral valve repair with a mitraclip abbott chicago il for severe mitral regurgitation mr have important prognostic and symptomatic benefits as the covid-19 pandemic continues to linger with possibilities of recurrent future spikes guidelines are required for how and when to manage patients requiring these interventions the canadian association of interventional cardiology caic has published guidelines on performing coronary and structural cardiac interventions stratified by the time phase of the pandemic 1 during periods of minor restrictions in regular services tavr is recommended only in patients with an increased risk of complications in the near term ie low ejection fraction ef valve-in-valve with severe aortic regurgitation recent hospitalization with a short expected length of stay los mitraclip is recommended in patients with repeated heart failure admissions during a time of major restrictions in services tavr and mitraclip procedures are only recommended for inpatients in whom these procedures would expedite hospital discharge when there is an inability to provide services because of staff or resource limitations then a complete cessation of tavr and mitraclip procedures is recommended at all time points a complete cessation of the performance of atrial septal defect asd patent foramen ovale pfo and left atrial appendage laa closure procedures is recommended in a consensus statement from the society for cardiovascular angiography and interventions scai and the american college of cardiology acc the authors proposed performing tavr to treat symptomatic severe as in all inpatients if they had reduced ef secondary to as new york heart association nyha class iiiiv heart failure secondary to as or syncope secondary to as 2 the authors recommended treating outpatients with severe to critical as if they had syncope due to nyha class iiiiv heart failure treatment could be considered in minimally symptomatic patients with echocardiographic measures consistent with very severe as based on gradient and valve area the authors recommended deferring treatment in asymptomatic patients with severe to critical as but urged weekly remote check-in whereas the caic proposes a major scaling down of operations in a time-sensitive manner the scaiacc statement recommends treatment in a larger cohort of patients and voices comfort with deferring treatment only in asymptomatic patients many practical details for the heart team the operators and the hospital administration are understandably missing we recognize that this is an evolving situation in which guidelines need to be flexible and hospitals need to be nimble the guidelines proposed in this manuscript attempt to provide cohesive guidance for structural heart disease treatment in the united states given our current knowledge of the covid-19 pandemic and keeping in mind patient and healthcare safety and resource allocation fig 1
 practical details missing in the existing guidelines are provided the guidelines account for a prolonged phase of the pandemic with potential future spikes in infection many questions remain unanswered how do we maintain rapidly evolving guidelines that are uniform across all states and hospitals should we designate one hospital per city to continue servicing patients with structural heart disease during the covid-19 pandemic era what should be the criteria to select such an institution and how do we protect that institutions services from being overrun by the covid-19 response we believe it is vitally important that physicians track cardiovascular outcomes especially when they are scaling down the interventions offered in addition to recording and tracking this using centers for medicare and medicaid services cms data valve coordinators should keep a local log of patients and update these following weekly phone calls with patients if there is a signal of increased death as a result of delaying treatment then that should trigger an immediate reassessment of guidelines healthcare distancing should be practiced in the catheterization laboratory during structural cases teams of operators technicians and nurses should be assigned where possible with minimal contact between teams this may prevent a scenario in which all the structural operators in an institution are either sick or in quarantine because of exposure to sars-cov-2 and the hospital is unable to provide services such a scenario has the potential for cascading effects on cardiovascular surgery services which would hamper an institutions ability to offer mechanical circulatory support including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo in critically ill covid-19 patients moreover the number of healthcare workers in a procedure should be restricted to a minimum trainees may be reallocated to frontline services during peak times preserving vital resources and personnel is important this includes the use of icu beds ventilators and anesthesiologists during and after the procedure we will discuss the specifics of this for each procedure below as the use of personal protective equipment ppe and ventilators ramps up in certain areas and hospitals it is important to continue servicing patients with structural heart disease as some hospitals continue to work at 50 of their capacity decision-making on resource-intensive cases should be shared between the heart team and hospital management if a procedure mandates the use of a ventilator it is important that both the heart team and a high-level hospital administrator are involved in the decision-making research cases may be considered for patients who require urgent treatment and still fit the study inclusionexclusion criteria while elective cases can be postponed until the worst of the pandemic is over the treating team should strongly consider switching urgent cases to commercial therapies research cases require extra staff including proctors industry representatives engineers research nurse coordinators and often extra investigations and resource utilization monitoring bodies should consider relaxing protocol violations on follow-up visits and timeframes for structural heart disease research patients and allow telehealth follow-ups remote communication should be utilized more often including guidance and proctoring vendors and specialists who are required to prepare the valve before deployment should be authorized to visit the hospital wear adequate ppe and leave as soon the procedure is complete finally each hospital should consider where it stands in the time course of the pandemic cutting down on cases too early may unnecessarily delay important procedures this may also adversely impact the institutions financial health and impair its ability to operate effectively procure extra supplies and recruit additional staff conversely continuing elective cases when the hospital is overrun with covid-19 cases takes away vital resources exposes patients and healthcare workers to unnecessary infection risk and may overburden the system we do not have clear evidence of when to resume services and need guidance from patterns in countries that have recovered from the pandemic symptomatic severe as carries an abysmal prognosis with a 1- to 2-year mortality rate of 50 3 the patients who do worse when treated conservatively are those older than 80 years of age with chronic kidney disease heart failure ef 40 pulmonary artery systolic pressure 60 mmhg and moderate or severe mr 4 information on patient outcomes during wait times for tavr has been accrued from ontario where the mean wait time was 80 days from diagnosis to tavr these patients had a mortality rate of 2 and a heart failure admission rate of 12 at 80 days 5 predictors of poor outcomes on the waitlist included older age low ef valve-in-valve with aortic regurgitation and prior heart failure admission 5 minimalist tavr improves procedural efficiency and reduces los 6 predictors of next-day discharge include younger age low creatinine absence of atrial fibrillation lower nyha class and higher ejection fraction and use of conscious sedation and transfemoral access 78 unfortunately the patients who are most likely to be discharged the next day are generally not the ones who would benefit most from urgent tavr therefore a careful balance needs to be struck we recommend the following1continue to perform tavr for symptomatic severe as in patients with increased risk of complications in the near term ie old age low ef heart failure hospitalization valve-in-valve with aortic regurgitation during the surge phase of the pandemic2patients who can be delayed include those who are younger and mildly symptomatic with preserved ef and not in nyha class iiiiv valve coordinators should follow up with these patients weekly by phone to monitor their symptoms3during the pandemic peak tavr should only be performed in inpatients in whom the procedure will facilitate discharge from the hospital4where possible tavr should be performed via the transfemoral route if there is a high risk for major vascular complications for example in borderline calcified and tortuous vessels then consider delaying those cases5moderate conscious sedation should be used and be nurse-led to free up anesthesiologists and ventilators6icu admission post-procedure should be avoided7a local algorithm for rhythm disturbances should be instituted to facilitate next-day discharge this would include either electrophysiological study or remote rhythm monitoring for at-risk patients and weekly telephone calls for the first month8structural operators should be divided into teams to minimize potential exposures9the number of healthcare workers should be limited to a maximum of five per case  one interventional cardiologist one cardiothoracic surgeon a running and recording nurse a scrub technician and a nurse for moderate sedation10teleclinics should be run for follow-up and for monitoring of patients who have had their procedures postponed11all patients being admitted for a procedure should be tested for covid-19 regardless of their signs or symptoms12strongly consider postponing tavr in covid-19-positive patients this also avoids prolonged laboratory or computed tomography scanner down time after contact with a patient with covid-1913each lab should develop ppe protocols for all laboratory staff during the local peak of the pandemic consideration should be made for all staff to wear n95 respirators and face shields for all cases because of the poor sensitivity of current covid tests14we do not recommend tavr in patients with covid-19 who are intubated balloon aortic valvuloplasty bav may be considered in rare cases in which the severe as is preventing ventilator weaning15case suitability should be determined by the heart team if a ventilator anesthesiologist or icu bed is required the decision to proceed should be made in consultation with hospital management16new patients should be screened in a virtual clinic with risk stratification for urgent or delayed tavr assessment that requires in-person contact should be skipped or delayed until the day of the procedure17coronary angiography should be performed at the time of tavr to reduce the number of visits with ad hoc percutaneous coronary intervention for high-grade proximal stenoses if deemed appropriate18tavr should be preferred over surgical aortic valve replacement because of the decreased length of stay and valuable resource utilization19regional centers for tavr should be established during the surge phase of the pandemic taking into consideration geographic coverage and center tavr volumes this would enable streamlined services for patients who need them while freeing up peripheral hospitals to deal with the pandemic criteria for regional centers should be established by cms using principles of just allocation of resources and patient access to care
 many of the principles that apply to tavr also apply to transcatheter mitral valve repair with the mitraclip a few specific points are mentioned below1patients with increased risk of complications in the near term particularly with repeated admissions for heart failure secondary to severe or moderate-to-severe primary mr that can be treated with a mitraclip should be treated during the surge phase of the pandemic2during the pandemic peak inpatients with heart failure secondary to severe primary mr should be offered mitraclip therapy when it will expedite hospital discharge3these procedures require transesophageal echocardiography tee ventilator use and an anesthesiologist so careful case selection is necessary4attempting tee under moderate sedation in patients with refractory heart failure is not recommended there is no widespread experience using intracardiac echocardiography alone to guide mitraclip implantation
 these procedures should be delayed until the pandemic has abated these are difficult times for everyone keeping our patients and ourselves safe as well as justly rationing resources is paramount different strategies are required during surge and peak times of the pandemic priority should be given to procedures that will facilitate discharge of patients by collecting data and sharing experiences we can optimize our response to the pandemic designated centers that continue structural heart disease intervention should be considered to provide safe services to our patients during the

concurrently concerns about potential shortages of healthcare professionals and health supplies to address these needs have focused attention on how resources are ultimately allocated and used some strategies misguidedly use age as an arbitrary criterion which inappropriately disfavors older adults this statement represents the official policy position of the american geriatrics society ags it is intended to inform stakeholders including hospitals health systems and policymakers about ethical considerations to consider when developing strategies for allocating scarce resources during an emergency involving older adults members of the ags ethics committee collaborated with interprofessional experts in ethics law nursing and medicine including geriatrics palliative care emergency medicine and pulmonologycritical care to conduct a structured literature review and examine relevant reports the resulting recommendations defend a particular view of distributive justice that maximizes relevant clinical factors and de-emphasizes or eliminates factors placing arbitrary disproportionate weight on advanced age the ags positions include 1 avoiding age per se as a means for excluding anyone from care 2 assessing comorbidities and considering the disparate impact of social determinants of health 3 encouraging decision makers to focus primarily on potential shortterm not long-term outcomes 4 avoiding ancillary criteria such as -life-years saved and -long-term predicted life expectancy that might disadvantage older people 5 forming and staffing triage committees tasked with allocating scarce resources 6 developing institutional resource allocation strategies that are transparent and applied uniformly and 7 facilitating appropriate advance care planning the statement includes recommendations that should be accepted article 5 immediately implemented to address resource allocation strategies during covid-19 aligning with ags positions the statement also includes recommendations for post-pandemic review such review would support revised strategies to ensure that governments and institutions have equitable emergency resource allocation strategies avoid future discriminatory language and practice and have appropriate guidance to develop national frameworks for emergent resource allocation decisions consequences of severe illness hospitalization and death the extent to which this disproportionate impact is due to factors such as the disease itself versus the response of health care systems to the disease is unknown concerns about potential shortages of ventilators icu beds and hospital bedsboth now and in the fall when resource shortages caused by any surge in covid-19 will likely be intensified due to influenza -have focused attention on how decisions to allocate these scarce resources are being made many of the initially available resource allocation strategies were informed by the h1n1 pandemic over ten years ago the first resource allocation strategy specific to covid-19 was developed in northern italy 12  where the number of people with this illness far exceeded available resources since then several frameworks have been put forward that address rationing of scarce resources in times of crisis 3 4 5 however some strategies adopted by states and professional societies apply age as a criterion in a way that disproportionately disfavors older adults such as categorical exclusions based on advanced age 67 raising concerns that older adults may be treated unjustly when there is an emergency need to ration resources due to a crisis such as the covid-19 pandemic the authors developed this ags position statement and the companion manuscript -rationing limited health care resources in the covid-19 era and beyond ethical considerations regarding older adults 8 within the context of a society in which too few adults have engaged in meaningful advance care planning discussions with their families and loved ones and as a result have not completed an advance directive 9 we also considered the overall the american geriatrics society is a nationwide not-for-profit society of geriatrics healthcare professionals dedicated to improving the health independence and quality of life of older people our 6000 members include geriatricians geriatric nurses nurse practitioners social workers family practitioners physician assistants pharmacists internists and specialty physicians who are pioneers in advanced-illness care for older individuals ags recommendations for resource allocation strategies if emergency rationing is these recommendations were developed to guide hospitals health systems and policymakers in their efforts to develop emergency rationing strategies our recommendations are informed by a structured literature review and a discussion of a number of issues that are described more fully in our companion paper these issues include 1 age as a determining factor 2 age as a tiebreaker 3 criteria with a differential impact on older adults 4 individual choices and advance directives 5 racialethnic disparities and resource allocation 6 scoring systems and their impact on older adults and 7 the need for post-pandemic reviews 8 1 age per se should never be used as a means for a categorical exclusion from therapeutic interventions that represent the standard of care likewise specific age-based cutoffs should not be used in resource allocation strategies 2 when assessing comorbidities the disparate impact of social determinants of health including culture ethnicity socioeconomic status and other factors should be considered 3 multi-factor resource allocation strategies that equally weigh in-hospital survival and severe comorbidities contributing to short-term 6 month mortality should be the primary accepted article reimbursement for advance care planning discussions presents opportunities to increase advance directive completion completion of advance directives is necessary but insufficient there must also be a meaningful goals of care discussion focusing on what matters most to the patient and also ensuring patient understanding by accounting for cultural factors limited health literacy and sensory deficits that may impede communication advance care planning should not be limited to the purview of only the primary care geriatrics or palliative care health professional and urgent efforts should be made to discuss patient preferences before an emergent need arises all outpatient clinicians including subspecialists and particularly those who care for high-risk populations such as pulmonologists cardiologists rheumatologists nephrologists and transplant specialists should engage in this advance care planning effort in fact many of these specialists are best suited to assess their patients chronic illness such as the severity of a patients chronic lung disease and likelihood of survival through critical illness in order to guide decision making patients are grappling with the new realities of care with the rise in virtual care modalities and are looking to all providers to give them an individualized risk assessment should they become ill with covid-19 these conversations are opportunities to discuss advance care planning but providers should not pressure even subtly patients to engage in advance care planning or change to do not resuscitatedo not intubate dnrdni status with the intent to conserve health care resources the existence of a prior advance directive should be confirmed with the patient health care proxy or surrogate decision maker before medical decisions are made the most basic discussion should include a decision about a surrogate decision maker and more advanced conversations should include patient preferences about mechanical ventilation and if sought the the ags recommends enhancing the availability of hospice and palliative care within post-acute facilities long-term care and assisted living facilities and removing barriers to obtaining palliative care and hospice care in these settings 23 for those individuals who are 1 critically ill but elect against high-intensity treatment measures or 2 are unlikely to benefit from critical care or 3 when it is compellingly clear that health resources are limited and rationing decisions are in adherence with institutional policies supportive care services should be invested in as part of covid-19 surge preparations in acute care settings such as emergency departments  framework of a just society with a specific focus on health care systems and reviewed legal considerations we determined that it is important to include these three considerations in both this ags position statement and in the companion manuscript the covid-19 pandemic further highlights the widespread and urgent need for all adults to engage in advance care planning discussions and create an advance directive advance care planning discussions are of paramount importance to reduce the need to ration limited health care resources during an emergency because these discussions will identify people who do not wish to receive intensive care including mechanical ventilation a critical point in the discussion of advance care planning is that these discussions are not rationing and should not be confused with triage allocation decisions advance care planning discussions should occur before patients are in crisis and should be part of every patients individualized care plan 1011 a conversation with older patients about what matters most to them 12 and their goals of care should not lead health care providers to incorrectly infer that simply having had a goals of care discussion signals a clear preference for limited interventions also providers should be aware that care plans developed for anticipated longer term declines in health may not be applicable to sudden emergencies such as covid-19 and it is inappropriate to infer from a do not resuscitate order that a particular patient would necessarily refuse mechanical ventilation 13 achieving justice in resource allocation 14 15 16 a just health care system should treat similarly situated people equally as much as possible there is something particularly unjust about membership in a class such as an age group determining whether one receives health care not only is membership in a class defined by characteristics such as race sex or age beyond the individuals control but the use of these accepted article criteria might conceal implicit biases and other social inequities as health care is critically important to many other goods in life across the life span it may be distinct in terms of requiring equal access these factors suggest that basing resource allocation decisions on advanced age may violate the ethical principle of justice resource allocation strategies such as those proposed in response to covid-19 rely on different notions of distributive justice there are many contested theories and each theory claims to represent justice in the priority given certain factors or values when goods are distributed to society this position statement defends a view of distributive justice that maximizes relevant clinical factors and either de-emphasizes or eliminates factors that place an arbitrary and disproportionate weight on advanced age the non-discrimination section of the affordable care act  1557 prohibits discrimination in federally funded health care programs on the grounds prohibited by the age discrimination act of 1975 42 usc   6101-6107 the age discrimination act applies to discrimination on the basis of age which includes exclusion from participation in or denial of the benefits of any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance allocation frameworks that use age as a categorical exclusion violate this provision of federal antidiscrimination law whether provisions of the age discrimination act beyond identifying age as a category are also included by reference in  1557 is an unsettled legal question but if they are they would permit age to be used as a proxy for some other characteristic such as survivability that is necessary to the statutory objective or to the business and that cannot practically be measured in an individualized way the statute and implementing regulations would also permit use of reasonable factors other than age that have a disproportionate effect on persons of accepted article different ages if the factor bears a direct and substantial relationship to the programs normal operation or statutory objective 17 the legal question then would be whether factors such as longterm survival or life-years lived are reasonable factors other than age that meet this standard the ags ethics committee is charged with ensuring that every older american receives high-quality person-centered care by improving public and professional understanding of ethical and moral issues intrinsic in caring for older adults the committee developed these policy and clinical recommendations in collaboration with an interprofessional writing team of experts in ethics law nursing and medicine including geriatrics palliative care emergency medicine and pulmonologycritical care this team conducted a structured literature review and examined relevant reports and studies which are outlined in the companion paper 8 this statement represents the official policy position of the american geriatrics society it is intended to inform stakeholders including hospitals health systems and policymakers about ethical considerations involving older adults that should be considered when developing strategies for allocation of scarce resources during an emergency the rationale for each position is provided in a companion paper 8 accepted article allocation method in emergency circumstances that require rationing due to a lack of resources 4  in order to avoid biased resource allocation strategies criteria such as -life-years saved and -long-term predicted life expectancy should not be used as they disadvantage older adults  given the current and near-future implications of the covid-19 pandemic the ags recommends the following strategies for immediate implementation given the urgent need to implement these strategies we have included our rationale for each we recommend that institutions implement a multi-factor resource allocation strategy as the primary allocation method that equally weighs in-hospital survival and comorbidities contributing to short-term mortality  6 months rather than implementing a resource allocation strategy based primarily on lifecycle principles age should never be used as a categorical exclusion this violates the principle of justice and discriminates against older adults moreover a robust body of literature demonstrates that chronological age alone is less predictive of mortality than other factors such as functional trajectory 18  multimorbidity 19 20  and frailty 21 22 thus age is a poor proxy for projected outcomes moreover as discussed below including chronic comorbidities unlikely to affect survival or 6 month mortality is ethically problematic we recommend including only severe comorbidities likely to result in death over a short period of time such as 6 months it is important to note that reliance on in-hospital survival as a strategy is not at odds with policies at many institutions that withhold care that offers no possibility of clinical benefit the withholding of such futile care although reducing resource use is justified by the principle of beneficence that applies to persons of all ages in the event that resources are so constrained that emergency rationing must occur and for circumstances in which consideration is given to withdrawing resources due to medical futility -triage committees and -triage officers should be established and available around the accepted article clock to implement rationing strategies these third parties who are not members of the primary care team could integrate objective considerations about decision making with rationing early initiation of these roles would alleviate moral distress among front-line clinicians being able to rely on a pre-existing rationing strategy allows them to focus on clinical care clinicians at the front lines should be applyingnot selectingemergency rationing criteria when resources are limited in addition transparent criteria developed by -triage committees and -triage officers can be systematically reviewed for their potential to cause differential impact on underrepresented groups states and health systems should communicate clearly and transparently about the ethical resource allocation strategies that are proposed and selected transparent communication is crucial in promoting greater adherence to these strategies a clear description of legal and ethical accountability and responsibility regarding these policies is also needed during the covid-19 pandemic when information is changing rapidly policies and chosen strategies should come from a centralized source for direct communication to healthcare providers and clinicians all older adults should be encouraged to develop individual care plans 24 that include information such as lists of medical conditions medications and health care providers as well as advance directives the medicare annual wellness visit is an ideal setting for health care providers to establish and update these individual care plans with patients and their caregivers advance care planning must be prioritized both now and after covid-19 the rate of advance directive completion is unacceptably low at about 50 of adults over age 60 9 medicare accepted article clinicians assessment of the patients comorbidities and likelihood of survival following critical illness 10 25 advance care planning discussions should be documented appropriately and clearly with reliable contact information for surrogate decision makers although less ideal such discussions can also occur in the ed setting goals of care discussions should not attempt to dissuade patients from using a ventilator or focus on resource allocation generally but rather should the shifting of outpatient care delivery eg to telephone and virtual encounters should include intensive outreach efforts in order to identify highly vulnerable patients eg living alone cognitively impaired at high risk from the detrimental effects of social isolation and who in the absence of intensive telephone or virtual outreach would otherwise be less likely to engage in advance care planning in many cases critical advance care planning discussions may need to be conducted with a surrogate who cannot be with the patient due to physical distancing commonly referred to as social distancing or facility visitation restrictions these conversations can be appropriately performed as audio-only services the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms should allow payment for advance care planning that is provided via audio telephone only and extend changes to telehealth payment beyond the current emergency so that reimbursement is equivalent to in-person provision of advance care planning given the time-intensive nature of these discussions allocations created during the pandemic and on developing and implementing ethical resource allocation strategies to be used when emergency rationing is required 1 state and local governments and institutions should establish committees that include older adults to conduct a post-pandemic review of outcomes of emergency rationing strategies that were actually implemented this review process should be conducted using de-identified data and should include results such as survival rates stratified by age group and comorbidities with the goal of informing the development of a national framework that can guide institutions in developing decision-making strategies for resource allocation that are just and equitable 2 hospital ethics committees state officials and other relevant stakeholders should remove discriminatory provisions including age-based cutoffs which disfavor older adults from any resource allocation strategies including those that were developed during the covid-19 pandemic 3 health care facilities and systems that did not develop and do not currently have a resource allocation strategy should develop an ethical framework or adopt an existing ethical framework that incorporates the principles described in this ags position statement emergency resource allocation strategies during the era of covid-19 and during future pandemics must not disproportionately disfavor older adults ideally these strategies will be developed and integrated into institutional policies when an institution is not in crisis when developing and implementing such strategies key stakeholders including ethics committees accepted article health care systems and policymakers must not apply categorical age exclusions since such exclusions are unethical and violate anti-discrimination law ethical multi-factor resource allocation strategies exist that rely on in-hospital survival and severe comorbidities contributing to short-term 6 month mortality extreme care must be taken to consider the disparate impact on older adults of assessing comorbidities as part of resource allocation strategies as older adults are heterogeneous with respect to burden of comorbidities and functional status racial and ethnic minorities are at even greater risk of the disparate impacts of assessing comorbidities in resource allocation strategies moreover our understanding of covid-19 is rapidly evolving with respect to its pathophysiology genetics transmissibility clinical trajectory immune response optimum management strategies and individual and public health approaches this incomplete understanding of the disease limits the ability to prognosticate about its clinical course and therefore makes the application of ethical frameworks even more difficult front-line providers should not be expected to make rationing decisions in isolation and therefore must have guidance from clear consistent transparent and uniformly applied ethical resource allocation strategies as well as triage officers and committees who have updated information about the availability of health care resources so that resource allocation strategies are not activated by hospital or health system leadership too early or too late now and in the future intensive efforts to provide meaningful advance care planning must occur to ensure that patients wishes are respected older adults would be well served by an intensive post-pandemic review of resource allocation strategies as public health measures creative use of resources and shifting resources between states and communities become more commonplace the need for rationing may be reduced or eliminated when adequate resources are available patient preferences for care accepted article  navigating the impact of covid19 on palliative care for head and neck cancer arjun singh gurmeet jayita deodhar pankaj chaturvedi   less than a decade ago the worldwide palliative care alliance and the world health organization who declared palliative care as a human right
1
 but still in the best times palliative services are under resourced world over as health systems are strained by the ongoing pandemic providing this essential service has become an unaddressed ethical challenge health care services are being confronted by a daily dilemma of who can receive critical care and who cannot in palliative care services this apprehension gets exemplified as these patients have limited life expectancy in some sense both patients with covid19 and patients with head and neck cancer receiving palliative care run a similar disease course resources are frugally rationed time is always short patients deteriorate quickly and families are counseled regarding the grim prognosis what is worse is when a patient receiving palliative care contracts the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 sarscov2 it will result in isolation measures extending to the inevitable the head and neck region further makes things critical as it comprises of all the sites through which the sarscov2 can be transmittedoral oropharyngeal nasal and laryngopharyngeal most guidelines suggest that health care workers dealing with these sites either defer management of these patients or use appropriate protective measures
2
 this has led to many centers rescheduling appointments indefinitely causing a significant delay in their treatment this scenario is not limited to lowincome and middleincome countries with most western countries facing similar if not worse shortages of critical care in a time where hospital resources are sparse even to treat patients requiring definitive care how does one provide palliative care this document strives to define the ways in which the head and neck cancer services can contribute to better patient care in a triage context the primary goal of all head and neck oncology centers today is to triage patients and avoid unwanted hospitalizations and intensive care that would aggravate the need for rationing services most of the centers across the world have implemented some form of contactless appointments be it virtual or telephonic routine home care through these approaches can be very effective in triaging patients early whenever possible the referral system should be decentralized to accommodate patients at freestanding hospice or home care centers to encourage this certain administrations have relaxed rules whereby hospices can provide appropriate services to insured patients under their medicare and medicaid packages
3
 however this would lead to hospice services facing an excessive amount of referrals which could in turn require their own triaging systems and use of teleconsultation prescriptions can also be given for longer periods so that patients do not need to return in short intervals palliative clinics have also started allocating resources including personnel more efficiently in preparation for the pandemic all measures undertaken should be aimed at preserving and prolonging life most people infected with sarscov2 will survive and recover for those dying as a consequence of the infection who do not wish to have active or invasive treatments the switch in focus to high quality compassionate care at the end of their life is equally important hence it is of utmost consequence to explore and documented the preferences on further management and goals of care patients with decisionmaking capacity should be appropriately counseled before embarking on any procedure highlighting the heightened risk of contracting the sarscov2 virus and possibly disseminating in the community if the patientrelatives express a wish for hospitalization they should be informed of the fact that the admission may not be ultimately be put into practice if there is a lack of medical indication particularly in a situation of scares resources few guidelines have suggested a three talk approach that includes a team talk option talk and a decision talk
4
 in addition to educating and counseling patients palliative care providers should coach the front line staff on methods to deal with negative emotions and communicating empathy if the disease course can ensue a delay of several days the physician should decide on medical indication for a local hospital or hospice transfer depending on the followingseverity and complexity of the symptoms and additional care needson the nursing homeambulatory care capacity of delivering quality palliative careavailability of palliative care unit resourcespatients request
 pain and dyspnea are the most common complaints that patients receiving palliative care present with to the emergency department
5
 both covid19 and noncovid19 conditions lung metastasis superior vena cava obstruction upper airway tumors etc can cause distress or breathlessness toward the end of life by virtue of its anatomy head and neck patients can pose a serious threat to the attending health care workers all patients should be treated as potentially covid19 positive noninvasive approaches should be attempted where possible cough hygiene should also minimize the risk of transmission standard practice guidelines for intubation and emergency tracheostomy for covid19 positive or unknown patient should be followed
6
 emphasis should be placed on the safety of medical personnel through proper use of personal protective equipment once airway is established suctioning should be done on a closed system and a trach collar is preferred patients should not be admitted in the hospital for prolonged periods and dealt with on an outpatient basis in general a symptombased approach should be adopted it is imperative to correct what is correctable either through nondrug approaches for mild to moderate disease and drug approaches when required for example prescribe antibiotics for a bacterial infection in case of fever few guidelines have suggested to withhold ibuprofen as concerns have been raised about its possible role in covid19
4
 alternate nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may be prescribed pain management is an integral part of palliative care long before the coronavirus hit us the opioid crisis has been a global controversy the who estimated that 80 of the world has insufficient access to the required opioid analgesic
1
 with supply chains being affected around the world there have been severe shortages of intensive care drugs such as morphine at hospitals treating the covid19
7
 this has precipitated in an acute shortage of these critical pain medications among palliative patients other opioid substitutes such as buprenorphine and methadone are now being handed out without prescription during the covid19 crisis in some countries as a harm reduction strategy for people who are dependent on opioids
8
 this could further exhaust the supply of essential drugs needed for pain relief among these countries even though it has been established that opioids are necessary for cancer pain a large part of palliative care patients will face barriers to relief of such suffering
9

 during this pandemic careful triaging of head and neck patients intended to or currently receiving palliative care is necessary to prevent further denuding of critical care resources early referrals where patients are not having a significant symptom burden could be temporarily avoided during the crisis this would allow palliative care providers to focus on urgent needs for consults in situations such as management of severerefractory symptoms shared decision making and managing anticipatory grief there is a troubling amount we still do not know about the sarscov2 infection one thing certain is that the disease poses a serious hazard to those with compromised immune systems such as patients with cancer in this vulnerable population covid19 could be much worse and more fatal than the cancer itself the who has issued guidance on maintain essential health services during the pandemic with a focus on maternal care immunization and emergency services among others but no mention of palliative care
10
 a pandemic is often a powerful amplifier of suffering through physical and mental distress and financial and social instability as head and neck cancer care providers it is imperative we deliver the best possible care to patients with the resources at hand irrespective of their outcomes in this time of crises we need to remember to withdraw life sustaining treatments not life sustaining care and deliver comfort focused treatments and not comfort focused care resources for patients and health care providersworldwide hospice and palliative care alliance httpwwwthewhpcaorgcovid-19

 none of the authors have any conflict of interest to declare all authors have made a significant contribution to this article from concept to implementation and publication  icu beds less is more not sure jason phua madiha hashmi rashan haniffa   there exists a huge variation in intensive-care unit icu beds across icus hospitals and countries this begs the question of just what the optimal number of icu beds is a conundrum which has been thrown into the spotlight with the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 1 the hypothesis that less icu beds is more is supported by various arguments 2 there is evidence that healthcare systems with a relative abundance of icu beds tend to use these beds more liberally even for patients who may not benefit from intensive care 3 for example in a study of icu patients in the united states in 2008 only about one-quarter required mechanical ventilation 4 this has several consequences first overly enthusiastic use of icus is not without risks the incidence of medical errors and adverse events among icu patients sometimes from unnecessary treatments ranges from 15 to 51 5 second the line between intensive care and end-of-life care can become excessively grey with more people spending their last days in the icus this is despite evidence that most people prefer to die at home 6 third icu beds are an expensive resource which contribute substantially to healthcare costs 7 when unaffordable and therefore inaccessible they can lead to guilt in families of the critically ill especially in resource-limited settings these arguments are sound but have to be considered concurrently with opposing views 8 a lack of icu beds creates a capacity strain conceptually defined as a mismatch between demand and supply it forces clinicians to aggressively ration the consequences are denial of or delay in admission of ill patients who would have benefited from intensive care and out-of-hours discharge of existing patients from the icu all of which have been associated with increased mortality 9 these issues have always existed but were made painfully clear with the surge of covid-19 in many overwhelmed healthcare systems 10 we believe that both the statements less is more and less is not more for icu beds are too simplistic the solution to the question of the optimal number of icu beds is best provided by a goldilocks answer just the right amount in the context of each icu hospital and country but how is one to determine this number first a nuanced understanding of what exactly is an icu is required the world federation of intensive and critical care suggested that an icu is based in a defined geographic area of a hospital and an organised system for the provision of care to critically ill patients that provides intensive and specialised medical and nursing care an enhanced capacity for monitoring and multiple modalities of physiologic organ support to sustain life during a period of acute organ system insufficiency 11 this attempt to standardise definitions notwithstanding intensive care is provided in different settings across the world today from icus capable of extracorporeal support in resource-rich urban areas to makeshift facilities without mechanical ventilators in resource-limited rural areas 12 second icus are not just a static collection of infrastructure and equipment but a dynamic force driven by physicians nurses and allied health professionals units with many high-acuity beds but insufficient trained staff risk compromising patient outcomes intensivist-to-patient ratios lower than 115 adversely affect patient care and staff well-being in academic medical icus 13 one-to-one nursing is clearly safer than one-to-many but critical care nursing shortages are pervasive even in high-income settings on the other hand units with mostly low-acuity patients and too much manpower risk deskilling staff who then struggle to cope when the sickest of the sick present thus while it has been suggested that bed occupancy rates of 7075 are optimal 14 estimation of bed requirements must take into account the availability and training of staff third icus exist within hospitals as part of a complex healthcare system and cannot be seen in isolation tertiary hospitals that provide more complex treatments and perform more high-risk surgeries will require more icu beds hospitals that have invested in providing critical care without walls will require less icu beds possibilities include the flexible use of high dependency units remodelled general wards post-anaesthesia care units emergency departments and deployable field units for high-acuity patients 1 many hospitals have also invested in telemedicine which is postulated to reduce icu length of stay and hence bed requirements 15 rapid response systems often advocated in the same vein have not been associated with a decrease in icu admissions 16 fourth icu bed capacity varies widely across countries low- and middle-income countries have significantly fewer icu beds than high-income ones for example while uganda and bangladesh respectively have 01 and 08 adult critical care beds per 100000 population taiwan and the united states respectively have 285 and 270 17 clearly rationing of icu beds is the norm in resource-limited settings while it is tempting to call for more icu beds in these countries governments policy makers and the intensive-care community will have to balance this with investments in more basic healthcare 12 cultural and societal views of the role of icus in end-of-life care also differ widely across countries and must be factored into any discussion on icu bed capacity 18 finally demand for icu beds is not constant but surges during pandemics and declines during peacetime 1 many have been struck by how new icus and icu beds had to be created literally overnight to deal with covid-19 in places like wuhan and lombardy 19 20 after the pandemic eases much of the infrastructure remodelled and created will likely form the surge capacity for future outbreaks while many of the ventilators procured and manufactured will likely enter a national or local stockpile how much to pre-emptively invest in such capacity and stockpiles is a matter of judgment the costbenefit at a societal levelwhile acknowledging the tragedy of each life lost at a family level due to a lack of icu resourcesneeds contemplation the implications at the hospital levelwhile recognising the need to complement any hardware with skilled human resource through continuing education and clinical trainingrequire consideration in conclusion the adverse impact of extremes of icu bed capacity is clear too few and patient outcomes are compromised too many and healthcare costs balloon while possibly also worsening patient outcomes what is too few or too many is however difficult to define it depends on the very definition of an icu bed the acuity and staffing of each icu the services and facilities of each hospital the resources and culture of each country and the waxing and waning of pandemics  what influenza vaccination programmes are preferred by healthcare personnel a discrete choice experiment qiuyan liao tiffany ng wy benjamin cowling j   healthcare personnel hcp have a significantly greater risk of seasonal influenza infection compared with general adults working in non-healthcare settings 1 work absenteeism among hcp increased significantly during influenza season compared with non-epidemic periods 2 leading to a substantial economic loss 3 and potential staff shortage for healthcare during influenza seasons 4 5 continued working with influenza-like illnesses among hcp was common which can increase the spread of influenza to vulnerable patients 6 7 there were also reports that influenza virus infections in hcp were associated with nosocomial outbreaks 8 9 seasonal influenza vaccination siv can significantly reduce the risk of seasonal influenza virus infection among hcp reduce work absenteeism and also confer the protection onward to patients and their families 1 10 11 the world health organization recommends that hcp should be vaccinated against influenza each year and free siv has been provided to hcp in many locations 12 13 however despite great efforts on promoting siv among hcp uptake rates remain unsatisfactory in the us 14 and widespread low in most european countries 15 16 australia 17 and also in hong kong 18 19 psychological determinants of siv uptake among hcp including perceived effectiveness of siv for preventing influenza virus infection concerns about vaccine safety and perceived personal risk of influenza virus infection have been consistently identified by observational studies 20 21 22 23 however interventional studies focusing on addressing these psychological factors through active educational campaign to promote positive attitudes towards siv indicated mainly small effect sizes for promoting siv uptake among hcp 24 25 26 a systematic review suggested that interventions that additionally combined components addressing the contextual factors relating to vaccination could be more effective in promoting siv uptake among hcp 12 these context factors included normative influences on vaccination uptake eg attitudes and siv uptake among colleagues and employers and convenience of access to influenza vaccine eg time location and procedure of access to vaccine however it is not clear which components are more important to determine resource allocation and optimize an influenza vaccination programme for promoting siv uptake in hcp discrete choice experiment dce is a commonly used methodology for optimizing medical interventions 27 in respect of a vaccination programme dce decomposes a vaccination programme into several important attributes such as vaccine efficacy and vaccine safety which can be further characterized by attribute levels eg a vaccine efficacy of 60 or 80 the attributes and attribute levels are then used to construct a series of choice sets each comprising 23 alternative hypothetical vaccination programmes and participants are asked to choose a preferred programme within each choice set through analyzing participants trade-off between attributes and attribute levels in a series of choice sets dce enable examination of the relative importance of the selected attributes and attribute levels for determining vaccination preference one recent study suggests that dce is a valid method for predicting real-world influenza vaccination decision 28 several studies have used dce to examine factors that determine preference for influenza vaccination 29 30 31 32 however none were conducted among hcp in addition all of these studies mainly chose attributes related to the characteristics of influenza vaccines 29 30 31 32 and only two additionally included attributes of social normative influence eg doctors recommendation and others opinions 30 32 in the dce the contextual factors related to convenience in access to influenza vaccine were generally overlooked this study used dce to examine the relative importance of attributes related to vaccine characteristics social normative influence and convenience in access to influenza vaccine for determining hcps preference for siv the final aim was to identify the optimal siv programme for promoting siv uptake among hcp development of the dce questionnaire involves choosing attributes defining attribute levels and constructing choice tasks the attributes included in a dce was limited to those most important for hcp in their decision for vaccination against influenza to improve accuracy and reliability in the elicitation of preference before conducting this dce we conducted a questionnaire-based longitudinal survey to identify important determinants of siv uptake among hcp in hong kong 18 in that study attitudes towards siv was the strongest factor that influenced uptake of siv among hcp which were mainly assessed by measuring participants perceived effectiveness and safety of siv therefore vaccine efficacy and probability of vaccine reactions were included as attributes in the dce social normative influence other people particularly colleagues opinions and vaccination uptake was also suggested to be important determinants of siv uptake in hcp 18 therefore a third attribute the proportion of colleagues intending to take siv was included in the dce this indicates how much acceptable siv is in the community of the target population which is an important attribute for influenza vaccination decision 32 furthermore contextual factors including time vaccination location eg on designated or mobile sites and procedure vaccination required by appointment or walk-in that affect convenience in access to siv were reported to be important reasons for refusing siv among the participants in the survey data not reported since the contextual factors are important for characterizing a vaccination programme they were also included in our dce to provide important information for how to optimize the vaccination programme for hcp after choosing attributes the levels of each attribute were defined based on the principle that the attribute levels should be realistic for real-life situation and meaningful for policy making the final attributes and attribute levels chosen for this dce were vaccine efficacy covering four levels 20 40 60 and 80 with the lowest level represents a poorly-matched vaccine strain and the highest represent a well-matched vaccine strain probability of mild vaccine adverse events mild flu-like symptoms comprising four levels 5 10 15 and 20 program duration comprising two levels level 1 the ordinal fall immunization season and the first month of influenza season in hong kong october-january level 2 extending the programme duration to the end of influenza season october-march vaccination location level 1 designated staff clinic level 2 mobile station vaccination arrangement procedure level 1 by appointment level 2 by walk-in service hours for vaccination administration

 these attributes and attribute levels can generate a total of 4  4  2  2  2  4  4  2048 scenarios with each representing a hypothetical influenza vaccination programme it is not realistic to present all these hypothetical programmes to participants several alternative approaches are available for choosing a subset of scenarios from the pool such as orthogonal design and d-efficient design 33 while recent research suggests that a d-efficient design is more flexible and can improve the precision of parameter estimates by minimizing the covariance between parameter values than an orthogonal design using a d-efficient design requires some prior knowledge of the parameter values and using more complex simulation procedure with specific software eg ngene 34 in comparison orthogonal design is easier to implement and is suitable when prior knowledge of the parameter values is not available and when researchers are mainly interested in the main effects of each attribute level 33 therefore this study used a fractional factorial designed based on orthogonal arrays 35 to choose 16 hypothetical programmes from the pool the chosen 16 hypothetical programmes were then used to construct eight choice tasks each presented participants with two alternative hypothetical programmes and participants were asked to choose the programme they preferred programme a programme b or neither a nor b an opt-out option one additional choice task which purposively presented a logically superior programme b than programme a was additionally included for rationality test before the eight main choice tasks in the dce questionnaire the rationality test was aimed to identify participants who were irrational or potentially have difficulties to understand the main choice tasks the questionnaire was tested for comprehensibility and difficulty before being used in the formal survey one example choice task is shown in s1 participants elicited preferences were analyzed using a mixed logit regression model to allow heterogeneity as well as correlation between the choices from each participant 39 after testing the linear continuous effects of the chosen attributes vaccine efficacy and risk of vaccine adverse events were treated as continuous variables while other attributes including programme duration vaccination location vaccination arrangement procedure vaccination service hours and proportion of colleagues intending to take siv were treated as categorical variables for the categorical attributes a dummy variable was created for each attribute level excepting for the reference level the preference weight  for each attribute and attribute level was calculated by the mixed logit regression model the statistical significance of a coefficient is set to p-value less than 005 indicating that individuals differ between one attribute level and the other in making stated choices to investigate the willingness of participants to trade off an attribute to achieve an improvement in one level of the other attribute ie the compensatory effects between attributes we calculated the ratios of the coefficients of more important attributes relative to less important attributes finally vaccination choice probabilities expected mean uptakes were also calculated to convey dce results into easily understood information to policy makers which was calculated by taking the exponent of the total utility for vaccination given specific attribute levels divided by the exponent of utility of both vaccination and no vaccination 39 we first calculated the expected mean uptake rate for the base case defined as the programme with the least preferred attribute levels of vaccine characteristics 20 vaccine efficacy and 20 risk of vaccine adverse effect 40 of colleagues intending to take siv and contextual factors of existing siv servicea programme duration of six month with vaccine being provided at a designated staff clinic by appointment during ordinal office hours 9 am-1 pm 2 pm-5 pm then we calculated the change in vaccination uptake rate with one level change in a particular attribute compared with the base case while holding levels of other attributes constant this would inform the relative importance of manipulating different attributes in affecting vaccination choice all statistical analyses were conducted using the stata151 statacorp llc 19852017 a total of 258 hcp completed the dce demographics of participants who completed the dce are shown in table 2
 overall of the participants most were female the main occupational category was nurse or nursing assistant and more than one half had an educational attainment of tertiary or above and had frequent contact with patient table 2 each participant completed a total of nine choice tasks including one choice task for the rationality test and eight main choice tasks in the rationality test 822 of the participants chose alternative b the logically superior alternative within the choice task for rationality test participants who chose alternative a in the rationality test were more likely to be older 2

4  1492 p  0005 for the main dce choice tasks 101589 of the participants chose either alternative a or alternative b for taking vaccination and 132357 of them chose neither a nor b opt-out the relative importance weights preference weight coefficients of the selected attributes and attribute levels of an influenza vaccination programme for determining participants preference for influenza vaccination are shown in table 3
 it shows that except for programme duration all attributes are significantly associated with participants preference for choosing influenza vaccination participants preference for choosing influenza vaccination increased with the increase in vaccine efficacy vaccination location changing from designated staff clinic to mobile station and vaccination arrangement procedure changing from by appointment to by walk-in but decreased with increase in probability of vaccine adverse events extending opening hours from 5pm to 6pm and knowing that 60 or more of their colleges intending to take siv excluding participants who failed in the rationality test ie choosing alternative a only slightly changed the coefficients but did not change the overall conclusion s2 based on the estimated preference weights table 3 the compensatory effects between attributes were calculated for vaccine efficacy vaccination location vaccination arrangement procedure and probability of vaccine adverse events it shows that 20 increase in probability of vaccine adverse events reduction in vaccination preference weight  20  005  100 can be compensated by 50 increase in vaccine efficacy change in vaccination preference weight  50  002  100 and changing the vaccination arrangement procedure from by appointment to by walk-in changing the vaccination location from designated staff clinic to mobile station can compensate the negative effect of 7 increase in probability of vaccine adverse events changes in expected mean vaccination uptake rate with the changes in vaccine efficacy probability of vaccine adverse events vaccination location and vaccination arrangement procedure were calculated because these attributes were significantly associated with how to optimize a siv programme for hcp in the model it shows that in the base case the expected mean vaccination uptake rate is around 310 expected mean uptake rates can increase to 596 if vaccination arrangement procedure changes from by appointment to by walk-in to 594 if vaccine efficacy increases from 20 to 80 to 537 if probability of vaccine adverse events decreases from 20 to zero by changing the effect of vaccine adverse events from 005  20  100 to zero on total utility for vaccination and to 443 if mobile vaccination station is implemented fig 1
 in this dce we found that vaccination probability increased with the increase in vaccine efficacy and decrease in probability of vaccine adverse events this finding is consistent with existing studies based on questionnaire surveys 20 21 22 23 adding to existing literature the dce further measured the relative importance of vaccine efficacy to vaccine safety in determining hcps preference for influenza vaccination based on their preference weights it is suggested that the decline in vaccination probability due to a 20 increase in probability of vaccine adverse events can be compensated by at least 50 increase in vaccine efficacy this means that vaccine safety is at least two times more important than vaccine efficacy in determining vaccination probability suggesting a loss aversion phenomenon in personal vaccination decision 40 however this finding was different to that of a dce survey on dutch public preference for influenza vaccination during hypothetical influenza pandemic which reported vaccine effectiveness was the most important attribute determining vaccination preference followed by vaccine safety 32 the inconsistent conclusions between the two studies may be due to the different characteristics between seasonal influenza and pandemic influenza of which the former is usually perceived to be mild and severity is not a significant predictor of vaccination uptake 18 while acceptability for vaccine risk can become greater during influenza pandemic of greater severity 32 for the current coronavirus disease pandemic acceptability of the vaccine risk if any could also depend on the perceived severity of the disease by the time when the vaccine is available in the target population 30 among the contextual factors procedure of vaccination arrangement had the strongest positive effect on vaccination preference merely changing the procedure of vaccination arrangement from by-appointment to by walk-in can compensate the negative effect of  20 increase in probability of vaccine adverse events on vaccination probability the procedure that requires individuals to book an appointment for their vaccination the opt-in procedure beforehand has been suggested to be a barrier for taking siv 41 the walk-in procedure represents an appointment by default without constraining time to receive the vaccination services this can greatly increase the convenience in access to vaccination services and thereby increase vaccination probability 41 42 changing the vaccination location from a designated staff clinic to a mobile station was another factor that can significantly increase vaccination probability previous studies also indicated that providing on-site vaccination was associated with greater siv uptake among hcp 14 43 however although others argued that extending vaccination delivering period from the conventional fall immunization season to cover the whole influenza season and extending the office hours of vaccination administration could increase vaccine access and thereby promote siv uptake 42 our study found no significant effect of extending the vaccination programme period and a negative effect of extending office hours of vaccination administration on vaccination probability this indicates that individuals who miss vaccination at the traditional immunization period are unlikely to catch up their vaccination uptake during main influenza season which is deemed to be late for protecting against influenza infection for timing of vaccination extending the vaccination service hours to late afternoon 500 pm to 600 pm significantly reduced participants preference for taking influenza vaccination this reflects that participants may have concerns over receiving influenza vaccination in late afternoon potential concerns may include perception of insufficient day time to observe the vaccine side effects and being unwilling to put extra burden to their colleague who provided vaccination services but actual concerns await further exploration notifying a greater percentage of colleagues intending to take siv did not increase vaccination probability but instead knowing that 60 or above of their colleagues intending to take siv reduce preference for taking siv this seems contradictive with existing social norm theories which propose that perceiving greater approval of an intervention in peers can improve acceptance of the intervention 44 45 however it is consistent with free-rider behaviours in vaccination decision 30 46 47 individuals may avoid vaccination risk when perceiving that the vaccination coverage is sufficiently high to generate herd immunity 30 46 47 a phenomenon that unvaccinated individuals can get indirection protection from others vaccination uptake if this explanation is true participants may have overlooked main risk source of influenza transmission from patients instead of their colleagues it may also reflect the influence of some psychological roots such as reactance or individualism of anti-vaccination attitudes on vaccination decision 48 some individuals tend to reject consensus views on vaccination and dislike follow others to make their vaccination decision 48 if true this may be a challenge for implementing the mandatory influenza vaccination policy in hcp 49 another possibility is that peers behaviours may have an implicit 18 or direct effect on actual vaccination behaviours 50 in real life rather than on the stated vaccination preference which thereby cannot be assessed in a dce however this finding may not be generalized to peoples vaccination decision in a severe pandemic when disease severity can become the dominant determinant on vaccination choice but free-rider behaviours remain possible when vaccine safety is perceived to be more uncertain 30 an expected mean vaccination uptake rate of 31 for the base case calculated using the estimated preference weights of the attributes in the dce was approximately the same as the observed vaccination uptake of 308 in hcp from our separate questionnaire survey 18 representing an indirect validation of the dce findings increasing vaccination efficacy from 20 to 80 or reducing probability of vaccine adverse events from 20 to zero could increase vaccination uptake rate to over 50 however promoting vaccination efficacy and reducing vaccine side effects can meet technical and contextual barriers such as how accurate the scientists can estimate the main circulating influenza strain in an influenza season and vaccination production technology instead our study suggests that simply changing the vaccination delivery procedure from providing by appointment to by walk-in can increase vaccination uptake rate to over 50 implementing mobile vaccination stations may further promote vaccination uptake this study has several limitations first our study only recruited hcp in public hospitals in hong kong therefore the findings may not be applicable to hcp working in other healthcare settings particularly those working in the private sector for whom free siv may not be completely subsidized second participants were those who gave consent to be re-contacted in our previous siv survey and thereby may be those who were more interested in siv however post-hoc analysis indicates no significant difference in past-year siv uptake rates between those who participated and those who did not participated in the current dce third despite multiple ways had been used to recruit hcp of different occupational categories 18 only a small proportion of our participants were doctors however our previous survey found that doctors generally had more favourable attitudes towards siv and greater intention to take siv than nurses nursing assistants and other hcp18 this means that our study findings mainly reveal the relative importance of main determinants on siv choice among hcp who should be the main target population of future influenza vaccination programme fourth the proportion of hcp colleagues intending to take siv along may not be a sufficient attribute to reflect the social normative influence on vaccination decision future dce should consider including opinions from department head or employers for siv furthermore although both textual and graphical formats were used to illustrate most attributes and attribute levels some participants may still have difficult to understand the choice tasks despite this excluding the minority of participants who failed in the rationality test did not change the conclusions of our study vaccine safety was more important than vaccine efficacy for determining vaccination probability in the context of seasonal influenza changing the vaccination arrangement procedure from by appointment to by walk-in can compensate the negative effect of a 20 increase in probability of mild reactions to vaccination or a 50 decline in vaccine efficacy resulting in a vaccination uptake rate of over 50 in hcp implementing mobile vaccination stations could further increase vaccination uptake this research was funded by the health and medical research fund of the food and health bureau of the hong kong sar government reference no 16150852 the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper  corporate law versus social autonomy law as social hazard michael galanis   even the keenest black-letter admirer of existing laws would accept that social institutions ought to be open to change in order to adapt to evolving social goals however adaptation is not always possible or at least as straightforward in practice so that even radical action such as the recent response to the coronavirus pandemic may not have a lasting effect or may even exacerbate social hazards social institutions and their users can function as forces of inertia so that society is unable to effectively meet its challenges by redefining its ends institutions appear as if they have acquired a dominant agency of their own even when inertia is socially hazardous1 this article claims that what is currently regarded as standard corporate law has a role in the emergence and persistence of such an inertia problem in our society within capitalism corporate law is a central institutional component of a social feedback loopie a self-reinforcing social processby which the primary corporate purpose namely wealth accumulation is amplified and imposed upon society as a supreme and indisputable social end the mechanics of this loop are fairly simple firstly as an extremely effective device for protecting corporate wealth and for promoting organisational expansion the basic anatomy of corporate law has found an unprecedented fit with the primary capitalist purpose of infinite wealth accumulation it has enabled business growth to the extent that economic activity is primarily organised within and between private manager-controlled bureaucracies2 thus corporate law is the legal platform for the bureaucratisation of the economy at the corporate level bureaucratic organisation tends to suppress the questioning of objectives therefore once these are internally set by management they are constantly reproduced by a feedback process within the corporate organisation secondly due to its social dominance the bureaucratic corporation externalises those privately-set objectives so that they are eventually elevated to social ones and this creates a wider social feedback loop corporate law is thus a legal structure for this social process which has become so pervasive that it hinders societys reflective capacity in relation to its objectives this capacity is the essential basis of social autonomy since an autonomous society is founded on the recognition that social goals are endogenously fashioned and therefore subject to social scrutiny without predeterminations in other words by providing the legal foundation for the proliferation of the bureaucratised business organisation the structural core of the feedback loop corporate law serves as an institution rendering our society essentially heteronomous ie a society founded on the belief that its primary ends are exogenously and eternally determined this way material accumulation acquires eternal validity as a primary social end and its consequences are ignored or marginalised corporate law is thus inevitably in conflict with social autonomy and therefore it is a socially hazardous institution on this basis and drawing from the theory on bureaucracy and castoriadis social philosophy this article argues that the social legitimacy of corporate law needs critical re-examination while engaging in a detailed discussion of alternative organisational forms is beyond this articles scope the finding that corporate law is socially hazardous is in itself important it sets the basic parameters for further research on how business organisation law can be radicalised in order to dismantle the social feedback loop presented here and sustain social autonomy the discussion will proceed as follows the next part will examine the role and organisational impact of corporate law as a vehicle for business the third part will analyse the social significance of these organisational changes to argue corporate law is a socially hazardous institution which reproduces social heteronomy by locking social ends within a capitalist frame the fourth part will explore the possibility of instituting social autonomy as a social ideal but show that corporate law in its current form can have no obvious place in a society organised on this basis in the light of these findings the concluding section summarises the basic parameters of future reform for restoring the social legitimacy of business organisation in one of the earliest historical accounts on the corporation williston 1888 p 106 traces its origins initially in primitive associations of individuals who formed entities representing clans tribes or families3 in classical antiquity incorporated entities were used by groups of artisans or public contractors and later by church organisations incorporated medieval guilds municipalities charities and hospitals what williston emphasises is that in most of their long history the role of corporate entities and of corporate law was of a purely public or quasi-public character they had a wider social roleeg monasteries performed to a large extent the role the welfare state has today rushton 2001or served the purpose of regulating public affairs whether those were connected to professions proximity of residence or activity and so on even mercantilist companies conducted trade activities on behalf of the state and this made the distinction between markets and the state quite fuzzy an important factor for their social legitimacy alborn 19984 hence incorporation in the pre-capitalist age was regarded as a scarce privilege and corporate charters were actively regulated by the state which required promoters to show their corporations served the public interest5 with the advent of capitalism all this was to change as arnold 1937 p 186 observes this era is defined by the prevailing ideal  of the freedom and dignity of the individual engaged in the accumulation of wealth this is known as the capitalist spirit the principal force behind capitalism which has been taken up by adam smith karl marx max weber and many others who have built on their works in order to trace and explain its true origins we will return to this later see fourth part below but what matters in this instance is that in spite of their divergence in other respects all these strands agree that perpetual wealth accumulation as an end in itself is the dominant organisational principle and purpose in capitalist society as new social interests emerged carrying and being determined by the capitalist spirit they also demanded the re-conception of existing institutions and of their relationship with the state more specifically business interests required an organisational structure which could serve the attainment of infinite economic accumulation by accommodating increasing scale and complexity the old legal infrastructure based on trust deeds contractual partnerships or agency law had served entrepreneurship well as long as business relationships were personal localised and relatively simple they were institutions capable of organising small-scale entrepreneurial capitalism however such instruments proved inadequate for large business scale and for attracting investment capital from outside investors pearson 2002 p 862 taylor 2006 p 17 so business organisation law eventually had to turn capitalist by offering a legal structure for large impersonal and complex business relations from an organisational perspective the corporate structure was an ideal vehicle for large business while this point will be analytically discussed below for now it is sufficient to emphasise two things on the one hand incorporation facilitated the governance of distant and impersonal relations though the creation of a corporate pool of assets and the delegation of their management to professional directors legal recognition of the corporate person as the fictitious entity representing the common business purpose is crucial for this as it provides a fixed owner of business assets and a reference point for corporate governance on the other hand it allowed theoretically limitless capital-raising with the issuing of shares as tradable instruments while also offering investors protection from business risk beyond their control by limiting their liability in respect of corporate debt as these elements had already been present in pre-capitalist corporations there was no need to re-invent the wheel the old corporate structure simply had to be privatised by being assigned to serve the purpose of private wealth accumulation thus by the mid-1800s corporate legitimacy solely rooted in public or quasi-public purposes had already come to an end this demanded the abolition of the old regime of state-controlled corporate charters and the re-conception of the corporation as a privately created and aimed institution this privatised legitimacy of the corporation inevitably became entrenched in britain the heartland of capitalism at the time with the joint stock companies act of 1844 and the limited liability act of 1855 this legislation granted general incorporation rights to privately owned businesses and offered shareholders all the protection against business debt previously reserved for quasi-public entities both acts were emblematic legislative attempts engrained in economic liberalism signifying the privatisation of corporate law in exchange for some disclosure requirements towards middle-class investors jones and aiken 1995 esp p 69 the latter thus became the private enforcers of any remaining social scrutiny by being vested with the right to litigate misconduct keay 2014 pp 9296 in fact a legal infrastructure of this type for the pursuit of the capitalist spirit was already in place in all major jurisdictions by the mid-1800s pistor et al 2002 pp 809810 in a nutshell as the private economic sphere expanded the privatisation of corporate law followed as an inevitable consequence contrary to its treatment in other historical accounts as a symbol of industrial capital axiomatically eg ireland 1996 p 69 talbott 2016 see also third part below the corporation is an ancient organisational form which is nonetheless radically adapted within capitalism in order to serve private wealth accumulation as an overriding social objective whose prevalence is historically distinct this reconception however has eventually led to further social developments this time promoted if not triggered by corporate law if the privatisation of corporate law through the liberalisation of the right to incorporate can be regarded as an outcome of social change within capitalism it has led to further social transformation the offering of the corporations organisational features to private business has transformed economic organisation which is now predominantly ordered by corporate hierarchies and in bureaucratic terms to the extent that capitalism has evolved into something which is not too different from a decentralised and essentially privatised planned system this is managerial capitalism this section will focus on how corporate law has supported and promoted this capitalist mutation crucial for this purpose is organisational scale and its association with managerial empowerment in this respect chandlers 1977 1990 historical exploration of the interaction between organisational growth and organisational mode has emerged as a standard source6 he demonstrates how advances in transport and communications in the 1800s enlarged markets and created opportunities for business growth in scale and scope this made mass production and diversification strategies possible for corporations via horizontal and vertical integration with those strategies emerged a large multidivisional corporate form controlled by a professional managerial bureaucracy with significant immunity from investor scrutiny berle and means 1967 have shown how shareholders as collective owners of control rights were too diffuse and too detached to influence strategic decision-making as corporate controllers managers pursued monopoly or oligopoly rents in saturated markets by restricting competition through collusion while they simultaneously created new markets by investing in new product development marketing and advertising divisions emerged as critical parts in this process by manipulating consumer needs marcuse 1964 in order to create and maintain demand simultaneously input costs were controlled via vertical integration and labour costs were contained by the division of tasks which effectively de-skilled and commodified labour wherever necessary braverman 1998 as a result commodity capital and labour markets were largely internalised by corporate hierarchies simultaneously through their market share or oligopolistic collusion managerial corporations were able to influence prices and market conditions this has been empirically established since the 1930s hall and hitch 1939 and confirms adam smiths 1976 pp 754755 aversion towards the corporation as an anticompetitive arrangement chandler 1977 has described this as the replacement of the market by the managerial visible hand indeed competition law has been historically ineffective in containing the concentration of economic power within corporate bureaucracies for instance once collusion via cartel agreements became illegal prohibitions were easily evaded via mergers and acquisitions licht 2014 p 150 so that collusion was also internalised by the merged corporate bureaucracies the effect has been a turn from the multidivisional incorporated bureaucracy towards the incorporation of divisions as subsidiaries hierarchically controlled by holding corporations zey and camp 1996 prechel 19977 and more recently to supply chain networks dominated by a small number of firms in each sector humphrey and schmitz 2001 witting 2019 due to this ineffectiveness of competition law in controlling concentration most markets have become predominantly oligopolistic a trend that has accelerated since the 1980s autor et al 2017 griffin 2018 kamerbeek 20108 so with the rise of the managerial oligopolistic corporation early entrepreneurial capitalism first in the us and later in other major jurisdictions chandler 1990 hannah 19769 has mutated into todays corporate capitalism a society where markets are internalised and dominated by private corporate bureaucracies commanded by virtually unaccountable managers corporate controllers independence from internal and external pressures is a crucial aspect of this capitalist mutation it is well recognised in organisation theory that managers autonomy unleashes their drive for endless expansion through organic growth and the acquisition of existing or potential competitors penrose 1959 marris 1998 odagiri 200810 this fits perfectly with infinite accumulation as an end in itself in other words the managerial corporation is essentially a self-controlled and growth-oriented hierarchy designed to reproduce itself together with its own capitalist ideas managerial autonomy and its effects have not even been contained by the restructuring of financial markets and the economy more generally towards financial capitalism since the mid-1970s financialisation has certainly instigated significant organisational changes in business organisation on the one hand it has increased the weight of profit opportunities from asset-price speculation as opposed to production investment dore 2008 epstein 2005 van der zwan 2014 tori and onaran 2018 on the other it has enhanced the role of investor interests as the reform of savings systems and their investment in securities markets has concentrated share ownership in the hands of institutional investors and speculators like hedge funds11 thus corporate control rights are more tangled with stock market speculation and expectedly managerial corporations are more inclined to emphasise the importance of share valuation in their decision-making however this is not a sign of managers surrender to external investor pressure instead corporate bureaucracies have emerged as dominant financial players in sync with other financial speculators they are actively involved in securities markets by way of mergers and acquisitions involving competitors as well as by profiteering from financial speculation directly12 managers especially at the top rather than being more constrained have also found a great opportunity in the financialised economic environment as they can use the stock market to increase their own pay while they also increase pay-outs to shareholders at the expense of labour interests appelbaum et al 2019 dnhaupt 2013 they do so by expanding the weight of their share-based remuneration and simultaneously manipulating share prices with extensive share-repurchase programmes lazonick 2013 bergstresser and philippon 2006 and by brokering deals in the market for corporate control for which they and shareholders get heavily rewarded thus if certain observers initially claimed that managerial control would eventually be dismantled and disappear jensen 1989 corporate managers have been able to simply align corporate and their own goals with the financialised mode of wealth accumulation boyer 2005 froud et al 2006 what may distinguish early corporate capitalism from its financialised mode is related to the method of economic accumulationfinancial speculation has been added as a growing component to wealth accumulation based on mass productionand the distribution of costs primarily to wage earners and benefits asset owners both modes however remain equally faithful to the leading principle of infinite accumulation as an end in itself boltanski and chiapello 2007 boltanski and esquerre 2016 and the managerial corporation retains its position as the primary structure through which this principle materialises thus modern business practice is typified by the expanding dominance of private incorporated bureaucracies which are largely unconstrained by what is commonly understood as the market mechanism either in financial or input and output markets that being so some predominantly post-modernist organisation theorists have tried to balance the lack of extra-organisational ie market pressure on the managerial corporation with what they see as intra-organisational constraints they emphasise the increasing need for independent knowledge-workers as a challenge to manager-controlled hierarchies which may lead to a post-bureaucratic era defined by organisational methods like project-management and semi-autonomous units adler 2001 fenwick et al 201913 however empirical scrutiny has exposed that such techniques are simply tighter reformulations of hierarchical control relying on the same principles of accountability and surveillance found in traditional hierarchies diefenbach and sillince 2011 vie 2010 courpasson and clegg 2006 thus the twenty-first century capitalist organisation remains as bureaucratic as that of the previous century if not more so in this sense corporate capitalism has essentially evolved into an economic system operating according to a decentralised but coordinated plan primarily devised by private bureaucratic organisations run by managers with minimal outside constraints hence what is commonly referred to as free-market capitalism is a gross misdescription and as real as a unicorn14 the contribution of corporate law to this transformation by which the entrepreneurially controlled firm is replaced by bureaucratised oligopolies has been immense without the essential anatomy of standard corporate law all this would have been impossible more specifically focusing on the effective implementation of what they call asset partitioning hansmann and kraakman 2000 have explained the importance of corporate personality and shareholder limited liability as protective devices for the corporate entitys wealth entity shielding on the one hand and for its investors owner shielding on the other they argue very thoroughly how for large-scale business corporate law as a form of property law rather than contract law is necessary for instituting effectively the defensive protection of the corporate entitys assets from those who control it or from third parties without the creation of the fictitious corporate person by operation of the law asset partitioning would be impossible to enforce against third parties and thus incorporation would be pointless ironically the privatisation of corporate law is now mirrored by the corporate person being offered protection at the highest-level through constitutional law grear 2006 greenwood 2017 this demonstrates how entrenched the corporation has become within capitalism the legal ascertainment and fortification of the corporate pool of assets is fundamental for the rise of the bureaucratic corporation since it offers the proprietary certainty required for enlarging corporate wealth without the risk of misappropriation simultaneously this legal certainty assists in the exploitation of corporate assets for increasing financial liquidityeg via direct borrowing or securitisationin order to generate and exploit further profit opportunities it also facilitates the retention and re-investment of profit that has been instrumental in the growth of the managerial corporation relatedly the perpetuity of the autonomous corporate person also matches perfectly the idea of infinite accumulation because it disentangles the latter from the limitations imposed by the finite human life additionally corporate personality combined with shareholders limited liability provide the legal basis for liability management by holding companies through risk externalisation and regulatory arbitrage muchlinski 2010 tweedale and flynn 2007 this has been instrumental in the expansion of corporate group activity nationally and internationally thus by allowing the transformation of business parts into incorporated divisions subsidiarisation corporate law supports endless accumulation not only in a temporal and quantitative but also in a geographical sense simultaneously limited liability is also facilitative of expansion organically or via acquisitions as it allows equity investors to shield themselves from business risk beyond their controlie from the cost of large scaleboth directly and via diversification blair 2003 p 439 more importantly for the current historical moment of capitalism asset partitioning has also allowed the managerial corporation to adapt to the demands of financialisation what ireland 2010 has dubbed as the reification of the corporation facilitates the dismantling or combination of business parts as subsidiaries which themselves can be treated as standalone assets relatedly the emergence of the share as an autonomous tradable asset15 a feature concomitant to the recognition of the corporate person is perfectly aligned with the asset price-based accumulation regime of financialisation by making possible the tradability of shares hansmann et al 2006 p 1361 corporate personality is a sine qua non for the market for corporate control and an essential element of financialised capitalism additionally the governance features of the corporation are also finely tuned with and supportive of unbounded wealth accumulation blair 2003 pp 433434 has highlighted the importance of vesting decision-making with a board of directors as an entity-shielding feature via directors accountability towards the corporate person as such16 this point becomes particularly important in large manager-controlled corporations where the board acquires primacy in defining and pursuing the corporate persons interests condensed in the legal notion of the corporate objective17 this is a theoretically and doctrinally divisive notion in corporate law scholarship first due to the question whether the corporate objective ought to include social concerns in some way and second due to its open-ended and malleable legal nature the latter is no coincidence as the objectives open-endedness assigns its ultimate formulation to the corporation itself and more specifically to whoever controls it we have seen that before the corporations privatisation these issues were more or less settled by the imposition of the public interest by the state as ultimate controller however within corporate capitalism the corporate objective is internally determined by managerial hierarchies with very little outside control as shareholders are rather passive monitors cheffins 2009 in this context then it should be seen primarily as an entity shielding device against outside interference with managerial autonomy the latter is further strengthened by the formulation and judicial application of the law governing business judgment which generally precludes ex-post scrutiny mcmillan 2013 keay 2006 deipenbrock 2016 the only differentiation one could make as to how the objective is applied is that compared to others in financialised corporations shareholder interests and accumulation through asset-price speculation may carry more weight in decision-making compared to other objectives boyer 2000 mitchell 2001 jrgens et al 2002 stockhammer 2006 overall the privatisation of corporate law has been a precondition for the emergence of bureaucratic capitalism by protecting corporate wealth and enabling the organisation of large business it serves the purpose of limitless accumulation very successfully corporate law is the essential legal infrastructure for the bureaucratic corporation however the social consequences of corporate laws privatisation are much deeper and wider these are explored next having demonstrated the contribution of corporate law to the bureaucratisation of capitalism we will now turn to assessing the broader impact of this transformation we will show how corporate law has enabled business organisation to reproduce the capitalist spirit to the point where social transformation is now severely hindered by the social structure to explain this point an appraisal of the essential features of bureaucratic organisation is important while bureaucracy is an ancient form of organisation it is only within capitalism that it became a subject of inquiry with hegel 1976 paras 287297 being the first to discuss its role and character his focus was on public administration he wrote prior to the privatisation of corporate law which in his view has a positive social role as a mediator between the private and public interest however he recognised that extensive division of labour carries the risk of bureaucrats losing sight of their social role18 this observation by hegel had great potential for understanding the extensive social impact of bureaucratisation and was taken up much later by weber however hegel himself did not expand on it and simply suggested ethical training and social accountability as remedies without being much more specific as a result hegels concise analysis has had little influence on modern theory of bureaucracy at best it inspired marxs brief critique of hegel in his early works19 where bureaucracy within capitalism is presented as an instrument of domination used by the capitalist class to guarantee its property rights and thus exercise its dominance over the working class in this sense he treated both state and corporate bureaucracies similarly however as krygier 1985 observes marxs treatment of bureaucratic organisation created insurmountable difficulties for his theoretical adherents who could not explain soviet bureaucracys autonomous power without resorting to paradoxical or contradictory claims state bureaucrats could not be a social class with independent interests and this contradicted the central marxist tenet of struggle between capital and labour in the context of capitalism this limitation equally applies to corporate bureaucracies as marxist theory cannot explain managerial autonomy from capital ownership as managers do not fit neatly into capital or labour it seems hegels intuition about bureaucrats propensity to diverge from their socially designated role was probably correct it allowed for bureaucracys autonomous agency weber was the first to offer a systematic account of bureaucratic organisation and in a way he reconciled the hegelian concern about bureaucrats social conscience with the instrumentality point of marx he did this by constructing his ideal type of bureaucracy as an analytical tool for organisational practice and by assessing the wider social impact of its widespread use within capitalism his departure point was that large organisational size is essentially associated with bureaucratisation weber 1978 pp 221 and 224 also dimock and hyde 1940 p 36 which explains how corporate capitalism has emerged as predominantly bureaucratic as organisational scale increases personal relationships wane and are replaced as a source and form of ordering by an impersonal hierarchical order similar claims have been made by simon 1976 who finds that large scale and complexity require a hierarchical organisation based on a centralised objective-setting at the top and decentralised operational decision-making through delegation and division of tasks at levels below for weberianshegel and marx would also agreebureaucratic organisation is grounded on two fundamental and related principles technique and domination the former principle refers to managerial expertise in devising rational procedural techniques and rules for the pursuit of bureaucratic goals which are impersonal and independent of other norms that are incompatible with bureaucratic rationality managerial tacit knowledge increases efficiency but at the same time managerial expertise denotes a shift of control towards the highest ranks of managers in webers own words bureaucratic administration means fundamentally domination through knowledge 1978 p 225 the second principle domination is the disciplinary effect of managerial techniquesprimarily through the definition of tasks and objectives as well as through the manipulation of incentives edwards 1979 esp pp 128129 and 148149upon those employed in the bureaucracy who may not share the same goals as those set for their organisation thus bureaucracy is fundamentally an effective incentive alignment instrument for the achievement of hierarchically set goals weber 1978 p 990 expectedly the recognition by weber of bureaucracys potential power over individual social agency has generated an immense literature comparing his efficient ideal type with organisational reality so some eg bigley and roberts 2001 du gay 2000 have celebrated bureaucracys organisational effectiveness while others eg dugger 1980 have emphasised its tendency to diverge from the weberian ideal due to various dysfunctions that allow personality traits expressed as status seeking inner circles personal favours etc to affect organisational efficiency however even such critics accept the power of bureaucracy over the individuals mode of rationalising the world which promotes instrumental reasoning over social conscience merton 1940 in fact this prevalence of instrumental rationality is the very reason for webers own misgivings about capitalist bureaucratisation he regarded bureaucracy as unable and unsuitable for tackling the political question of social ends weber 1978 p 266 et seq in this regard he was very careful in distinguishing practical rationality from substantive rationality the former refers to instrumentality while the latter is concerned with the rationalisation20 of action on the basis of unverifiable value postulates21 as kalberg 1980 p 1156 notes when it comes to systematising action in certain or all life-spheres such as family religious professional life and so on a radical perspectivism prevails in which the existence of a rationalization process depends on an individuals implied or stated unconscious or conscious preference for certain ultimate values different individual and social substantive rationalities can easily coexist within the same socialhistorical moment even if they have to compete against each other so what is to be instrumentally pursued by the weberian bureaucracy is to be determined independently and outside of it through a substantively rational social function ie by politics thus weber 1978 p 222 was careful enough to point out that ideally at the top of the bureaucratic hierarchy there is an element that is at least not purely bureaucratic otherwise bureaucratic domination over social agency can turn the precision instrument into a social hazard22 this is encapsulated in webers renowned iron cage metaphor describing the prevalence of instrumental rationality for the pursuit of economic acquisition as a result of expanding bureaucratisation in modern society23 weber had the hindsight of the managerial corporation that marx or hegel did not accordingly hibou 2015 p 24 et seq focuses on the process of abstraction as a necessary function of bureaucratic organisation she explains how the extensive use of aggregated and quantified information in order to devise standardised rules practices and targets requires and simultaneously leads to the proliferation of arbitrary abstraction this otherwise necessary form of organisation constructs an artificially static reality in order to deal with uncertainty and contingency in the governance process governing by aggregation and quantification enables communication between governors and governed through providing a set of stable reference points but once those are instituted the illusion of stable certainty also leads the organisation to forget their artificiality and arbitrariness as constructed realities the result is a closure of minds that can lead to tunnel vision and as such stifle reflexive evaluation of established practices goals or standards in addition anything that is not measurable and quantifiable is of lesser or no importance in the governance process so that substantive rationality is subjected to instrumentality similarly castoriadis 1997a critiques bureaucracy on the basis that instead of merely closing meaning abstraction ultimately destroys meaning completely24 it does so by reducing qualitative differences and social relations into quantitative ones so as to eventually produce a measurable value most preferably in monetary terms in order to facilitate hierarchical dominance but this value has no meaning whatsoever beyond a specific irrational belief in its actual validity and usefulness more explicitly it has no meaning beyond serving the unverifiable and thus irrational goal of economic accumulation what is concerning in relation to bureaucratic domination within corporate capitalism is that as we saw in the second part above the managerially-controlled corporate bureaucracy is not simply instrumentally managing even imperfectly the implementation of goals set through processes outside of it as weber would have liked on the one hand the managerial corporation implements the principle of infinite accumulation to perpetuate its own existence in accordance with the capitalist spirit managerial incentives growth orientation has already been mentioned earlier simultaneously though due to its bureaucratic antagonism towards substantively rational goal-setting action it is unable to reflect upon its own goals and radically alter them if necessary in this way it supports a feedback loop where economic accumulation requires instrumental reason and instrumental reason perpetuates economic accumulation as a supreme value thus corporate governance issues can only refer to the corporate hierarchys instrumental efficiency in achieving this otherwise unverifiable value to the point of irrationality all this is all too familiar in the context of empirical corporate governance scholarship it explains for instance the non-resolvability of the corporate valuation problem and the impossibility of treating the share price as an accurate reflection of the real economic value of production all these values actually produced are simply arbitrary and fictitious constructions of a particular belief system and are simply accepted as real by investors and managers as a social fact haiven 2011 this may fit nicely with the rationalisation of the governance process within the framework of economic positivism but it is absolutely nonsensical beyond it it is equivalent to organising by self-deception murphy 2014 certainly this feedback loop of economic instrumentality would be of limited importance if it was simply contained within the boundaries of business organisation the iron cage of instrumental rationality would not have a generalised impact on societys substantively rational deliberation and would simply reduce such corporate logic to one of many competing value systems however within corporate capitalism we also have the subversion of this social process for two reasons firstly and more obviously the larger the number of people participating in and being governed by corporate bureaucracy the larger the social influence of the latters logic indeed within corporate capitalism labour markets are predominantly organised in bureaucratic terms which is not surprising given the economic dominance of the managerial corporation jacob 2004 also hamel and zanini 2016 secondly the social power of the latter is also exerted through its extensive channels of influence over policy and culture the literature demonstrating the excessive levels of large corporations socio-political power is immense and need not be reiterated here25 what is noteworthy though is that more recently corporate influence has reached extraordinary levels with the use of internet technology for the generation and analysis of big data by which even the most private spheres of human agency are placed at the service of corporate profitability this type of surveillance capitalism zuboff 2015 is a supercharged form of accumulation which relies on using personal data for predicting and modifying human behaviour in ways that make traditional mass production marketing practices appear as totally innocent and ineffectual thus through these two channels of social dominance operating simultaneously at both micro and the macro level the managerial corporation imposes its irrationality not only upon itself but also upon society as a whole this is of utmost importance from a social goal-setting perspective the internal feedback loop of corporate bureaucracy which rationalises corporate action through the dogma of economic accumulation inevitably emerges as a social feedback loop26 this underlies the persistence and intensification of the capitalist spirit over the past two centuries and its further amplification more recently within the financialised version of corporate capitalism it also explains the conformist character of regulatory reform in response to the global financial crisis a decade ago and more importantly to the intensifying ecological crisis27 the bureaucratised private corporation and the financial interests attached to it have become the stratum carrying instituting and legitimising economic rationality as the ultimate unquestionable social value system the same phenomenon is described by habermas as the colonisation of the world28 by bureaucratic power effectively denoting the subjugation of weberian value-based rationality to economic instrumentality in a way that limits critical reflection about values at the individual and social level in this logic every aspect of social life can be reduced to quantifiable monetised values ready to be used for the purposes of economic accumulation this sustains the spirit of capitalism but also entrenches the corporations central role in the feedback loop of economic rationalisation because it prevents non-conforming and incompatible value postulates from arising even outside the corporate boundaries substantive rationalisation is not simply subjugated but suppressed due to its incompatibility with corporate logic thus social space is created for the capitalist spirit to expand through the generation of a growing number of reductionist postulates like those in empirical corporate governance literature mentioned earlier in this discussion as a result economic accumulation emerges as the ultimate and unchallengeable social value to the extent that society cripples its capacity to reflect upon and re-determine its instituted ends in spite of their irrationality and hazardous consequences29 in other words the social feedback loop of corporate capitalism is one of social heteronomy where deterministic economic logic appears to be the most prevalent way of rationalising social action its structural core corporate law and the business organisation erected upon it renders the capitalist spirit a structural concern as opposed to a mere spiritual one this structural centrality of corporate law also makes its radical reform unlikely without prior social change signified by the prevalence of another spirit to the extent corporate law impedes such change it is a socially hazardous institution and thus its legitimacy is lost to explore the possibility of breaking out of the current heteronomous social setting of corporate capitalism it will be necessary first to discuss in more detail how an autonomous society may emerge similarly to the emergence of capitalism in the first place this would be a process of radical societal change which would necessarily require the uprooting of the capitalist accumulation-orientated paradigm thus the discussion will have to turn back to tracing the latters origins as mentioned earlier smith marx and weber provided seminal analyses upon which the three dominant theoretical approaches on the origins of capitalism have been built admittedly the discussion of such important works could only be crude here and does not do justice to their complexity and eminence it will be shown however that none of these threads can adequately explain the rise of capitalism as a radical social paradigm shift and thus fail to offer sufficient guidance on whether and how the heteronomy loop can be broken first the perspective following smiths 1976 p 25 early analysis attributes the drive for capitalist accumulation to human nature and thus considers its pursuit as naturally beneficial there is a propensity in human nature to use smiths own words to engage in self-interested exchanges in order to promote well-being through wealth accumulation human nature is thus reduced to the homo-oeconomicus however this natural propensity cannot be easily reconciled with the emergence of economic accumulation as a dominant ideal only relatively recently in human history nor does this proposition so unreservedly adopted in economic theory offer a convincing basis for its explicit or implicit reference to the natural character of accumulation as a social purpose it can only be accepted axiomatically and thus has no rational grounding hollander 1977 founded on this axiom smiths perspective cannot offer an explanation for social transformation towards or away from capitalism at best it resorts to exogenous contingency and this is often the path followed by those adopting capitalism as a natural social ideal thus north and thomas 1973 locate the roots of the capitalist spirit in population growth which resulted in market expansion and profit opportunities however they do not explain why population growth initiated capitalism in eighteenth-century england when it could have done so in the netherlands where a more dramatic population growth was noted two centuries earlier wallerstein 1976 p 276 similar claims have been based on scientific knowledge expansion in the pre-capitalist era but again scientific advances have been too linear to suggest a revolution in the strict sense and definitely not unique in history kearney 1964 so even if the problem concerning the axiomatic nature of accumulation could be ignored the contingency proposition also offers little in relation to explaining social paradigm shifts towards capitalism or any other social system additionally another historical contradiction and irony is that among the initial carriers of the capitalist spirit were the private merchants around smiths time who organised their activities as private corporations mcnally 1990 p 22 et seq this denies the very essence of free exchange hence smiths hostility towards them and his accusation that they privatised and corrupted mercantilism muthu 2008 p 185 this historical contradiction is of course even more pronounced now that capitalism is predominantly bureaucratic and the corporation is the primary structural pillar of capitalism on the other hand the marxist strand traces the capitalist spirit to the economic structure of feudalism and reduces it to a reflection of an oppressive mode of production relations marx 1909 brenner 1982 on this basis there is little fundamentally wrong with accumulation as a natural social purpose provided it is socialised30 the standard but false prediction of marx was that this would happen inexorably so for marxists the capitalist spirit is mostly an epiphenomenon of structural change from feudalism to capitalism to socialism on a naturally pre-determined path defined by a class struggle between the working and the capitalist class this struggle is founded upon and ultimately determined by the economic structure of production relations and the commodification of labour meiksins wood 2002 p 96 et seq even if the problem of marxist historical determinism and its actual refutation by history itself could be ignored the commodification of labour is not particular to the capitalist era slavery certainly pre-dates it moreover within corporate capitalism social classes are no longer those observed by marx and different classes can have similar aspirations and vice versa this has already been mentioned above in relation to the managerial class corporate management without ownership rights over capital does not fit the distinction between capitalist and worker barbalet 1986 graeber 2014 pp 7475 one could add to this todays wage-earners who are tomorrows pensioners and therefore interested in stock market returns or land and other asset prices thus social change cannot be solely explained by class struggle and one would have to look elsewhere for its roots the weberian strand is more openthough not without its own problemsas to the drivers of social change by referring to various social status groups as carriers of competing ideas values some of which may prevail depending on these groups relative social power wright 2005 it traces the origins of capitalism to the combination of technological with cultural factors eg the protestant ethic however scientific progress is of lesser importance in the emergence of capitalism because it is cultural factors that determine its uses weber 2005 at xxxvii the emphasis is thus on the world of ideas for weber capitalist accumulation is neither a natural state of affairs as in smith nor a product of economic relations as in marx but the consequence of a particular way of rationalising the world which prevails over other competing rationalities in fact webers major contribution in this respect is not so much his point on the relation between religion and social change but his emphasis on how religious rationality gradually gave way to instrumental rationality he called this the disenchantment of the world devoted to the perpetual pursuit of material wealth as the predominant characteristic of capitalism however as already mentioned and contrary to marxs optimism about social evolution webers sociological analysis of modern capitalism was quite pessimistic rationalisation came with the proliferation of the bureaucratic iron cage which would become so inexorable that only charismatic leadership outside of it could subject it to a substantively rational process of goal redefinition history vindicates webers first point but by relying on charisma as a solution he offers little more than another contingency-based proposition charismatic leadership is not guaranteed and even if it was it could not ensure a desirable social order weber was aware of this problem but could not offer a satisfactory answer dow 1978 p 85 in this respect castoriadis 1987 theory of radical social paradigm shifts based on the concept of the social imaginary not only responds to this problem in weberian theory but also avoids the methodological difficulties and contradictions in the other perspectives described above his basis is the individual and his emphasis is on the role of imagination a human capacity that has either been ignored eg in cartesian rationalism or rejected as distortive of truth as in aristotelian ethics or subjected to some form of transcendental reason as in kant the prominence of imagination in castoriadis is more than justified it is for some time now empirically established by cognitive science that human learning reasoning and purposive action are entwined with the imagining capacity of the brain eg hesslow 2012 schacter 2012 gaesser 2012 stokes 2014 leahy and sweller 2008 dolan 2002 on this evidence ignoring rejecting and subjugating imagination as a factor influencing human action in traditional philosophy now seem outdated therefore incorporating it in the study of social phenomena the law included has been long overdue and this is exactly what gives currency and force to castoriadis theory on social change and stability however as we shall see this framework offers more than explanations as it suggests the possibility of instituting social autonomy through a pure conception of democratic polity as a social ideal thus it is not only helpful in explaining corporate capitalisms emergence and appraising the social feedback loops ultimate force but also offers guidance as to how such structures can be dismantled and avoided in the future this ticks all the boxes for our purposes here the starting point for castoriadis is the subconscious and in particular its ability to create imaginary representations ex nihilo this conception of human imagination recognises the psyches potential to do more than simply re-present external reality that it then simply re-produces castoriadis 1987 p 283 castoriadis calls this psychical capacity the radical imaginary this empirically proven cognitive process brogaard and gatzia 2017 dijksterhuis and meurs 2006 dietrich 2004 is the source of radical noveltycreative out of the box thinkingrather than the simple re-interpretation or synthesis of already existing and pre-imagined realities modell 200331 interaction with the external world ie perception relies on imagination which interprets but also gives meaning to this experience ultimately the psyche creates its own imagined and therefore subjective representation of the world it is perhaps accurate to compare this with the subjective understanding of the self and the world described by weberian substantive rationality both lead to an open-ended notion of rationality so as to accommodate different images of the self certainly castoriadis 1997b does not disregard social conditioning and this creative process is not in nihilo or cum nihilo ibid pp 32132232 due to an inherent tendency of the individual as a social being to internalise socially created representations of external reality the psyche is always socially conditioned for example the individual socialised within capitalism will more or less resemble the homo conomicus or some type of personality that fits within the capitalist structure so as to exist within this context this is indeed the source of the social feedback loops power within corporate capitalism since by its nature corporate bureaucracy is a mechanism for confining meaning within the economic accumulation frame it effectively restrains the creative capacity of the radical imaginary its proliferation contradicts individual autonomy to the extent however that this structural power is unable to fully determine the radical dimension of the subconscious bureaucratic control can never be complete there will always be a fault-line between the social feedback loop and the individuals radical imaginary thus imagining a different mode of being even within capitalism always remains a possibility which necessarily begins from the individual social agent this battleground between socialisation and the radical imaginary is indeed for castoriadis the driver of social change and what therefore created the capitalist spirit in the first place he links what occurs at the individual level with the emergence of social order by tracing the latters roots in the former it is from the creation of shared images of shared realities arising from agents co-existence in space and time the socialhistorical that a society is instituted this shared imagination of societys individual members as an anonymous collective castoriadis 1997b p322 generates central significationssuch as god the economy justice or capitalwhich do not refer to logic or actual reality but have to refer to other things to signify how society thinks about them so within capitalism capital has to refer to machines land work human resources shares or more recently personal data through such second order significations society gives meaning to everything elseeg wages goods profit costs and so onand is held together by referring to them thus a societys history-specific logic is ultimately determined by its central significations which are unverifiable creations of collective imagination the radical social imaginary castoriadis 1987 pp 358365 this as thompson 1982 p 664 observes creates central significations explaining the orientation of social institutions the constitution of motives and needs the existence of symbolism tradition and myth in this creative process which institutes society social praxis is of primary importance social agents spontaneous activity even if mundane and not necessarily revolutionary often requires imagining the future and their position in it from this inevitably originates an infinite creation of new significations joas and meyer 1989 which may not always be compatible with what is already instituted and such contradictions can instigate minor or wider changes certainly social praxis occurs in various domains and among a variety of social groupings where different significatory configurations may emerge to the extent such groupings see themselves as belonging in the same society they will more or less share that societys central logic the dominant imaginary and remain conformist indeed the transition from entrepreneurial to corporate and financial capitalism can be explained in this way however even central significations are not immune from this process of constant flux social praxis does not exclude the existence and emergence of other radically different imaginaries carried to various degrees by particular social segments so there is always a tension within the instituted society which can eventually bring about radical social change as self-alteration even without clean breaks arnason calls this a long revolutionary process arnason 2001 p 157 also ciaramelli 1997 as all societies are subjectively self-instituted they are also subjected to the forces of change endogenously thus capitalism can also be explained as the outcome of a particular accumulation of such practice-driven reconfigurations of previous rationalities which gave rise to the capitalist imaginary the roots of the capitalist spirit can indeed be traced in webers verdict that in the aftermath of the enlightenment the world was disenchanted following the retreateven if not completeof religious rationalities weber 1946 pp 129156 also harrison 2017 this created a vacuum in relation to rationalising lifes finitude which had to be filled by a phantasy of omnipotence expressed through the domination over nature in this context it did not take long until economic rationality became an elite project too by which social salvation would be attained through the pursuit of material accumulation hirschman 1977 indeed this is what underlies adam smiths optimism about economic development and is recognised by mill 1909 pp 696699 also schmidt 2014 or even marx as the driver of infinite economic accumulation served by instrumental reason certainly this is webers verdict too all this can be attributed to the workings of the radical social imaginary which has instituted what castoriadis calls rational mastery as the central signification guiding capitalist society he uses the terms pseudo-rational and pseudo-mastery to denote its imaginary and unverifiable essence however this irrationality matters little since central significations cannot have a rational basis anyway it suffices that rational mastery has surpassed religion-based salvation so that infinite material accumulation is promoted as a governing social end as benjamin pointed out almost a century ago the emergence of the market or a market ethic as the natural arbiter and calculator of social activity is not too different from the metaphysical beliefs which were more prevalent in the pre-capitalist world33 what does matter is that this social imaginary orientates our society through the process exposed above by referring and giving meaning in various degrees to all other organisational aspects an objectively rational basis is completely unnecessary for that to happen indeed castoriadis major contribution in locating the roots of social framing in the workings of imagination is that by doing so he has also opened the way towards radical reflection on institutional arrangements and thus towards promoting social change if transformation towards bureaucratic capitalism can be explained as a product of social imagination breaking the social feedback loop is also possible without having to resort to the nebulous concept of weberian charisma to the extent that the radical social imaginary is not constrained capitalism just like any other previous social order is also susceptible to incremental change resulting from mismatches between regular praxis and what is instituted the more such frictions accumulate the higher the likelihood of generalised questioning of central significations certainty catalytic events may even speed up and radicalise social change for instance in response to the global coronavirus pandemic we have witnessed the unprecedented suspension of economic activity imposed by governments in order to prioritise public health simultaneously the private sector has been mobilised and quasi-nationalised with the substitution of private incomes by state subsidies partington 2020 this could signify a moment of radical departure from economic determinism and the supremacy of economic accumulation could be significantly challenged however even as such events have been unfolding the forces of social inertia and the social feedback loop have not vanished the corporate sectorespecially big pharmaceutical companiesis still relied upon and legitimised as the potential saviour from the pandemic while even wage subsidies could turn out to be a costly and disguised effort ensuring the survival of established economic rationality also rather striking have been the objections of powerful corporate interests to the prioritisation of public health over the economy even as coronavirus fatality rates had been accelerating reich 2020 thus the possibility of a paradigm shift will ultimately depend on whether the epidemics social impact prevents a return to the servitude of the capitalist imaginary once the possibility of sidelining economic accumulation in favour of another social end eg public health has already been experienced this had previously been considered irrational and impossible however the more exceptional a crisis the more likely the response to it will also be regarded as exceptional as such this response may never become systemic so that social inertia eventually prevails still even if a radical shift away from the capitalist spirit and practice could indeed become a visible possibility after such dramatic events the next and more important logical question is about the type of any new central significations and its social desirability to answer this question a vital distinction should be made here while all societies are essentially and always self-instituted they are not necessarily autonomous as they tend to conceal their self-instituting capacity this heteronomy arises when the instituted structure leads to a closure of meaning by suppressing the workings of the radical imaginary as illustrated in the context of bureaucratic organisations third part above social heteronomy can be explained on the basis of a central imaginary representation postulating institutions which are based on a rationality presumed objective and extra-social eg gods will or the market logic as a natural law this is when the relationship between society and its institutions is turned upside down to use castoriadis words with the former serving the latter castoriadis 1987 pp 91 and 110 the only remedy and defence against heteronomy is to institute society on the basis of what castoriadis calls the central signification of autonomy effectively this is a political call for a society that takes responsibility for and abides by its own rules but only for as long as they serve its democratically selected goals by similarly self-reflective and actively responsible citizens in a circle of creation klooger 2012 pp 9192 so if webers hope for social emancipation rests with charismatic leadership castoriadis proposition is for a system of institutions promoting lucidly reflective but necessarily democratic practice as an enduring project of autonomy anchoring the radical social imaginary and its institutional manifestation within such a democratic process is the safeguard against the risk of charismatic leaders authoritarian subjectivism not an unknown phenomenon these days the infinity of the project of autonomy is indispensable because contrary to rational democratic deliberation  la habermas 1996 pp 287328 for castoriadis social outcomes can never be ideal even if they have emerged through a rational process procedural rationality principles are also socially determined and value-laden34 all institutions can only be substantively rational and therefore arbitrary to the extent they are founded on unverifiable values which make them always open to radical revision social autonomy requires the acceptance of this type of openness and its full enactment includes the revision of social deliberation processes too indeed the social feedback loop problem presented above vindicates castoriadis concern in that current democratic arrangements seem to struggle against corporate power the struggle for social autonomy even in the aftermath of a pandemic or other crisis is therefore twofold on the one hand it is for sustaining radical change against the tide of the social feedback loop of economic determinism for long enough on the other hand it is for ensuring that the new structure replacing the old will institute the central signification of autonomy unfortunately the measures adopted in response to the pandemic general lockdown with the suspension of fundamental freedoms can hardly be reconciled with autonomy this risks rendering the social feedback problem analysed in this article even more acute in the future on the basis of the normative position outlined above the primary social legitimacy criterion for corporate law as with any other institution is its compatibility with autonomous reflective action this open in terms of corporate legitimacy but quite prescriptive in terms of method criterion necessitates the undoing of the social feedback loop in order to resolve the conflict between corporate law and social autonomy the question then is if corporate law can indeed accommodate this criterion to begin with that in an autonomous society one would expect to find institutional arrangements promoting democratic deliberation on a substantively rational setting is unquestionable in such a context business organisation would be assigned to serve social purposes which are democratically set without exercising social agency independently of its individual participants essentially this presumes that business organisation ought to be non-bureaucratic otherwise it would undermine individual agents reflective capacity and frustrate substantively rational deliberation within its decision-making and governance arrangements more generally nonetheless the analysis in the third part above has exposed the impossibility of this within the setting of the managerial corporation and corporate capitalism we have already established that the social feedback loop and its corporate law foundation is a typical illustration of the inverted social arrangement where society exists to serve its institutions as corporate bureaucracy imposes its goals upon society the re-imagination of corporate law through its privatisation as business organisation law is the root cause of this problem ultimately through corporate law our society has instituted and reproduces its own heteronomy even if not all corporations are managerial and bureaucratic we have shown how by its nature as a governance form corporate law has an in-built propensity towards organisational growth that is a bureaucratisation tendency as such corporate law is a mechanism for confining meaning within the economic accumulation frame and ultimately limits the creative capacity of the radical imaginary it contradicts autonomy by reproducing the capitalist logic through its re-incarnations as a managerial structure this is indeed its fatal flaw from the perspective of autonomy and in respect of its compatibility with a society instituted on the basis of that perspective seen in this way modern corporate law is simply an ideologically charged product of our own societys self-imposed imaginary in other words corporate law the legal foundations of the social feedback loop can only be explained and justified by adhering to the heteronomous capitalist logic and the ideology that follows and solidifies it as observed by lefort 1978 p 296 ideology conceals the imaginary nature of central significations through the linking together of representations which have the function of re-establishing the dimension of society without history at the very heart of historical society the significance of this is that it crystallises meaning by making issues which are essentially social political and therefore temporary look as if they are simply of a technical nature with little normative background thompson 1982 p 672 and of eternal legitimacy the proliferation of pseudo-scientific mathematical modelling in the justificatory framework for current corporate law doctrine is simply another sophisticated tool concealing the ideological roots of corporate law with a pseudo-scientific gloss chen and hanson 2004 lifting this technocratic facade would simply reveal that corporate law is a deeply political instrument and would open the door towards re-subjecting it to political ie democratic deliberation about its use indeed this way of treating corporate law could open the door to democratic reflection which could resolve its conflict with society however this re-politicisation would contradict its very nature as an institution serving private business interests ie infinite private accumulation as a social end after all it was privatised in order to facilitate the supremacy of private economic interests over the public interest through reducing the latter to the former if this subjugation has not been problematic within capitalism its questioning is equivalent to doubting the very foundations of our society so long as it is guided by the capitalist imaginary the more business activity diverges from what is regarded as the public interest as it increasingly seems to be the case the trade-off between business organisation and social objectives becomes more pronounced and this delegitimises the former as mentioned above the temporary suspension of capitalist accumulation could indeed instigate radical social reflection on the social role of corporate law but inertia could yet again prevail after the pandemics containment eg the focus could be targeted towards economic rebuilding along conventional lines but with higher intensity indeed the first signs of the feedback loops further entrenchment are already visible as among the post-coronavirus reforms considered by the british government is the introduction of manager-friendly corporate insolvency rules partington and stewart 2020 if the legitimacy problem of business organisation is to be resolved its governing law ought to take a radically different turn by imposing limits on the concentration of social power by private organisations outside and above the reach of democratic scrutiny35 otherwise even if the social feedback loops force could be temporarily suspended by social crisis to allow for the emergence of a new social logic corporate bureaucracy would at best mould it to fit its own interests even if radically new as another type of iron cage or it could revert and re-impose the default business purpose of endless accumulation yet again as explained earlier the root of corporate laws socially hazardous nature is its orientation towards accumulation which leads to increasing scale bureaucratisation and the freezing of meaning in economic terms thus one of the preconditions for engraving autonomy in the social structure is to socialise business organisation through the imposition of an organisational limit to its scale this would dismantle the heteronomy loop by removing the dominant agency that business organisation currently has acquired which subjugates social scrutiny it would also prevent the colonising effect of business practice and ideology outside of its strict limits in other sectors of public and private life business organisation would thus become more of a receiver of social significations and more adaptive to social purposes what is clear from the analysis so far though is that corporate law as a structure for business organisation has no evident fit in a social context of this kindits legitimacy exists only in a heteronomous social setting therefore the use of corporate law as business organisation law ought to be marginalised and replaced by structures respectful of autonomy in fact if a prediction can be made this could be inevitable to the extent that capitalist accumulation has reached its natural limits and inexorably leads to societal adaptation towards a post-growth era36 this is indeed an insurmountable challenge to capitalist societys central signification the phantasy of mastery over nature whereas the coronavirus pandemics impact could also fertilise the ideological debate however more effort along the lines suggested in this part will be necessary if social autonomy is to be instituted so corporate lawyers social role is specific and significant in spite of corporate laws social impact discussed here we have established that social paradigm change is after all inevitable since our social order is subjected to the radical imaginarys creative forces and therefore can never be eternally set however it matters little whether the heteronomy loop of corporate capitalism can be temporarily broken if this breaking does not lead to an autonomous society and is replaced instead by some other heteronomous social arrangement thus what matters most is that social focus and therefore academic effort should be on replacing the current relation between society and its structure with a different one instituting the principle of autonomy inevitably within this frame our business organisation law ought to look very different to how it currently does and its legitimacy must be grounded on its capacity to accommodate self-reflection rather than being based on some other objective irrationality as a first start in this direction even if this is a painful process for corporate lawyers we should acknowledge that corporate laws social legitimacy has already been lost from this acknowledgment begins the responsibility to re-envisage business organisation law in radically different terms if it is to cease being an institution of hazardous social inertia the paradigm of social autonomy constitutes a good general guide in this process which undoubtedly will have to be dynamic and perpetual even if working out the detail of what business organisation law ought to be is beyond the endeavour of this article the discussion above has revealed one major aspect of corporate law causing its legitimacy problem as a hazardous institution of heteronomy namely its inherent orientation towards endless accumulation law reform in this area could then start by actively promoting the marginalisation of corporate law in the structuration of business organisation positive action along these lines could involve the promotion of non-corporate legal structures for non-hierarchical organisation which can accommodate autonomous agency better to the extent radical social change is at least imaginable if not inevitable the black-letter corporate lawyer an increasingly imaginary figure would then need to be prepared for the marginalisation of the private business corporation delaying this could eventually backfire as the increasing divergence between corporate and social interests may eventually take a more authoritarian or violent turn and the coercive reaction to the coronavirus is not too promising  title information and disinformation social media in the covid-19 crisis authors michael gottlieb sean dyer john stroger h  hospital   the novel coronavirus disease of 2019 covid-19 is a global pandemic with over 47 million cases and 316000 deaths worldwide 1 social media defined as electronic communication through which users create online communities to share information ideas personal messages and other content 2 has played an important role during the covid-19 pandemic in fact social media usage amongst the public has previously been demonstrated to significantly increase in cases of natural disasters and crises 3 however it is important to consider the benefits and limitations of this medium there are several key benefits to social media during times of national crises first social media can be utilized to facilitate the distribution of new information to providers on the front lines as examples of this include recent online discussions regarding controversial studies of hydroxychloroquine 5 and remdesivir 6 additionally this can allow healthcare leaders to directly communicate with the public sharing information that was traditionally relegated to medical journals and hospital video sessions this is evidenced by healthcare leaders having prominent social media accounts with large numbers this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved of non-physician followers examples of this include dr esther choo 113000 followers dr megan ranney 36000 followers and dr jeremy faust 36000 followers who have utilized twitter and other social media outlets to increase awareness of healthcare crises and public health needs moreover experts can openly debate topics while identifying and challenging false information in real-time finally social media can allow healthcare providers and healthcare systems to identify trends and prepare for surges in acuity this may allow for advanced procurement and rationing of needed supplies to protect healthcare providers and patients as well as altering hospital functions to better sustain the anticipated challenges for example an awareness of critical national personal protective equipment ppe shortages allowed for hospitals to begin to develop strategies to reallocate and ration ppe where possible and engage local businesses to repurpose production for medical supplies these systems can also share information in a much more open manner to facilitate incidence tracking as well as identify differences in incidence rates a similar approach has been used previously to prepare for hurricanes and tornadoes in real-time 3 however it is also important to consider some of the limitations of social media in this setting one major consequence of the massive amount of information being shared via social media is difficulty with filtering information the online social media tracking program talkwalker tm new york city ny usa reported that covid-19 had been referenced on social media 402 million times from may 12 th  2020 to may 18 th  2020 7 as the sheer volume of social media information rises the signal-to-noise ratio lowers and it can become difficult to identify factual and pertinent information additionally social media can allow for virtual celebrities and influencers both medical and non-medical to have a significant influence on information spread due to their number of followers regardless of the accuracy of their information this can lead to rapid spread of incorrect information and significant potential for harm one study found that physicians are not able to reliably assess the quality of online resources using their gestalt alone 8 another study found that up to 27 of physician bloggers had undisclosed financial conflicts of interest 9 this can be particularly problematic given the increased emphasis on novel therapeutic agents this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved targeted toward covid-19 which may have harmful side effects this may be even more challenging for the public as a wide array of physicians appear on social media sites occasionally proposing strategies which conflict with recommended care therefore we propose the following strategies to improve the role of social media during covid-19 and future emergencies first we must train both providers and the general public how to properly evaluate social media resources this should include an assessment of conflicts of interest and looking beyond the headline to review the supporting literature one approach could be to create online tutorials using real examples from social media to demonstrate the importance in a more tangible manner additionally a system could be implemented by which social media outlets are vetted by a third party to ensure accuracy and publicly display the results in order to inform the public of notoriously inaccurate and misleading sources of information we should also help identify and expand the reach of reliable healthcare experts on social media twitter has recently approached this by substantially increasing the number of verified healthcare experts on their site creating and publicizing lists of reliable public health experts as well as amplifying their messages via social media will also help in this regard additionally we should challenge online experts to include their credentials specialty of training conflicts of interest and if active in clinical care what environment they work in this would aid users in being able to most clearly contextualize their comments and recommendations we should also work with social media companies to help adapt algorithms so that more reliable information appears at the top of search indices finally we should create centralized locations for medical professionals to share and disseminate reliable information and engage in discussion as well as post-publication peer review of the literature in a sustainable centralized database social media is more important now than ever but we must be aware of the potential limitations healthcare providers have been leaders on the front lines of this crisis since the onset it is important to be leaders in social media as well accepted article  evaluations from different parties on influenza a h1n1 prevention and control 180 7 evaluations from different parties on influenza a  71 the publics assessment  assessments of policy formulation and implementation by domestic and international stakeholders especially domestic stakeholders comprise a crucial component of policy evaluation the end goals of the states prevention and control efforts were to ensure the protection of public health and safety protect social order and maintain the status quo in work and life thus assessments on the states responses by patients close contacts medical personnel the public and international community could reflect in many ways the degree of completion for expected objectives and the social effects of adopted prevention and control efforts in order to objectively evaluate the assessments on the states response to influenza a h1n1 by patients close contacts medical personnel and the public this research group conducted the following data collection questionnaires for 3262 randomly sampled residents across the country phone interviews with 893 influenza a h1n1 patients and 646 close contacts from beijing fujian and henan areas and field interviews with 519 personnel from 31 disease control agencies and 243 medical personnel from 29 key hospitals in beijing fujian henan guangdong and sichuan in order to gauge the international communitys assessments on chinas response to the pandemic this research group also conducted interviews and field surveys with the who along with a literature review of international media the publics satisfaction with the central governments response to influenza a h1n1 reflects their assessment of the states overall performance in the prevention and control of the virus the changes in the level of public trust in the states emergency response capabilities also reflects the credibility of the government in handling emergencies and it also gives credence to the efficient communication between government and society the effect of individual differences in  satisfaction to a certain extent reflects the impact of specific prevention and control measures on different groups of people based on the above presumptions in order to objectively gauge the publics assessment on the states response to influenza a h1n1 the assessment group worked with the horizon surveying company to conduct door-to-door surveys with 3262 randomly sampled residents across the country these surveys analyzed the following the level of satisfaction regarding the central governments overall performance in its prevention and control efforts the perceived effectiveness of the prevention and control mechanism established by the central government level of satisfaction in the local governments including sub-district office and government from the town and township level to the provincial level overall performance in prevention and control the level of trust or changes of trust in the central governments and local governments including sub-district office and government from the town and township level to the provincial level emergency response capabilities after experiencing the influenza a h1n1 epidemic and information credibility provided by the central and local governments as the outbreak of influenza a h1n1 constituted a national public health emergency the central government took the lead by forming a prevention and control mechanism and also by formulating an overall response strategy under the guidance of this strategy local governments then adopted relevant measures to mitigate the disaster assessing the level of public satisfaction of the governments efforts means we must evaluate the overall performance of the government in mitigating this epidemic the strategies made by the central government needed to be carried out by the local governments and the extent to which measures were implemented directly affected the efficiency of prevention and control efforts therefore the publics level of satisfaction of the local governments including governments at the provincial municipal county town and township level and sub-district offices overall performance in prevention and control is actually based upon their direct perception of how the measures were implemented in their local area 7111 nearly 92 of the public was satisfied with the central governments performance in mitigating the influenza a h1n1 pandemic a large portion of the sampled public nearly 92 expressed their satisfaction in the central governments overall performance among these 449 of respondents stated they were very satisfied with the governments response efforts 4664 expressed they were quite satisfied and 025 stated they were dissatisfied with the efforts fig 71  as can be seen in the data individual characteristics within the public didnt significantly impact their assessment of the central governments response efforts and it is evident that satisfaction with the states efforts was prevalent among the masses in regards to overall satisfaction we investigated the impact demographics and other characteristics may have on the publics assessment using one-way analysis of variance we found that factors such as gender age educational background income residence experience with infectious disease and having children had no significant impact on the level of satisfaction in regards to the central governments responses after dividing the respondents according to age income and gender respectively we found that more than 90 of the respondents felt satisfied with the government which was accordance with the overall situation there were some significant differences in the level of satisfaction among different occupations and industries the results of the study showed that middle to upper level management in enterprises expressed higher satisfaction than their peers in government bodies and public institutions over 90 of enterprise management expressed their satisfaction with the central government while over 80 in government bodies and public institutions answered as being satisfied after separating the groups by industry we found that the education sector and the hotel and restaurant sector had lower levels of satisfaction than the average value  fig 72 in our assessment we paid special attention to the publics level of satisfaction with the prevention and control mechanism as it played a pivotal role in the central governments response efforts among the respondents 3613 knew that the state council had established such a mechanism out of those who were aware of it 5709 believed it to be successful and 3579 found it to be very successful as shown in fig 7  3  it is evident that most of the people who knew about the mechanism believed in its efficacy the public was also satisfied with their local governments as 85 were satisfied with their local governments overall performance but generally not as much as they were satisfied with the central government as you can see in fig 7 4 which shows the publics satisfaction towards the central government the proportion of people who answered very satisfied declined and overall satisfaction dropped by 7 while more people answered as being neutral to not being satisfied with their local governments performance in line with the satisfaction found with the central government demographic factors such as gender age educational background income and family background had no significant impact on the level of satisfaction occupations however did have a relatively significant impact as 124 of service members as well as the same percentage of police officers were neutral or dissatisfied with the local governments overall performance the participants working in education had the highest level of dissatisfaction among the groups with 91 answering as dissatisfied in terms of a regional comparison residents in the central region were slightly less satisfied with local government than residents in the eastern and western regions while the proportion of eastern respondents expressing not very satisfied with the performance of local governments was higher than those of the central and western regions credibility in a government is a type of soft resource its the amount of trust the public has in their state institutions its an important guarantee of a governments usefulness and its improvement and enhancing this credibility is mutually beneficial for both the government and the public enhancing credibility can happen through the government proactively improving its performance or it can happen through communication with the public therefore we took two factors into consideration when assessing the states prevention and control efforts and their impact on government credibility one was measuring the level of trust or change in trust by the public in their governments emergency response capabilities after they experienced the influenza a h1n1 outbreak which showed the impact of the states emergency management response on the governments credibility second was measuring the level of public trust in the information provided by the government which showed the impact of communication on government credibility in order to assess credibility in the states prevention and control efforts this assessment team measured the change in trust by the public after they experienced the influenza a h1n1 in regards to the central and local governments capabilities in emergency management we also compared the level of trust during the sars period with this epidemic the results of the survey showed that the public generally expressed confidence in the governments emergency response capacity and the public became significantly more trusting of local governments and their capabilities in regards to the central governments emergency response capabilities the following results were found 323 of the public polled felt the same amount of trust as before 447 felt they trusted in the past and have a little more trust in them now 191 felt no trust in the past and now there is trust and only 21 felt that they did not trust in the central government see table 7 1 as shown in table 7 1 in regards to local governments emergency response capabilities the following results were found 359 felt the same amount of trust as before 306 felt they trusted in the past and have a little more trust in them now 274 felt no trust in the past and now there is trust and only 41 expressed no trust in their local governments which is two percentage points higher than those who expressed the same for the central government the central governments credibility has been relatively high in regards to emergency response with 77 of respondents expressing they had confidence or even more confidence than before in the governments capabilities after experiencing the outbreak of influenza a h1n1 the ratio of respondents that felt no trust before but now there is trust was much higher for local governments 306 of respondents than for the central government 191 although the credibility of local governments overall was relatively lower after the outbreak there was a significant increase in the trust in local governments response capabilities in the surveys we asked respondents about the reliability of news from different sources including the central government local government experts grassroots communities village groups working units and news by word of mouth the results clearly showed that during this epidemic the publics most trusted news source was still the government and the trust in the central government was higher than in local governments as seen in fig 7 5 similar to the assessment on the publics satisfaction towards their government demographic factors such as gender age educational background income family background and residence had no significant impact on their perception of the governments credibility what did make a significant impact on the perception of the credibility of the central government was whether the respondent or any of the respondents family members had been infected in the past by a contagious virus however this one factor did not seem to have any significant impact on the respondents confidence in their local governments the government adopted relevant measures in each of the four distinct epidemic phases and these measures included the following customs health inspection patient isolation close contact isolation class suspension where the virus was prevalent the promotion of wearing masks and frequent hand washing inoculations more exercise and the use of traditional chinese medicine the majority of the respondents recognized the need for these measures especially the customs health inspection patient isolation close contact isolation class suspension and the promotion of exercise over half of the respondents felt that these measures were necessary as can be seen in fig 7 6 it is clear that there was a wide acceptance by the public of these prevention and control measures and that the implementation personified humanistic care however fig 7 7 shows that one third of the respondents felt that these measures were inconvenient to a certain extent for their daily routines about 50 of the respondents felt that the measures adopted were appropriate in terms of their intensity but the ratio of those who felt the measures partially strict did rise in the peak and slow periods of the epidemic fig 79  as seen in fig 7 as seen in fig 7 information disclosure to the public had a direct impact on their level of awareness and behaviors surrounding the epidemic the government disclosed information not only regarding trends in the domestic spread of the virus and scientific information regarding prevention and control they also disseminated information on the measures adopted as well as the provided information to relevant agencies as seen in fig 7 12 the public generally approved of the governments disclosure on epidemic information and over 80 of respondents approved of the information regarding their local epidemic situation the domestic and international trends updates and the use of self-protection in preventing the spread of the virus all of those who had been infected with sars the avian flu or influenza a h1n1 felt that the government did very well in disclosing the right information to the public from a regional perspective people in the eastern regions showed the smallest amount of satisfaction in the local information disclosure regarding the epidemic the highest level of satisfaction was found in the western regions and satisfaction in the northern regions was slightly higher than in the southern regions as seen in figs 713 and 714 prevention and control in public places was the focal point of post-epidemic measures which included disinfecting temperature testing isolation prevention and control information dissemination and the retention of personal data as 15 shows over half of the respondents communities adopted measures such as disinfecting areas and disseminating prevention and control information which were the focus of the prevention and control efforts during this phase schools are also focus of the middle-to late-stage prevention and control efforts and the implementation of these measures was fairly comprehensive most schools took measures including disinfecting temperature testing as well as prevention and control information dissemination one third of the schools employed isolation measures and retained personal data  fig 716  hospital-led prevention and control measures were the most comprehensive in scope as most hospitals adopted measures such as disinfecting temperature testing and dissemination of prevention and control information almost 40 of hospitals adopted isolation measures as well  fig 717 fig 7 14 satisfaction in information disclosure in the northern and southern regions a horizontal comparison was done on the same data for different prevention and control measures and it was found that implementation of disinfecting and temperature testing in schools and hospitals was more comprehensive fig 718  as a portion of the respondents lacked any interaction or understanding of hotels it is understandable that there was a high rate of refused to answerdont know responses  patients and close contacts of influenza a h1n1 were the direct beneficiaries of the states prevention and control strategies and measures and their attitudes feelings and levels of satisfaction with these policies directly reflect the outcome of the governments response efforts understanding the implementation of these prevention and control strategies for patients and close contacts and understanding the attitudes feelings and levels of satisfaction from these affected people towards national strategies will provide useful references for future emergency response policies based on the four different epidemic phases we employed a stratified sampling method and conducted phone interviews with 893 patients and 646 close contacts from the three areas in the national disease monitoring information report management system beijing fujian and henan the interview included topics covering implementation of quarantine and treatment policies during different epidemic phases the implementation of discharge standard policies the implementation of humanistic care policies and medical treatment costs we also investigated the attitudes of the close contacts in regards to medical observation management and humanistic care policy implementation the study showed that 65 of patients were either satisfied or very satisfied with the national prevention and control efforts 26 were neutral and 9 were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied table 7 2 as seen in tables 73 74 and 75 93 of patients felt that the prevention and control measures adopted by the government were necessary however 25 of them felt that these measures caused some level of inconvenience to their daily lives and among them 79 felt that they could tolerate this inconvenience among those patients who believed the measures were inconvenient most 75 found the isolation measures to be the most inconvenient followed by triage diagnosis and treatment measures lastly measures such as control of public opinion information disclosures and class suspensions did have a certain impact on peoples daily lives table 7 6 shows that 17 of patients felt that state-led prevention and control measures were a little strict during the onset of the epidemic during our investigations into assessments of early prevention and control we discovered that respondents in in the central province of henan felt that these measures were a little strict and it also was evident that there was a certain rationality and necessity to adjusting regional policies according to regional differences table 7 7 shows that 42 of patients felt that the prevention and control measures taken against the influenza a h1n1 epidemic were fair or very fair 37 were neutral 13 felt it was hard to say and 7 felt that they were unfair or very unfair among those respondents overall evaluations in henan were lower than those found in beijing and fujian and thus it is clear that distinct differences existed in the implementation and adjustments of regional policies table 7 10 shows that after experiencing the prevention and control 79 of patients felt they could trust in the governments response capabilities 15 stated it was hard to say and 6 expressed distrust in the governments capabilities as seen in tables 712 713 and 714 93 of close contacts polled felt that the prevention and control measures directed towards them were necessary but 23 of them also felt that these efforts caused to some extent inconvenience to their daily lives among those that felt inconvenienced 92 of them felt they could tolerate it regarding the prevention and control measures adopted by the government at the start of the epidemic 11 of close contacts felt that they were a little strict 71 felt them to be appropriate only 3 found them to be too relaxed and 15 stated it in comparison with the response to sars 95 of close contacts felt that the state had made progress in its public health emergency response capabilities as seen in table 7 18 after experiencing the prevention and control measures against the influenza a h1n1 epidemic 84 of close contacts felt they could trust the states health emergency response capabilities 15 stated it was hard to say and 6 expressed distrust as seen in table 7 19 medical agencies and disease prevention and control mechanisms were the core organizations in the response efforts against influenza a h1n1 as they were responsible for policy advice and implementation during the epidemic thus medical personnel working for these agencies were directly involved in the process and should be able to make judgments concerning these policies their assessments on the timeliness necessity rationality feasibility sustainability and comprehensiveness of these policies will better reflect the implementation and effects of these policies and measures in order to gain an understanding of assessments from medical personnel on national prevention and control policies we provided a questionnaire to the following entities the heads of the comprehensive team the medical treatment team and the safeguarding team from the prevention and control mechanism managers and leaders from 29 designated hospitals for influenza a h1n1 cases and hospitals that received and treated severe cases of influenza a h1n1 and relevant personnel from 31 disease prevention and control agencies all within beijing fujian guangdong sichuan and henan the questionnaire covered the evaluation and analysis for medical agencies and disease prevention and control departments on the distribution adjustments implementation and enforceability of national medical treatment policies tables 720 721 and 722 display the scores given to prevention and control policies and medical policy implementation by medical personnel in the 29 designated hospitals that treated influenza a h1n1 these personnel assessed the policies timeliness necessity rationality feasibility sustainability and comprehensiveness the results of this study showed that 93 of the medical personnel polled felt that the medical treatment policies and measures during the imported case phase of the epidemic were timely or very timely and no respondent felt that the measures were untimely or very untimely 91 of the respondents felt that the measures were timely or very timely during the light domestic cases phase of the epidemic again with no one finding them untimely or very untimely and during the peak phase of the epidemic 85 of those personnel felt that the measures were timely or very timely with 4 feeling that the measures were untimely there was a trend of declining approval of the timeliness of the measures shown in the responses the results of this study produced the following 95 of medical personnel polled felt that the prevention and control along with medical treatment measures implemented during the imported case phase were necessary or very necessary and no one felt them to be unnecessary 92 of the respondents felt that the measures were necessary or very necessary during the light domestic case phase of the epidemic again with no one feeling that they were unnecessary and 93 felt the measures to be necessary or very necessary during the peak phase of the epidemic with no one finding them unnecessary the assessments regarding the necessity of these policies and measures remain relatively high  the results of this study showed that 84 of medical personnel polled felt that the prevention and control as well as the medical treatment measures implemented during the imported case phase of the epidemic were either rational or very rational with 04 who felt the measures were not rational 87 of respondents felt that the measures implemented during the light domestic case phase were rational or very rational with no one finding them to be not rational and 91 of respondents felt the measures implemented during the peak phase of the epidemic to be rational or very rational with no one finding them not rational there was an upwards trend of more people believing in the rationality of the measures implemented the results of this study showed that 80 of medical personnel polled felt that the prevention and control as well as the medical treatment measures implemented during the imported case phase of the epidemic were feasible or very feasible with 08 finding the measures infeasible 82 of the respondents felt the measures implemented during the light domestic case phase were feasible or very feasible with a few individuals finding them infeasible and 85 of the respondents felt the measures implemented during the peak phase of the epidemic were feasible or very feasible with no one finding them infeasible there was also an upwards trend in the perceived feasibility for these measures the results of this study showed that 70 of the medical personnel polled felt that the prevention and control as well as the medical treatment measures implemented during the imported case phase of the epidemic were sustainable or very sustainable with 3 finding the measures to be unsustainable 79 of the respondents felt the measures implemented during the light domestic case phase were sustainable or very sustainable with a few individuals finding the measures to be unsustainable and 85 of respondents felt the measures implemented during the peak phases of the epidemic were sustainable or very sustainable with no one finding them unsustainable there was an upwards trend of perceived sustainability for these measures the results of this study showed that 70 of medical personnel polled felt that the prevention and control as well as the medical treatment measures implemented during the imported case phase of the epidemic were comprehensive or very comprehensive with 2 finding them uncomprehensive or very uncomprehensive 76 of respondents felt the measures implemented during the light domestic case phase were comprehensive or very comprehensive with only a few individuals finding them uncomprehensive and 83 of respondents felt the measures implemented during the peak phase of the epidemic were comprehensive or very comprehensive with no one finding them to be uncomprehensive there was an upwards trend in the perceived comprehensiveness of these measures figure 7 20 outlines policy assessments for the first three phases of the epidemic and from this comparison we can see that there is a downwards trend in perceived timeliness and necessity of the policies and so the timing of policy adjustments may need further consideration there is an upwards trend in believing in the rationality of the policies as well as their feasibility sustainability and comprehensiveness this shows that the entire process of influenza a h1n1 prevention and control was rational and as we gained a deeper understanding of the virus and epidemic information the medical policies gradually improved and became more sustainable  this study conducted surveys on 519 disease control personnel from fujian guangdong sichuan henan and beijing to find out their understanding and assessment of prevention and control policies and measures the results are as follows the results show that 95 of disease control personnel felt overall that the prevention and control of influenza a h1n1 was successful and 67 felt that the overall inputoutput ratio for these efforts was proper in comparison with the prevention and control of sars 75 felt the measures were timelier 72 felt they were more open 69 felt they were more transparent 59 felt they were more rational and 57 felt they were more effective table 7 23 among the disease control personnel 95 felt that the national strategies for the different phases were fully consistent or mostly consistent with the epidemic situation 95 felt that the strategies were consistent with objectives 94 felt that the measures were consistent with the strategies and 90 felt that the measures were in line with the epidemic situation as seen in table 7 24 among the respondents 90 felt it was necessary to make influenza a h1n1 a statutory epidemic under the countrys legislation among those 70 thought influenza a h1n1 should be dealt with as a class b infectious disease and only 44 felt it was necessary to respond to it with class a infectious disease management measures 85 felt that the timing was appropriate in dropping it from class a to class b infectious disease and 83 felt that in the future it should be dropped from class a to class c see table 7 25 table 7 26 shows that 81 of respondents thought that the management of close contacts was only necessary in the early days of the epidemic 91 felt that adjustments in close contact measures suited the epidemic situation at that time 84 felt the adjustment suited local conditions and 85 felt that the timing was appropriate in adjusting close contact policies during the different epidemic phases as show in table 7 27 84 of respondents felt that the epidemic monitoring network needed to be expanded 76 felt that the proper amount of expansion was conducted and 78 felt that the expansion was realistic what cannot be ignored is that 20 of respondents did not approve of this expansion stating in the interviews that a large-scale expansion simply wasnt necessary and that choosing a few representative areas would suffice these respondents felt that it was a waste of resources and that it would be unsustainable after the epidemic in regards to the number of sentinel hospitals and laboratories along with the coverage of the monitoring network how to distribute resources to properly meet the demands of prevention and control and at the same time reduce inputs to ensure sustainability is an issue that requires further study as fig 7 21 shows concrete measures received fairly high approval rates of four and above building on this in comparison we see that close contact management measures and adjustments received the lowest ratings followed by case diagnostic processing and expansion measures for the epidemic monitoring network law-based management scored the highest among the assessments necessity and importance of these measures also received high ratings however sustainability comprehensiveness and fairness scored relatively low which need to be strengthened in future policy formulation in scoring the different epidemic phases necessity importance and timeliness all received high ratings but the rationality feasibility sustainability among those besides the high score of timeliness in the imported case phase all other items scored relatively low in this phase as seen in fig 7 22 one key characteristic of the prevention and control efforts against the influenza a h1n1 pandemic was widespread and strategic international cooperation understanding international assessments on the national prevention and control efforts will provide us with a more comprehensive and objective view into our own successes and setbacks therefore we conducted in depth interviews with who officials stationed in beijing and we conducted a literature review on the international media surrounding the pandemic looking at the overall picture of their prevention and control strategies from the very beginning china adopted a containment strategy and also adopted other control measures like close contact isolation and held these measures in place over a long period of time the transition to the mitigation phase did take a little longer than in other countries as this decision took into consideration chinas domestic realities chinas medical treatment capabilities are weaker than developed countries like the us and thus the country needs to strengthen its first line of defense however this type of containment strategy expends a large amount of resources and manpower and as soon as the epidemic spreads containment is no longer efficient in regards to vaccinations china was the first developing country to successfully research and implement inoculations the who offered guidance to many countries as well as information to help with decision-making and chinas prevention and control measures in many areas were quite stringent the mainstream media did not provide a lot of judgments on the actions of the chinese government for this epidemic nor were there any clear criticisms the majority of news reports were objective and rational and simply covered the facts there were few that provided any evaluations in other words most of the reports focused on a few key countries including china and provided introductions to the outbreaks developments and prevention and control efforts there were very few that provided any assessments of these developments in a sense this phenomenon could mean that chinas emergency management was suited to the task this time around which left little for the media to criticize taking into account mainstream media leans more towards criticism and not praise and the influx of criticism from foreign media for the sars outbreak we could interpret this phenomenon as a more positive international response to chinas influenza a h1n1 prevention and control efforts both public and expert opinion overall showed that although there were criticisms most understood and approved of the strict prevention and control measures china adopted in response to the influenza a h1n1 epidemic during the onset of the outbreak the chinese governments decision to segregate and isolate all of the passengers on the plane was criticized of course the most intense criticism came from the mexican government especially the minister of foreign affairs patricia espinosa she stated that the treatment of mexican citizens in china was discriminatory and that some of the quarantined people were in unacceptable conditions 1 us congress also criticized the isolation procedures by issuing tactful travel warnings the isolation and medical detention adopted by china was called an offensive prevention and control measure in the new york times and china was also criticized for being inflexible as the author felt these type of measures are easy to implement in authoritarian countries 2 other foreign professionals who experienced isolation measures also expressed their dissatisfaction psychiatry professor jonathan m metzl from the university of michigan felt that the isolation he experienced was against public health regulations and xenophobic in nature he also felt that the isolation measures adopted were completely inappropriate 3 other public opinions felt that the measures were redundant the wall street journal also had criticisms on the states actions the governments attempts to quarantine all arriving passengers suspected of carrying h1n1-and those seated around them on aircraft-has been overzealous 4 on the other hand cnn stated in a report on september 16th that china has had perhaps the most extreme and active response to the virus than any other country in the world 5 however a considerable amount of public opinion also reflected an understanding of these measures on november 11th 2009 the new york times quoted a us school teacher who had been isolated in this passage at the time it seemed extreme and it seemed restrictive because i had never experienced an infectious disease outbreak now looking back and seeing some of the measures that are being taken now in the us the chinese measures dont seem so extreme 6 msnbc also pointed out that china was hit hard before by sars its understandable as to why they are so worried about another outbreak of an infectious disease bbc news also stated that this time the government has acted quickly and decisively 7 in november 2009 the head of the who office in beijing officially approved of chinas response measures to influenza a h1n1 stating i think there were a variety of measures put in place by different countries and its difficult to say what worked best and what didnt but chinas has worked very well 8 2 the international opinion around chinas isolation measures were doubtful of its effectiveness and high cost for example the los angeles times made their opinion clear so is chinas aggressive approach which has quarantined thousands of americans and others the proper way to protect its population from the new flu no 13 there was positive feedback regarding chinas influenza a h1n1 vaccination but there were also suspicions regarding its effectiveness for example australias the age expressed the concern that although the vaccination is at the international forefront of development it still poses a safety issue 14 the csis commission on smart global health policy stated that when responding to an infectious disease outbreak the publics trust in their government comes from having no secrets in view of the fact that the lack of trust in the government during the sars period led to the rapid spread of the disease this time around the chinese government and media must learn from the past and promote public cooperation and trust through whatever effective measures are available 15 the los angeles times also purported that many countries-the us included -have tended to see viral illness as coming from outside only to learn that pandemics show little respect for national borders in a globalized world chinese health authorities need to wake up to this lesson and develop chinas ongoing h1n1 response in concert with rather than in rejection of international norms 16 in combination with the survey results of satisfaction with state prevention and control efforts from patients close contacts and medical institutions along with the survey findings on the impact of influenza a h1n1 on the credibility of the government and international assessments the following conclusions can be made the results from this study showed that almost 92 of the public polled were satisfied with the central governments prevention and control efforts among which 449 were very satisfied and only 025 expressed clear dissatisfaction 85 of respondents also were satisfied with their local governments additionally 95 of disease control professionals felt that the measures were an overall success and 84 of close contacts along with 65 of patients expressed satisfaction towards the treatment they were given the overall satisfaction of patients and close contacts was lower than the publics which is understandable as they were the targets of these measures they were constrained in the isolation and treatment process their level of satisfaction naturally decreased the chinese governments work in information disclosure and openness during the prevention and control of influenza a h1n1 garnered widespread approval as the information supplied by the government became the publics most trusted news source the public also approved of the governments emergency response capabilities especially in regards to their local governments as there was a clear improvement in capabilities since sars after they experienced influenza a h1n1 961 of the public polled expressed trust in the central governments emergency response capabilities and 94 of the public expressed trust in their local governments emergency response capabilities compared with the time of sars 638 of the public trusted the central governments emergency response capabilities more and 581 expressed more trust in their local governments emergency response capabilities which shows significant improvement in addition 95 of close contacts and 82 of patients felt that the government made improvements in their public health emergency management the distinct transition of 307 of the respondents from distrust to trust of the local governments capabilities is a clear indication of the significant progress the state has made in emergency management and public communication out of the population that was directly affected by the prevention and control measures 93 of patients 93 of close contacts and 92 of medical personnel in designated hospitals all agreed to the necessity of these measures over 90 of the general public polled also saw the necessity of certain prevention and control measures over 84 of the medical personnel in designated hospitals approved of the rationality of the treatment measures adopted and 91 of disease control personnel felt that the close contact measures adopted were consistent with the current epidemic situation the who also felt that the overall strategy matched chinas epidemic realities and the disease monitoring system garnered worldwide recognition for its success roughly 90 of medical personnel in designated hospitals felt that the prevention and control strategies and measures were adjusted in a timely manner however this proportion was lower in the general public with only 70 feeling that the adjustments were timely the who office in beijing felt that the transition from containment to mitigation was a little slower than other countries and that the cost for containment was rather high in regards to the measures adopted only 50 of the public felt them to be appropriate with roughly 20 stating the measures were relatively strict additionally 17 of patients and 11 of close contacts felt that the measures adopted at the onset of the epidemic were relatively strict some industries and professionals felt the measures to be excessive and the level of satisfaction was relatively low for example the overall satisfaction expressed from military members in regards to prevention and control efforts by the central and local government was relatively low there was higher proportion of neutrality or dissatisfaction among people working in the hotel and restaurant sectors as well as education sector in regards to the central and local governments efforts against influenza a h1n1 this could be because the measures adopted placed more pressure on the military and education sectors and also had a negative impact on the hotelrestaurant businesses roughly 30 of the public polled felt that the government invested a lot into its prevention and control efforts however the proportion of patients and close contacts that felt the investment by the government was worth it is relatively higher than that of the public with 84 of patients and 82 of close contacts seeing the worth of state investment its clear from these numbers that state investment in the prevention and control efforts was widely approved of and supported by the affected population taking management of class a infectious diseases as an example less than half of the disease control personnel felt that influenza a h1n1 needed to be classified for class a management most just felt that in the future this virus should be downgraded to a class c infectious disease at the same time there were similar issues in diagnosis procedures almost 40 of respondents felt it was not necessary to ask the higher authorities to confirm the diagnosis most respondents in fact felt this procedure wasted a large amount of manpower and resources and that it was completely unnecessary thus the formulation of certain prevention and control measures will need improving in the future  the politics of sars -rational responses or ambiguity symbols and chaos tom christensen martin painter  the main focus in this article is on the sars event as a political process involving political leaders administrators and health professionals how can we understand the reactions to sars of some of the main actors and institutions what aspects were they preoccupied with and did their definition of what sars was all about change during the process a selection of jurisdictions is chosen -china the hong kong sar canada and the world health organization -to explore these questions the starting point is a view that the reactions cannot primarily be seen as an instrumental based on rational standard-operating-procedures sops and technical expertise but may be better understood by a garbage can-perspective from a review of the events as publicly reported we find as suggested by garbage can theory that politicians and administrators responses to the sars outbreak were a combination of competing rationalities and overlapping agendas critical decisions were triggered by extraneous factors and administrative actions were shaped by dramatic switches from one set of standard operating procedures to another as events unfolded the public health issues constantly vied with other agendas and only when compelling alignments among them occurred did professional or technical rationales for solving the problem become dominant  the epidemic disease sars severe acute respiratory syndrome caused fear and panic on a global scale the first case of a new kind of atypical pneumonia with no known cause was reported in guangdong province in southern china in november 2002 by early february the hong kong media was reporting a mysterious virus sweeping through guangdong but the chinese authorities issued denials and imposed a media blackout in late february cases appeared in hong kong and hanoi and the world health organizations whos first travel advisory was issued on march 15 cases by now were being reported in canada and singapore the epidemic peaked in april during which month international agencies and governments all over the worldincluding china which in mid-april came clean about the extent of the problem -adopted increasingly drastic measures to combat its spread cases were reported from 30 countries on six continents by july the epidemic was said to be under control indicated by a lifting of all the who travel advisories according to statistics from who during the period of november 1 st 2002 to july 1 st 2003 8445 people were infected by sars the disease killing all together 812 people of whom 348 were in mainland china 298 in hong kong sar 84 in taiwan 38 in canada and 32 in singapore who 2003a  many epidemics and diseases have killed many more people all over the world and continue to do so so how and why did this epidemic create so much public nervousness and panic one explanation could be a more general feeling of insecurity in the world after september 11 another explanation connected to the first one was the handling of sars from the main actors involved primarily who and some of the countries affected early on it was indicated that there was probably no cure for the disease leading many people to think that sars was fatal in most cases in fact there were different reactions and symptoms of varying severity between different infected patients there were successful treatments and death rates were not dramatically high compared with some other diseases vivid accounts in the media of how the disease was spread -via hotel lift buttons through being coughed on by a super-spreader and so on -also added to the sense of fear was this the big one the mystery virus that defied all efforts of modern science sweeping the world with devastating consequences the plague panic epidemic was as virulent if not more so than the disease itself travel and travellers were particularly affected as the speed at which index patients cropped up in different parts of the world highlighted the significance of this mode of transmission countries began to screen or even prohibit visitors from affected areas airlines cancelled flights and laid off thousands of workers hotels in east asia emptied adding to this global public alarm and uncertainty was a feeling that the authorities didnt have control of sars it was almost a doublebind situation for many countries if they admitted that sars was a problem and they took dramatic measures people got nervous if they said things were under control it was seen as deception and cover-up and created even more nervousness the same pattern was seen in whos initial somewhat reluctant action and their later warnings against the possible effects of the disease seen by many as overreacting the main focus in this article is on the sars event as a political process involving political leaders administrators and health professionals all over the world we are interested in the way the fighting of sars was organized and performed how can we understand the reactions to sars of some of the main actors and institutions -whos decision makers and spokespersons chinas leaders hong kongs health administrators canadas politicians and so on what aspects were they preoccupied with and did their definition of what sars was all about change during the process can their reactions primarily be seen as an instrumental reaction based on rational standardoperating-procedures sops and technical expertise or are their responses better understood by a garbage can-perspective where sops were not in place but had to be invented where symbols were important and several other events and problems became connected in unpredictable ways with the process of dealing with sars our analysis will principally tap into those aspects of events brought to the knowledge of the public in the media our empirical data do not come from primary sources such as interviews with top political leaders we focus on the realm of communication and public debate about sars and upon published internal and external reviews of national and international organizations responses as a reflection of political and administrative actions this is clearly a limitation as much of what we conclude is based on inferences rather than on direct evidence on elite decision making behaviour graham t allisonss 1971 analysis of the cuban missile crisis using three decision-making models -rational actor organizational processes and governmental bureaucratic politics -drew on three seminal traditions in organizational theory and policy making studies the same traditions inform our starting point allisons contribution effectively demolished the unitary rational actor model as an adequate explanatory framework on its own however the insights of organizational theory on bounded rationality simon 1957 were deployed by allison to illuminate important dimensions of the decision making process we go further by contending that a garbage can approach march and olsen 1976 can assist in showing how complex crises are handled from an organizational process perspective such an approach we argue also illuminates the nature of bureaucratic politics drawing on bounded rationality theory political and administrative actors behaviour in public decision-making processes can primarily be seen as combining social control and rational calculation dahl and lindblom 1953  on the control side political and administrative leaders are supposed to exercise control at the top either by participating themselves in closed processes or by tightly controlling other principal participants in the decision making processes rational calculation means that actors must score high on formulating relatively unambiguous goals and means and they have good insights into the possible effects of different actions and their probability of solving problems and fulfilling goals a tight coupling between control and rational calculation may imply that there are some very unambiguous ways of organizing like standardized rules for handling decision-making processes often labelled standard operating procedures sops this implies that when certain events happen and certain decisions and actions are taken there is a relative lack of ambiguity about which actors get involved what role they should play and what actions are to be taken according to different structural positions actors have different functions and roles to play there is always a trade-off between the necessity of tight control in public decisions through hierarchical steering on the one hand and on the other the involvement of a broader set of participants often through different kinds of collegial structural arrangements to accommodate bargaining here allisons governmental politics model comes into play decision making becomes a multi-player game allison 1971 162-81  while more participants may slow things down and make decisions more loose and ambiguous this can at the same time increase the legitimacy of the leadership and the process for example the leadership needs the expertise of internal and external participants particularly if it is a technically advanced policy area these participants -particularly if their right to contribute rests on expertise that is stored in public agencies with formal jurisdictions -will want discretion and leeway for enacting their functions something that may potentially undermine the control of the leadership and drive it to bargain and negotiate there are a number of potential problems for public leaders in scoring high on both political control and rational calculation it is not an easy task to formulate unambiguous goals in an increasingly complex and changing world nor is it easy to find clear instruments for achieving them for example structural or organizational solutions the more complex novel or crisis-bound nature of the issue the less will it be likely that tight management of bargaining plus judicious deployment of appropriate sops will suffice insight into the effects of actions and measuring these effects amidst other public actions is also problematic in the sars process we had a set of decision problems fraught with ambiguity uncertainty social panic and political conflict do we see tight control of the process by the political leadership or are the decision making processes more varied involving a variety of participants what characterizes the relationship between the political leadership the administrative leadership of the health sector and the more typical epidemic expertise do we find unity and agreement or conflicts is there a clear common definition of how to handle sars or disagreement and do the definition change over time is the impression that there are unambiguous sops that are used when sars occur or do the actors have to change existing sops or invent some new ones the garbage can perspective developed by march and olsen 1976 extends allisons framework of analysis of organizational process factors in a way that might help to cope with the extreme uncertainties and ambiguities of the sars case it is founded on some basic premises first participants in public decision-making processes have attention and capacity problems so their participation is parttime and unpredictable thus their real attention is not only based on rational calculation second each and every decision situation is characterized by ambiguous stimuli meaning that the decisions could have several different aspects whether they are closely connected to the formal decision agenda or not political and social factors that have more or less ambiguous relations to the issue in hand can come into play there could also be disagreement about how history should be interpreted elements of superstitious learning and disagreement about what the decisions and the decision contexts are all about thus decisions are garbage cans in the sense that participants can throw a lot of premises for diverse actions into them making problem definition solution search and choice more unpredictable thus in an organization or formal decision arena participants problems solutions and decision situations come and go and are very varied and context-or situation-driven solutions can come first waiting for problems to be connected with not only problems worked on to find solutions participants can be characterized by local rationality as in allisons organization process model but their actions may be poorly coordinated and the collective result of separate actions relatively irrational and the manipulation of symbols because instrumental action is made difficult may characterize decision-making processes this last point has been highlighted as a common feature of many supposedly ration-comprehensive reform processes in the public sector where hypocrisy frequently characterize leaders behaviour in the absence of clarity over reform consequences christensen and laegreid 2001  so what is the relevance of this perspective to the sars process is the participation structure characterized by being fluid and unpredictable are the definitions of what sars is all about as a public issue characterized by being particularly varied ambiguous or changing and is the public talk accompanied by high usage of political symbols do different actors try to connect sars to other political and administrative processes going on at the same time processes that originally were pretty loosely coupled to sars do they eventually see sars as an opportunity to shift blame and support to certain actors are their actions typically solution-driven the sars issue exhibited certain common features across jurisdictions features that we can categorise into three types first the nature of the epidemic itself and its social and economic consequences second the range and type of participants involved and third a common context of multi-level global governance structures as to the first the sars issue exhibited high degrees of uncertainty and risk for decision makers lack of knowledge about causes along with the absence of a cure and of well-tried technologies for prevention created similar problems for all in part due to its nature as a new disease the epidemic took the first jurisdictions to suffer its consequences by surprise at the same time lack of preparedness was a common accusation as doomsayers had been predicting such an event for some time bundled together with this accusation other criticisms were common such as inadequate resources and lack of coordination among the several agencies involved in dealing with the epidemic both within and across national borders as to social and economic consequences the effect of the epidemic on business and commerce due to the fear of travel and to the deliberate attempt by the authorities to limit movement in and out of affected areas impacted on all affected countries regardless of the measures they took themselves to deal with the outbreak another near-universal feature of the sars issue as a policy problem was the extent to which it called into question the integrity and status of the nation-state governments were highly sensitive to the need to act responsibly as a result of international pressure to prevent the spread and they also faced the urge particularly in the least affected countries to pull up the drawbridge in pursuit of national protection the dilemma for many was whether the responsible course of action was either internationalist and cooperative or protectionist and unilateral the same groups in each community -in particular health workers who bore the brunt of infections and deaths -were prominent in their claims to participate and to be given special attention in decision making the special status afforded to the so-called expert epidemiologists and other medical scientists was a notable feature albeit in a context where they perhaps more than any other group freely admitted their limited understanding complex technical debates about such things as the adequacy of methods of diagnosis and labelling or the accuracy of published death rates dismayed those looking for authoritative reassurance from the experts responses and remedies recommended by them were disconcertingly diverse and multidimensional there was on the one hand a search for sophisticated scientific knowledge about the virus with a view to finding a chemical cure and on the other exhortations to the general community to wipe their feet and wash their hands given a natural urge on the part of medical staff to self-preservation this lack of certainty exhibited itself in some cases as a particular kind of techno-panic in which the uncertainty about causes prevention and cure coupled with an acute awareness of the possible worst case consequences led to ultracautious and failsafe recommendations the very status of medical science and the health professions was wrapped up in the struggle to define the appropriate responses the global and international context of the issue was in part a reflection of the border-less nature of any epidemic but it was also a consequence of two contemporary circumstances first the increasingly global reach of the media and second the existence of a burgeoning set of multi-lateral institutions for dealing with cross-border health problems as to the first the intense interest of the international media created a news storm that no jurisdiction -not even china -could escape where there were obstacles to news-gathering and reporting the internet and text-messaging were vital unofficial methods of access to and dissemination of information about the disease as to the second circumstance the role of the who meant that no nation state could act in isolation although each could adopt varying degrees of the same kind of response for example more or less harsh quarantine and surveillance measures the fact that the mere labelling or un-labelling of a country or region by the who could have such dire economic and social consequences gave that body and those upon whom it depended for support and advice extraordinary global power in response the pressures for cross-border cooperation of a defensive kind to protect state capacities were intense resulting in involvement at the highest level by political leaders through multi-lateral organisations such as asean issues of national performance and integrity were at stake as well as the status of international monitoring and regulation by a body such as who we can best see the combined effects of these various factors on decision making by governments and by the multi-lateral agencies by taking account also of the national local political and institutional variables in each case when we observe the unfolding of national and international responses in the face of events we see the different considerations that came to play in decision making processes we shall look first at three systems of government -china hong kong and canada -and finally at the who as a major institutional actor ever-present for all three sets of governments guangdong province experienced a serious outbreak of what later came to be called sars during january 2003 placing the health authorities under great pressure but information about the event was kept from the public for security reasons chinas response executed a sudden u-turn in april 2003 when the authorities shifted from a stance of denial to one of confronting a national crisis what accounts for the secrecy and prevarication in the first place and then a sudden shift to more openness accompanied by a draconian coordinated campaign against the disease was there a trigger that shifted the system from one approach to the other and if so was it anything to do with the nature or severity of the actual problem a number of standard operating procedures in the chinese political and bureaucratic systems combined to produce an initial process of cover-up and denial a habit of secrecy was ingrained in the bureaucracy and reinforced by strict party control there are two kinds of policy relevant information in chinese government the first for official consumption the second for public knowledge the same officials may be involved in creating and disseminating both kinds detailed accounts are passed up the line to keep the leadership informed while information for public release is carefully formulated and passed down the line local journalists are tightly regulated by the party the pattern of information release over time went through a familiar set of stages cover-up then dismissal of the problem as a minor one and finally admission of the serious nature of the problem accompanied by the assertion that it had been under control from the outset link 2003  a report from guangdong health officials on the nature and seriousness of the epidemic was presented to the top leadership in beijing on january 27 but the information was not immediately made public and standard measures were applied to ensure that public officials did not break ranks and the media did not report the outbreak in the face of leaks and outside pressures on february 11 guangdong health officials held a press conference admitting 305 cases of atypical pneumonia and five deaths on march 10 china approached the who for assistance in investigating the outbreak but later in the month a who delegation was barred from guangdong province raising increasing suspicions by now the disease had begun to take hold in hong kong whose officials put increasing pressure on the guangdong officials and on beijing to cooperate with the release of information under this combined pressure including increasing criticism in the international media on march 26 the admitted tally of patients was increased from 305 to 792 with 31 deaths in guangdong and 3 in beijing since late february to save face statements were made identifying hong kong as the source of the beijing outbreak however in a sign that the strategy was still one of public denial a state council meeting on 2 april stated that sars had already been brought under control but this strategy of denial was not just a matter of a habit of bureaucratic secrecy crucial for understanding why the authorities were so reluctant to admit the increasingly obvious and to take tougher measures to combat the epidemic is the political climate of the times the period from november 2002 to march 2003 coincided with a leadership transition with jiang zemin and zhu rongji stepping down and hu jintao and wen jiabao taking their places as general secretary and premier respectively apart from the distraction that this transition process created at critical moments the predispositions of both the leadership and the rest of public officialdom at such a time were to avoid any trouble and maintain calm and stability fewsmith 2003 1  the stage management of the 16 th party congress in november 2002 and of the national peoples congress in march 2003 required displays of public efficiency all round so as not to sully the old leaderships last days in office while the transition period itself was marked by more than usual caution on the part of the new guard as they settled into their new roles the potential for the epidemic both to reveal bureaucratic and party failures and to spread alarm and social unrest were it confronted head on was clearly a particularly unsettling one at this time tight hierarchical control of communication flows creates many potential dysfunctions one such arises because separate hierarchies have their own channels but may not communicate with each other this was evident in china in a number of ways first the local and provincial health authorities did not communicate effectively with the national level and vice versa channels of expert communication on health matters were overlaid by the hierarchy of political command and reporting such that the health experts at the centre could not get a clear picture of the spread of the disease from their provincial level counterparts as provincial political bosses or ministry chiefs got in the way of effective and speedy aggregation of the facts this severely inhibited the tracking of the course of the disease and also the implementation of coordinated plans to combat it the official diagnosis of the failure to respond as presented by vice-minster of health gao qung stressed this point the health ministry did not give clear-cut instructions or offer effective guidance due to the lack of a sound system of information collection survival reports and contact tracing there appears to be a major weakness in the compilation of statistics knight ridder newspapers 2003 gao 2003  secondly communication about the nature of the disease and the manner of treating it between localities provinces and even between different hospitals in beijing was also inhibited by these overlapping but tightly managed vertical communication channels the reluctance of the military to cooperate with the health authorities in beijing in the release of accurate information during april was such a case even after the government began to take serious measures sars statistics were not just state secrets but some of them were also military secrets and the so-called official statistics for some time excluded cases in military hospitals but here as well the political situation indicates that not just sops but also the intrusion of other agendas were shaping the decision making process there was possibly an increased reluctance on the part of the respective authorities to cooperate at this time because of the mutual suspicion between arms of the party-state arising from the uncertainties of the leadership transition jiang zemin remained head of the party and state central military commissions after the handover and his continued presence as a key leadership figure was also evident in the number of his supporters appointed to the politburo jiang was one of the last among the leadership to join the chorus of self-criticism entailed by the u-turn and military leaders remained silent meanwhile the crisis as it evolved in late march and early april proved a testing ground for the new leadership on the one hand there was mounting outside pressure the lack of openness became increasingly difficult to sustain not only in the face of growing international hostility and loss of business confidence but also because rumour and panic were spreading among the local population aided by new forms of communication such as text-messaging and the internet on april 9 shortly after official figures were released claiming only four deaths and 19 cases in beijing a retired chief surgeon of a beijing military hospital blew the whistle and in an interview with foreign journalists claimed he had personally seen over 60 cases in the one hospital others began to speak out the director of guangdong provinces leading respiratory disease research institute challenged the official position that the disease was under control lefkow 2003  the who team in beijing publicly criticised the health authorities for concealing data the combined pressure made continued cover up or denial increasingly difficult in what appears to be a strategic political decision the new leadership decided to make a fresh start on april 17 a special politburo meeting called for complete openness and disclosure by all public officials and set up a new task force on 20 april the health minister and mayor of beijing were stripped of their party posts the unusually tough discipline meted out to the two scapegoats might be explained by the wish to assert the new leaders authority significantly while one was a jiang zemin supporter the other was close to the new leadership and was hence perhaps a symbolically even-handed sacrificial victim along with the dramatic u-turn in policy these dismissals also symbolised to the outside world that a clean break was being made with the past in the direction of more transparency and greater international cooperation subsequently many local officials were dismissed or punished for various errors committed during the sars outbreak the chinese bureaucracy and military have a set of standard responses to large scale crises and disasters tough prohibitions the rapid mobilisation of physical and human resources and the ideological mobilisation of the population these were all rolled out after the decision to act was taken the newly appointed minister for health and mayor of beijing were in chinese party circles heavy hitters fewsmith 2003 4 and both took the lead with decisive action the government announced very strict quarantine provisions it cancelled the may holidays to limit the movement of people 1 entertainment venues schools and universities were shut road blocks were set up to prevent people leaving beijing and a new quarantine hospital of 1000 beds sprang up almost overnight from a situation where inaccurate figures were released only reluctantly the government began to issue daily updates it shifted from a policy of token cooperation with who teams to one of eager collaboration political leaders and the media spoke with a united voice in support of a mass campaign by the people to eradicate the danger and lauded health workers as national heroes other than those that were symbolically singled out for punishment this strategy had clear political dimensions domestically it aligned the new leadership closely with a more open responsive and peoplefriendly style as a way of providing it with its own distinct political identity xiong 2003 and it sent strong signals to the international community that china was getting serious peoples daily 2003 gao 2003  yet the strategy also reflected and accommodated continuing internal doubts and tensions best illustrated by the case of shanghai where the numbers of reported cases and deaths were very low doubts and suspicions by the who and international media that the true situation was still being covered up continued to be expressed reports emerged that the decisions of mid-april to move to a more open stance were qualified by special instructions in the case of shanghai xu 2003 beech 2003  this also reflected shanghais economic importance and the political standing its leaders enjoyed jiang zemin was shanghaibased the shanghai political leadership was especially sensitive about the impact of sars on the local economy given shanghais international economic connections and was unhappy about the potential for the new set of measures applied in beijing to disturb their own control over managing the delicate balance between claiming on the one hand that the situation was in hand and on the other hand appearing to conceal the truth from the national leaderships perspective restoring confidence of the business traveller and investor in the safety of doing business in china became a top priority prompting its sudden switch to acting the model international citizen but further signs that the april u-turn was a matter of compromise and political strategy rather than the dawn of a new kind of political rationality that is not chinas chernobyl as some proclaimed came in the following month with a series of arrests and prosecutions against a number of people accused of disturbing social order for spreading news of the epidemic on the internet hoenig 2003  hong kongs response to sars was on the surface markedly different to that of beijing its political institutions and the presence of a free press made cover-up impossible but there was one important similarity a leadership concerned about legitimacy problems accusations of indecisiveness and weak leadership accompanied the crisis as it unfolded in hong kong and they were not without justification the first sars case -a visitor from guangdong -was admitted to hospital in late february and died on 4 march that patient was the source of infection for others who also spread the disease to singapore and toronto among other places this only became apparent over the ensuing month but as it did so it became a source of acute embarrassment for hong kong in particular due to the unfortunate choice of the sars label by the who the spread of the infection within the sar from this original case occurred in large part via health workers raising the question about the state of preparedness and organization of the health system for dealing with such an outbreak the first hong kong victim a visiting guangdong doctor warned hospital officials upon checking in that he was suffering from a highly infectious disease that he had been treating in guangdong some of his medical colleagues phoned the hospital with advice about treatment and precautionary measures moy and phillips 2003  as a consequence he was strictly isolated and effective measures were taken to limit infection in that hospital the spread of the infection through health workers stemmed primarily from another hospital where a patient who had been in contact with the first victim was admitted staff reporter et al 2003  necessary protocols and safeguards against infection were not applied leading to an outbreak among medical staff following this outbreak the hospital authority notified the department of health of the situation on 10 march public information was released and who was notified on 12 march who issued a global alert on atypical pneumonia the label preferred by the sar authorities on 15 march as the numbers of infections grew criticisms grew that the uncoordinated measures taken by different hospitals lack of information dissemination to medical practitioners and insufficient knowledge and preparedness were hampering the response to the outbreak suspected cases were not promptly separated from other patients some patients who had been in contact with such cases in wards were shifted to other hospitals one victim was the subject of visits from groups of medical students many of whom were subsequently infected some treatment methods employed had the effect of spreading infectious material through the ward those in contact with patients did not all take the necessary precautions or have available to them the correct protective clothing and so on as cases emerged among private general medical practitioners who had treated suspected victims in their local surgeries they began to voice complaints about lack of information and support from the health authorities a subsequent report by an expert panel commissioned by the hong kong government confirmed some of these problems the response during the initial period of the outbreak was inadequate due to inadequate contingency planning and a number of system inadequacies  weaknesses in hospital infection control structures inadequacies in staff training deficiencies in the hospital environment scarcity of equipment no pre-determined outbreak control plan or communication strategy and a lack of clarity about the respective roles and responsibilities of the hospital authority department of health and the university sars expert committee 2003 15 meanwhile the political leadership called mostly for calm and warned against over-dramatization in the media but the seeming lack of preparedness and coordination was apparent more widely a major new cluster of cases emerged in late march from a housing estate amoy gardens uncertainty and speculation mounted over how and why so many cases occurred in this area in particular as it now appeared that the disease might not only spread through direct personal contact with a seriously ill patient as the political leadership reluctantly was forced to admit that the sources of infection and the danger had spread into the community and outside the hospital system their response appeared to some to be indecisive and at cross-purposes for example at the same time as the health secretary was calling for calm over the threat of infection in schools the education secretary was publicly speculating in the face of growing pressure from anxious parents about the possibility of shutting the school system down during the crisis the tourism authority announced a new slogan hong kong -it takes your breath away in the face of growing complaints from health workers about lack of resources and slowness in providing equipment in the public hospital system a campaign was begun in the media to collect donations to buy much needed protective equipment for hospital staff the apparent lack of leadership and coordination can be exaggerated given the lack of knowledge about the virus and the speed with which events occurred but there were other signs that the government initially responded indecisively to the outbreak its difficulties were political and stemmed from the uneasy relationship with beijing chief executive tung chee-hwa was beijings choice for the position and continued to have beijings support 2 his position as the crisis unfolded in march and early april was made acutely difficult by beijings official position that sars was not a serious problem in china tung held a number of well-publicised meetings with chinese political leaders at which they offered full logistical and moral support and from which he came away expressing gratitude tung even had to bear the indignity of hearing hong kong blamed as a source of the beijing infections hong kong sar secretary for health yeoh engkiong was quoted on 17 march as saying there is still not an outbreak south china morning post 2003a when this was no longer tenable he then claimed that the mainland should not be blamed for the outbreak staff reporter et al 2003  it appeared that the government was under beijings instructions certainly tung was under pressure not to cause the kind of panic that beijing was so anxious to avoid on its side of the sar border but this pressure only could go so far hong kongs openness and the willingness to call in the who at a relatively early date in turn embarrassed the beijing leadership which came under increasing international pressure on april 3 the first who mission was let in to guangdong with full cooperation beyond the governments relief at receiving beijings continued political backing was a growing anger at chinas lack of initial willingness to admit to the severity of its own earlier outbreak in guangdong and the lack of official cross-border communication between health authorities that this gave rise to effectively hong kongs leaders could argue that they were unprepared because guangdong health officials were prohibited from sharing experience and knowledge with their hong kong counterparts even as the hong kong epidemic unfolded in march the lack of accurate information and official contacts was a continuing problem as already described a vital piece of information shared informally among medical specialists contributed significantly to the mitigation of the effects of the first hospitalised case had this advice been officially shared there may have been a chance that it would have been communicated from the top down to the whole hospital system avoiding some of the initial errors in treatment of other patients and making for better preparedness but in turn there was less than perfect cross-border routine cooperation on the part of the hong kong authorities with their guangdong counterparts the sensitivities of direct cross-border contact among local officials were brought to the surface by this incident the clashing demands of medical and political considerations contributed to internal conflict and indecisiveness in the government particularly as medical advice was ambiguous in the presence of imperfect information and knowledge the clarity and timeliness of this advice was also in question due to bureaucratic conflicts within the health system hospital authority and the health department officials were not always speaking with the same voice advice during march on stronger measures from medical experts close to the front line was rejected by the health secretary south china morning post 2003b the hospital authority was left to bear the brunt of much of the criticism over the rate of infections among hospital staff and the lack of a speedy coordinated response while in turn the authority blamed the treasury for cost cutting measures south china morning post 2003c the amoy gardens outbreak along with a continuing acceleration in the number of confirmed cases drove the government to act rather as beijings leaders later acted tungs official pronouncements turned from reassurance and calm to a stance of decisive action at the end of march with 367 cases now confirmed quarantine measures were ordered for all members of the community who had been in contact with a victim and schools were closed but the media immediately contrasted this with singapores much more draconian and prompter quarantine measures and too little too late was the common response pomfret 2003  on april 2 the who travel advisory warning against visits to hong kong was announced and this further increased pressure on the government earlier comments from some officials had been mildly critical of the who for being too alarmist by now the only plausible strategy was to take all-out measures to control the epidemic regardless of the economic or social consequences the economic effects on hong kong of a sudden decline in the number of international visitors were immediate and dramatic 3 in order to hasten the end of the crisis and regain international public confidence it now became very much a positive for the hong kong authorities to be completely open fully cooperate with the who take more drastic administrative measures including health checks on the borders and urge local residents to take all necessary precautions once the need for a coherent decisive strategy was agreed on the hong kong bureaucracy moved into top gear all restraints on causing panic were dropped -for example from april 10 the health department released daily information on the buildings where sars cases had occurred despite fears that this might cause discrimination schools were reopened after two and a half weeks with strict hygiene measures enforced but criticism continued against the inadequacy of measures taken to screen travellers at the airport and in particular at the land border crossing the toronto sars outbreak had its origins in the metropole hotel in hong kong when a woman who subsequently returned to toronto came into contact with the same index patient who brought the disease to hong kong she spread the virus to her closest family who than spread it to the family doctor and to other patients at the emergency room several hospital staff both inside the original hospital hit but also at other hospitals were quickly infected in this latter respect the spreading had similarities with hong kong what contributed to the spreading in the first wave was an elderly grandfather of a large family that was admitted on march 16 to the hospital that first experienced sars he was infected by a patient who caught sars from a family member of the index case and spread it further to his nearest family these family members belonging to a large philippine religious group then spread sars to others through large church events on march 28 and 29 the first outbreak peaked during mid march and early april had 136 probable cases all together of which 25 died and 121 suspected cases of which one died health canada 2003a after rigorous measures taken by the local health authorities including quarantines the epidemic seemed to be under control in mid april adding only some few new cases it was now april 23 that who chose to issue a travel advisory on toronto lifting it one week later in mid may the alert on toronto as an affected area was also lifted and during this period the health authorities also relaxed the control measures put in place in late march on may 20 the second outbreak of sars in toronto occurred it started with five patients in a rehabilitation hospital who had contracted sars through contact with a man of 96 years who had been infected in the original infected hospital in late march and early april but was not diagnosed with sars then health canada 2003b  in this second wave of the sars epidemic in toronto there were 111 probable cases of which 16 died most were infected from exposure at the original community hospital during the first wave in the second wave there were only seven suspect cases of which none resulted in death reflecting a more narrow definition of sars than in the first wave the second outbreak was followed by a closure of the hospital to all new admissions except sars patients and strict quarantine measures towards the hospital personnel and the outbreak was in reality over by the time its existence was more widely known the response to sars in canada was characterized by intergovernmental tension and confusion followed by a blame game with wider implications formal authority concerning health policy in canada rests mainly in the provincial governments 4 the federal government has responsibility for quarantine questions and it also deals formally with who but there are no national health standards for fighting epidemics moreover ontario is among the provinces that traditionally has delegated the management of health issues to local boards of health one implication of this is that the provinces have limited capacity to assist local boards for example concerning epidemiological expertise but also to communicate with all doctors and hospitals when the crisis occurred something that resulted in contradictory advice about what to do with sars overall the local health authorities in toronto did a relatively good job during the epidemic even though it had resource problems problems with adequate computer programs for tracing sars patients and problems of giving adequate and reliable information macleans 2003a one indicator of relative success of the local health authorities was that there was no community spread of sars in a broader sense in the first wave most of the spreading occurred in the most advanced hospitals that obviously had problems with internal procedures of prevention included nurses working in multiple settings and not adequate resources for infection control national post 2003  5 an editorial in the canadian medical association journal cmaj 2003 sums up a lot of the questions raised and problems experienced it asks whether the right structure both medical and political was in place for fighting epidemics like sars it questions whether the local and provincial health authorities had the training and the resources they needed and the proper surveillance and reporting system in place two matters posed questions about the adequacy of the systems of preparedness first the lack of isolation of sars patients by the clinicians in the initial phase of the epidemic and second the moving of sars patients between hospitals macleans 2003b the same editorial also questioned whether the relationship between the federal and provincial level is collaborative enough and whether health canada should be more in a leading or coaching role who had laid the groundwork for an event such as a sars epidemic in response to the perception of the growing dangers posed by new emerging transmittable diseases the organization developed a set of new instruments and standard operating procedures involving collaborating centres and laboratories the new system called goarn the global outbreak alert and response network was built up systematically from 1997 and formally launched in 2000 brundtland 2003  it is centrally coordinated by a team at the who headquarters and consists of 110 organizations and teams connected in a virtual network that have data expertise and competence relevant to detect and handle international epidemic outbreaks 6 this was also an apparatus that could be activated in case of bacteriological warfare this system drew on a new slogan in the medical world -evidence-based medicine it was widely seen as an objective system that would clearly indicate how collaborating actors should react to an epidemic the sars epidemic seems to show both the advantages and limitations of such a perspective although the leadership in who could base their reaction to sars on this surveillance system there were still several crucial questions of a political nature to attend to what was actually the nature of the problem they faced with sars when was it appropriate to act should the reaction be reluctant not to scare people or should it be decisive and dramatic what collaborating institutions and countries should be involved in what ways and when all together this created a complex set of decision constraints for the leadership in who even though they had the evidence-based system as a basis for their reactions the potential was there for a rational response to the epidemic but also for conflicts and symbols in fighting it who was first officially informed by the chinese ministry of health of an outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome in guandong province on february 11 2003 three days later who learned that cases dated as long back as november 16 2002 and that the outbreak was coming under control the latter information later was proved to be wrong but it seems to have slowed down whos initial reactions the goarn system and the global influenza network were alerted by two cases in hong kong february 19 th and 20 th  similar cases were reported in late february from vietnam and who sent a health expert team it was still not easily understood what caused the disease how it could be defined and how severe it was when cases also occurred in singapore and toronto the possibility that the disease could be spread rapidly through international travel was immediately raised after a substantial number of hospital employees both in hanoi and hong kong were affected who on march 12 issued a low level alert on sars this alert recommended that patients with similar symptoms should be isolated and handled according to strict procedures of infection control who 2003b  national health authorities were also recommended to report new cases to who that alert was stepped up to a second global alert on march 15 the first ever of this type including emergency travel recommendations the most dramatic travel recommendation seen as a travel ban and followed by several nations came in late march and was aimed at china and hong kong this resulted in a dramatic decrease in international air travel particularly in asia two more alerts were further issued in april and one in may asking people to postpone all but essential travel to certain areas seeking to prevent further international spread of sars as the escalating alerts from who were signalled the whole surveillance system was put into gear collaborating laboratories worked around the clock to reveal the secrets of sars the central organization consulted intensively with its regional offices and site workers the regional office in beijing was strengthened more people were sent to vietnam and hong kong and international expert teams were sent to china new york times 2003a during late april the sars outbreaks in vietnam hong kong singapore and toronto seemed to peak but some of these countries experienced small outbreaks again later in international media coverage during and after the sars outbreak questions were asked about why who reacted so late new york times 2003b and why it reacted so strongly -some said overreacted -when it finally did respond the simple answer to the first question may be that the surveillance system didnt detect the true nature of the threat posed by the pending epidemic ie the indications were too ambiguous to act upon this failure would have been furthered by chinas secrecy about the source of the disease in guangdong province whether this shows that the surveillance system was not good enough or that the data and knowledge on sars were inadequate for providing an unequivocal alert is difficult to decide when the who finally reacted firmly and decisively within the organization it was perceived that there was no choice even though more evidence about the disease was available then a month earlier one still didnt know how dangerous it was the combination of potentially high death tolls and absence of a known effective cure seems to have created increased insecurity around the world even panic this leads to the question of whether who could have handled differently the ways they informed the public about sars the effects of the sars process for who seems mainly to be positive who was generally praised for its role and the organization emerged with heightened prestige and legitimacy the global awareness of epidemics is higher collaboration within who and between who and different countries seems to have increased more resources have been channelled to fight future diseases like sars and who has acquired stronger methods of reaction and greater influence as a result of the epidemic these are all side-effects to the main process of fighting the epidemic of particular importance for who was the 56 th world health assembly that in late may 2003 supported who actions in the sars process and supported a revision of the international health regulations covering surveillance of epidemic diseases to give who a more central role wha 2003  who acquired increased power and resources to issue global alerts set up an instant communication network tap unofficial but reliable sources of information and send its own teams to countries and see to it that they were doing enough to control outbreaks new york times may 28 2003  an intergovernmental working group open to all member states was set up to review and recommend a draft revision of the international health regulations for adoption at the 58 th world health assembly in 2005 the newly elected director of who dr jong-wook lee announced on may 22 two initiatives related to sars the first was a pledge by the donor countries of 200 million to expand and strengthen the agencys response network towards epidemics like sars the other was an initiative together with the world economic forums global health initiative to raise 100 million for the same cause who 2003c new york times 2003d  as shown who had its epidemic surveillance system put in place when the sars epidemic developed meaning that they primarily reacted based on some standard operating procedures and what was seen as evidence-based medical premises this system was however confronted by different national health systems that did not necessarily fit smoothly with the who system in addition the sars process in these countries also involved other elements that were less health related and more related to ongoing political processes so how can we describe the relationship between who and the three countries analyzed during the sars process the relationship between who and china on the surface appeared to be a good one before the sars epidemic started china was the first country dr gro harlem brundtland visited after she became director of who in 1998 and from then on mutual confidence was built whos relationship to china was one of confidence-building rather than confrontation with a willingness shown to wait to get more openness and correct information about the outbreak who 2003d groups of who experts were sent to beijing but had to wait three weeks until they were allowed into the province obviously a result of traditional secrecy and tension between the central and province levels when china opened up the relationship between china and who strengthened greatly china said that they would cooperate fully with who and provide full information about sars and also took drastic measure to fulfil its promises who from a sceptical and critical start particularly from regional and front line officials turned to praising china for its efforts as an encouragement for it to continue with this kind of openness for the surrounding world this made both china and who look good the relationship between who and hong kong during the sars epidemic seems to be far less complicated than the relationships with china and canada the relationship may be characterized as transparent and helpful who didnt dig into the somewhat complex relationship between mainland china and hong kong but saw hong kong as well organized and competent who used information from the sars cases in hong kong as guidance to other countries with sars this also meant that who was reluctant to criticize hong kong for some of its flaws in the handling of sars one sign of this goodwill was that who after pressure from the hong kong authorities gave hong kong some extra hours of preparation time before issuing the travel alert the canada case is quite another story and shows a sharp tug-ofwar and conflicts between who and canada and we will therefore look more closely into this relationship some background is necessary to understand some of the conflict when dr brundtland started as the director of who the relationship between canada and who was somewhat strained because canada had vigorously supported the inter-american candidate from barbados but the relationship was gradually mended and got better who had every reason to believe that canada as a developed country with a good health system could handle the sars epidemic it was therefore less reason to send experts or to interfere in the sars process there compared to for example china and less reason to come up with a travel advisory it obviously came as a big surprise to canada that who came up with a travel ban to toronto on april 22 7 and it also surprised many around the world when the ban was lifted a week later without much happening in between that could account for this move canada protested the travel advisory both through a letter from the assistant deputy minister of health to who on april 24 and also with a delegation to who canada expressed concern and disappointment over the decision and claimed that sars was by now under control health canada also simultaneously issued an advice saying that travel in and out of toronto was safe contradicting whos travel advisory there seems to be at least two possible explanations for what happened one is the straightforward one saying that there were good medical reasons both to establish and lift the ban on toronto the ban should originally have been put in place earlier but was postponed because who thought canada had control so the time between planning to impose and lifting the advisory was actually longer than a week in this respect it was understandable and based on standard operating rules that who on april 30 could say that the situation in toronto has now improved who 2003f dr rodier the director of communicable disease surveillance and response at who argues in a commentary in the canadian medical association journal in late april that whos travel advisory was no punishment but based on evidence and objective criteria rodier 2003  but based on his account it remains unclear why the advisory didnt come some weeks earlier when the first sars wave peaked in toronto his arguments for lifting the ban are more specific but most of the criteria mentioned seem to have been met even before the travel advisory came the second version is based on the fact that canada is the only country to react strongly against the travel advice both the prime minister and the mayor of toronto thought it was highly unfair and insisted that they had sars under control this reaction may also be seen as based on facts the curves for the disease seemed to show that it was under control when the ban came so in that respect who may have had inadequate information as it was argued 8  but resisting the ban can also reflect a country with much more self-confidence than some of the asian countries involved and one probably with a more strained relationship to who therefore the process was elevated to a high political level and the ban was lifted through contacts and negotiations between who and the federal level in canada the canadian authorities promised to install more rigorous screening and testing at the airports something that didnt have effects that easily could be measured new york times 2003e in the aftermath one can say that who looked better then canada because canadas insistence that it had the epidemic under control was obviously contradicted when the second outbreak came the toronto epidemic seems to be different in some ways from the ones in china and hong kong it was a much more limited al-though very deadly outbreak of sars because it was limited to one index case that later lead to three groups of sars infected patients two in the first and one in the second wave that made it potentially easier to fight but in fact purportedly one of the best health systems in the world had problems in doing so the case is also different in that the local and federal authorities fought back from the notion that they had serious problems with sars something that had not happened in hong kong and china once the initial denials were overcome fighting back obviously helped the standing of the authorities because they had also been widely criticized and this could be a way of shifting the blame towards who but the appropriateness of that strategy waned when the second wave occurred it also showed clearly that this was a political process with give-and-take with wider political and economic implications it also illustrates very well how an epidemic like many other dramatic events with serious political implications could be defined in different ways the local and federal authorities insisted that a limited outbreak mostly contained should not lead to such dramatic measures like asking people to shy away from toronto potentially seen as a warning against going to canada at all events such as the sars epidemic give rise to special problems for political leaders and administrators our review of their responses shows how attempts to exert control and impose a rational technical order based on the close participation of government health experts were first prompted but then thwarted by the nature of the problems chinas case is particularly interesting in that the initial response to the epidemic was not to see it primarily as a public health problem so much as a potential threat to political and social stability this is a not unfamiliar scenario in a country on the one hand used to coping with both man-made and natural disasters among which this epidemic may have initially appeared nothing out of the ordinary and on the other hand constantly wary of potential sources of social unrest but the misreading of the potential for the neglected even suppressed public health dimensions of the issue to cause acute political embarrassment gave rise to a sudden shift from one set of standard operating procedures cover up and denial to another draconian punishment and mass mobilization as well the government switched over to accept at least on the surface the who definition of the urgency of the issue as a public health problem and its diagnosis of the deficiencies in the countrys health systems this complex interplay of different agendas and of problems and solutions becoming transformed as the issue jumped tracks was less apparent on the surface in the other two countries where the issue was dealt with more from the outset under a set of health policy response procedures guided by international protocols set by the who yet here as well the political vulnerabilities and sensibilities of the authorities also shaped the responses similar blame games and crosscutting agendas made the orderly and smooth application of remedial measures less than predictable but at various points in each case trip-mechanisms tipped the stance of the authorities from one of confusion from a health policy perspective and blaming to one of decisive open and dramatic action the confusion and conflict were in part a result of lack of know-how and uncertainty and in part a lack of bureaucratic preparedness the switch to full acknowledgement of a crisis and the mobilisation of drastic measures to deal with it as such came once this response was seen also as a solution to the attendant political and economic problems that is as a way of reestablishing legitimacy in the eyes of panicking publics domestic and overseas and restoring interrupted business activity symbolic reassurance of relevant publics according to how their interests and needs were perceived was critical at all stages for all actors including the who with its own agenda of confidence building in new political relationships as with china and its agenda of institutionalization of its overarching monitoring and coordinating role in an environment of conflicting national interests and agendas in sum we find as suggested by garbage can theory that politicians and administrators decisions during the sars outbreak were in many critical instances triggered by extraneous factors while administrative actions were shaped by dramatic switches from one set of standard operating procedures to another as events unfolded this switching can not be explained simply by bureaucratic politics the responses were a combination of competing rationalities and overlapping agendas in the public realm the public health issues constantly vied with other agendas and only when compelling alignments among them occurred did professional or technical rationales for solving the problem within a single means-end frame become dominant there was however a form of convergence on a set of measures that restored public confidence and in particular international business confidence the shape of these measures was crystallized largely through the parallel but not always consistent decisions and interventions of the who the uncertainties over what was the precise nature of the problem and what were the solutions continued however to create ambiguities and conflicts among health sector policy actors their power as solutions lay not just in their capacity to assert control and rationality within the public health policy domain but also in their capacity to restore confidence and bolster legitimacy and support for local political elites following the end of the outbreak in the remainder of 2003 there were one or two isolated sars cases and some false alarms in several countries the response in each case was identical the public health authorities and the governments concerned seemed to vie with each other for the approval of who with fully transparent rapid and firm responses that this was the preferred political strategy was a demonstration of the increasing penetration of the agendas of domestic policy making by protocols and standards set by the who a transnational body with symbiotic links with domestic health policy experts and administrators as a final thought we therefore predict a more politicised future for that body based on our observations of the significance of political considerations in the manner of responses to the initial outbreak 1 the contrast is stark between this decision in april and the earlier decision to conceal the potential danger of epidemic in february when hundreds of millions of chinese citizens took to the roads trains and airways to return to their communities for the new year holiday 2 the hong kong chief executive is elected by a local electoral college the composition of which is effectively controlled by beijing 3 at the international airport in hong kong the number of daily travelers fell from around 100000 in early march to around 15000 in mid may 4 in the light of the limited central capacity to handle epidemics such as sars proposals were discussed to establish a canadian office of disease control and prevention built on the american model 5 the only contagion outside the hospital system in toronto was in the closely knit ethnic-religious group but this also originated in the hospital system 6 from january 1998 through march 2002 who investigated 538 outbreaks in 132 countries brundtland 2003  7 in a

covid-19 from january 25th to march 9th 2020 in a heavily affected hospital during the initial outbreak in china we found that covid-19 associated delayed-phase thrombocytopenia was occurred in 118 percent of enrolled patients the delayed-phase thrombocytopenia in covid-19 is prone to develop in elderly patients or patients with low lymphocyte count on admission the delayed-phase thrombocytopenia is significantly associated with increased length of hospital stay and higher icu admission rate we began our study based on clinical observation that occasionally several patients developed rapid platelet count decrease after more than 2 weeks of treatment without evidence of other coagulation abnormalities rare cases even suffered severe delayed-phase thrombocytopenia platelet

delayed-phase thrombocytopenia prompted us to investigate its prevalence and characteristics with expanded hospitalization capacity and prolonged isolation period patients can be admitted timely and laboratory results were well followed-up these enabled us to conduct a longitudinal study on dynamic changes of platelet count our study showed delayed-phase thrombocytopenia is prevalent in the

severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers suggested that thrombocytopenia is common in both sars and mers patients 15 16  however the viral infection associated delayed-phase thrombocytopenia has merely been reported as rare case reports without enough patients for statistical analysis 17 18  to clarify the pathogenesis of the delayed-phase thrombocytopenia we screened laboratory results underlining key cytokines and lymphocyte immunity our results suggest that il-6 a strong inflammatory cytokine was negatively correlated with the delayed-phase platelet count decline this indicated that il-6 might be an active player in the delayed-phase platelet decline notably our time-correlated lymphocyte subset analysis showed b cells percentage was negatively associated with the delayed-phase thrombocytopenia since antibody production by b cells is crucial in virus protection this result highlight an important role that antibodies play in the delayed-phase platelet decrease we also found most of the delayed-phase thrombocytopenia lasted less than 7 days implying the delayed-phase thrombocytopenia is transient furthermore we sought to obtain evidence from bone marrow bone marrow aspiration analysis help to recognize possible pathogenesis in the hematopoietic tissue all bone marrow aspiration pathology showed common features as impeded megakaryocyte maturation and mature platelet-producing megakaryocyte were rare less than 5 in the bone marrow smear these bone marrow features were as similar as that in immune thrombocytopenia impaired megakaryocyte maturation and insufficient platelet production participate in the pathogenesis of immune thrombocytopenia 19  at the time-point of platelet count nadir these three patients had been covid-19 nucleic acid negative twice suggesting virus been deleted or suppressed and their igg antibody were positive suggesting protective antibody producing based on the antibody production curve after sars-cov-2 infection 20  we speculated that at the delayed-phase platelet destruction is mediated by antibodies virus associated immune thrombocytopenia may include several mechanisms 21

platelets recovered in a few days 18  this study has several limitations first because our analysis was based on a retrospective study with a relatively small sample which could cause biases and limit the reliability of our results second the laboratory data were not monitored by strictly fixed time interval due to rapidly evolving epidemic this might lead to omission of data at the changing time point third our hospital-based study no doubt missed patients who were mild cases and who were treated at home and our study cohort may represent the more severe end of covid-19 fourth multivariate regression analysis is recommended to recognize the risk factors and the individual odds ratio further study integrating more clinical characters is needed to draw a more complete conclusion fifth because several patients were still hospitalized and information regarding clinical outcomes was unavailable at the time of this writing the relationship between these patients prognosis and delayed-phase thrombocytopenia remains to be investigated in summary we have demonstrated prevalence of delayed-phase thrombocytopenia in covid-19 patients in rare cases patients even suffered life-threating thrombocytopenia compared to those without delayed-phase thrombocytopenia covid-19 patients with delayed-phase thrombocytopenia have a longer hospital stay time and a worse clinical

mustafa   coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause disorders ranging from a mild cold to severe diseases some coronaviruses are zoonotic which means that they spread from animals to humans in december 2019 a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 caused an outbreak of covid-19 typical symptoms of covid-19 include fever cough shortness of breath and muscle pain severe complications have been reported to occur in 33 of patients with covid-19 and include acute respiratory distress syndrome acute renal failure acute respiratory injury septic shock and severe pneumonia1 currently there is no specific treatment or approved vaccine against covid-19 and the clinical management primarily includes implementing recommended infection prevention and control measures and supportive management of complications thus far treatment is provided according to the clinical condition of the patient supportive treatment such as oxygen therapy hydration and feverpain management and antibiotics if bacterial co-infection is present is recommended1 many clinical trials are currently investigating potential medications to treat covid-19 including remdesivir a prodrug in development immunoglobulins arbidol hydrochloride combined with interferon atomization asc09f plus oseltamivir ritonavir plus oseltamivir lopinavir plus ritonavir and some other drug httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2resultscond2019ncovtermcntrystatecitydist but no specific treatment or vaccine is approved yet in addition chloroquine phosphate used to prevent and treat malaria and some inflammatory conditions was found to have acceptable safety and demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of covid-19-associated pneumonia2 the immunosuppressed status of some cancer patients whether caused by the disease itself or the treatment increases their risk of infection compared with the general population immunosuppression may also expose cancer patients to serious complications from an infection which may result in treatment delay and unnecessary hospitalizations that could negatively affect disease prognosis it has been reported by liang et al3 that patients with cancer have an increased risk of severe infections with an 35-fold increase in the risk of needing mechanical ventilation or icu admission or dying compared with patients without cancer cancer patients increased susceptibility to severe complications of covid-19 can be attributed to the immunosuppressed status caused by the malignancy and anticancer treatments such as chemotherapy or surgery patients who had received chemotherapy or undergone surgery in the 30 days before presenting with covid-19 were found to have a higher risk of severe events than patients who had not been treated with chemotherapy or surgery it was also found that cancer history conferred the highest risk for severe complications and was correlated with poorer outcomes from covid-19 notably lung cancer patients did not have a higher probability of severe complications compared with patients with other cancer types3 zhang et al4 reported the case of a 57-year-old chinese male patient with lung cancer who presented with fever cough shortness of breath myalgia and diarrhea and later tested positive for covid-19 the patients lung cancer was initially treated with gefitinib an epidermal growth factor receptor egfr inhibitor starting in february 2016 and the patient was subsequently started on osimertinib monotherapy in september 2017 when the gefinitib resistance-causing mutation egfr t790m was detected upon disease progression covid-19 was treated with lopinavirritonavir a combination of protease inhibitors typically used to treat hiv1 infection improved pneumonia was reported after 2 weeks of treatment three follow-up rt-pcr tests for sars-cov-2 were found to be negative indicating a cure for covid-19 in the reported case the patients clinical condition and performance status permitted continued osimertinib treatment despite the diagnosis of covid-19 wang and zhang5 pointed out that during the covid-19 pandemic the primary risk for patients with cancer is limited access to required health care and inability to receive necessary medical services in a timely fashion especially in high-risk epidemic areas like wuhan china where there is a high demand on medical staff and health care facilities health care providers must pay attention to the treatment-related adverse effects in lung cancer patients who are treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as severe myocarditis and pneumonitis such side effects may negatively affect the patients survival thus it is vital to identify and treat such conditions promptly a recently published retrospective cohort study recruited 28 cancer patients with confirmed covid-19 from 3 hospitals in wuhan china to assess the risk factors associated with icu admission mechanical ventilation or death the study reported that covid-19-infected cancer patients have a high risk of poor clinical outcomes severe event and mortality cancer treatment within 14 days of covid-19 diagnosis was reported as a risk factor for developing severe events acute respiratory distress syndrome 286 septic shock 36 and acute myocardial infarction 36 are among the documented severe complications in the study population interestingly 286 of the study patients developed covid-19 infection while hospitalized which is mainly attributed to the nosocomial transmission such findings highlight the importance of implementing strict infection control measures and treating cancer patients in an outpatient setting instead of hospitalization whenever feasible the authors of this study have recommended that cancer patients currently on cancer treatments should undergo thorough screening for covid-19 infection and avoid immunosuppressive therapy in case of covid-19 infection6 many clinical resources including guidelines for covid-19 prevention and management have recently been published to guide cancer patients health care professionals and cancer centers on the proper recommendations and measures to fight this contagious disease and to maximize the use of the available resources in order to sustain health services to cancer patients one of these resources is a patient information reference issued by the british columbia cancer center that includes many frequently asked questions by cancer patients and offers proper instructions on the required precautions regarding detection of signs and symptoms of covid-19 social distancing personal protective equipment use and hospital visits7 in addition the cancer council of australia has issued a patient-friendly brochure in many different languages to familiarize cancer patients including those who are currently being treated with all of the necessary information regarding covid-19 and the approved measures of prevention8 recently the national institute for health and care excellence nice issued a clinical guideline for the delivery of systemic anticancer treatments to cancer patients with covid-19 the nice guideline provides many recommendations based on the currently available evidence regarding many covid-19-related and cancer-related issues including communicating with patients managing patients with confirmed or suspected covid-19 staff who are self-isolating prioritizing patients for treatment modifications to usual service and treatment breaks such preliminary guidelines can be helpful tools at this time for health care providers to provide the best available care to cancer patients until more detailed and evidence-based guidelines are available9 in addition the european society of medical oncology esmo has developed an updated online clinical resource page to highlight all covid-19-related clinical issues pertaining to cancer the esmo clinical resource can provide physicians with proper recommendations based on recent updates about covid-19 in cancer patients including information on self-protection treatment continuity risk of procedures and key actions to deliver optimal care to cancer patients in these exceptional circumstances10 the royal college of radiologists has also recently established a clinical resource that includes guidelines on the management of many cancers including breast upper and lower gastrointestinal prostate lung central nervous system sarcoma thyroid melanoma gynecologic and urethral cancers during the covid-19 pandemic these guidelines provide detailed recommendations on treatment with radiotherapy including types of radiotherapy administered doses and when to continue delay or stop radiotherapy11 whether to continue cancer therapy or to stop it is still a subject of debate as the risk of cancer progression after stopping cancer therapy remains controversial further clinical trials in cancer patients with covid-19 are urgently needed before any recommendation can be generalized in some solid tumors including lung and pancreatic cancer and hematologic cancers including acute leukemia and high-grade lymphoma timely diagnosis and treatment are warrantied while in early-stage diseases such as breast prostate cervical and nonmelanoma skin delaying cancer treatment may be an option during the covid-19 pandemic in high-risk patients in general it is recommended that patients receiving curative cancer therapy should continue their treatment despite the potential risk of covid-19 infection during anticancer therapy delaying treatment of metastatic disease results in deteriorated performance status admission for symptom palliation and progressive disease12 surgeries can be delayed in some cases based on the clinical judgment of the treating physicians for example selected early-stage hormone-positive breast cancer patients can continue their hormonal therapy for additional months if needed thus it is recommended that the risks and benefits of treatment delay be assessed for each patient individually in order to identify candidates who would be eligible for treatment delay without major negative health consequences12 because of the severe clinical deterioration associated with covid-19 in cancer patients 3 essential strategies may be used to mitigate the covid-19 crisis or any future infection affecting cancer patients the first strategy is postponing chemotherapy treatment or elective surgical procedures in stable cancer cases at high-risk locations the second is implementing strict personal precautions in cancer patients or cancer survivors the third strategy is providing more intensive care and treatment to covid-19-infected patients with cancer who are old or have other comorbidities3 online medical counseling and appropriate diagnosis and treatment of critical cases to minimize patients exposure to covid-19 may be required during the virus outbreak5 in addition to implementing strict personal precautions to avoid covid-19 infection some experts have recommended using outpatient health care facilities to treat nonsmall cell lung cancer patients with advanced disease whenever feasible during the covid-19 pandemic in addition they recommended ruling out covid-19 infection before admitting patients to the hospital for cancer therapy13 kutikov et al14 have proposed specific recommendations which can be used to guide the decision process on delaying or continuing cancer treatment during covid-19 pandemic the proposed guide is based mainly on categorizing patients into low medium or high risk of disease progression with cancer treatment delay for example it is considered safe to delay treatment for 3 months with low risk of disease progression in patients with chronic hematologic cancers and surgery and radiotherapy can also be delayed for the same risk group including patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer nonlocally advanced breast cancer low or intermediate-risk prostate cancer low-grade lymphoma and other low-risk cancer diseases in contrast treatment delay is not recommended in patients who are at high risk of disease progression with treatment delay including patients with high grade or aggressive cancers colon cancer with obstruction malignancy suspicious ovarian liver or pancreatic mass and small cell lung cancer14 table 1 one of the cornerstone strategies for any health care institution to fight covid-19 is to implement robust infection and environmental control identifying and triaging patients suffering from respiratory symptoms is also important to contain sars-cov-2 and minimize exposure some health care organizations have adopted strict measures banning travel to certain high-risk areas to protect their facilities and prevent the spread of covid-19 by dana-farber cancer institute and md anderson cancer center 2 of the leading health care institutions have recently banned all business travel to cdc-defined impacted areas to limit health care providers exposure to covid-19 institutions along with others have also encouraged their employees to consider restricting personal travel and to exercise caution during personal time16 virtual health services including telephone or online appointments especially for routine checkups or prescription refills can also be implemented as appropriate to reduce crowding in health care facilities to reduce exposure and efficiently utilize clinical resources moreover having institutional management guidelines and an emergency plan with equipped isolation areas is required to accommodate any surge in covid-19 patients during this difficult time it is imperative for any health care organization to address health care providers well-being and to fulfill their physical and emotional needs by offering the required support to prevent identify and properly manage any burnout psychological stress or safety concerns especially for those providing direct patient care such as physicians respiratory therapists and nurses during covid-19 outbreak many health care systems are facing challenges due to the high demand on pharmaceutical equipment and medical supplies that resulted in critical shortages which can force the clinicians to take tough decisions to restrict using advanced therapeutic options including mechanical ventilators to selected patients based on many factors including age comorbidities or the expected clinical outcomes such difficult scenarios may raise ethical considerations regarding the allocation and use of the current limited resources to treat the most critically ill patients with complications or severe conditions during this crisis it is vital to apply medical ethics in the clinical practice aiming to treat and cure as many patients as possible with the best use of the available resources rationing treatment canceling appointments and delaying surgeries are challenging decisions in patients with confirmed covid-19 and advanced-stage cancer or severe comorbidities requiring mechanical ventilation poor prognosis is usually expected in such cases end-of-life and palliative care plans must be discussed when faced with limited resources during the covid-19 pandemic a cancer treatment multidisciplinary team which may include medical ethicists and palliative care specialists must decide which patients will receive complicated or critical care based on the expected clinical outcomes12 the american college of surgeons acs committee on ethics has prepared some guiding principles to help the clinicians and the health care institutions in the decision-making process regarding the allocation of resources during the covid-19 outbreak17 such recommendations can be very helpful in resolving the expected ethical dilemma which may affect the emotional health status of the overwhelmed health care providers due to the high demand for clinical resources and the need to rationalize its use finally ensuring the continuum of care in cancer patients is vital and is considered a major priority during this time as many hospitals and health care centers are overwhelmed with increased numbers of covid-19 cases high demand on medical supplies including personal protective equipment and shortages of health care providers in areas facing an especially high number of cases clinical judgment is paramount in determining whether to continue or withhold cancer therapy in patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19 health care providers caring for cancer patients are advised to review the latest rapidly changing literature pertaining to cancer and covid-19 to provide evidence-based management on a case-by-case basis there is an urgent need for well-designed trials to identify the clinical consequences of continuing or withholding cancer therapy and the proper prevention management and treatment of covid-19 in the oncology and hematology settings  factors associated with resilience among medical staff in radiology departments during the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease covid-19 a cross-sectional study lei huang yun wang juan liu pengfei ye bochao cheng huayan xu haibo qu gang ning   novel coronavirus pneumonia ncp emerged in wuhan china in december 2019 and the outbreak has since spread rapidly worldwide 12 on february 12 2020 the world health organization officially named the disease caused by this novel coronavirus as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 3 as of 10 am on february 29 2020 a total of 53 countries had reported outbreaks of covid-19 with the number of cases rising to 85403 indicating a serious situation for prevention of the disease 4 the novel coronavirus often causes pulmonary infection and early and accurate identification of chest imaging characteristics is conducive to early diagnosis timely isolation and treatment 56 therefore patients with fever or cough 78 must undergo imaging examinations for further clinical diagnosis of their condition this makes it easy for the medical staff in the radiology departments to come into contact with patients with covid-19 and places them in an environment with a high risk of infection 9 meanwhile requirements for efficient and orderly clinical task completion and high-intensity work stress 10 may further increase the psychological load of the staff if their psychological state cannot be promptly addressed it is easy for the staff to have negative emotions which impair their enthusiasm initiative and work efficiency and seriously harm their physical and mental health 1112 however during the covid-19 outbreak there were no reports about the resilience level of the medical staff in the radiology department resilience refers to a rebound ability that allows humans to maintain good adaptability in the face of life adversities threats or other major stressful events 13 in the face of the sudden epidemic the general populationhas different levels of anxiety depression severe stress and other psychological impact as do front-line medical staff 14 previous research showed that having good resilience can help medical staff alleviate adverse effects brought on by various stresses 15 in the face of job burnout or stress effective interventions should be undertaken to improve the resilience level of doctors resulting in a more conducive way of coping with various challenges brought on by work stress 16 moreover improving the resilience of nurses is conducive to their ability to cope with difficulties adapt to new situations and have more realistic and positive expectations for the future which is very important to protect resilience in work and in daily life 17 another study found that measures taken to increase resilience can reduce the expected stress of an influenza outbreak such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars on the medical staff as well as benefit the physical and mental health of the medical staff 18 furthermore high-risk appraisal can decrease resilience in hospital workers whereas strengthening coping ability and relieving the intensity of negative emotions experienced increased resilience during the outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome 19 therefore the objective of this study was to assess the resilience level of medical staff in radiology departments during the outbreak of covid-19 and to explore factors related to it to provide a basis for more effective risk assessment and psychological intervention from february 7 2020 to february 9 2020 600 medical staff members were randomly selected from the radiology departments of 32 public hospitals in sichuan province to take online electronic questionnaire surveys inclusion criteria were 1 age 18 years or older 2 being a nurse technician or doctor

short a period of time and 2 submission of a questionnaire that was obviously inconsistent with the actual situation finally 587 medical staff members were included in the final study cohort before the start of the study 30 cases were selected from the hospital where the investigators worked to perform a pretest evaluation to check and improve the scale used in the survey get familiar with the process and techniques of data collection and measure the internal consistency of the scale after the reliability and validity requirements were met formal data collection began the relevant scales were completed on a mobile phone by scanning the wenjuanxing qr code the members of the study group analyzed and screened the questionnaire responses filled in by the included subjects in strict

covid-19 knowledge of covid-19 protective measures availability of adequate protective materials knowledge of the psychological hotline whether the participant was concerned about contact with suspectedconfirmed cases at work and whether the participant was concerned about work-related infections this scale is used to assess an individuals ability to respond and adapt to life adversities traumas tragedies threats or other major life stresses 21 the chinese scale was used in this study 22 the scale contains the three dimensions of toughness strength and optimism with a total of 25 entries the total score ranges from 0 to 100 and a higher score indicates a higher resilience level in this study the cronbach  coefficient of the scale was 0959 this scale is used to measure the overall and ubiquitous stress in an individuals life reflecting the individuals degree of self-awareness of stress 23 the chinese scale was used in this study 24 the scale contains two dimensions namely loss of control and tension with a total of 14 entries wherein loss of control is scored in reverse the total score ranges from 14 to 70 and a higher score indicates greater mental stress in this study the cronbach  coefficient of the scale was 0867 the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the corresponding research institute the online questionnaires involved in this study were anonymous and informed consent of the participants was obtained before starting all analyses were performed using the ibm statistical package for social sciences spss version 190

3260 p0042 and lack of protective materials in the hospital 1268 p0039 were important related factors for resilience of the medical staff in the radiology departments p005 which accounted for 415 of the total variation of the regression equation table 4 the outbreak of covid-19 occurred suddenly and severely because computed tomographydiagnostic radiology is an important diagnostic method for early clinical screening of covid-19 25 the medical staff in the radiology departments are faced with great work stress and will inevitably be in a state of high mental stress meanwhile as a high-risk group who are more likely to have close contact with patients with covid-19 they will also suffer greater mental stress and be prone to negative emotions if the medical staff do not have good resilience it means that not only can they not recover after experiencing stress but also that they may continuously accumulate negative emotions and even develop psychological disorders in severe cases 26 this is extremely detrimental to the effective work of the medical staff in the radiology departments in response to the outbreak in our study the total resilience score of the medical staff in the radiology departments was 6576 which was lower than the 6850 score of 463 medical students 27 and even more significantly lower than the 7875 score reported for 560 nurses in china 28 an international study of medical staff reported a score of 718 points 17 this studys results indicated that the resilience level of the medical staff in the radiology departments during the outbreak of covid-19 was relatively low the reasons are multiple first pathogenesis and transmission route of covid-19 was not clear enough because of the sudden outbreak 2930 medical staff in the radiology departments were not mentally prepared and they were worried about being unable to protect themselves and unable to do the best job at this time second there was less confidence in coping because of the highly contagious nature of covid-19 and the high number of deaths 3132 it is completely unknown when the outbreak will be effectively contained and when such high-intensity and high-risk working conditions will change third as a high-risk group the medical staff members were worried about the safety of their families because of their work and the staff showed restlessness and anxiety therefore hospital administrators should realize the adverse psychological effects of the high-stress state on the mental health of the medical staff in the radiology departments during the outbreak of covid-19 and should take targeted measures to alleviate these effects in order to avoid serious and complicated psychological problems the psychological high-stress state may not only affect the normal and orderly work of the medical staff in the radiology departments but it may also may lead to a decline in their immunity resulting in a higher risk of infection 3334 the results also showed that among the dimensions of resilience the items in the toughness dimension had the lowest average score suggesting that medical staff were less resilient in terms of toughness when they are depressed and frustrated it is more difficult to consciously integrate the control behavior goal-setting and decision-making behavior and they lack more effective buffers in terms of stress resistance 35 on the other hand the average score for items on the optimism dimension was the highest indicating that medical staff were more inclined to treat the outbreak with an optimistic attitude and have confidence in overcoming the current difficulties 13 therefore hospital administrators can pick people with consistent good psychological quality and strong decision-making ability to share their psychological experience and coping behavior with others in addition hospital administrators can encourage medical staff to discuss and reach a consensus regarding the outbreak and develop a set of more effective behavioral norms that integrate control goal-setting and decision-making behaviors so as to relieve the stressful experience of being overwhelmed by inner conflict and optimize the psychological adjustment mechanism in addition resilience training for medical staff should be emphasized and strengthened in daily life from the analysis of related factors for resilience the results showed that perceived stress gender knowledge of covid-19 knowledge of covid-19 protective measures and availability of adequate protective materials were all statistically significant factors related to the medical staffs resilience some of these results were consistent with results of previous studies perceived stress reflects an individuals psychological experience after the self-interpretation of stressful events 36 the results showed that greater perceived stress indicated worse resilience of the medical staff another study also found that good resilience enables a person to more successfully cope with the stresses and demands of life 37 it is not difficult to predict that with an increase in self-perceived stress an individuals adaptability to stress will decline and their self-recovery ability after psychological adjustment will also be affected showing a low level of resilience therefore hospital administrators should take whatever measures are feasible to relieve the stress level of the medical staff in their radiology departments on the other hand hospital administrators can start by reducing their sensitivity to and perception of stress promoting relaxation reducing anxiety and treating the outbreak objectively and rationally the results showed that resilience of female medical staff in the radiology departments was significantly lower than that of male medical staff a study found that women had higher levels of psychological distress and that the resilience of women had less impact on their psychological distress than did the resilience of men on their psychological distress 38 meanwhile another study also found that the resilience of women was significantly lower than that of men 39 the reason may lie in the differences between the different genders in their perspectives and ways of looking at problems women are more susceptible and sensitive their anti-stress ability is also relatively weak and thus possibly inadequate for psychological adaptability therefore more attention and emotional counseling should be given to female medical staff in the radiology departments a greater understanding of covid-19 equated to better resilience which means that a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of covid-19 is more conducive to an objective and rational view of the outbreak thus excessive anxiety and panic can be avoided and the evolution of the outbreak can be viewed with a more peaceful attitude therefore the medical staff in the radiology departments should be encouraged to obtain information on covid-19 and to enhance their understanding of the disease meanwhile hospital administrators can also collect valuable positive information about the outbreak and provide timely notification to medical staff in their radiology departments this study also found that a greater understanding of protective measures for covid-19 equated with better resilience which means that a comprehensive understanding of those measures is necessary to improve medical staff resilience only by mastering good protective measures can risk of infection be fundamentally reduced and the psychological security of the medical staff increased only with psychological security can medical staff promptly get rid of anxiety panic and other negative emotions and persever through the epidemic 40 therefore the hospital administrators should training medical staff in their radiology departments on how to protect themselves from covid-19 as soon as possible without just depending on the staffs own knowledge and self-learning instead guidance on unified professional and scientific protective measures that fit the outbreak should be organized to foster clear and consistent behavioral norms thus the negative impact of adversity on individuals can be minimized and adaptation and growth can be maximized the results also showed that whenmedical staff are faced with a shortage of protective materials they will have worse resilience a study demonstated the importance of ensuring the adequacy of medical supplies during the outbreak of covid-19 41 adequate protective materials are the most fundamental prerequisite for personal safety of medical staff lack of protective materials will also lead to lack of psychological security that pessimism and helplessness will significantly reduce the ability to mobilize protective factors make risk factors gradually become stronger and hinder psychological recovery therefore current efforts of hospital departments  especially in some local hospitals  to ensure a supply of protective materials are particularly necessary if medical staff in the radiology departments are to maintain good resilience despite unprecedented advances in medical technology over the past few decades awareness of and vigilance aboutr epidemics have fallen far short 42 as a result when sars middle east respiratory syndrome and even this outbreak of covid-19 suddenly appeared it was difficult for medical staff in radiology departments to make full preparations psychologically it was difficult to establish enough confidence to cope with and maintain good resilience to adapt therefore we need to make some preparations during normal times in terms of government functions it is important to ensure that radiology departments at all hospital levels including community hospitals not just at large-scale hospitals are well prepared for public health emergencies in terms of hospital administration it is necessary to strengthen the study and practice of scientific and systematic response measures daily for all kinds of public health emergencies which can not only enhance the awareness of self-protection of medical staff in radiology departments but also increase their confidence about self-protection so that they can calmly respond to an outbreak in addition daily training among medical staff in radiology departments especially women should also be actively carried out to improve their psychological anti-stress ability and enable them to transform negative emotions into positive emotions promptly and effectively under stress all of the above are conducive to medical staff in radiology departments maintaining good resilience during an emergency our study has the following limitations first only medical staff in the radiology departments in sichuan province were included and further study is needed to conduct supplementary surveys in other provinces in china to improve generalization of the findings second the related factors included in this study only accounted for 415 of the total variation in the equation and more relevant factors that are clinically valuable need to be included in subsequent studies to provide a more comprehensive and in-depth basis for implementation of scientific and effective interventions in the future finally because of the limited conditions we only studied medical staff in radiology departments and it was impossible to determine whether their resilience differed from that of staff in other departments the resilience level of medical staff in radiology departments during the outbreak of covid-19 was generally low especially in the aspect of toughness attention should be paid to factors that may influence resilience including high perceived stress female gender lack of understanding of covid-19 and covid-19 protective measures and lack of protective materials for staff targeted efforts should be made to improve the resilience level of radiology staff during the outbreak of covid-19  living with covid-19 a systemic and multi-criteria approach to enact evidence-based health policy didier raboisson guillaume lhermie   the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic has been perceived as a major unprecedented public health threat sparing no country with a speed of onset that has lead policymakers worldwide to implement drastic control measures very quickly 1 the first objective was to avoid a massive mortality burden which led to extensive lockdowns to contain the dissemination of the outbreak as days pass lockdowns prove effective in limiting public health damage while at the same time social movements rise to advocate for freedom to work and circulate 2 indeed covid-19 represents a change in paradigm for our society and the healthcare system in the last few decades outbreaks have been maintained locally and have been limited over time which makes covid-19 a novel entity 3 the management of infectious disease can follow two alternative strategies the first one is to eradicate the disease and the second one is to learn to live with the disease and mitigate its impact as of mid-2020 eradicating a disease such as covid-19 seems not to be an option vaccines are not available protective immunity after infection is challenged and immunity duration is unknown moreover quick development of herd immunity would likely come at high public health costs with a significant number of deaths and a large healthcare expenditure living with covid-19 will lead to substantial changes in individual freedom and behaviors and directly change medical economic societal and political stakes worldwide the very challenge for policymakers consists of implementing a sustainable approach for the economic and social sector which will require the lifting of restrictions sooner or later the ultimate goal of lockdown-lifting is to mitigate the impact on the countrys economy and on the well-being of individuals while containing the spread of the outbreak in a way that is manageable for the healthcare services without having to face ethical dilemmas such as equity in healthcare or additional risks of death in case of infection the optimal lockdown-lifting method would be the one that best meets these four objectives mitigating the spread of the outbreak maintaining economic activity and social well-being and ensuring political stability in both the short and the long terms this crisis reveals the difficulty of implementing responses to seemingly simple problems a single infectious agent but which are actually fundamentally complex and gaining acceptance of them by citizens this observation is not new in the public health literature and academics as well as some institutions invite policymakers to pledge policies accounting for multiple parameters additionally political scientists have analyzed agenda-setting in light of the interdependence of people acting in a political and institutional context 4 5 in the case of covid-19 a context of emergency leads to the envisioning of responses articulating i biological and economic constraints including the behavior of individuals and ii high biologic and economic uncertainty these facts lead to the seeking of original solutions that are able to handle multiple criteria simultaneously and are sufficiently acceptable by individuals for their own safety and for compliance with rules for collective purposes a holistic approach to health management beyond outbreak management is therefore necessary 6 it should dynamically handle multiple risk factors and multiple economic and biologic outcomes and be customized at various geographical scales such an approach must combine medicine epidemiology and economics and differs from normal epidemiological approaches centered on an infectious agent or a syndrome we propose to lay down the characteristics of a holistic approach accounting for several objectives and different time steps that is required to manage lockdown-lifting and the covid-19 endemic situation to do so we rely on social-ecological approaches developed in the field of environmental economics and in public health policy in ostroms diagnostic approach the social-ecological system ses framework was designed to address coordination problems of natural resource management and help prioritize the most relevant variables 7 8 sess are complex adaptive systems with many locally interacting components evolving with non-linear dynamics sometimes unpredictably 9 10 adapted to the current covid-19 situation the ses relates outcomes such as health well-being and economic welfare to interactions between humans eg number of contacts or conflicts among people which are influenced by the resource system the governance system and users in a given social economic and political setting in parallel a significant amount of literature advocates for systemic approaches in public health 11 one way to measure interactions between factors affecting health is to use the social ecological model sem 12 this model studies how the physical social and cultural dimensions and political environments of the individual as well as their personal characteristics influence health well-being and social cohesion the sem recognizes interactions across individuals embedded within larger social systems and describes the characteristics of individuals and environments that underlie health outcomes in the sem each level overlaps with other levels hence defining the best public health strategies requires that a wide range of perspectives be targeted although our purpose here is not to investigate how to adapt the previously cited models to covid-19 we emphasize the importance of accounting for multiple variables simultaneously with the perspective of complex adaptive systems 9 13 the biological constraints linked to covid-19 and lockdown-lifting are known and have been extensively studied under various situations 1519 the constraints arise both from the characteristics of the outbreak epidemiological parameters ie contagiousness and severity of the disease and from the structure of the healthcare system number of available beds testing facilities personnel it is primarily a question of defining the modalities of lockdown-lifting that will not saturate the healthcare system which would lead to excess mortality due to lack of patient care 19 in the context of lockdown-lifting and living with an endemic disease the major economic constraints arise from business resumption and societal benefits the brutal and general cessation of economic activities has been widely accepted in the case of covid-19 as was the application of national solidarity for the most affected individuals however the prolongation of lockdown leads us to question both the cost-effectiveness of this policy and its acceptability to individuals a cessation of activity also generates a steep increase in public expenses and simultaneously a decrease in revenue taxes this situation leads us to seek a compromise between the resumption of activities and public health for each resurgence of covid-19 the issue will re-appear in very similar ways the behavior of individuals and their compliance with the potential rules issued for lockdown-lifting represent a major economic component of lockdown-lifting in the case of selective lift some people will benefit from population protection provided in part by the share of the population remaining locked social benefit and will also benefit from their private benefits resumption of activity and freedom of movement locked-down people will benefit from protection by being unexposed as well as from the social benefits derived from the lifting the contribution to society of the workers in return for respecting the lockdown the former would benefit from the positive externality generated by the collectives restrictive measures without having to assume the private costs however such free-riding may significantly reduce the effectiveness of the policy as frequently illustrated in other settings for public good or public health management 2022 the covid-19 crisis is an example of management in an uncertain context due to the novelty in biological terms new virus and economic terms large-scale shock it is not only a question of considering the risk which is likely but of uncertainty which is associated with a higher level of lack of knowledge we do not know and do not know how to predict this high degree of uncertainty is often fairly misunderstood or tolerated by populations and stakeholders sars-cov2 is a new pathogenic agent and therefore there several biological uncertainties exist regarding the detection and care of afflicted individuals and its population dynamics 23 considerable efforts are underway around the world to strengthen the level of knowledge of its pathophysiology or therapy in order to better treat cure predict and manage the behavior of the epidemic and its consequences on individuals the fact remains that today the lifting strategies must be defined with very uncertain parameters for example having vaccines available to a large population in the short term would allow for significantly different strategies than if the vaccine were only available on the shelf several years from now in parallel with biological uncertainties at least two major economic uncertainties are identified the first uncertainty relates to the costs and benefits of lockdown-lifting strategies and medium-term endemic covid-19 management which directly depend on the uncertainties of the economic impact of lockdown the impact could be more or less significant depending on the type of shock that covid-19 will represent 24 the negative economic impacts could be offset over a post-crisis period with these benefits even potentially exceeding the losses but these scenarios seem unlikely given the intensity and globality of the crisis the brutal severe and global cessation of economic activities suggests a major economic impact at least in the mid-term with pre-crisis activity levels not reached at best until 2021 25 the second economic uncertainty consists of the resilience of our social-ecological system and the possibility of renewal of our lifestyles interestingly some western countries call for an exit from the present covid-19 situation through an in-depth change of our societal growth model as part of lockdown-lifting decision-making it seems reasonable to target a hypothesis of a return to a before pandemic state since this represents in the short term the main way to limit the impact of the crisis it is moreover in these terms that the majority of economic impacts are measured to date at least for 2020 fall in gdp tax revenues etc grounding the lockdown-lifting strategy on the current economic system does not exclude the development of alternative economic models in the long term there is an exponentially increasing amount of information available on the covid-19 situation the critical information required for rational decision-making is as yet still limited and fake news and misinformation propagated massively via social networks blur evidence regarding public health management there are major concerns about how to make quick decisions that combine up-to-date information the limited rationality principles suggest the adoption of a procedural rationality approach ie focusing on the process of how to make the best decision with an exponential availability of information rather than on trying to gather all the information regarding its precision and relevance less to address the paradox between data availability and its use in decision-making multi-criterion analysis helps to gather data with various origins and combine information of different natures it concatenates indicators and considers historical features actor behavior and expert opinions the integration of various information and metrics for an improved decision-making process may dramatically help to reach optimal societal benefits through balanced and equitable decisions epidemiological and economic modeling provide a set of highly valuable sources of information to consider in the holistic decision-making process the holistic approach proposed and focusing on procedural rationality instead of substantial rationality are required all the more given that all the processes take place in a context of high uncertainty covid-19 requires that decisions be made under uncertainty as we cannot predict the odds of some epidemiologic economic or political events occurring for instance it means implementing lockdown-lifting with neither precise information on the seroprevalence in the population and the distribution of seropositive individuals within the different subpopulations at risk infants adults seniors nor on the location of contagious people the nature of the contacts and the observance of biosecurity measures are complex and inconstant peoples behavior is changing as the system changes and the resilience of the economic system is not known computer simulations must be taken into account as regular updates will provide new information improving the strategies adopted but they also face uncertainty uncertainty leads to dynamic adjustments of the decision and the best decision today may not be the best tomorrow this means that the decision process is based on biased information and that we must be clear on this within the communication strategy political path dependency ie the tendency to keep the same policy even if not really well-adapted anymore so as to avoid any criticism on initial lack of vision should clearly be avoided here and the dynamics in political decisions should be highlighted and claimed as positive a feedback mechanism of the effectiveness of the measures taken allows us to continuously adjust the biological and economic dynamics and therefore represents a fine and precise regulatory tool if used and understood as such many metrics can be used for feedback in animal medicine feedback has been applied with success for decades for population health-related decision making it is based for instance on clinical observations and on advanced health indicators provided by production and health data analyzed using machine learning tools 26 in the case of covid-19 it would be a question of checking on a regular basis whether the predicted event really occurs and whether the trajectory is respected or deviated from a comparison with the forecasts associated with the containment strategy would enable policymakers to relax or tighten certain rules unfortunately the use of feedback in the management of the epidemic is often limited on the one hand the information used must be sufficiently reliable to support the decision which is generally the case for the prevalence criteria at least in the hospital system on the other hand the adjustment of the measures implemented in the management of outbreaks contradicts the path-dependence of the previous decision to which policies are particularly sensitive and requires a significant educational effort to be accepted using the feedback principle for the covid-19 situation appears a promising approach combining pragmatism and efficiency that will enable a precision health management approach at the local level town department in accordance and complementarity with national rules the success of its application in animal health population medicine can be duplicated for covid-19 a multi-scalar policy of lockdown-lifting and endemic covid-19 management will differentiate the strategies to be implemented as a function of the subpopulations and the ecosystem in which they live multi-scalar means well-integrated and coordinated multilevel policies these principles are well-integrated into the epidemiological approaches of covid-19 but not yet in the economic ones whether it be the behavior of actors or their contributions to the creation of wealth this differentiated approach by cluster not only improves the performance of the policies for limiting the spread of the disease but it also integrates the interest for individuals and groups in unlocking certain populations gradually 27 clustering allows the inclusion of equity instead of equality because collective and superior interest should prevail applying equity means defining precise rules accounting for all subpopulations well-being the contributions of individuals to the collective value creation and individual constraints at both the personal or familial and professional point of view seniors and the unemployed should have access to public areas respecting given restrictions priority for freedom of circulation should remain for medical staff and their support as well as essential sectors people performing partial home working without any drop in productivity should continue to do so in spite of some preferring to work only at the office on the contrary people with a low socio-professional level and no possibility of working at home should be authorized to contribute whatever they can to global societal value combining epidemiological clustering with outbreak management and economic clustering though the contribution of socio-professional groups to societal value may help to achieve the best societal benefit in the context of covid-19 coupling the principle of feedback to a multi-scalar approach at least with a segmented geographic approach would make it possible to respond efficiently and clarifying a precision approachdifferentiated geographically and by populationwould be facilitated because lockdown has increased social pressure there might be strong protests against the different strategies to be adopted all the more so the longer the lockdown and crisis last avoiding a political shock is a key point for policymakers but also for overall societal benefit a yellow-vest-like crisis during covid-19 management may have dramatic consequences considering the constraints encountered and the principles described above we propose an evidence-based policy framework to handle the covid-19 situation as is applied to perform medical diagnostics for diseased patients figure 1 any policy should envision i respecting an equilibrium among the three dimensions detailed below public health economics and wellbeing ii quantitatively qualitatively and continuously monitoring the societal-economic-epidemiological dynamics allowing iii the policy to be adjusted by tightening or loosening measures before the epidemic damage may re-occur the figure represents three successive policies implemented according to the proposed framework the framework includes scientific background from epidemiological and economic modeling readily available blue boxes figure 1 the epidemiological transmission models used should consider the sub-populations in terms of biological risk children adults seniors as well as in terms of economic socio-professional profiles and political socially vulnerable populations impact epidemiological and bio-economic modeling are not a substitute for managing uncertainty but they provide practical support for the expected results of each strategy which can then be integrated into the overall decision-making process a well-integrated and coordinated multilevel policy will differentiate the strategies to be implemented as a function of the subpopulations and their social-ecological system considering the subpopulations allows societal dimension of the issue to be practically accounted for figure 1 ie accounting for socio-professional categories for their contribution to the collective production and their vulnerability hard-to-reach populations refugees homeless high precarious and long-term consequences child and student education reintegration of the unemployed considering several social gradients guarantees a precision approach a high-precision geographically differentiated strategy is possible providing a high level of coordination of decision-makers within and between geographical areas based on bio-economic modeling an evidence-based policy can be implemented through the societal economic and public health dimensions differently for various subpopulations importantly the policy is not only the compromise of the monetary and public health dimensions but accounts for societal outcomes as well societal indicators refer to strategies that specifically consider non-active subpopulations or subpopulations that do not directly contribute to monetary value production gdp the sub-population epidemiological modeling allows the strategy to be adjusted for minorities as well as for people with specific risk factors because covid-19 is likely to become endemic these social and societal well-being criteria non-monetary economic are key criteria to be accounted for policy 1 represents for instance a highly intensive level of lockdown ie strict lockdown as observed in many countries that leads to strong negative economic and societal impacts by enhancing the public health dimension the feedback system guides a practical approach to manage uncertainty a set of quantitative and qualitative indicators are proposed to precisely monitor the societal-economic-epidemiological dynamics figure 1 right par it could for instance be based on active surveillance devices tracking time or location depending on socio-professional profiles implemented for alternate access to public areas for various populations at risk social criteria metrics such as real outdoor access could be used i to control abuses and to predict epidemiological metrics for the next week but also ii to evaluate how a well-being measure outside access for the elderly for instance is welcome and adopted policy evaluation such metrics help in measuring the needs and behaviors of the population and adapting the strategy epidemiological criteria such as mortality morbidity and the possible saturation rates of hospital and intensive care services could be used the feedback overtakes the regular updating of the bioeconomics and epidemiological models that support decision-making and clearly and directly bridges the gap between the situation in the field and the situation as seen by policymakers the early balancing process allows tightening or loosening measures before the epidemic damage re-occurs applying the feedback principle leads for instance to changing policy 1 into policy 2 at time 2 to balance the three dimensions and give room to breathe to economics and the locked-down population for example the surveillance indicators might show that policy 1 was efficient for outbreak control decrease in morbidity and mortality and healthcare services no longer saturated but that social mental health acceptability of the lockdown principle and economic bankruptcy gdp decrease indicators had reached a critical level a few weeks later a policy adjustment policy 3 may occur due to an increase in mortality and morbidity and a high level of healthcare service saturation leading to limits being placed on outdoor access for populations with low contributions to the countrys economic life seniors the unemployed children through a spatial-temporal sharing of public areas altogether this allows an evidence-based policy that steers the strategy with precision and avoids any political shock adapting the framework regionally would likely improve the efficiency of such a precision approach dr and gl conceived and wrote the paper and the figure dr and gl contributed equally to the article and approved the submitted version the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest  the covid-19 outbreak in italy perspectives from an orthopaedic hospital alberto grassi nicola pizza dario tedesco stefano zaffagnini   italy is one of the countries more severely affected by the novel coronavirus disease covid-19 1 2 with more than 150000 cases and nearly 20000 deaths after the isolation of two chinese tourists in rome who were found to be positive to coronavirus on january 31 the real outbreak officially started in northern italy on february 21 less than two months ago 3 4 the following day the virus entered emilia-romagna which is a region of 4500000 inhabitants confining with lombardy the region of bergamo brescia and milan where the outbreak begun bologna the chief town of emilia-romagna accounting for nearly 1000000 inhabitants in its metropolitan area registered the first positive case on february 29 the rizzoli orthopaedic institute is the main hospital dedicated exclusively to orthopaedic surgery of the emilia-romagna region and among the largest of the whole italy in this hospital which accounts of more than 300 beds nearly 90 orthopaedic surgeons perform more than 12000 procedures every year mostly elective surgery such as joint replacements arthroscopies spine surgery paediatric surgery but also a relevant number of musculoskeletal oncologic cases and fractures the aim of this report is to describe how covid-19 affected the life and organization of one of the main orthopaedic hospitals of the country and which measures were implemented to face the outbreak managing either covid and non-covid patients with fractures rationalize the activity and limit the contagious diffusion dealing for the first time with an unknown enemy pose to administrators surgeons and overall staff many new challenges unavoidably mistakes could have been made and others could follow therefore we think that our experience could be helpful to speed up the process of implementing effective measures in orthopaedic hospitals with settings similar to ours a personal interview has been conducted with four doctors of rizzoli orthopaedic institute dr tedesco from the medical affair department prof zaffagnini director of ii orthopaedic and traumatology clinic dr grassi orthopaedic surgeon and dr pizza third year orthopaedic surgery resident when the world health organization who declared the novel coronavirus later renamed sars-cov-2 outbreak an emergency of international concern on january 30 2020 rizzoli orthopaedic institute developed its first strategies to respond to the potential spread of the epidemic at that time though italy was not considered a high-risk country and the national and local guidelines were not particularly specific or detailed on february 21 the first italian covid-19 case was reported in a small town 200 km from bologna and the same day another 20 citizens tested positive in the same area on february 22 the ministry of health released detailed guidelines based on both clinical and epidemiological criteria for how to define suspect cases and how to organize the healthcare response on february 23 the rizzolis medical affairs department adapted the national guidelines for the specific settings of care of its hospital facility by issuing the first of a series of local instructions this document was particularly focused on two main aspects 1 instructing doctors nurses and administrative employees to recognize patients with suspect of covid-19 in the emergency setting surgery wards and outpatient clinics and define specific pathways for these patients 2 providing the most appropriate ppe for each healthcare professional potentially exposed to the infection it was apparent that the latter was a critical issue because the risk of a pandemic had been globally underestimated and national and local authorities had not secured sufficient stocks of protective equipment in order to keep up with the swiftly changing epidemiological context the hospital management updated protocols and instructions daily for a rational and evidence-oriented use of the ppes and organized educational meetings to instruct healthcare workers on their appropriate use the crisis worsened the hospital which is part of the national health service but was not assigned to be a covid-hospital had the first covid-19 case in a patient and in a nurse on march 9 in the following days the number of cases among patients and healthcare workers increased and the hospital management responded not only with a massive swab testing campaign aimed at detecting contact histories among patients and healthcare workers but also with an additional testing campaign for asymptomatic healthcare workers at the same time the level of ppe protection was raised with the use of surgical masks in all patients with any respiratory symptoms and all healthcare workers who were in contact with these patients regardless of their clinical condition in order to prevent the contamination of healthcare workers and other patients specific pathways for patients with suspect or confirmed covid-19 were established for the operating room intensive care unit emergency department and surgical wards with specific hygiene and prevention protocols starting from march 20 a specific covid-19 ward with 14 beds for patients with a musculoskeletal disease was opened as of april 10 133 of the screened patients resulted positive for sars-cov-2 the percentage of healthcare workers who tested positive was 83 among the group of healthcare workers who did not have symptoms or were not contacts of positive patients or healthcare workers only 16 tested positive on april 6 the hospital launched serology tests seeking igm and igg against sars-cov-2 in the hospitals asymptomatic healthcare workers as of april 10 only 11 of them showed an immune response to the virus as the hospitals infection control manager since the beginning of the emergency i have felt the profound need to respond swiftly and appropriately to different and sometimes conflicting interests at play for example i was compelled to balance the need to address the potential ppe shortage by providing it only to professionals who were in close contact with suspect patients according to the who guidelines with the duty of guaranteeing a safe work modality for all the employees the entire period has been characterized by a general sense of uncertainty and continuous change among the hospitals employees and particularly the healthcare staff over the first 50 days of the covid-19 outbreak the medical affairs department together with nursing management has constantly worked to inform update and instruct the hospitals staff by discussing the most recent evidence and policies at the local and regional level sharing the decisions with the clinical and nursing leaders and applying an open-door policy for anyone in need of help or clarification on this topic two days after the discovery of the first positive patient elective surgeries were cancelled and the hospital was re-organized to receive most of the fractures from the whole city since all the smaller local hospitals were progressively closing in order to centralize the treatment of critical diseases and trauma trying to limit the diffusion of virus therefore only trauma surgery was allowed together with oncologic and urgent cases such as osteomyelitis and wound infection dehiscence all sports trauma arthroscopy joint replacement and spine deformity which represented the core activity of the institute were suppressed ambulatory surgery was cancelled as well in order to promote social distancing and avoid population movement in line with government decrees activity of outpatient clinic was reduced to allow only indispensable follow-up visits suppressing first-time consultations and creating a task force to implement telemedicine orthopaedic surgeons were organized in two different teams to allow a weekly-based alternation in the management of surgical trauma cases this alternation allowed to limit the interaction among colleagues and to make up for the possible lack of personnel due to quarantine two operatory rooms running from 7 am to 7 pm were dedicated to trauma surgery which were more than 50 hip fractures in elderly followed by proximal humerus fractures and ankle fractures severe pelvic and spinal fractures were treated in the trauma center of the city which is a multi-specialty hospital also designated as general covid-center where an icu for covid patients was present one operation room isolated from the others was entirely dedicated to the treatment of positive or suspected covid patients there separate clean and dirty spaces were created to allow safe dressing and undressing procedures which are performed one member at time under the supervision of a trained nurse in order to avoid auto-contamination especially while removing headgear despite being the referral centre for most of the trauma in the whole city the emergency department registered a drastic decrease in the number of trauma cases especially minor of more than 50 due to the national lockdown to manage trauma or oncologic patients positive for covid-19 or those with suggestive symptoms and positive radiological exams a dedicated ward was created converting one of those previously dedicated to elective surgery a dedicated team was created selecting members from the existing hospital staff the ward was organized to take care of the pre- and post-operative management of suspected or positive covid-19 patients providing nurses for monitoring of and administration of therapy physiotherapists for patients rehabilitation and anesthesiologist consultants for the management of patient ventilation with non-invasive measures such as oxygen mask or cpap an isolated area of the hospital icu was reserved as well for positive or suspected covid patients separate beds were also reserved for non-covid patients requiring icu support after trauma or oncologic surgery as a university center all didactic activities were suppressed to avoid people gatherings lectures and oral exams for medical students were conducted remotely via webcam as officially implemented by the local university i am one of the orthopaedic surgeons assigned on a weekly-basis to manage the trauma-covid ward in collaboration with an internal medicine doctor the population of the ward is composed of covid-19 positive patients and patients who were transferred from the clean trauma ward to guarantee isolation due to symptoms suggestive of covid infection logistically the ward is divided into a clean area where staff is allowed to circulate with surgical mask regular scrubs cap and gloves then half of room corridor and all the rooms represent the dirty area where entrance is allowed only with ffp2 mask glasses double gloves disposable coat and shoe coverage instructions for dressing and undressing are present in multiple spots and these actions are performed under the supervision of a second person that controls the appropriateness of the procedure in order to avoid auto-contamination while removing protective gear mirrors helps the removal of head gear minimizing the risk of touching face skin the distinction between a clean and dirty area is possible since patients are confined in isolation inside the rooms two patients per room in the case of positivity for covid-19 one patient per room in the case of suspected covid or when diagnosis is in progress due to confinement of patients inside the rooms and limited droplet-generating procedures this setting is considered a safe and smart environment for all the required medical activities in fact since patients with a non-confirmed covid diagnosis could be admitted in this ward isolation among patientsunless confirmed positiveand staff should be maintained in order to not create nosocomial contagion one of the main challenges in the management of trauma-covid patients is represented by the high mortality 5 especially of elderly patients of the first eight cases of hip fractures surgically treated nail or replacement in patients with covid-19 diagnosis three of them died within seven to ten days from surgery unpublished preliminary data another challenge is obtaining an accurate and timely covid diagnosis as a relevant quote of false-negative swabs may be present 6 moreover trauma patients are usually elderly with relevant co-morbidities often involving the respiratory system and the typical ground-glass appearance of the lungs at high-resolution computerized tomography hrct 7 could be present as baseline characteristics when screened for covid diagnosis it is also possible that symptoms such as fever weakness and desaturation may be part of the classical post-operative complications if the general population with borderline presentation and indeterminate diagnosis can be safely managed with preventive home quarantine this is not possible for post-operative trauma patients since their condition does not allow basic self-care in complete isolation on the other hand their management in the usual non-covid structures dedicated to post-operative rehabilitation would expose healthcare staff to contagious risk and local cluster onset until 100 negativity is confirmed the long-lasting treatment of these patients within the trauma-covid ward does not represent a feasible option either since the continuous surgical activity and the imminent risk of infection outbreak causes a permanent need for free beds which requires prompt patient turnover with discharge home or transfer to care facilities for assistance continuation the other possible pathways for covid-positive or suspected covid are represented by the covid-hospitals equipped with high-volume icus in the case of complex patients possibly requiring ventilatory support or the so-called covid-resorts in the case of stable patients necessitating standard medical therapies however due to the special needs of trauma patients like active physiotherapy and wound management the isolation setting within all these paths in which a physiotherapeutic support is not contemplated represents a dangerous threat for the quality of patient care and health maintenance in fact elderly patients especially those with limited respiratory impairment would enormously suffer from bed immobilization and isolation due to the concrete risk of complications such as deep venous and pulmonary thromboembolism bedsores cognitive impairment and death 8 9 i am a pgy3 orthopedic surgery resident aged 29 who contracted the sars-cov-2 and luckily recovered i spend most of my time in the hospital between the clinic and the laboratory as it is easy to imagine our work leads to continually meet people either patients or colleagues which is sometimes necessary despite the application of social distancing measures therefore understanding how i came into contact with the virus is almost impossible as the infection reached my hospital i had the possibility to be screened for the infection in that moment i was completely asymptomatic so i took the test sure that i would be negative and only for personal and deontological safety towards the patients i would meet in the following days the day after the test my phone rang it was the public health institution of my city which called me to report the result of the test it was positive the first thought was for my family when did i last see them was it within the virus incubation period how far were we did we hug each other did i infect them too then i thought about the people i met in the hospital my colleagues but mostly the patients in the end i thought about my own health the quarantine began after i came to know that i did not infect anyone i started to fear about my own health i was attentive to every symptom that could have possibly manifested i was lucky enough to not have any of them since some of my older orthopaedic colleagues had bad fevers and malaise for a couple of weeks and few of them required hospitalization for non-invasive ventilator support the more the days went by the more i thought about when i could go back to work according to the actual protocol since i was asymptomatic i took the first control test ten days after negative two days later the second control test again negative therefore i was able to return to work and the concern i had before for my health had been directed back to others again if i were symptomatic i should have waited at least one day after all symptoms resolution before taking the two consecutive tests what would have happened if i hadnt been screened i am afraid to think about it screening healthcare workers should be considered in every hospital in particular hospitals like mine which is dedicated to the care of trauma and urgent surgeries and therefore considered non-covid could come in contact with covid-patients and the contagion could circulate among patients and healthcare professionals despite all protections an interview of four doctors involved in the covid-19 outbreak has been presented from the institutional point of view one of the most important lessons learned so far is the absolute need to adapt daily to the new evidence and to find a constant balance between what guidelines prescribe and the legitimate concerns of the healthcare staff for healthcare provider regarding the treatment of patients in this period there is an urgent need to create dedicated pathways or structures for post-operative trauma patients to receive at a minimum aside from medical care and possible need of respiratory support basic physiotherapeutic assistance while respecting healthcare staff safety finally it should not be overlooked that these elderly patients experience isolation and removal from their families for weeks therefore the covid experience could represent a dramatic event also for those with non-severe covid clinical forms thus it is important for all involved healthcare members to maintain humanity with patients and especially with their relatives due to the concrete possibility to never see their beloved alive as their treating physician he also spent a relevant amount of time on phone to update families regarding the overall status of their relatives attempting to establish direct patient-family communication using phone and video-calls whenever possible finally asymptomatic positive healthcare provider represents a further challenge as they could potentially become unaware carrier therefore all efforts should be made to recognize and manage similar situations in order to avoid the propagation of the epidemic moreover considering the possible delay between contagious and symptoms onset also patients with fractures admitted to the trauma department from the emergency are now tested for the presence of covid the outbreak of covid-19 pandemic in italy deranged the national healthcare system and poses new and imminent challenges to everyone involved the absence of predetermined guidelines made us build our approach on a daily basis based on incoming requests new problems to face internal feedback and increasing limited evidences therefore at the moment we are not able to provide an outcome of these measures or determine how their implementation has improved the management of covid and non-covid patients with fractures but only to suggest useful recommendations table 1 however the main lesson is that any actions should be quick and decisive for one week during the covid-19 epidemic could make the difference  corona games masks social distance and mechanism design balzs pej gergely biczk crysys lab  pandemic response is a complex affair most governments employ a set of quasi-standard measures to fight covid-19 including wearing masks social distancing virus testing and contact tracing we argue that some non-trivial factors behind the varying effectiveness of these measures are selfish decision-making and the differing national implementations of the response mechanism in this paper through simple games we show the effect of individual incentives on the decisions made with respect to wearing masks and social distancing and how these may result in a sub-optimal outcome we also demonstrate the responsibility of national authorities in designing these games properly regarding the chosen policies and their influence on the preferred outcome we promote a mechanism design approach it is in the best interest of every government to carefully balance social good and response costs when implementing their respective pandemic response mechanism  although in the same institute authors have collaborated remotely  the current coronavirus pandemic is pushing individuals businesses and governments to the limit people suffer owing to restricted mobility social life and income complete business sectors face an almost 100 drop in revenue and governments are scrambling to find out when and how to impose and remove restrictions in fact covid-19 has turned the whole planet into a living lab for human and social behavior where feedback on response measures employed is only delayed by two weeks the incubation period from the 247 media coverage all of us have seen a set of quasistandard measures introduced by national and local authorities including wearing masks social distancing virus testing contact tracing and so on it is also clear that different countries have had different levels of success employing these measures as evidenced by the varying normalized death tolls and confirmed cases 1  we believe that apart from the intuitive eg genetic differences medical infrastructure availability hesitancy etc there are two factors that have not received enough attention first the individual incentives of citizens eg is it worth more for me to stay home than to meet my friend have a significant say in every decision situation while some of those incentives can be inherent to personality type clearly there is a non-negligible rational aspect to it where individuals are looking to maximize their own utility second countries have differed in the specific implementation of response measures eg whether they have been distributing free masks affecting the efficacy of mask wearing in case of equipment shortage or providing extra unemployment benefits affecting the likelihood of proper self-imposed social distancing framing pandemic response as a mechanism design problem ie architecting a complex response mechanism with a preferred outcome in mind can shed light on these factors whats more it has the potential to help authorities mechanism designers fight the pandemic efficiently in this paper we model decision situations during a pandemic with game theory where participants are rational and the proper design of the games could be the difference between life and death our main contribution is two-fold first regarding decisions on wearing a mask we show that i the equilibrium outcome is not socially optimal under full information ii when the status of the players are unknown the equilibrium is not to wear a mask for a wide range of parameters and iii when facing an infectious player it is almost always optimal to wear a mask even with low protection efficiency furthermore for social distancing using current covid-19 statistics we showed that i going out is only rational when it corresponds to either a huge benefit or staying home results in a significant loss and ii we determined the optimal duration and meeting size of such an out-of-home activity second we take a look at pandemic response from a mechanism design perspective and demonstrate that i different government policies influence the outcome of these games profoundly and ii individual response measures sub-mechanisms are interdependent specifically we discuss how contact tracing enables targeted testing which in turn reduces the uncertainty in individual decision making regarding both social distancing and wearing masks we recommend governments treat pandemic response as a mechanism design problem when weighing response costs vs the social good the remaining of the paper is structured as follows section 2 briefly describes related work section 3 develops and analyzes the mask game adding uncertainty mask efficiency and multiple players to the basic model section 4 develops and analyzes the distancing game including the effect of meeting duration and size section 5 frames pandemic response as a mechanism design problem using the design of the two games previously introduced as examples finally section 6 outlines future work and concludes the paper here we briefly review some related research efforts for a more complete survey we refer the reader to 3  13 modeled the behavioral changes of people to a pandemic using evolutionary game theory and showed that slightly reducing the number of people an individual is in contact with can make a difference to the spread of disease moreover both an earlier warning and when accurate information about the infection is disseminated quickly peoples responses to the information can limit the spread of disease 17 focused on the traveling habits of people between areas affected differently by the disease and found conflict between the nash equilibrium individually optimal strategy and the social optimum optimal group strategy only under specific changes in economic and epidemiological conditions in line with our mask game 6 studied how individuals change their behavior during an epidemic in response to whether they and those they interact with are susceptible or infected the authors show that there is a critical level of concern ie empathy by the infected individuals above which the disease is eradicated rapidly furthermore risk-averse behavior by susceptible individuals cannot eradicate the disease without the preemptive measures of infected individuals in line with our social distancing game 14 studied how individuals would best use social distancing and related self-protective behaviors during an epidemic the study found that in the absence of vaccination or other intervention measures optimal social distancing can delay the epidemic until a vaccine becomes widely available 2 studied the vaccination behavior of people the designed model exhibits a wait and see nash equilibrium strategy with vaccine delayers relying on herd immunity and vaccine safety information generated by early vaccinators as a consequence the epidemic peaks timing is strongly conserved across a broad range of plausible transmission rates besides any effect of risk communication at the start of a pandemic outbreak is amplified finally the game-theoretic model in 15 focuses on the various level of drug stockpiles in different countries and find controversial results sometimes there is an optimal solution of a central planner such as the who which improves the decentralized equilibrium but other times the central planners solution minimizing the number of infected persons globally requires some countries to sacrifice part of their population to improve readability we summarize all the parameters and variables used for the mask and the distancing game in table 1  probably the most visible consequence of covid-19 are the masks before their usage was mostly limited to some asian countries hospitals banks in case of a robbery and some other places due to the coronavirus pandemic an unprecedented spreading of mask-wearing can be seen around the globe policies have been implemented to enforce their usage in some places but in general it has been up to the individuals to decide whether to wear a mask or not based on their own risk assessment in this section we model this via game theory we assume there are several mask types giving different level of protection  no mask this corresponds to the behavior of using no masks during the covid-19 or any pandemic its cost is consequently 0 however it does not offer any protection against the virus  out mask this is the most widely used mask eg cloth mask or surgical mask they are meant to protect the environment of the individual using it they work by filtering out droplets when coughing sneezing or simply talking therefore hinders the spreading of the virus they do not protect the wearer itself against an airborne virus the cost corresponding to this protection type is noted as c out  0  in mask this is the most protective prevention gear designed for medical professionals eg ffp2 or ffp3 mask with valves valves make it easier to wear the mask for a sustained period of time and prevent condensation inside the mask they filter out airborne viruses while breathing in however the valved design means it does not filter air breathed out note that cdc guidelines 2 recommend using a clothsurgical mask for the general public while valved masks are only recommended for medical personnel in direct contact with infected individuals the cost of this protection is c in  c out  besides which mask they use ie the available strategies the players are either susceptible or infected 3  the latter has some undesired consequence hence we model it by adding a cost c i to these players utility which is magnitudes higher than c in and c out  using these states and masks we can present the basic games payoffs where two players with known status meet and decide which mask to use on the left of table 2  the payoff matrix corresponds to the case when both players are susceptible note that in case both players are infected the payoff matrix would be the same with an additional constant c i  on the right of table 2 corresponds to the case when one player is infected while the other is susceptible on the left side of table 2 it is visible that both players cost is minimal when they do not use any masks ie the nash equilibrium of the game when both players are susceptible is no no this is also the social optimum meaning that the players aggregated cost is minimal the same holds in case both players are infected as this only adds a constant c i to the payoff matrix this changes when only one of the players is susceptible ie right side of table 2  the infected player using no mask is a dominant strategy for her 4  since it is her best response independently of the susceptible players action consequently the best option for the susceptible player is in ie the ne is in no on the other hand the social optimum is different noout would incur the least burden on the society since c out  c in  in social optimum susceptible players would benefit through a positive externality from an action that would impose a cost on infected players therefore it is not a likely outcome in fact such a setting is common in man-made distributed systems especially in the context of cybersecurity a well-fitting parallel is defense against ddos attacks 9  although it would be much more efficient to filter malicious traffic at the source ie out internet service providers rather filter at the target ie in owing to a rational fear of free-riding by others since in the basic game no player plays out we simplify the choice of the players to either use a mask or no hence we note the cost of a mask with c use  to represent the situation better we introduce ambiguity about the status of the players we denote the probability of being infected as  we know from the basic game that if both players are infected with probability  2  or susceptible with probability 1 2  they play nono while if only one of them is infected with probability 2    1   the infected player plays no while the susceptible plays use in this bayesian game the players play no most of the cases eg with probability 1    1   this chain of thought is too simplistic as we assumed case-wise that the players know their status consequently with uncertainty we must minimize the costs of the players if both players are infected with equal probability the payoff for player 2 is equation 1 where p n is the probability that player n plays use otherwise she plays no the payoff for the other player is similar since the game is symmetric in more detail the first two lines correspond to the case when player 2 is not infected hence the multiplication with 1   at the beginning while the last line captures when she is infected either way she plays use with probability p 2  which costs c use  otherwise she plays no which has no cost except when player 1 is infected and she plays no as well end of the second line since this formula is linear in p 2  its extreme point within 01 is at the edge we take its derivative to uncover the function steepness the condition for the function to be decreasing ie higher probability for using a mask corresponds to lower cost is seen below consequently the only scenario which might admit wearing a mask with non-zero probability corresponds to the availability of sufficiently cheap masks in the basic game we assumed in provides perfect protection from infected players while out protects the other player fully however in real life these strategies only mitigate the virus by decreasing the infection probability ie  to some extent for this reason we define a b  0 1 in a way that the smaller value of the parameter corresponds to better protection a measures the protection efficiency of the protection strategy while b captures the efficiency of eliminating the further spread of the disease consequently a and b was set in the previous cases to a out  0 a in  1 both in prevents further spread fully while out does not prevent it at all b out  1 out has no effect on protecting the player b in  0 in fully protects the player we simplify the action space of the players as we did in the bayesian game in and out is merged into use with efficiency parameters a and b we set b  2 3  as surgical masks on the infectious person reduce cold  flu viruses in aerosols by 70 according to 12  while a home-made mask achieves 23 of this efficiency 4  parameter a is much harder to measure it should be a  b since any mask keeps the virus inside the players is more efficiently than stopping the wearer from getting infected for the sake of the analysis we set a  b 2  1 3  we are interested in the mask-wearing probability of a susceptible player when the other player is infected 5 the utility in such a situation is shown in equation 3 where for simplification we defined p  p 1  p 2  ie both players play a specific strategy with the same probability with such a constraint we restrict ourselves from finding all the solutions however since the game is symmetric an equilibrium of this reduced game is also an equilibrium when the players could use a different strategy distribution from this we easily deduce that use corresponds to a smaller cost that no if cuse c i  7 9  which holds by default as c use c i even for more inefficient masks moreover use ie p  1 is the best response most of the time because of the following 1 the utility is a second order polynomial hence it has one extreme point 2 this extreme point is a minimum due to u  4 9  c i  0 3 the utility ie cost is decreasing on the left and increasing on the right of this minimum point 5 the minimum point is expected to be above 1 due to c use c i  6 p  0 1 is on the left of the minimum point hence a higher p corresponds to a smaller cost this game can be further extended by allowing more players to participate in this extension if there exists an infected player who plays no as we showed already all the susceptible players should play in this ne is the so as well if the ratio of the infected which is identical to the probability  of being infected is sufficiently high the accumulated cost when the susceptible players play in and the infected play no is less than the accumulated cost when the infected players play out and the susceptible play although it is mathematically possible that the infected plays no in the so but it is doubtful both the cost of in is significantly higher than out and the infection ratio  is low at least at the beginning of the pandemic another thing most people has experienced during the current covid-19 pandemic is social distancing here we introduce a simple distancing game it is to be played in sequence with the previously introduced mask game once a player decided to meet up with friends via the distancing game she can decide whether to wear a mask for the meeting using the mask game a summary of the used parameters are enlisted in table 1  we represent the cost of getting infected with m  l ie the mortality rate of the disease multiplied with the players evaluation about her own life 6 we set m  01 as this value is approximately in the middle of the possible interval 7  006  dead all cases  m  dead closed cases  014 besides the risk of getting infected going out or attending a meeting could benefit the player denoted as b on the other hand staying home or missing a meeting could have some additional costs denoted as c the probability of getting infected is denoted as  with these notations the utility of the distancing game is captured on the left of equation 4 where p is the probability of going out since this is linear in p its maximum is either at p  0 stay home or p  1 go out precisely the player prefers to stay home if the right side of equation 4 holds example for instance a rational american citizen should go out only if she values her life less than 2941 1 0003401  times the benefit of going out and the loss of staying home together if we approximate the infection ratio with active cases population  00034 as of 20th of may 2020 according to 16  the value of a statistical life in the us was 92 million usd in 2013 which is equivalent to 113 million usd in 2020 with 03 interest rate this means a rational average american should only meet someone if the benefit of the meeting and the cost of missing it would amount to more than 3842 usd  113m 2941  one way to improve the above model is by introducing meeting duration and size leaving our disinfected home during a pandemic is risky and this risk grows with the time we spend outside similarly a meeting is riskier when there are multiple participants involved in the original model we captured the infection probability with   1  1   this ratio increases to 1  1   gt when there are g possible infectious sources for t time since g and t are interchangeable we merge this two together under a common notation z  g  t this extended model can be used to determine the optimal duration and size of a meeting once the player decided to go out according to the basic distancing game we define 0  z  100 as no player has infinite time or meeting partners moreover the benefit and the loss of attending and missing a meeting should depend on this new parameter for instance staying home in isolation for a longer period might cause anxiety which could get worst over time ie increasing the cost or attending a meeting with many friends at the same time could significantly boost the experience ie increase the benefit consequently a rational person should leave her home only if equation 5 holds which is the extension of the right side of equation 4  in figure 1  we present three use-cases of the formula inside the maximization above the left one represents the case when both the benefit and the cost are constant the right one corresponds to the case when both of them are linear in the middle is a mixture of these two note that we needed to restrict z to be under a certain amount otherwise the formula goes to infinity as z   in some cases let us assume a bus tank is leaking the owner is loosing 1 usd of petrol every t time ie cz  1  t as the owner must visit a mechanic and meet one person in the meantime the benefit of leaving the house is constant eg bz  1 the middle of figure 1 corresponds to this setting it is visible that going out for a short or long period eg z  5 and z  100 is only rational for someone who values her life below 3553 and 3499 usd respectively figure 1 a few examples for various benefit and cost functions of the lower limit on the life value which would ensure that a rational american would stay home ie the formula inside max in equation 5 x axis represents z while y axis represents the utility pandemic response is a complex affair the two games described above model only parts of the bigger picture we refer to the collection and interplay of measures implemented by a specific government fighting the epidemic in their respective country as mechanism consequently decisions made with regard to this mechanism constitutes mechanism design 10  in its broader interpretation mechanism design theory seeks to study mechanisms achieving a particular preferred outcome desirable outcomes are usually optimal either from a social aspect or maximizing a different objective function of the designer in the context of the corona pandemic the immediate response mechanism is composed of eg wearing a mask social distancing testing and contact tracing among others note that this is not an exhaustive list financial aid creating extra jobs to accommodate people who have just lost their jobs declaring a national emergency and many other conceptual vessels can be utilized as sub-mechanisms by the mechanism designer ie usually the government we do not discuss all of these in detail due to the lack of space instead we shed light on how government policy can affect the sub-mechanisms how sub-mechanisms can affect each other and finally the outcome of the mechanism itself we illustrate the importance of mechanism design applying different policies to our two games and adding testing and contact tracing to the mix here we analyze the impact of commonly seen policies compulsory mask wearing distributing free masks limiting the amount of people gathering and total lock-down compulsory mask wearing and free masks if the government declares that wearing a simple mask is mandatory in public spaces such as shops mass transit etc it can enforce an outcome outout that is indeed socially better than the ne the resulting strategy profile is still not so but it i allocates costs equally among citizens ii works well under the uncertainty of ones health status and iii may decrease the first-order need for large-scale testing which in turn reduces the response cost of the government by distributing free masks the government can reduce the effect of selfishness and potentially help citizens who cannot buy or afford masks owing to supply shortage or unemployment limiting the amount of people gathering and total lock-down if the government imposes an upper limit l for the size of congregations this will put a strict upper bound on the optimal meeting size g   and the resulting group size will be minl g   note that if l  g  then it creates an opportunity for longer meetings larger t as equation 5 with appropriately designed and administered coronavirus tests medical personnel can determine two distinct features of the tested individual i whether she is actively infected spreading the virus and ii whether she has already had the virus even if there were no or weak symptoms note that detecting these two features require different types of tests able to show the presence of either the virus rna or specific antibodies respectively in general testing enables both the tested person and the authorities to make more informed decisions putting this into the context of our games testing i reduces the uncertainty in bayesian decision making and ii enables the government to impose mandatory quarantine thereby removing infected players even more impactful mandatory testing as in wuhan completely eliminates the bayesian aspect rendering the situation to a full information game it serves as an exogenous health oracle imposing no monetary cost on the players to sum it up the testing sub-mechanism outputs results that serve as inputs to both the distancing and the mask game naturally a health oracle does not exist someone has to bear the costs of testing from the governments perspective mandatory mass testing is extremely expensive similarly from the concerned individuals perspective a single test could be unaffordable contact tracing whether traditional or mobile app-based serves as an important input sub-mechanism to testing 7  it identifies the individuals who are likely affected and inform both figure 2  pandemic response mechanism as influenced by government policy dotted lines and the interplay of sub-mechanisms solid lines them and the authorities about this fact in game-theoretic terms for such players the benefit of testing outweigh the cost per capita with high probability from the mechanism designers point of view contact tracing reduces the overall testing cost by enabling targeted testing potentially by orders of magnitude without sacrificing proper control of the pandemic note that mobile os manufacturers are working on integrating contact tracing into their platform to eliminate adoption costs for installing an app 1  the big picture as far as pandemic response goes the mechanism designer has the power to design and parametrize the games that citizens are playing taking into account that sub-mechanisms affect each other after games have been played and outcomes have been determined the cost for the mechanism designer itself are realized see figure 2  this cost function is very complex incorporating factors from icu beds through civil unrest to a drop in gdp over multiple time scales 11  therefore governments have to carefully balance the -very directly interpreted -social optimum and their own costs this requires a mechanism design mindset in this paper we have made a case for treating pandemic response as a mechanism design problem through simple games modeling interacting selfish individuals we have shown that it is necessary to take incentives into account during a pandemic we have also demonstrated that specific government policies significantly influence the outcome of these games and how different response measures sub-mechanisms are interdependent as an example we have discussed how contact tracing enables targeted testing which in turn reduces the uncertainty from individual decision making regarding social distancing and wearing masks governments have significantly more power than traditional mechanism designers in distributed systems therefore it is crucial for them to carefully study the tradeoff between social optimality and the cost of the designer when implementing their pandemic response mechanism limitations and future work clearly we have just scratched the sur-face of pandemic mechanism design the models presented are simple and are mostly used for demonstrative purposes also the mechanism design considerations are only quasi-quantitative without proper formal mathematical treatment in turn this gives us plenty of opportunity for future work a potential avenue is extending our models to capture the temporal aspect combine them with epidemic models as games played on social graphs and parametrize them with real data from the ongoing pandemic policy changes mobility data price fluctuations etc relaxing the rational decision-making aspect is another prominent direction behavioral modeling with respect to obedience other-regarding preferences and risktaking could be incorporated into the games finally a formal treatment of the mechanism design problem constitutes important future work incorporating hierarchical designers who eu nations municipality household an elaborate cost model and analyzing optimal policies for different time horizons if done with care these steps would help create an extensible mechanism design framework that can aid decision makers in pandemic response  maximizing the calm before the storm tiered surgical response plan for novel coronavirus covid-19 samuel ross wade cynthia lauer w william miles s john

medical icu 14-bed cardiac icu and virtual critical care services for atrium health over 300 icu beds in atrium health are monitored virtually based on lessons from history those already learned in the covid-19 pandemic and the following principles were used to create a tiered response plan for use in surgery departments throughout the united states led by our division of acute care surgery acs in coordination with emergency management and other stakeholders this plan has been developed for and is being disseminated through our department of surgery and throughout all surgical subspecialties at all our facilities in the earliest weeks of the epidemic in wuhan isolation of patients and then eventual quarantine of family communities and then whole cities was seen while these concepts may be familiar to many in the past weeks an old concept but new to many has been disseminated to the country to decrease the spread of covid-19 social distancing this term includes measures from simply limiting unnecessary activities like in large gatherings such as concerts marathons and sports games to more drastic measures like banning all gatherings more than 50 people closing schools city-wide and in some cases state-wide and furloughing non-essential personnel from businesses8 the goal of these measures is to reduce the spread of the virus so that the doubling time of the virus is increased the purpose being to have fewer patients present in a shorter time period to hospitals this has gone viral in the flattenthecurve movement with the publication of carl bergstroms graph illustrating the surge in patients on an exponential scale in relationship to the healthcare capacity as a flat line figure 1
 measures such as social distancing would act to slow the spread and prolong the time frame of patients presenting to hospitals as we have seen in italy when the steeper rise occurs a higher number of deaths occur as patients who need intensive care and ventilators have long out-paced the available resources and a rationing and triage of patients is required7 however with increased testing meticulous contact tracing and measured social distancing south korea has been able to decrease the rate of spread and healthcare facilities have not become overburdened9
 optimal disaster response necessitates knowledge preparedness and coordination to ensure adequate resource availability and allocation this often requires difficult capacity and financial decisions during a preparation phase to make room for the anticipated influx of patients inherent in this is assessing the number of currently occupied beds planned procedures and admissions and the maximum capacity for floor and icu beds more novel is what beds could be created in austere conditions by double bedding hospital and icu rooms conversion of pacu operating rooms and even hallways into icu beds a typical or could house 3-6 patients depending on its size and could be staffed by crnas and anesthesiologist as elective and even urgent cases are cancelled early and proactive bed management is key as reports from italy indicate that all non-critical and non-emergent care has ceased as the hospitals are now at 200 capacity7 given these capacity issues systems are unable to provide adequate care for patients with everyday emergencies like stroke myocardial infarction and trauma thus the early covid-19 mortality numbers fail to account for many patients who will have a concurrent preventable mortality from other causes as the result of this unanticipated surge and subsequent resource exhaustion oxygen delivery and mechanical ventilation will no doubt be the highest value resource given the presence in critically ill covid-19 patients of respiratory failure 54 and ards 3110 in general the experience has been that non-invasive oxygenation modalities such as nasal cannula and bipap are ineffective and patients at this stage will need mechanical ventilation ingenuity with methods to create new ventilators from spare parts and retrofit old machines such as ippb into working ventilators will be required additionally if all patients are covid-19 as many as 4-patients could be linked in parallel on pressure control settings to attain reasonable minute ventilation and tidal volumes if required11 finally while ventilators will be in high demand endotracheal tubes are copious and if family members are willing bagging of patients by family members when no ventilator is available may be required first and foremost a proactive response is needed to limit the unnecessary interactions and contact of all personnel in an effort to minimize exposure risk as early as possible as the situation evolves staffing will become dynamic requiring a coordinated effort among physicians advanced practice providers and residents clear and definitive leadership will be required to best determine staffing and provider labor allocation for each facility buy-in from all respective division chiefs and departmental coordination will define and facilitate staffing levels situational flexibility will be paramount in conjunction with clear and efficient communication and multidisciplinary collaboration all staffing plans must inherently assume attrition and furloughs required not only as the result of iatrogenic and community exposures but also due to social instability andor resource consumption as such agreements should be in place to allow emergency credentialing and expansion of scope of practice to other facilities as necessitated by the needs of the community in large health systems or even regional cooperatives a pool of surgeons can be mobilized to start covering cases at satellite hospitals as surgeons at these facilities are furloughed consideration should also be taken to minimize the risk to more senior partners to lower risk roles outside the hospital quarantined and senior surgeons can participate in telemedicine and even virtual critical care to increase the capacity to triage patients and care for the critically ill additionally since this will be a prolonged surge if measures of social distancing are successful consideration to weekly rotating teams off service of faculty apps and residents to not deplete or expose all providers at once principles of the crisis standard of care should be used in disaster response when health care needs overwhelm available resources12 at the highest response levels plans for the advancement of senior residents and fellows to attending status may be required given the increased need for critical care expertise at this highest level emergency general surgery egs and trauma coverage should be transitioned to general surgery trained elective surgeons to allow deployment of any surgical critical care scc trained physicians solely to the intensive care setting we recommend a tiered reallocation of acute care surgeons acs faculty as appropriate for each respective facility at severe manpower shortage levels non-acs familiar with high-acuity priorities and hemorrhage control like vascular transplant and hepatobiliary surgeons may be required to take trauma call additionally when supra-maximum patient capacity with decreasing providers in critical care and internal medicine subspecialized surgeons will likely be called to become general physicians to treat the non-critical patients with covid-19 however every nurse therapists ancillary staff and physician regardless of specialty should have some basic training of ventilator management given the possibility of provider depletion and expansion of icus learners inevitably play a role in large-scale responses and preparations must strike a balance between patient safety and residents personal safety while an emergency plan is focused on patient care it must also support workforce sustainability in the event of quarantine illness or injury resident participation in emergency preparedness plans is essential in hospitals with training programs planning for trainee allocation or quarantine has not been extensively studied a hospital and graduate medical education department must decide the role trainees will play before their deployment is required which will likely involve graduated promotion at the highest response level the role of medical students should be carefully considered with the default response being for them to be dismissed to isolation with the general public the benefit provided to the affected population by students would be minimal compared to the risk of their exposure evaluations and planning has focused on mass casualty incidents isolated to specific communities13 14 15 there has been no published and distributed plan instituted for residents in such a population health scenario as presented by covid-19 for example residents roles in the disaster response to the boston marathon bombing was unclear there was no understanding if residents would be expected to provide surge staffing or if they would be stratified by experience13 though most hospitals train nurses and attendings for mass-casualty events fewer than half train residents14

15 this is a gap in medical education that should be addressed as these incidences are unfortunately becoming more frequent most resident staffing during crises is managed ad hoc by chief residents or program directors communications should be in place whether by group text online meeting applications or other local mechanism so that chief residents act as a liaison between institutional command attending physicians and resident teams it is likely that trainees could be asked to work beyond scheduled duty hours local graduate medical education leadership should be involved in preparations and knowledge of acgme program requirements is essential it is possible residents will be asked to work beyond accepted duty hours and these exceptions should be made known to the acgme but exemptions should be provided given the national emergency graduated autonomy and extension of attending physicians by senior residents as well as battlefield promotions of fellows and chief residents will be the most logical progression as the response to the crisis escalates and personnel are furloughed or quarantined unfortunately in a resource exhaustion and surge capacity difficult ethical decisions will have to be made on which patients merit the use of a scarce resource these types of discussions are usually reserved for organ allocation and in cases that require ecmo even in a normal situation where your hospital only has one icu bed one ventilator or one ecmo circuit left the default is to still give it to the first patient that needs that resource however more complex in our current pandemic scenario is that the ventilator you are allocating today to the person with a poor chance of survival may deprive that resource tomorrow to the patient with a moderate chance of survival several schemas have been created in the past to rationalize the choices that are now in front of many healthcare providers some of which are to maximize number of life years favors the young social value favors occupations that are deemed valuable in preserving society infrastructure and culture and instrumental value those that would have impact on the current outbreak like physicians and nurses16
 currently in italy reports in over capacity facilities describe making hard decisions to not intubate patients over 65 and no icu care to patients over 8017 this type of rationing is un-thinkable to most americans with the perception that all aspects of healthcare are an inherent right up to and escalating towards death while many practitioners in the us will rightly not want to set hard limits like this the withholding of surgery with recognition of futility is readily decided upon surgeons inherently understand futility in end-stage cancer overwhelming sepsis and advanced age and comorbidities covid-19 patients with progression to ards and multiple risk factors will have similarly dismal potential for survival therefore in the vein of justice and maximizing benefit to all of society advanced triage criteria based on individual risk factors should be performed before resources become exhausted to ensure that the next salvageable patient has the opportunity to benefit where the current patient likely will not given the rapid changes in technology as well as societal healthcare pressures due to the global pandemic telemedicine should be the frontline triage for specialty surgery clinics18
 the limitations for use such as costs training or hippa related concerns may limit the ability to rapidly upload and utilize these platforms for virtual visits especially when faced with a rapidly progressing pandemic19 however many of these can be circumvented or expedited in the current state of emergency for example during the h1n1 pandemic north et al were able to use telephone screening triage to reduce unnecessary clinic visits yet preserve medical access20 in our specific acs clinics pre-operative visits were stopped when the pandemic was declared and the us was seeing increasing numbers post-operative patients still need to be evaluated and managed for many issues such as drains wounds and suture removal due to the time constraints given the increasing community spread we rapidly developed an acs clinic patient screening process edocument1 that started with already scheduled patients for return to our trauma and egs clinics if a patient was determined not to need a virtual or physical visit a telephone call was used to discuss the appointment and manage patient expectations this tool evaluated not only if they had medical issues requiring evaluation but also screened for potential covid infections utilizing the institutional infectious disease risk screening questions embedded within the screening tool edocument 2 utilizing this risk tool allowed a patient that was high risk to be directed to a covid-19 testing site all patients designated for upcoming clinics are assessed the week prior to the clinic appointment and determined to 1 not need to be seen physically nor virtually and their situation is evaluated by a clinic nurse phone conversation 2 be an ideal candidate for a virtual clinic visit or 3 in need of objective data such as a radiograph or laboratory blood work prior to clinic so the type of clinic visit can be determined due to the limited socio-economic resource of most of our patients many of our patients only have access to android or apple smart telephones if any so a computer video platform is not always viable we outfitted our clinic with 2 computers with video capability for patients calling into a virtual communication app teams so these patients can connect with a computer or android or i-phone device we elected to use these technology methods for more rapid preparations for virtual evaluations in the clinics and due to the time constraints of the forced social distancing mandates of the community after reviewing the previously completed screening tool on a patient an acs physician or app perform the virtual visit utilizing a standard virtual exam template edocument 3 with the information gleaned from the screening tool and the virtual exam a management plan is individualized for each patient and the forms are scanned into patients electronic medical records along with a documented clinic note if a patient requires a physical appointment in our acs clinic they are screened again on arrival for symptoms of a potential covid-19 infection only 1 additional care giver or family member can accompany the patient in order to improve social distancing in the waiting rooms all chairs are kept 6 feet apart on arrival to the clinic if a patient has any active symptoms of a covid-19 infection they are directed to a testing site appropriate for their symptoms per institution protocols only 1 nurse and 1 attending can evaluate the patient utilizing these methods in the first week of implementation out of 21 scheduled acs clinic patients we have already identified 19 patients able to be managed by virtual or telephone visits 91 reduction in clinic visit exposure contact has been completed and they are being managed virtually revealing a potential 91 reduction in clinic visits objective data is being obtained for 2 patients chest radiographs and laboratory values in order to determine whether they will require a physical clinic visit one of these 2 patient has staples that will be removed via a nurse visit or at their primary care providers office since they live over 1 hour away from our clinic office while we are early in the process transitioning our acs clinics to a virtualtelemedicine process with appropriate resources will continue to allow us to keep patients safe from exposure preventing potential exposure risk to healthcare staff as well as maintaining patient safety and perioperative surgical expectations in reflection of the above principles led by acute care surgeons with familiarity in disaster preparedness and public health in conjunction with the incident command structure and in an effort to keep in mind a prolonged surge of covid-19 patients the following surgery department covid-19 response plan was created table 1
 this has now been disseminated and adapted to each facility subspecialty surgical service and is being pivoted to other specialties such as pulmonary critical care and internal medicine within atrium health key in understanding the response level is your individual facilities incident command response level which follows similar structure set by the federal emergency management agency fema4

12 however new to this schema is conditionzero which indicates patient surge and acuity beyond the capacity of the infrastructure and manpower available a scenario currently being experienced in italy iran and progressively around the world advancement to higher tiers should follow incident command structure but may also be required within individual specialties departments or divisions plans given manpower and resource depletion at alert level which many facilities in the us have already surpassed disaster preparedness must begin in earnest and non-time sensitive elective cases or many cases in high risk patients should be delayed cancelled and rescheduled for no sooner than 3 months in the future limitations on non-emergent transfers non-operating room anesthesia nora cases and furlough of non-essential non-clinical staff should occur clinic triage and telemedicine should be performed whenever able prioritization to develop plans for further tiers and organization of surgeons into potential call back-up pools should be performed additionally in large health systems and regional collaboratives efforts to back-up community facilities from larger tertiary departments should be performed to limit transfers required due to quarantined or furloughed surgeons at these sites in progression to further tiers great focus is given the acute care surgeon ability to staff trauma scc and egs services given their true vertical integration in the hospital from the ed or floor and icu given their flexibility and critical care training it will be key to support these acs faculty with non-acs surgeons to manage egs and eventually even trauma this will allow the acs surgeons to support expanded icus or icu conversion and ecmo patients at non-trauma centers in the community or with no acs faculty general surgeon coverage and adaptation of this plan will be paramount to cover all surgical and covid-19 patients at level 2 healthcare providers will begin to be furloughed and decreased resources like blood ventilators and ppe will be available subsequently a 50 drawdown of all elective cases should be performed with focus on completing necessary cardiovascular and cancer cases but patients with high risk factors should be deferred age 60 dm htn smoking hx copd chf cad a good resource for deciding on the necessity is the elective surgery acuity scale just released by the american college of surgeons21 rearrangements of schedule and service coverage responsibility for residents app and faculty should begin and cycling of on call teams by several days or a week should be encouraged response level 1 will have accumulating provider and staff attrition due to quarantine and illness additionally stocks of ppe blood ventilators and other essential infrastructure will be diminished by increasing numbers of covid-19 patients therefore all non-emergent cases should be cancelled and transfer requests managed at the requesting facility all surgical transfers should be vetted by an acs surgeon with situational awareness to assess its acuity available resources and beds and if care may be futile expanded icu beds and staffing by the acs faculty will be required and non-acs surgeons required to flex to cover egs teams of younger acs faculty can be deployed to cover medical icus if needed and expect scc fellows to have battlefield promotions to junior icu attending status ecmo should be reserved for young non-comorbid patients with single organ dysfunction and acceptable prognosis expect decreasing staff and blood availability as quarantine and social distancing impact the community graduated resident autonomy and chief resident run floor services will be expected finally if the surge in patients comes as a tsunami as it did in italy and wuhan condition zero will require stretching the infrastructure and manpower beyond the breaking point in this scenario acs surgeons should focus on just icu patient care and non-acs surgeons cover trauma and egs in a tiered response non-emergent cases should not be performed and non-operative modalities should be pursued if possible for all urgent disease processes the export of urgent egs cases may be required to other centers advanced triage criteria with consideration of available resources expected increase in surge volume patient risk factors and principles of justice and value unfortunately must be considered for the continuation and betterment of our society novel ventilation strategies should be pursued whenever able and even emergent non-covid care may need to be triaged or suspended for certain disease processes if the system facility and providers are over-leveraged at this level covid-19 healthcare workers may need to continue treating covid-19 patients given the extreme attrition of personnel at this level do not lose hope as wuhan has taught us with social distancing strict quarantine and abundant testing we can beat back this disease and mitigate its effect on our communities in any rapidly evolving crisis certain principles remain key to combating a constantly evolving and austere situation act with speed of the plan above perfection of the plan flexibility in the face of adversity is required and those that are not able to deftly change strategies with new information will be battling the past and not preparing for the future even in this response plan adaptation and integration of individual situations will be required communication with an assigned structure is vital to ensuring the entire team service facility and system are working on the same page and criteria situation reports within each of these strata is vital to understand the situation on the ground as well as the plan for the institution however succinctness is required so that worried and overwhelmed providers can quickly process and implement new information and protocols most of all a sense of community purpose and legacy is paramount to keep us mission focused on the health of our patients and community support and acknowledgement of our risk and sacrifice as physicians providersas healers are not in vain the current covid-19 pandemic is causing a paradigm shift for our globalized world in every sector economic social cultural and even a religious impact the brunt of the initial surge of patients was weathered in china and has now expanded to almost every country on earth all estimates point that the us is on track to have a similar surge of patients like italy and therefore now is the time to prepare coordinate among key stakeholders set up incident command and plan for every conceivable contingency the authors desperately hope that social distancing measures will prevail and that our tiered response plan will not be required at its highest level however failure to plan for these eventualities would make the outcome all the worse if or when they are needed please use adapt share and disseminate for the good of all our patients this is the defining moment of our generation leave a legacy worthy of remembrance godspeed  covid-19 timing is important giovanni de simone costantino mancusi   in the bergamos experience patients are admitted to the hospital after many days of symptoms and substantial aggravation this delay is reported to extend up to 2 weeks in addition the time of permanence in the emergency rooms or in sub-intensive wards is only 4 days on average before the patient is transferred to the intensive care unit icu this indicates that often patients or their family doctors delay their decision to go to the hospital until the conditions are critical thus the first question would be might an earlier admission to the hospital or an early aggressive therapy at start of the viral infection and the immune response save more lives than are now saved we wonder whether early antiviral therapy could work better in the early phase of the disease rather than when patients are in severe condition and a massive replication of the virus is more likely 2 once admitted to hospital covid-19 patients exhibit low po2 and are put under non-invasive ventilation niv in cpap mode a procedure that carries some environmental risk and is thought to be one of the reasons of in-hospital virus outbreak among health care workers 3 niv most often fixes the po2 and helps maintaining po2fio2 ratio pf in a reasonable range but in many cases this improvement is just temporary and acute respiratory failure develops 4 patients are transferred to the icu with very low pf values 
the second question would be is there a rationale for an earlier endo-tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation once a patient exhibits respiratory distress evidence from the h1n1 outbreak strongly suggest that in many or most cases niv is ineffective and that early intubated patients have a better prognosis 5 in wuhan 76 of a small group of critically ill patients were non-responsive to niv 4 it should be considered that any attempt to re-balance the respiratory function with niv can cause a delay in intubation direct evidence on the consequences of delayed intubation in covid-19 patients is not yet available however contacts with emergency room doctors trained in my department at the university of naples federico ii who are managing patients with covid-19 confirmed the same experience as with h1n1 early intubated patients seem to exhibit better outcome personal communication analyses on retrospective data on this matter are urgently needed nobody knows exactly how to stop lung destruction caused by covid-19 hundreds of scientists are now working on different pharmacologicimmunologic approaches in order to fight the viral invasion these include specific anti-viral drugs molecular targets to inhibit cell entry and vaccines another approach which was proposed at the time of the ebola outbreak focuses on increasing the host resistance against the viral invasion 6 the administration of convalescent sera 7 anti-inflammatory agents and specific cytokine-inhibition by administration of tocilizumab a monoclonal antibody blocking il6 and approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis were tested with some apparent success in wuhan 8 and in naples italy a clinical trial with tocilizumab has been recently approved for covid-19 in italy several trials are on-going on all these possibilities as reported in the covid-19 science report of university of singapore httpssphnusedusgwp-contentuploads202003covid-19-science-report-therapeutics-23-marpdf 
the third question would be is there a possibility that the scarce success of the drugs used so far could be at least in part related to the timing of administration of these compounds sars-cov-2 infection clinically presents no symptoms or symptoms of common colds until it evolves to covid-19 pneumonia and therefore to ards siddiqi and mehra 2 propose a 3-level stage-sequence of sars-cov-2 infection based on the present knowledge their hypothesis is based on the assumption that during its natural history the disease switches from a viral infection to a self-maintaining hyper-inflammatory response during stage i infection cells of the innate immunity are involved before the involvement of cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctl which play a major anti-viral response through the production of cytotoxic molecules with the purpose of eliminating infected cells 9 the production of igm anti-virus antibodies occurs during the first week of infection subsequently plasma cells start producing high-affinity igg antibodies which presumably play a protective role during this initial phase of the disease stage i it would be rational to administer anti-viral medications combined with specific convalescent sera or even non-specific polyvalent high dose immunoglobulin 
stage i can presumably evolve in most cases towards healing nobody knows the immunological mechanisms underlying the failure of resolution of inflammation and the progress of infection to stage ii an important role in the evolution toward a more severe stage could be played by t follicular helper tfh immune cells 10 specialized in providing help to b-lymphocytes and fundamentally required for antibody production a dysfunction of this cell line can be found in elderly patients and contributes to the decreased antibody formation 11 when evolved to stage ii covid-19 is characterized by virus proliferation and massive lung inflammation viral pneumonia in this stage there are two enemies to fight the virus and acute lung inflammation human lungs contain a plethora of immune and inflammatory cells 12 all producing inflammatory cytokines and chemokines massive release of these proinflammatory mediators are at the basis of the multiple organ failure at this stage continuation of anti-viral therapy should be combined with adequate anti-inflammatory therapy ie anti il-6 chloroquine and especially in the elderly potentiation of serum immunity in stage iii the main problem is hyperinflammation and therefore the main target therapy should be a very aggressive anti-inflammatory strategy including glucocorticoids 13 associated with high doses of polyvalent immunoglobulins if convalescent serum is not available a fulminant coronavirus myocarditis has been reported very recently in a case-report with complete recovery using high doses glucocorticoids and high dose immunoglobulin 14 this combination has a pathophysiologic rationale in the approach to increase host resistance 6 acting the two critical levels inflammation and useful immune response we recognize that the latter approach is based on limited clinical evidence however the combination of aggressive anti-inflammatory therapy and support of immunological defense has a rational basis in this brief

many patients with covid-19 are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism vte therefore we recommend pharmacologic prophylaxis for patients with covid-19 when hospitalizedwe recommend that dosing of vte pharmacologic prophylaxis be evidence-based whenever possible escalated doses can be considered for critically ill patientswe recommend that post-hospital pharmacologic prophylaxis be used selectively for patients at highest risk for vte based on existing evidence from randomized trialswe recommend the use of anti-xa assay rather than aptt to monitor unfractionated heparin dosing due to potential baseline abnormlaities in aptt for patients with covid-19we recommend a full 3 month course of therapeutic anticoagulation for patients with covid-19 who are presumed to have a hospital-associated vte event
 reports of elevated risk of thrombosis associated with coronavirus disease-19 covid-19 have led frontline providers to consider the empiric use of therapeutic anticoagulation for hospitalized patients even in the absence of documented or clinically suspected thrombosis high-quality evidence in this clinical area is absent as such providers should employ a methodical and thoughtful approach to the use of high-risk anticoagulant medications for both prophylactic and therapeutic purposes this guidance document addresses key issues pertaining to prevention or treatment of thrombotic events in hospitalized patients with covid-19 with the overarching purpose of striking a balance between risks and benefits of anticoagulation therapies the document also addresses key strategies to minimize covid-19 exposure risk for patients taking chronic anticoagulant medications this guidance is predicated on 1 the shared experiences of medical providers managing covid-19 from early stages across the globe 2 expert opinions from the anticoagulation forum board of directors and 3 known best practices that have long-served as the evidence-based foundation of anticoagulation management in the pre-covid-19 era given the highly dynamic nature of this pandemic it is essential to apply rational evidence-based approaches whenever possible stay apprised of emerging evidence and modify practice accordingly in this document the use of specific language points to the strength of our guidance statements practices for which there is the strongest evidence andor nearly unanimous expert opinion are described as we recommend practices for which there is less strong evidence andor lack of consensus are described as we suggest finally practices for which little to no evidence exists andor there is lack of consensus are described as is reasonable recommendations in this document are whenever possible based on the latest available evidence however readers are cautioned that for some issues published evidence is inconclusive unavailable or evolving in all instances recommendations represent the opinions of the authors and are not to be solely relied upon or used as a substitute for careful medical judgments by qualified medical professionals 
a we recommend pharmacologic vte prophylaxis for all hospitalized non-pregnant patients with confirmed or highly suspected covid-19 regardless of vte risk assessment score eg improve 13 padua 14 caprini 15 unless a contraindication exists eg active bleeding profound thrombocytopeniab we recommend pharmacologic vte prophylaxis for all hospitalized pregnant patients with confirmed or highly suspected covid-19 providers should follow guidance recently published by the royal college of obstetricians rcog 16 close collaboration with obstetric and anesthesiology colleagues is recommended in the event of delivery andor need for epidural anesthesia during hospitalizationc in patients with a contraindication to pharmacologic vte prophylaxis we recommend consistent application of intermittent pneumatic compression devices with regular re-assessment for conversion to pharmacologic prophylaxisd in critically ill patients it is reasonable to employ both pharmacologic and mechanical vte prophylaxis ie intermittent pneumatic compression devices as long as no contraindication to either modality exists
 
a for all non-critically ill hospitalized patients ie not in an icu with confirmed or highly suspected covid-19 we recommend standard dose vte prophylaxis as per existing societal guidelines for medically ill and surgical hospitalized patients dose adjustments for renal function or extremes of weight should follow product labeling andor institutional protocolsb for critically ill patients ie in an icu with confirmed or highly suspected covid-19 we suggest increased doses of vte prophylaxis eg enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneous twice daily enoxaparin 05 mgkg subcutaneous twice daily heparin 7500 units subcutaneous three times daily or low-intensity heparin infusion 22 24 this suggestion is based largely on expert opinion dose adjustments for renal function or extremes of weight should follow product labeling andor institutional protocols individual hospitals should determine which regimens best align with institutional experience and workflow several examples of institutional protocols for covid-19 are available for review and use within the anticoagulation forums centers of excellence resources center httpsacforum-excellenceorgresource-centerindexphpc for pregnant patients with confirmed or highly suspected covid-19 we recommend that providers collaborate closely with obstetric and anesthesia colleagues to determine optimal vte prophylaxis dosing intermediate dosing regimens often used in the third trimester as suggested by the american college of obstetrics and gynecology acog 25 and rcog 26 may be a reasonable option for pregnant patients with covid-19d we recommend against using biomarker thresholds such as elevated d-dimer as the sole reason to trigger escalations in anticoagulant dosing outside the setting of a clinical triale for patients that are improving and transferring out of the icu to the medical ward it is reasonable to de-escalate to standard vte prophylaxis dosing
 
a we suggest that extended vte prophylaxis is not necessary for all patients with covid-19 who are being discharged from the hospitalb we suggest that a multidisciplinary discussion occur at or near the time of discharge to determine if a patient has ongoing vte risk factors may benefit from extended post-hospital vte prophylaxis and has ensured access to vte prophylactic medicationsc we recommend using a standardized patient selection approach that mirrors clinical trial populations as closely as possible see table and that involves the patient in the decision-making processd if post-discharge prophylaxis is deemed reasonable we recommend use of an adequately studied andor approved agent such as betrixaban 29 or rivaroxaban 30 or enoxaparin adjusted as need based on weight renalliver function and drug-drug interactions and suggest limiting the total duration as used in the clinical trials ie enoxaparin 6-14 days rivaroxaban 31-39 days betrixaban 35-42 days see table 1
 
a we suggest use of low molecular weight heparin lmwh over ufh for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vte whenever possible in patients with covid-19 this approach avoids additional laboratory monitoring minimizes nursing and phlebotomy exposure and limits use of personal protective equipmentb due to lack of evidence on outcomes for bleeding or thrombosis we do not recommend dosing adjustments of lmwh using anti-xa levels 32c we recommend use of ufh over lmwh in patients with acute kidney injury or creatinine clearance less than 15-30 mlmind we recommend using an anti-xa assay rather than an aptt to monitor therapeutic ufh in patients with covid-19 whose aptt is prolonged at baseline if the baseline aptt is normal it is reasonable to monitor therapeutic ufh with either an anti-xa assay or aptt we suggest that clinicians consider possible reasons other than covid-19 for baseline aptt prolongation as this laboratory finding could be due to an underlying coagulopathy that increases the risk of anticoagulant-associated bleedinge we suggest using an anti-xa assay rather than an aptt to monitor therapeutic ufh in patients with covid-19 who exhibit heparin resistance typically defined as need for 35000 units of heparin per 24 hours as measured by the aptt if a patient does not exhibit heparin resistance it is reasonable to monitor therapeutic ufh with either an anti-xa assay or aptt guidance for establishing anti-xa monitoring of heparin infusion is provided at the anticoagulation forum centers of excellence httpsacforum-excellenceorgresource-center
 
a based on currently available evidence we suggest against daily monitoring of d-dimer for the purpose of guiding anticoagulant therapy d-dimer measurement may be used as a marker of illness severity and prognosisb we suggest against intensification of anticoagulant dosing based only on biomarkers such as d-dimer however acutely worsening clinical status in conjunction with laboratory value changes such as rising d-dimer may necessitate further thromboembolic workup or empiric treatmentc we recommend providers and clinicians stay apprised of emerging evidence regarding biomarkers of thromboembolic risk and adjust practices accordingly
 
a we recommend against use of thrombolytics in patients with covid-19 outside of a clinical trial setting unless there is another clinical indication for thrombolysis such as st elevation myocardial infarction acute ischemic stroke or high-risk massive pe with hemodynamic compromise
 
we suggest that pediatric patients admitted for covid-19 who are moderately or severely ill be given vte risk prophylaxis in accordance with existing institutional guidelines
 
a we recommend thorough evaluation for any clinically relevant drug-drug interactions in patients with covid-19 who require concomitant anticoagulation in addition to screening for common drug-drug interactions it is important to screen for interactions with covid-19-specific therapies eg antivirals via regularly updated reliable resources a suggested resource may be accessed at httpswwwcovid19-druginteractionsorgb we recommend a full 3-month course of anticoagulation for any patients initiated on therapeutic anticoagulation for a presumed thrombus in whom rapid imaging is not feasible a possible exception would be a patient who experienced recent bleeding or is at a high risk of bleeding anticoagulation beyond the initial 3-month period should be determined in accordance with existing guidelines for presumed hospital-associated vte events 40c in patients receiving empiric anticoagulation for a presumed but unconfirmed vte we suggest that delayed imaging not be used to determine if anticoagulation can be stopped before completing a three-month coursed we recommend that all patients be assessed for prehospital use of anticoagulation and that re-initiation of anticoagulation prior to discharge be based on a combination of pre-existing conditions eg atrial fibrillation and their covid-19-related hospital coursee we recommend that all elements of an anticoagulation stewardship transition of care be included for patients with covid-19 prior to hospital discharge on an anticoagulant this includes but is not limited to clear documentation of the indication eg empiric treatment of highly suspected covid-related vte intended duration of therapy appropriate anticoagulation education referral and follow-up appointment scheduled prior to discharge access the anticoagulation forum core elements of anticoagulation stewardship programs guide may be accessed at httpsacforumorgwebeducation-stewardshipphp
 
a we recommend that anticoagulation clinics use standardized educational materials for their warfarin-treated patients about safety precautions when obtaining inr blood draws to reduce the risk of covid-19 infectionb we recommend that patients who would not be eligible for doac therapy prior to the covid-19 pandemic not be switched to doac therapy during the covid-19 pandemic this includes but is not limited to patients with mechanical heart valves severe liver dysfunction or combined renal dysfunction andor drug-drug interactions that preclude safe doac use ability to reliably obtain and take doacs is another important consideration when assessing eligibility to switchc we suggest that clinics interested in transitioning patients from warfarin to a doac develop a standardized screening protocol to identify eligible patientsd we suggest that patients taking chronic oral anticoagulant in the outpatient setting be switched to shorter acting agents eg lmwh or ufh when initially hospitalized for covid-19 in case of clinical deterioration changes in renal function or need for invasive procedures
 
a we suggest that for patients on chronic warfarin management who have had stable inrs for at least three months extending the inr testing interval up to twelve weeks can be consideredb we suggest that anticoagulation clinics that provide face-to-face management explore the option of drive-up inr point-of-care testingc we recommend that patients who require inr testing be encouraged to work with their providers and laboratories to minimize their covid-19 risk rather than omitting or delaying inr testingd we recommend patient self-testing for patients who demonstrate testing competency and who can afford this option
 while evidence is rapidly emerging about covid-19-associated coagulopathy and thrombosis risk there is little high-quality evidence to guide antithrombotic management the present recommendations aim to provide guidance for frontline clinicians caring for patients with covid-19 andor patients with chronic thrombotic conditions requiring ongoing management in the era of the covid-19 pandemic whenever possible we recommend that clinicians rely on pre-covid evidence-based principles of anticoagulation management combined with rational approaches to address unprecedented clinical challenges as this area is rapidly evolving it will be necessary to integrate additional evidence into our management recommendations fortunately several clinical studies including randomized controlled trials are being conducted the results will better inform our management decisions online resources such as the anticoagulation forum centers of excellence resource center httpsacforum-excellenceorg will be

help with the coronavirus pandemic but mistook the comfort for the uss intrepid a retired aircraft carrier like many qanon believers she had become obsessed with the comfort convinced that its being used to rescue mole children from the clutches of liberal elites who enjoy sodomizing and then cannibalizing young children some of these same conspiracy theorists believe that children are being held hostage in secret tunnels beneath city streets by liberal democrats to be used in rituals designed to conjure satan a vigilant trump was apparently onto them in a thrice and is preparing to bring the evil doers to justice sommer and marcottes reporting identifies one type of conspiracy theory-fueled insanitythat which has infected the trumpster qanon followers and those who enable them including the previously anti-vaccination crusader president donald trump but there is another type of insanity the one that attempts to separate the rich and the poor and then pretends that such a separation does not exist trump and the conspiracy theorists belong in this camp too the whistle-a-happy-tune-happy-talk-keep talkin-happy-talk cover up that paints the gross economic inequalities that mark

technology  some of which is already in use by google for example  is very frightening and in this toxic mix of circumstanceswhere we are saddled with a president who has claimed that a final us coronavirus death toll of approximately 100000 to 200000 people would indicate that his administration has done a very good job rupar 2020the evangelical community is putting countless numbers of people at risk by refusing to stop holding large church gatherings and refusing to cease its decades long attack on science in the usa the evangelical community has found a second-tier messiah in the person of donald trump mclaren and jandri 2020a christian nationalism in the age of trump is a religious virus that gives no respite to its hostthe commonweal and its enduring search for spiritual and material prosperity but trump is no fool when it comes to pleasing his basehe had been cannily throwing them red meat long before his run for president and as president he is well on the way to defunding planned parenthood and in the mind of many evangelicals to bringing about the biblical apocalypse approximately 40 of american adults are biblical apocalypticists and believe that jesus will or likely will return to earth by 2050 dias 2020 from the time that the coronavirus crisis first appeared on the shores of gods favorite piece of real estate it became clear that it is comorbid with christian nationalism or to put it another way christian nationalism seems to be a co-occurring condition relative to pandemics that reach the shores of america the beautiful mclaren and jandri 2020a some religious scholars in fact are in agreement that there is a two-way relationship between religion and nationalism a mutual reification and buttressing as grzymala-busse 2019 explainsin this relationship religiosity defines the nationand nationalism reinforces religiosity leading to unusually high rates of national identification with a given religion and high rates of religiosity itself this mutual reinforcement characterizes countries where religious participation and religious nationalism are both high such as the philippines poland ireland until the late 1990s or the united states grzymala-busse 2019 and while this is certainly true we cannot blur the distinction between the sacred dimension of religion and profane sphere of the political nation which remain separate even when they contradict andor reinforce each other i would not want to make the case that christianity is equivalent to the political state in whose wheelhouse trump sits in washington when he is not bedizened in golf attire swinging the clubs at mar-a-lago but it is increasingly clear that trump has identified himself with charismatic pentecostal and evangelical christianity largely for political reasonstheir practitioners perceive him as a divine instrument of god and are prevalent in key states important for trumps reelection chances i am largely against religious states in principle and have said so when speaking in israel or pakistan or the west bank palestine i have always supported freedom of religion within a secular state apparatus open to a wide range of religious faiths and i have always defended the separation of church and state thomas jeffersons phrase in articulating my understanding of the intent and function of the establishment clause and free exercise clause of the first amendment to the united states constitution which reads congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof see mclaren and jandri 2020b ignoring the constitution those who have helped to manufacture the virus of christian nationalism boast no need of critical sobriety and less need for metropolitan intellectuals with their incessant insistence on finding new ways to clamp down on what they see as the necessary separation of church and state christian nationalism is a sickness that poisons every ethico-political reservoir of hope and possibility with a fatal hubris for decades the messages of prosperity preachers have hollowed into my mind sometimes in the form of a revolving worm announced by a roll of thundering apocalyptic prose and on other occasions like a flaming corpse decamped from the grave of undiscovered history and in my most paranoid moments they take the shape of unclean spirits shooting like roman candles from some pungent weed-strewn sepulcher right out of buffy the vampire slayer on the surface christian nationalism may seem about as dangerous as the skeletons that spring from the crypt at spook-a-rama courtesy of denos wonder wheel amusement park on coney island but that would be a serious miscalculation what cannot be denied is that christian nationalism in the age of trump and his disaster capitalism cabinet stalks the halls of the white house and the nations airwaves like marx and engels hobgoblin rudely awakened from the depths of oblivion former evangelical frank schaeffer states were at a time now when the naked lickspittle enablement of donald trump by his evangelical followers is more horrifying than ever schaeffer in boggioni 2020a he goes on to say when we come to this time of covid-19 overtaking our country a literal life and death issue we see two things very clearly one is the utter moral bankruptcy of this leader who pits himself against governors trying to save their people and the second is the utter moral bankruptcy of evangelical the white evangelical voter schaeffer in boggioni 2020a after being placed in charge of the coronavirus crisis the first action undertaken by mike pence was to form a prayer circle with evangelical supporters later the state of oklahoma held a statewide prayer day where megachurch pastors from all over the state appeared with gov kevin stitt r-ok to try and pray away the coronavirus and of course prayer circles popped up all over the country that would not be so bad if these titans of christian power were not part of a long tradition that was infamously anti-science rational- and religious-minded citizens as well as atheists and i count myself as among the former group have no immunity to this type of siege to this type of hobbesian war of all against all we have no maid of orlans armor of god that can protect us from the battlefield tactics of idolatrous trumplar knights from this inescapably salty theology creeping up our spine like a winter chill at a nova scotian fishing village and from this widespread winnowing of reason this twitterverse phrasemongering pitched from a mar-a-lago golf course caddy shack the trump cults that operate like impassioned yet enigmatic love functionaries for jesus and the 45th president regularly hand over our future to corporations which chomsky refers to as private tyrannies falcone 2015 a measure tantamount to having a spiritual death wish that will surely lead to self-destructive turmoil if not a fate more harrowing than even end times prophets can wrench from the moribund secrets hidden within ancient scrolls discovered on episodes of the naked archeologist the trump cult places in counterpoint the endless sweep of falsehoods about the coronavirus and the turbid unyielding faith of those who propagate such falsehoods see peters et al 2020a b while we lack at present a set of evidentiary standards for establishing the empirical existence of religious nationalism that goes beyond the invocation of religious motifs and symbols in politics grzymala-busse 2019 it seems reasonable to assert that religious nationalism is alive and well among trumps evangelical christian baseand its not pretty according to anna grzymala-busse 2019 religious nationalism especially in the christian world has shaped the very definition of legitimate citizenship delineating the nation and privileging some political actors and visions in making public policy obtaining electoral support and building states religion as it relates to behavior belief and belonging is extremely ramped up among evangelicals in terms of attending religious services evangelizing and taking part in communal religious activities such as bible study or prayer according to grzymala-busse 2019belief is an internalized and personal adherence to the doctrine and to the sacred the personal level and kind of faith acceptance of doctrine and relationship to the deity the sacred and religious teachings belonging or affiliation is a much weaker connection it may simply consist of self-identification or a nominal belonging to a given religiongrzymala-busse 2019 elaborates that where nationalism seeks political recognition and sovereignty for the nation religious nationalism does so for a nation first and foremost defined by religion she also points out correctly that referents of religion are the sacred and the transcendental nations are fundamentally mundane and political and i fully agree with the observation that whether religion and nation replace reconcile with or reinforce each other they are conceptually and empirically distinct additionally i would argue that intense activities such as bible study prayer proselytizing participating in religious pilgrimages and peregrinations contributing to religious publications and attending religious performances can create the contextually specific conditions of possibility for religious nationalism once the tribal conditions in american politics are met for the creation of a patriotic protestant temperament and once trump was elected reshuffled the government and began to communicate through twitter the tribal conditions were set in place twitter for trump is equivalent to the microphone at the lectionary of a church from here he can dictate the catechism for the days events the compatibility and mutual buttressing between the secular state and the evangelical community redound to the trump administration solidifying his christian base while accentuating the chasm between the illegitimate state and the true religious calling of the country to bring freedom to all nations of the world whether this includes imposing sanctions or bombing those countries back to the stone age the hebraic idea of people enjoying a special covenant with god has had an impact on northern irish afrikaner and israeli nationalismand also on us nationalism grzymala-busse 2019 the narratives of nations as divinely chosen people have merged religious and national identities in these countries and i would say that trumps moving of the us embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem certainly has secured the gratitude of many israelis and christians who believe that this action brings the world one step closer to armageddon and the coming of the messiahfor christians this would mean that jesus would establish the kingdom of god on earth and true christians who had repented their sins would receive heaven as their reward the pandemic for some is seen as a divine reset get ready the locusts having been swarming in east africa wildfires have ravaged australia and the golden trumpet was shaken free from angel moronis hand on top of the salt lake temple during a recent earthquake dias 2020 while it might be that those totemic entities known as sports have displaced religion as the chief factor in human group relationships in the usa religion is still going strong just witness how many americans today believe in angels some reports say 8 in 10 cbs news 2011 alt-right ethno-nationalist movements are identifying with nordic symbology just look at the symbols on alt-right shields during their confrontations with antifa are they seeking historical continuity with the inhabitants of ragnarok are they seeking the twilight of the gods where odin and the fenrir wolf will fight each other to the death and where loki will go against the aesir and fight heimdall to the death will tyr and the watchdog garm that guards the gates of hel kill each other stay tuned for a new season of the coronavirus dating game where participants will compete to find couples who are still alive in new york city clearly as grzymala-busse 2019 puts it religious nationalism thus reinforces popular religiosityand that religiosity becomes a marker of who belongs to the nation and who is a true member of the national community this statement could not be more apposite than in the usa today given the anti-muslim policies of trump and the hostility toward migrants immigrants and those seeking refugee status as a result of experiencing persecution in their own countries and of course there are other attitudes that accompany religious nationalism that are associated with cultural homogeneity and the preservation of national traditions these include natalism redistribution to members of the religious nation the preservation of national religious symbols and traditions grzymala-busse 2019 in contrast religious nationalism holds little affinity for increased diversity or change in national composition grzymala-busse 2019 religious nationalism thus correlates with high levels of hostility toward immigrants and other new groups that dilute the existing national identity grzymala-busse 2019 and of course there is an antipathy toward stem cell research abortion rights same-sex marriage divorce and other issues that are related to public policy conflicts between secular and religious authorities reinforce old borders as well as breed new borders and borders are prone to propagating violence give me a border and i will show you an enemy some evangelical christians who argue that christianity is under attack in the usa have motivated christian militias to prepare for a holy war against the deep state religion and nation god-talk and nation-talk all those contentious and toxic analogues tend over time to genuflect toward conflictif not outright violence that is the nature of this virus is it any wonder that the nrx movement refers to trump as the god-emperor who has the power and will to restore order to an immigrant-flooded nation under the thumb of a progressive media-academic complex  global jewry in neo-nazi-speak obrien 2020 obrien writes thatthe neoreactionary movement also known as nrx or dark enlightenment is a geeky subset of the racist misogynistic far-right that has festered in silicon valleys libertarian circles for over a decade especially within the cryptocurrency community its members revere peter thiel microdose lsd and gussy up totalitarian ideas with a pseudo-intellectualism that creates a moral pretext for them to undermine  engineer they might say  democracy obrien 2020 and to say that christian nationalism i would link this to the prosperity gospel ideology which is deeply imbricated in the logic of capitalism that is the ruling ideas which marx argued are inextricably braided to the ideas of the ruling class is plague-infested would be an insult to the power of the plague if the prosperity preachers are wincing from criticisms by fellow evangelicals they certainly know how to hide it as they continue to double down on their convictions their embrace of trumpwho before his presidency rarely ventured into spiritually loaded territoryhas been widely documented and commentaries that have offloaded scathing criticism are not difficult to find the evangelical community continues to preen itself as the spokesperson for the correct trajectory of todays political christianity and in doing so has proclaimed donald trump as the new christian messiah mclaren and jandri 2020a weve all seen their performances on television or in personthe flair the fanfare the bargain basement pageantry and the carnivalesque world of sensations have you ever seen a video of paula white speaking in tongues just watch some old reruns of robert tiltons show success-n-life and you might see where she got some of her tongue-twisting blubbering personally i prefer tiltons haut

there bobby lee and howdy jimbo have you tried jim bakkers silver sol liquid that he says can diagnose or cure coronavirus illness you know covid-19 its been effective against sars and hiv wiped them right out yes this type of religiously tainted ideological muck is suffused all around us a chuck e cheese attempt at creating a rarified air of sanctity a pantheon of kitsch religious props and an obsessive overlighting of the preacher on center stage clog dancing to the delicate harmony of a cheyenne frontier days tie-down rodeo act the whacky outpourings of the preacher declaimed before a wildly effusive live audience are often compelling in their allusive religiosity and emotional spiritualitythank you jesus praise godyet devastating in their theological barrenness pushing scripture beyond its semantic and semiotic limits betty put down that textbook on evolution ive been telling you since you were in kindergarten that human beings co-existed with dinosaurs and maybe even tamed some of the smaller ones and kept them as pets didnt you watch the flintstones when you were growing up noyou were too busy watching that communist mr rogers a splashy aestheticism stands in for what we might hope to be the sepulchral depths of an impassioned religious celebration preaching while enthralled with the sensation of being enthralledit all boils down to this we might profitably entertain this preponderance of delusion by asking the following questions could this spectacle be traced to the hebraic idea of the covenant which is revealed in the narratives of nations as divinely chosen people could it be tied historically to the advent of confessionalization or the protestant reformation see grzymala-busse 2019 could this type of spectacle be a twentieth-century remnant of biblical literalism or the detritus of an arch monasticism so spiritually claustrophobic that it finally led to a mass exodus to the cities could religious hysteria have slowly trickled down through the ages only to be rekindled in big tent revivalism and the eventual appearance of the praise-be-to-god-amening-hallelujahing grahams falwells robertsons swaggarts whites tiltons bakkers and others of this grandstanding self-serving ilk could it be that god is having a kayleigh mcenany-type meltdown or can the spectacle be traced to something more recent a sloppy metaphysics spun from the lecture halls of liberty university perhaps an overweening estimation of the power of suggestion an increased gray matter volume in the anterior cingulate cortex that can be correlated with inclinations toward social justice christian morality aristotelian ethics and liberation theology as opposed to those with increased gray matter volume in the amygdala which is part of the limbic system concerned with emotions that could be associated with alt-right adjacent evangelical christianity and political conservatism could it be the rise of radio shock jocks such as rush limbaugh whom president trump honored with the presidential medal of freedom indeed the pathological logic and demonic invective of rightwing broadcasters like rush limbaugh could be a contributing factor to the madness that surrounds us see mclaren and jandri 2020b dont you feel falwell must be one of limbaughs dittoheads cant you just picture jerry falwell jr in miami his scarf billowing in the night air as he drives his convertible into the parking lot of his favorite dance club listening to rush on the radio or simply put is the lock-step attachment of evangelicals to trump more of a case of just plain hypocrisy on the part of the contemporary evangelical leadership surely there is much more to the story and there is benjamin e park 2018 writes that during times of national or international crisis the power of religious rhetoric is a force that can always be counted on historically to focus on and reinvigorate the idea of american nationalism and in recent years its singular purpose has been to connect christianity with the republican party which can be seen in the moral majoritys ascension to the national stage in the 1980s and its connection to ronald reagan and the republican party park 2018 but we can see explicit religiosity and conservatism reaching back even earlier to the framers of americas federal government though the framers of americas federal government sought a distinction between denominational influence and state powerso much so that evangelical observers critiqued the constitution as a godless documentpartisans quickly capitalized on the power of religious rhetoric in political debates park 2018 in the age of revolutions which included both the french revolution and the american revolution key figures turned to biblical figures for inspiration according to park 2018 french philosopher jean-jacques rousseau for instance looked to moses as the premier example for turning a national body into a political body that lived together with stability and peace in germany friedrich schlegel argued for a symbiotic relationship between religion and politics park 2018 the french revolution caused american leaders to become concerned about the violence into which france descended promoting competing theologies of national belonging park 2018 and causing some politicians to rationalize french anarchy and violence as a result of a lack of religious devotion among its citizens the french revolution influenced americas concept of exceptionalism and placed christianity at the center of the idea of patriotism park 2018 there was fear that the french revolution was a threat to christianity globally and the influence of writers such as thomas paine became a concern of major significance since he was in favor of banishing religion from society and embracing secularism in its stead and embracing the enlightenment commitment to universal rationalism as a challenge to religious authority and authoritarianism consequently park 2018 writes that in a world of growing secularism the united states is presented as a last refuge for explicit christian devotion and in recent times burgeoning religious nationalism has even made possible one of the unlikeliest of alliances the loyalty between evangelical ministers and donald trump the ideological hieroglyphics directing trumps thinking are not hard decipher as bob cesca makes clear when he writesduring a presidency thats beyond satire no one really anticipated that trumps red hat militia would end up being a death cult but here we are the cults warped calculus is basically this trump will only be re-elected with a prospering economy but if covid-19 decimates the economy trump could lose so we have to save the economy literally at any cost even if it means we have to sacrifice older americans who typically vote republican cesca 2020trumps evangelical base seems to be adhering to their masters logic and besides kathaleen wall a member of the texas state republican executive committee and a candidate for texas 22nd congressional district is euphoric that the coronavirus has a silver lining its going to save more people than it kills this weekbecause abortion clinics in the state of texas have been closed chapman 2020a i am certain most of trumps salvation corps would agree the evangelical communitywho are less likely to be seen wearing a protective mask while shopping at the local piggly wiggly than their scientifically minded atheist brethrenhas received an upsurge of attention during the coronavirus crisis journalist catherine stewart disagrees that christian nationalism is equivalent to a religion since she notes the positive things many evangelicals and other christians are doing with respect to the coronavirus crisis she prefers to view christian nationalism as a political ideology that cloaks itself in religious rhetoric and as a political movement that put trump in power cited in chapman 2020b she writes the movement promotes an anti-science culture  that has obviously contributed to our inability collectively to address this crisis in an evidence-based fashion misinformation is rife in those hyper-conservative and highly politicized religious communities that were all in for trump chapman 2020b trump has boasted about his effectiveness in mobilizing the country against the coronavirus crisis but amanda terkel has shown the extent to which trump downplayed the seriousness of the coronavirus when it first showed up in the usa this timeline is worth quoting in fullon feb 10 he repeatedly predicted  at a meeting with governors at a campaign rally and in a fox business interview  that the coronavirus would no longer be a problem by april he then made this claim at least three more times a few days laternow the virus that were talking about having to do  you know a lot of people think that goes away in april with the heat  as the heat comes in typically that will go away in april were in great shape though we have 12 cases  11 cases and many of them are in good shape now feb 10looks like by april you know in theory when it gets a little warmer it miraculously goes away feb 10i really believe they are going to have it under control fairly soon you know in april supposedly it dies with the hotter weather and thats a beautiful date to look forward to feb 10we think and we hope based on all signs that the problem goes away in april feb 13theres a theory that in april when it gets warm  historically that has been able to kill the virus so we dont know yet were not sure yet feb 14i think its going to work out fine i think when we get into april in the warmer weather that has a very negative effect on that and that type of a virus feb 14on feb 10 there were 12 confirmed cases of covid-19 the illness caused by the coronavirus in the united states according to johns hopkins university now there are nearly 200000 and on tuesday the death toll in the us surpassed 3000 making the virus more deadly than the 911 terrorist attacks that reshaped much of american life who knows how many people will have died as the result of the coronavirus by the time this article sees print terkel 2020 trump has referred to the covid-19 as the corona flu minimizing its potential to wreak lethal havoc on the us population geriatric populations especially are at major risk mike davis 2020 reports that the death rate among those over 65 is 23 in italy and 18 in britain because of the shortage or unavailability of test kits containment in the usa is virtually impossible and without testing it is difficult to ascertain the size of the infected population davis 2020 reminds us that this virus is mutating as it courses through populations with different age compositions and acquired immunities davis 2020 also points out that even if the virus remains stable and little mutated its impact on under-65 age cohorts can differ radically in poor countries and amongst high poverty groups davis admonishes journalists and western governments for egregiously ignoring the threat of the coronavirus to the global poor he warns us that the only certainty is that rich countries and rich classes will focus on saving themselves to the exclusion of international solidarity and medical aid walls not vaccines could there be a more evil template for the future the usa was woefully unprepared for previous flu seasons and its hospitals were unable to cope with those who became stricken as a result of profit-driven cutbacks of in-patient capacity which resulted in a shortage of medical supplies and hospital bed availability davis notes 2020 that er conditions in such institutions are already unable to cope with seasonal infections so how will they cope with an imminent overload of critical cases already 380000 nursing home patients die every year from facilities neglect of basic infection control procedures nursing homes are very likely to become coronavirus hotspots davis 2020 underscores the unwillingness of big pharma to participate in the development of new antibiotics and antivirals remarking that of the 18 largest pharmaceutical companies 15 have totally abandoned the field they are more interested in producing profits by churning out tranquilizers pain killers and viagra davis warns that as the antibiotic revolution is rolled back old diseases will reappear alongside novel infections and hospitals will become charnel houses the role of the big lie in germanys wwii persecution of the jews is often attributed to goebbels and the nazis and was used to push long-standing anti-semitism into the unholy precinct of torture medical mutilation and mass executions jennifer rubin cited in burris 2020a condemns fox news for spreading what amounts to the big lie with respect to appropriate ways of reacting to the coronavirus she writesin short fox news  its anchors its contributors its panelists and its guests eg republican elected officials  have spread provably wrong information to its viewers on arguably the most important story in our lifetimes said rubin a large percentage of americans who form the trump cult and absorb his misleading information its like the flu plenty of tests get their misinformation reinforced by an outlet that seeks as its main goal to support the president rubin in burris 2020a clearly trump is no 1950s commando cody-type hero when it comes to a national crisis commando cody defended us from the radar men from the moon trump cannot make enough test kits available for the american public in fact he has clearly exacerbated the crisis by dint of his initial cavalier attitude toward it and yet even the medical experts have waffled on exactly how to fight the virus at first they said that americans do not need to wear masks then they changed their minds kenen and roubein 2020 report the agency said the virus spread through droplets from coughs and sneezes  but then warned about catching it from people with no symptoms or even from surfaces like subway turnstiles or metal shopping carts it said young people are at low risk  but the hospital beds and morgues of new york called that into question and while confusion has reigned supreme among the trump administration including its medical teams what is very clear is that the country should be practicing social distancing and residents should remain in their homes unless they are part of essential services to the community many trump supporters however are flagrantly disregarding the advice of medical experts since they want to show their loyalty to trump by downplaying the crisis hey let us go to the beach today honey its a nice sunny day thanks to the slavish veneration that they afford their man-child master in his war against america trumps cult followers are more receptive to the idea that the coronavirus should be called the china virus hey let us make the virus the fault of china to deflect blame away from trumps ineptitude in handling the crisis the alt-right and ethno-nationalist movements are going to be inundated with new applications for membership as a result of trumps racist dog whistle and all of this is occurring when the number of deaths in the usa has exceeded the us death toll during its invasion of vietnam when us lawmakers are cashing in on millions of stock transactions when school districts across the country are preparing to lay off 300000 teachers and when gun-toting michigan protestors pack into the statehouse calling for the governor to be hanged because of her stay-at-home law and lets not forget the stream of vile comments made by politicians who think its a fair trade-off to let the elderly and infirm die in order to preserve the economy dont they realize that the coronavirus also kills children take for example comments made by the repugnant antioch planning commission chairman ken turnage ii who felt compelled to compare the corona virus to a forest fire that burnsold trees fallen brush and scrub-shrub sucklings that drain resources adding that society will strengthen when the pandemic is all settled we would have significant loss of life we would lose many elderly that would reduce burdens in our defunct social security system health care cost once the wave subsided make jobs available for others and it would also free up housing in which we are in dire need of turnage wrote in the post that has since been deleted we would lose a large portion of the people with immune and other health complications i know it would be loved ones as well but that would once again reduce our impact on medical jobs and housing prieve 2020 these comments made all the more chilling as they appear delivered in a dispassionate pragmatic and businesslike manner echo aktion t4 the program for involuntary euthanasia in nazi germany a project of mass murder that took the lives of approximately 300000 people between 1939 and 1945 the program was based on eugenics theory racial hygiene and budgetary concerns certain people were selected as lebensunwertes leben unworthy of life or useless eaters and were killed by lethal injection gas or other means that we have politicians that would so easily condemn americas useless eaters to a suffocating death should serve as a warning that the unthinkable could happen again and this time in a country that brags about its concern for human rights the herd immunity argument is similar judith butler writesbecause the vulnerable are not deemed productive in the new quasi-aryan community they are not valued lives and if they die that is apparently acceptable since they are not imagined as productive workers but drains on the economy although the herd immunity argument may not make this claim explicitly it is there cited in yancy 2020 well i hope burning away the rotting old brush is worth it to mr ken turnage ii maybe he can make another killing on estate auctions charles sykes 2020 reports that feckless and fancy-free evangelical jerry falwell jrwho is as subtle about his adoration of trump as the hair and mustache dye on mypillow ceo mike lindellhas held in flagrant disregard the health of his students at his liberty university and by extension the health of all those with whom his students will come into physical contact falwell who has maintained that the coronavirus was a plot to hurt trump and hinted that it could be a bioweapon created by north korea or china to attack the usa has acted recklessly and irresponsibly despite the escalating coronavirus pandemic several thousands of students and professors returned to liberty universitys main campus while the rest of the nations campuses were locked downfalwell who is the president of the conservative christian school defending his decision by insisting that 99 percent of students are not at the age to be at risk and they dont have conditions that put them at risk that of course is factually untrue young people are not immune indeed last week the centers for disease control and prevention said more than a third of us patients ill enough to be hospitalized were ages 20 to 54 and of course even young people who do not become seriously sick can pass the disease to others sykes 2020 see palma 2020a sv date 2020 reports that trump has been trying to convince the american people that he has been a great wartime president who has done a miraculous job in protecting the country from the coronavirus having sold himself as a great business and military leader despite bankrupt casinos and bone spurs president donald trump faces his greatest challenge yet making americans forget the two months he dismissed concerns about a deadly pandemic as a hoax at the time of this writing trumps approval ratings are increasing demonstrating yet again that the american public have fallen victim to the swarmy cult of trump trumps evangelical followers can continue to bask in his carnivorous glory an immediate challenge to be reckoned with is the idea that the coronavirus can be cured by prayer or by being implored by a preacher to touch the television screen very likely close to the commercial break sky palma writesone of those people is evangelist kenneth copelandwho visited the white house in 2018 for a dinner trump held with a group of evangelical leaders earlier this month copeland went viral for a segment he did on this victory network channel where he asked his viewers to put their hands on their tv screens in order to receive gods divine protection against the coronavirus put your hand on that television set copeland said hallelujah thank you lord jesus he received your healing now say it i take it i have it its mine i thank you and praise you for it palma 2020b when the catholic church is searching for a miracle to prove sainthood it is well understood that finding such proof can take years even decades of careful investigation including scientific investigation do we really expect those desperate for a cure for say liver disease to find the holy spirit cascading through the neon xenon and argon gases that have miraculously combined into the phosphor gas that makes up the cells of their flat screen television set or by making such a statement am i admitting to an egregious lack of faith will my television set suddenly turn on by itself in the middle of the night with an urgent message from john the baptist that the second coming is now in progress since it is unlikely that those pastors under 60 have ever frequented pavilions for pulmonary patients my father died slowly and painfully of emphysema and hacking coughs and mounds of bloody mucous were a steady fixture of my childhood and adolescence they may feel that they have been granted divine immunity by the holy spirit or should they contract the disease and survive they can then make the boastful claim that their daily baptism in the word of god protected them from a painful death by calling for church services to continue they willingly subject themselves and the hundreds or thousands who pack their churches to the virus and this is true even if they hold their church services outdoors do pastors think outdoor winds do not carry christian spittle even if that spittle is born again reverend tony spell who defied an order from louisiana governor john bel edwards against large gatherings in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak because the good reverend spell believes the handling of the coronavirus pandemic is politically motivated was charged on six misdemeanor counts for his actions but hallelujah he is going to be advised in court by alabamas infamous judge roy moore even though moore is not licensed to practice law in louisiana moore believes that charging rev spell is a violation of the acknowledgment that god is sovereign in america gstalter 2020 and even though he has been charged reverend spell is back at it again intent on holding more services at his life tabernacle megachurch in baton rouge with the justification that jesus is a physicianpeoples hope is in the house of godif they do contract the virus if they have fears of the virus the church is more essential now than ever to pray with people to let them know there is a physician in jesus christ he is the healer come under you all that are weary and heavy-laden let me give you rest we were supposed to be at a million and a half body bags and were at 4800 so the narrative is false spell in boggioni 2020b reverend spell claims to believe the science surrounding covid-19 but then argues astonishingly that because he heard that some people are infected with the virus and recover without even being aware they had the virus this somehow justifies putting his parishioners and those with whom they may come into contact at serious risk for the good reverend spiritual healing supersedes medical safety precautions he also claims that his services are preventing incidents of domestic violence suicide and starvation spell in boggioni 2020b in fact rev death wish let-me-be-remembered-as-a-martyr-spell is advocating religious fanaticism calling for christians literally to die from the coronavirus in the name of religious freedom he proclaimed that those who prefer tyranny over freedom do not deserve freedom he also said that the bible teaches us to be absent from our bodies so we can be present with the lord  so like any revolutionary or like any zealot or like any pure religious person death looks to them like a welcomed friend palma 2020c does this sound to you a bit like a christianized version of the heavens gate cult whose leaders preached that suicide would allow them to exit their bodily containers in order to enter an alien spacecraft hidden behind the hale-bopp comet a nightmare scenario aaron bundy joins rev spell in a waco-like standoff this is an attack of the branch covidians  other megachurch pastors are intent on flouting social distancing guidelines during palm sunday and easter kelly burton a pastor at lone star baptist church in lone star texas wrote satans trying to keep us apart hes trying to keep us from worshipping together but were not going to let him win barone 2020 fundamentalist christians as a spiritual tribe frequently rally around the idea that they are being persecuted remember how indignant christian evangelicals felt about being persecuted by the vile evil satanic greeting of happy holidays because they felt it was an attack on merry christmas and christianity in general fox news played this persecution to the hilt trump bragged to a conservative student group turning point usa that he had given the right to speak the words merry christmas back to americans after it was falsely claimed that the white houses national christmas tree was renamed the holiday tree under president obama does anyone remember when in 2003 france criticized the us plan to invade iraq and elected officials in the us house of representatives decided to rename french fries freedom fries fortunately im not ancient enough to recall when during world war i sauerkraut was renamed liberty cabbage and german measles became known as liberty measles if evangelical christians want to understand religious persecution in a more serious vein they can certainly find valid examples of the persecution of christianswhere those faithful to their beliefs have been exiled or tortured or burned alive at the stake but the idea that christians are being persecuted for having to hold their church services onlineas most college professors have been required to do with teaching their classes during this pandemicis stretching the notion of persecution to absurd proportions mclaren 2020 but this christian persecution complex does serve a purpose evangelical congregations can now identify as martyrswith those christians thrown to the lions in ancient rome by emperor nero but seriously we are talking here about throwing christians to their laptops so that they are forced to watch their pastors speak in tongues on their computer screens how traumatizing is that have the faithful forgotten that you can now be healed by touching a tv screen while a church service is in progress and im sure god would not discriminate against computer screens just ask evangelical preacher kenneth copeland havent these evangelicals heard of cybertemples and churches and online prayer chapels in networked environments that can be customized to any religious belief system yes be wary of technology but do not be too fearful that watching a church service in lieu of the real thing is the digital equivalent to being a loser is there anything worse in trumpworld than not winning the public release of the apple iphone was regarded as the jesus phone when it first came out in 2007 and then for those with more conservative inclinations there is the flip-phone sometimes called the kosher phone that has no internet to tempt the user into entering the world of sinthe original model being the lg vx5500 which was released in 2008 ammon bundy of the malheur militia who once led an armed takeover of a wildlife refuge in oregon has encouraged idaho residents to defy the social distancing orders at a public meeting he told the audience that the coronavirus is a relatively low-risk situation and added that if nine out of 10 people were dying it still does not justify the taking of rights humphrey 2020 bundy warned that he was willing to use weapons to defend the rights of businesses to remain open during the pandemic humphrey 2020 and you can be sure that white supremacist militia members all over the country are all on board with this sentiment perhaps they frequent the same shooting ranges as their fellow evangelicals where they can share information on the best firearms to have during a pandemic hey you rookies avoid the five-shot snub-nose j-frame revolvers they have heavier trigger pulls and a shorter sight radius and lack the accuracy of revolvers with larger frames get your asses in gear on this okay pandemic preppers arm up already lawmakers in michigan are wearing bulletproof vests to the statehouse to protect themselves from duck dynasty lookalikes carrying assault rifles youve got them running scared bobby lee ever since you were knee-high to a grasshopper ive been telling you that the day will come when you need to soak the flag of freedom in the blood of tyrants hey bubba why not use your 1200 cash payment to invest in an ar-15 with a scope in the meantime most of the money in the governments economic stabilization plan will be used by the federal reserve to buy up us treasury and other bonds in order to prevent a collapse of the international financial system and they will be lending money directly to corporationsa frightening prospect but of course all of this drama around putting people at risk of the coronavirus is supposedly for the benefit of the younger generation who will otherwise die and according to trump many will die of suicide should the economy collapse besides its a chance to show that born again christians are not wimps trump has now tacked to the left in so far as stressing the deadly seriousness of the virus yet immediately afterwards he tacked to the right again by saying that we need to open the country up again for business some people are questioning if trump has business ties to the drug hydroxychloroquine or if hes onto something that has escaped the attention of the medical establishment after all hes a billionaire and in his own words a stable genius perhaps trump would be willing to attend a service at the river church in tampa where as burris 2020b notes pastor rodney howard-browne has denounced social distancing claiming that he can cure the coronavirus just like he did with the zika virus which still exists howard-browne promised his flock that he would never close the church regardless of what scientists and doctors say burris 2020b howard-browne is insistent that he has a cure for the covid-19we are not stopping anything ive got news for you this church will never close the only time the church will close is when the rapture is taking place we brought in 13 machines that basically kill every virus in the place and uh if somebody walks through the door its like it kills everything on them if they sneeze it shoots it down at like 100 mph itll neutralize it in split seconds we have the most sterile building in i dont know all of america burris 2020b amen so let me ask this if the evangelical leaders are so sure that their faith will protect them will they volunteer to be the last ones to receive the vaccine when it is available if we learn one thing from this pandemic it is that the us health care system ripped to shreds by tax breaks for the rich privatization austerity capitalism and the rise of the gig economy needs to be replaced by socialized medicine the whole country needs socialismand if people cannot see this then it just shows how powerful a hegemon the media industrial complex is as it continues to create the necessary illusions that so far have worked effectively in keeping the american people from mounting a popular ground-level challenge to the overall capitalist system here the media serve as a self-replicating filibustering mechanism that keeps the public in a state of endless debate over whether or not there are viable alternatives to the current capitalist system creating a pendulum of inertia at both ends of the argument it appears that many christian nationalists formulate the pandemic in a way that metaphysically juxtaposes nature to history producing a manichean duality of good versus evil a social universe overpopulated by metaphysical reflections of a mystified world they understand the pandemic not as historically mediated by circumstances engendered in a world that is both real and law-governedie as in the chronic tendency of capitalism toward overproductionand that can be explained dialectical analysis but as trapped within a chamber pot history in which the laws of nature remain static timeless and stagnant in this way the virus can be interpreted as an indication of gods wrath against those who support abortion or who are homosexual and those in the deep state who are working to undermine trump and setting up cannibal-pedophile rings underneath dingy strip mall pizza joints an attachment to this type of paranoid ideology clearly is preventing evangelical christians from understanding the virus in an historical and materialist mannerfrom the vantage point of a deep realismand thus promoting relief from spiritual constipation does not the basis of the spiritual reside in the materialin flesh blood and brain im not taking a physicalist position heresince i think it is very likely that consciousness exists beyond the material and is mediated that is refracted not reflected in along and through the brain what i am saying is that evangelicals appear in many cases to have adopted a creed of thought that antiseptically separates the general from the particular and the universal from the specific and conceives of dichotomies ie fact versus value from an abstract and metaphysical perspective but binary oppositionslet us say male and female black and white and up and downare not oppositions only in a metaphysical or idealistic sense but in the real world of scarcity they exist as distinctions trapped within dependent hierarchies capitalism constrains labor whiteness constrains blackness maleness constrains femaleness and so onvia capitalisms institutionalized structures and their normalizing functions attached to racism sexism division of labor judicial system etc we must wake up to the fact that we make ourselves our self and social formation in accordance with wider laws of nature and in so doing we are dependent upon laws of necessity external nature imposes necessity upon human beings but there is after all absolute necessity and contingent necessity necessity is absolute only in relation to the needs of society which are historically specific we live in a capitalist society and we necessarily have to sell our labor power for a wage unless we own the means of production in other words needs are contextually specific they are contingent upon the situation at hand ie mode of production geopolitics existential challenges so that contingency and necessity have to be understood dialectically not as eitheror but as bothand all things are relative to the necessity that produces them yet evangelical preachers declaim messianically that humankind is universally born of the spirit and propagate the falsehood that contingent phenomena such as the coronavirus are in reality divine plagues cast upon humankind for the sin of homosexuality abortion fornication political correctness and multiculturalism in this way for evangelicals faith in the transcendent supernatural power of jesus must supersede science humans are perceived as powerless if they decline to pray to the god of prosperity here science is glibly supplanted by a metaphysical abstraction but prayer should not be done in the spirit of helplessness we cannot pray and then abdicate our responsibility for achieving what we are praying for because we are denying the difficult work ahead in saving the country from covid-19 prayer can serve as a smokescreen that hides the class struggle and the socialist structures that are necessary to create a world prepared for disasters such as the coronavirus pandemic i am not denigrating the power of prayer here since i endorse the following statements of the galileo commissionno human intellectual activity including science can escape the fact that it has to make assumptions that cannot be proven using its own methodology ie absolute presuppositionsthe prevalent underlying assumptions or world model of the majority of modern scientists are narrowly naturalist in metaphysics materialist in ontology and reductionist-empiricist in methodologythis results in the belief that consciousness is nothing but a consequence of complex arrangement of matter or an emergent phenomenon of brain activitythis belief is neither proven nor warrantedin fact there are well-documented empirical phenomena that contradict this belief galileo commission 2020 this is not an argument against materialism as a bona fide teslified ecopedagogicalized social scientist i rely on materialist analysis but i can affirm that there are reasons to move beyond materialist explanations for understanding and appreciating certain phenomena this is not prophecy television gobbledygook speech i remain committed to an historical materialist analysis of capitalism and still at the same time consider it possible that prayer may have some effects that cannot be explained by traditional paradigms of science see mclaren and jandri 2020b but during a pandemic prayer should not be a substitute for medical research and prayer circles cannot replace medical treatment and religious bullshit cannot take the place of rational adjudication and dialectical reasoning paula jerry and franklin are you listening you might want to order some books on liberation theology or join a paulo freire or thomas merton reading group im sure they will encourage you to pull up a chair attend a sunday service by dr william

america latina  risk perception and covid-19 liliana cori fabrizio bianchi ennio cadum carmen anthonj   the call for articles for the international journal of environmental research and public health special issue research about risk perception in the environmental health domain was proposed at the beginning of 2020 as part of multidisciplinary efforts to understand the complex interactions between people and the environment oftentimes research on environment and health sheds lights on the fact that the prevention or limitation of risks to people and biodiversity often arises in contexts that are conflictual from a social and scientific point of view especially when anthropogenic pressures are at stake we had the ambition of observing ongoing improvements in risk perception studies we included the different perspectives of policymakers citizens and stakeholders to reinforce on the one hand the validity of the research results and on the other the usability of the results in decision making all along the governance cycle the study of risk perception has in fact become increasingly relevant with the recognition that beliefs knowledge values and attitudes influence not only decisions but also behaviors and directly the exposure of people to environmental pressures however the ongoing covid-19 pandemic modified the whole picture around us and is shaking the foundations of public health governance all over the world as the weeks go by the impossibility of imagining the scope of the consequences we will face in the near future is emerging this notwithstanding researchers are challenged by informing and supporting authorities with acquired knowledge and practical implications what seems possible today is to try to understand public reactions applying established theories of risk perception research to covid-19 and reflecting on the utilization of this knowledge to improve health risk communication build trust and contribute to a collaborating governance the current interdisciplinary research and reviews on risk perception in the environment and the health domain will form the core of the special issue in progress but the challenge posed by the pandemic is a proper emerging issue that must be tackled and examined the connections between the environment and health issues must be explained as there is in fact a substantial difference between infectious diseases such as covid-19 and non-communicable diseases caused by the impact of pollution on human health infectious diseases have a single necessary cause although sometimes not sufficient and spread with deterministic mechanisms while non-communicable ones have multiple causes which are usually neither necessary nor sufficient and act through a causation network if the distal causes of the emergence of the novel sars-cov-2 are to be found in climate change ecosystem changes or migrations then the main causes that influence the covid-19 epidemic are all the factors that facilitate contagion these factors include the presence of outbreaks among people travelling contacting each other as well as many social cultural psychological and environmental cofactors that play an important role directly or as effect modifiers within only three months the covid-19 pandemic has become the most severe global health challenge since the spanish flu one century ago 1 the novel coronavirus has already reached 213 countries areas or territories with cases around the world with over 3 million confirmed cases and more than 200000 deaths status quo on april 28 600 cet 2 while some governments have been implementing drastic measures to slow down the spread such as severe travel restrictions the closing of borders lockdowns curfews and the limitation of personal contact to family plus one non-family member only others have decided to take softer actions or mainly voluntary measures along with the pandemic fear spreads and grows this is not a novel phenomenon the reason is traceable in risk communication theory found in the history of public health and confirmed also by the current developments of covid-19 by now the majority of people around the world have heard of the coronavirus and of the need to practice hand hygiene and social distancing to prevent its spread but while some individuals strictly adhere to the restrictions others ignore or delay the governments rules and mingle in crowds in public places at beaches or in their homes the fact that individuals in these times of joint challenge act so differently indicates that the risk perception relating to this novel virus strongly differs between different places and individuals this means moreover that risk perception is potentially a strong modifier of the epidemic evolution since it can influence the number of new positive cases the coronavirus outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the world health organization on 30 january 2020 and since then many governments have declared a state of emergencyallowing the reallocation of resources and for drastic measures to be taken war metaphors are commonly used by many governments and media the global community and national and local governments fight against and hope to win the war against the pandemic 34 a us navy hospital ship with a 1000 bed capacity was deployed in new york city the new epicenter of covid-19 as a response to the pandemic 5 this makes this metaphor come to lifeand increases the fear further in the multitude of discussions and articles on different media we find its possible to find all the typical ingredients of a time of epidemics accusations plots exploitation obscure interests misinformation and misbelief there are a few that try to reassure too much and many that demand collaboration and rationality in facing the complex scenarios that no one can understand in an exhaustive way never-forgotten anxieties re-emerge from the distant plague and closer smallpox past when a novel disease rapidly appears crossing borders and approaching worlds that seemed very far away one by one the elements that characterize the perception of risk emerge and should be considered if the management of risk communication by governments is to be based on rationality and consciousness risk perceptions refer to peoples intuitive evaluations of hazards that they are or might be exposed to 6 including a multitude of undesirable effects that people associate with a specific cause 7 risk perceptions are interpretations of the world the evaluation of risks is influenced by numerous individual and societal factors and different social cultural and contextual factors influence risk perception these go beyond the classic hazard attributes and are based on experiences beliefs attitudes judgments misconceptions and feelings as well as wider social cultural and institutional processes 8 although risk perceptions act as triggers for precautionary action 9 the engagement in preventive health behaviors is not merely determined by the awareness of objective health risks but also influenced by health beliefs and specific health cognitions 10 the results of an extensive set of research has allowed us to highlight some key features explaining the perception of risk and its influence on decision-making familiarity controllability voluntary exposure potential catastrophic equity the immediacy of danger and the level of knowledge 11 according to this approach the perception of risk is the subjective judgment that people create regarding the characteristics severity and way in which the risk is managed one of the key elements is the sense of outrage and indignation that the risk produces which multiplies anxiety and quickly runs through society in fact sandman et al 12 propose a definition of risk as a product between hazard and outrage the risk is intended as a probabilistic assessment produced comparing the probability that an event occurs and the seriousness of the potential damage it is largely influenced by outrage which constitutes then a key element in capturing or understanding the estimated risk which concerns both the nature of the risk and its management the elements that increase or mitigate fear and risk perceptions have been extensively examined and discussed 13 fear is inherent in the covid-19 characteristics and is not completely manageable especially with generic calls to dominate fear and an excess of public concern around the difficult management of such a complex problem cannot be avoided thinking ahead and about the future our current fear and perception of risk can serve as a useful tool to promote increased preparedness and improved response by the health sector moreover on a larger scale fear can promote consciousness and care towards the planet following the philosopher hans jonas declaration that an authentic responsibility towards the future implies an heuristic of fear fear that is rooted in our biological baggage can be used as a tool that drives us to prudence in order to ensure the inviolable obligation to inform and the right to know conventional and social media offer direct updates on the number of infected people and each new death accompanied by the number of citizens subjected to containment measures this number grows and rapidly reaches the whole population each death takes on enormous weight and increases fear and bewilderment in addition the world health organization who issues daily reports with the necessary level of detail to assess not only the overall extent of the crisis but also its progression the reports show the resident population the number of confirmed cases per day and the cumulated number of cases the number of deaths per day and the cumulative lethality per day and other information including suspected cases and the trend curves of the epidemic 14 the calculable lethality rate using not sick cases but all infected cases as a denominator which fortunately are or will become partially ill could provide important information on the different time periods if the rate is true and not underestimated as it is reasonably likely to be since not all positive cases are recorded the increase in general mortality and the admissions to hospitals in high intensity of care unit would be more appropriate for understanding the dynamic of the epidemic using the case fatality rate cfr as a proxy in italy at the high point of the epidemic the cfr was over 123 slightly higher than in spain 97 and france 86 but much higher than that registered in the us 28 and most other countries beyond the in-depth analysis of the causes the absolute number of deaths creates a great concern especially when those deaths are concentrated in a limited geographical space and in confined places such as nursing homes residences for the elderly or hospitals 15 there is a macabre juggle with information that is not found in any other field of health seasonal flu epidemics cause more than 10 times the number of infections of coronavirus but have a lethality that is 100 times lower partly because of the high immunization coverage repetitive and expected events usually do not arouse fear but if anything apprehension more concern arises when the causes are not explained in the case of covid-19 a good spatialtemporal contextualization is needed to support the definition of scenarios for the post-epidemic phase a stop and go strategy as envisaged by imperial college london seems possible particularly if we consider the need for flexible measures and limited knowledge of both the duration of the infectious capacity and identification of acquired immunity 16 related parameters would be useful in guiding decision-makers in their choices 17 the role of the factors identified abovevoluntariness knowledge and trustappears crucial in planning communication actions suitable for the next delicate phase in order to communicate strategies we need to evaluate the application and effectiveness of different protective measures for different age groups and individuals with different health conditions the active involvement of communitieswhich are showing extraordinary creative mobilization and support skillscan transform the sense of outrage into an assumption of personal and collective responsibility moreover knowledge entails the growth of collective awareness the increase in self-efficacy and the empowerment in contributing to political decision-making mutual trust and the reliance on local communication networks between peers could exponentially increase the possibilities of applying flexible measures attention to the aspects of equity and the respect for rights and privacy should be maximized and the war metaphors should be shifted towards health- and wellbeing-promoting concepts linked to healing collaboration and solidarity 18  preparation of a radiology department in an italian hospital dedicated to covid-19 patients anna ierardi maria bradford wood j antonio arrichiello nicola bottino laura bracchi laura forzenigo maria andrisani carmela valentina vespro cristian bonelli amel amalou evrim turkbey b baris turkbey i giuseppe granata antonio pinto giacomo grasselli nino stocchetti gianpaolo carrafiello   the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic began in late 2019 in wuhan china the outbreak is due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection 1 italy had precious little time to prepare any response to the covid-19 pandemic this response is led by the italian national government in coordination and synchrony with local or regional governments and hospitals the major hot spot of covid-19 patients have thus far been in the north of italy especially in the region of lombardy to date the total of infections in italy is  215000 of which 80723 are in lombardy 2 over 10 million people live in lombardy region forming more than one-sixth of italys population 3 within lombardy milanos metropolitan area is the largest in italy and the third most populated functional urban area in the entire european union 2 as it is now well known from the clinical course of covid-19 available in the guidelines and the literature the most severe cases develop acute respiratory conditions that require intensive care unit icu admission although only a few of those infected require icu the need for icu beds increases exponentially during the upward trajectory of the pandemic outbreak curve in this scenario the demand for critical care in the northern region of italy exceeded supply raising significant practical and ethical concerns in the process to overcome this important issue within 2 weeks from concept to opening a new hospital was arranged this is not a camp hospital or acute triage fever clinic but a real brick and mortar hospital focused on intensive care and intensive triage of the critically ill cases two pavilions located on two floors of an exhibition area were made eligible to host all the equipment and staged care triage settings of the ic ward all the services laboratories radiology etc necessary to an independent functioning of over dedicated ic 200 beds were allocated in the same building with a strategic position this location minimized cross-contamination and interactions with non-covid-19 activities and staff procedural and staff sequestration that mimics the geographic sequestration of such an effort is requisite to successful nosocomial containment of pandemic covid-19 radiology is one of the frontline specialities in the clinical service because of its role in diagnosis and follow-up of patients a multidisciplinary symphony of coordinated policies infrastructure communications flow and staff awareness were harmonized to enable a successful mission to fight covid-19 the present article describes the logistical setting strategy and organization for radiology services in a new dedicated covid-19 critical care and critical triage hospital a well-equipped dedicated hospital facility to deal with covid-19 patients with adequate protective equipment and policies for healthcare workers is the key to successful delivery of safe and optimal public health care in the setting of a pandemic the hospital was designed to be practically a self-contained and self-sufficient establishment that can meet most of its daily needs with only essential and limited contact with the outside world via predetermined limited channels for such critical pipelines as nutritional services and other supply chains basic requirements that needed to be defined included appropriate cleaning practices adequate floor space for beds adequate ideally negative one-pass ventilation for isolation rooms and procedure rooms adequate isolation facilities for airborne droplet contact isolation and protective environment with well-defined and disseminated standard operating procedures sops and finally a regulated and rational traffic flow to minimize exposure or cross-contamination of high-risk patients and facilitate patient and clinical material transport the hospital composed of 205 icu beds includes 2 floors is divided in red and green units or zones fig 1 red zones are completely dedicated to host beds for covid-19 patients ventilators and devices dedicated to ic management beds are contained in modules from a to h as shown in the map fig 2 in each module 7 or 14 beds are located depending on floor with controlled access and unified connections to each other barrier nursing practices and protective isolation facilities are present to minimize risk of nosocomial infections beds are sequestered from each other as much as possible to avoid cross-contamination in case of different strains of covid-19 or differing superinfections with more standard microorganisms part of the radiological services is also located in red zones like ct us etc laundry access for patients and patient triage is all located in the red zone also green zones include access for healthcare workers changing rooms offices and administrative area and some support services such a staged space designation is analogous to the ante-room concept for staged doffing ppe whereby the doffing occurs in staged locations in very specific sequences from very dirty to less dirty to more likely clean in order to minimize human error and exposures doffing is done with a doffing watcher whose sole assignment is to watch the doffers and donners for human breaches in technique or sequence likewise it is wise to designate staff as coordinators for traffic control and communications of transport issues and educators for dissemination of sops and new policies and practicing and runners whose sole responsibility is to transfer equipment or supplies from a clean supply or storage space to a dirty procedure room along predetermined and pre-practiced chains of transfer and chains of communication green zones as illustrated in the map fig 1 are represented by an external perimeter surrounding the red zones four entry points are present equipped with protective personal equipment ppe each red module is equipped with doffing points from which it s possible to go out from the red zone attention to donning and doffing education practicing training and standard sops is critical to safe operation of such a covid-19 facility radiology unit is present in both red and green zones in the red zones are located ultrasound us machines one for each module portable radiography is repeatable and easy to decontaminate and serves as the mainstay imaging tool for emergency departments and inpatient settings therefore portable radiography equipment is present in predefined locations a leaded glass barrier similar to grocery store lines may serve as an extra barrier for staff especially in the field acute care or screening settings two ct machines are present one for each floor they are located in the red zone and closer to the triage to permit immediate access to the ct room even for patients just admitted a little room with a workstation is located closer to the ct room but staffs are encouraged to do remote communications remote interpretations and remote consults whenever possible in the green zone a radiology office is present in which 2 workstations are available to allow radiologists and residents to interpret images do reconstructions make a report and be accessible via remote communications to the red zone staff a workstation dedicated to artificial intelligence ai is also available to permit studies on chest x-rays and ct scans for research purposes and point of care applications of novel approaches to multi-parametric data integration all with regulatory clearances and a network of multinational partnerships as directed by government policies guidelines and procedures surgical masks must be worn by anyone who leaves home overall shoe covers clogs and surgical masks are mandatory throughout operations even in the green zone before entry into the red zone special ppe must be worn screening may occur upon entry to the hospital entry into the green zone or entry into the red zone all healthcare workers involved should have extensive knowledge and training in the correct donning and doffing steps along with appropriate and safe disposal of ppe this requires training and practice sessions for these critical steps and procedures videos and guidance during the donning and doffing were dedicated for every operator and each operator was trained by senior mentor until heshe became fully independent with verifiable metrics and certification by a mentor written protocols should be available and posted in every donning and removing room and on hand for all operators and staff careful hand hygiene correct wearing of protective equipment and strict adherence to infection control procedures ensured continued and complete compliance non-powdered latex-free gloves should be used by all operators eye protection and face shielding should be used gowns should be long-sleeved and made of non-absorbable fluid-resistant materials the same gown should not be worn for all patients in case gowns are not available waterproof aprons should be used the who recommends the use of particulate respirators n95 or ffp2 or equivalent for contact and airborne precautions 4 ppe shortages should be met timely with a coordinated approach and plan endorsed by hospital epidemiology experts to minimize risk to staff and patients although beyond the scope of this report this may be the most critical piece of the puzzle in some pandemic settings close communication with epidemiology is encouraged shifts are employed to provide around the clock coverage for radiologists interventional radiologists and technologists with as many services as possible performed remotely via teleradiology technology workloads should be matched whenever possible to the workforce realizing this may be impossible during a pandemic setting efforts to limit around the clock work should be made to promote eating sleeping and daily activities to allow for minimization of fatigue induced errors or breaches in techniques for example whenever possible teams of physicians nurses and technologists should work together or as staffing allows in staggered shifts as teams in order to minimize potential transmission between teams or from one patient to many staff all at once careful attention to avoid group mealtimes or coffee times is made using social distancing guidelines since mask removal is often required for such activities which creates vulnerabilities for transmission drinking straws are encouraged and 2 m distancing is encouraged whenever possible regardless of mask use staff who enter new spaces are encountered with screening queries upon entry to ensure the critical in-person requirement for their entry the hospital is dedicated to bedridden patients therefore only portable x-ray machines are present fourteen portable radiography systems are available for each floor red zone portable equipment remains in the red zone they are never brought out technicians are usually working in their office in the green zone and they may be called by a phone call directly by the red zone anaesthesiologists or critical care staff anaesthesiologists designate the necessary x-ray studies and indicate the number and the exact locations of the patients module beds number etc radiology technologists usually 2 may access the red zones through the changing room where they can donn ppe via a ppe donning sop a station to process images and put them online in the pacs is present in the red zone therefore after taking the x-ray within a few minutes images are online and all specialists including radiologists may visualize them radiologists are usually in the green zone and may produce a report from the workstation in each module a dedicated us machine is present fig 3 each fully equipped with 3 probes us machines may be used by anaesthesiologists for vessel image-guided puncture for central vein accesses for catheter placement or arterial access for blood gas analysis cardiologists andor anaesthesiologists may use the probe dedicated to cardiac ultrasonography or echocardiography a convex probe is available for thorax or abdomen fast us examinations usually performed by non-radiological specialists or by the interventional radiology team for assessment for bedside procedures if necessary the radiologist may be called to perform a dedicated us if a specific diagnostic question arises recently lung ultrasound has rapidly become a tool for monitoring of patients stricken by the novel covid-19 helping in clinical decision making and reducing the use of both chest x-rays and computed tomography ct 5 us may provide a rapid continuous and real-time assessment of peripheral lung physiology such as fluid in peripheral infiltrates interlobular septal thickening or any adjacent effusions which may change dynamically ct scanners are located in red zones as described above fig 4 the ct room is equipped with a ventilator intercoms and cameras for dedicated monitoring and patient and staff communications during ct execution the pump injector and any other room surfaces are completely covered during exams at any time multidisciplinary decision making and team assessments may occur preferably remotely with anaesthesiologist critical care staff and diagnostic andor interventional radiologists to discuss clinical indications or findings decision making is always a team effort once the decision is made that a ct scan is clinically indicated after donning ppe a radiologist and technologist may enter the red zone radiologists have the opportunity to decide and protocol the exam images are immediately available on hospital pacs for all the specialists in charge reports may be done directly in the red zone or when the radiologist will be back in the green zone office exchange between zones is governed by strict adherence to sops a commercial disposable portable isolation bag was designed for outpatients by radiologists national institutes of health with cvico medical solutions usa fig 5a b the isolation bag use in any patient who is not intubated will allow for oxygen exchange and minimization of viral load on contaminated surfaces air exchange rates and negative flow ideally should be closely analyzed prior to implementation of such facilities to ensure that adequate passive air exchange is allowed in between patients especially important in the event that covid-19 status is uncertain or for standard practices outside of the red zone or in outpatient or acute care facilities in this specialized hospital built for isolation patients this device may not be necessary but in future projects and managing non-intubated patients this may permit a ct area to be cleaner when not isolated closer to the ct room a suite equipped with a modern portable c arm is available fig 6 the logistics are strategic because after execution of ct scan an interventional radiology procedure may sometimes be immediately indicated such proximity minimized patient transfers and staff exposure risk an important concept must be kept in mind all the devices in the red zone should never leave it nor be brought in the green zone therefore interventional radiologists together with technologists prepared small dedicated kits for each procedure in the green area a little collection of spare materials is provided catheters microcoils drainages guidewires etc interventional radiologists may access to the room equipped with portable c-arm only after donning ppe since located in the red zone the kits available in red zone include materials and devices for embolization inferior vena cava filter deployment pharmacological and mechanical fibrinolysis percutaneous drainage deployment thoracentesis paracentesis chest tube placement and central vein access deployment for hybrid procedures us machines may be taken from one of the modules but must undergo strict decontamination sop in between patients despite the red zone location such a dedicated facility is a costly endeavor indeed however such as effort should be carefully analyzed with cost-effectiveness and cost-utility metrics that have long-term comparisons and outcomes analyses based upon the economic realities of the pandemic the cost metrics should factor in the downstream cost of lives saved quality adjusted life years saved pain averted and intact family units toward the strength of the fabric of society at large each transmission averted by such a dedicated covid-19-specific facility has the potential to avoid a long-term admission ventilator use and resources required for that admission and each of the contacts for that covid-19 transmission with an r  2 in a cramped and mixed healthcare facility without dedicated team focused on isolation efforts the staff patients and processes might unfortunately mix together this could allow the virus to spread rapidly potentially infecting health care workers and patients and taking health care workers out of the care team this might occur when that team is already stressed to the max and short staffed with demand outpacing supply across multiple fronts of staff equipment and testing the infection rate is likely much higher for health care workers where a single infected worker could also spread the virus to more than 22 naive patients thus the downstream costs of a transmission in the healthcare setting are difficult to measure thus each and every averted transmission saves the healthcare system immensely when confronting a pandemic faceless enemy focal investments toward a dedicated facility have immense economic benefits that make it overwhelmingly cost effective especially in the early phases of a pandemic outbreak curve whose end remains blurry and ill-defined earlier economic restart possibly made possible by fewer nosocomial transmissions and ideal and early critical care is also hugely impactful economically such investments may be made by proactive and forward-thinking stakeholders and leaders in radiology and policy-making a dedicated facility for the management and triage of patients with covid-19 clusters the expertise and tools requisite for optimal care when resources allow for a dedicated icu facility to be built this enables team sequestration and collective isolation of staff teams processes patients and equipment the construction of this covid-19 hospital also allowed relatively easy transfers to and from other icus of the milano area with strict sops an environment completely dedicated to isolated covid-19 patients permit a better management of these patients and resources and promotes containment within the healthcare facility that must care for these covid-19 patients during a pandemic outbreak such prophylactic biocontainment is cost-effective and provides value for the investment in the long term even if it is a resource-intensive affair in the short term repeated practice sessions training and standardized and epidemiologically rational sops and preparation are paramount many hours spent preparing will save lives as we prepare for this global team battle

care in response to the covid-19 tsunami of suffering lukas radbruch felicia knaul marie liliana de lima cornelis de joncheere afsan bhadelia   coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has brought a tsunami of suffering that is devastating even well resourced countries the disease has wreaked havoc on health systems and generated immense losses for families communities and economies in addition to the growing death toll patients caregivers health-care providers and health systems can benefit from the extensive knowledge of the palliative care community and by taking heed of long-standing admonitions to improve access to essential medicines particularly opioids for the relief of breathlessness and pain1 2 3
 for low-income and middle-income countries lmics the covid-19 pandemic is likely to be even more severe than in high-income countries there will probably be a high burden of covid-19 in settings where there are weak health-care systems lack of access to clean water and disinfectants poor outbreak preparedness severe shortages in personal protective equipment ppe and medical technology challenges in enforcing physical distancing regulations and reliance on informal employment in such settings it is expected that patients with severe covid-19 who are unable to access the limited supply of intensive care resources or hospital beds will suffer and die at home where they would be cared for by family members without ppe and access to relevant information training or palliative care resources these caregivers will probably become infected and spread the disease additionally if resources are reallocated to respond to covid-19 patients with other life-limiting conditions could find themselves pushed out of their health-care settings with reduced access to opioid medication during the covid-19 pandemic access to essential palliative care at end-of-life including bereavement support will be limited in the face of high demands in all countries there will be increased isolation and suffering for palliative care patients and those who are bereaved4 5 strict physical distancing regulations to slow disease transmission mean that patients who die from covid-19 will usually be without loved ones by their side who in turn will be unable to say goodbye or undertake traditional grieving rituals4 6 providers of palliative care including private hospices will require additional human and financial resources basic palliative care training to all medical and nursing students has been the recommendation of the palliative care community for many years1 and had it been heeded the health-care workforce would be more prepared for this pandemic online training is available to help prepare medical personnel to provide some palliative care at all levels of care now is the time to insist on rapid capacity-building for clinicians7 8 in symptom control and management of end-of-life conversations3 9 smartphones and telemedicine can facilitate at-home activities supported by health-care professionals and volunteers without physical contact for people who are isolating at home10 immediate-term and long-term strategies to extend palliative care during and after the covid-19 pandemic are shown in the panel
panelstrategies to extend palliative care during and after the covid-19 pandemic
immediate responsiveness to adapt to pandemic parameters

optimise cooperation and coordination

initiate formal and informal pathways for collective action and exchange by governments bilateral and multilateral organisations civil society and the private sector based on the principle of solidarity

preserve continuity of care

ensure the availability and rational use of personal protective equipment and encourage self-care among palliative care health-care professionals and all caregiversensure an adequate and balanced supply of opioid medication to all patients for relief of breathlessness and pain by instituting the simplified procedures of the international narcotics control boardconduct rapid training for all medical personnel to address additional palliative care needs of covid-19 patientsengage technology partners to equip community health workers with telehealth capabilities to virtually conduct home-based palliative care activitiesenable families to virtually visit and partake in health decisions with loved ones especially at the end of life to address the almost universal fear of dying alone

enhance social support

enlist informal networks of community-based and faith-based organisations to mobilise and train a citizen volunteer workforce that is ready and able to teleconnect with patients in need of basic social support delivering on palliative cares cornerstone featurecompassionate care

assess emerging needs

link with contact tracing activities and testing sites to collect data from the general public to better understand the social dimension of pandemic suffering

long-term preparedness strategies that embed palliative care into the core of medicine

expand all medical nursing social work and community health worker curricula as well as training of clergy to include core palliative care competenciesestablish standard and resource-stratified palliative care guidelines and protocols for different stages of a pandemic and based on rapidly evolving situations and scenarios
 support for health-care workers and strategies such as peer counselling regular check-ins with social support networks self-monitoring and pacing and working in teams to mitigate the impact of continued exposure to death and dying breathlessness desperation and suffering need to be deployed across health systems these strategies need to include the palliative care workforce worldwide because their patient groups are usually at increased risk from covid-19 and the least likely to be triaged into intensive care4 11
 adoption of triage for clinical decision making including who will receive ventilator support marks a deterioration in use of person-centred care in favour of utilitarian thinking5 palliative care rejects the comparative valuation of human life and upholds the allocation of resources using the key ethical principles of justice and beneficence such that previous treatment adherence should not be a consideration in defining access to care12 universal do-not-resuscitate orders should be rejected the cornerstones of clinical decision making must be strict differentiation of clinicians who provide care from those who make triage decisions5 and patient-centred assessment of the medical indication applied in conjunction with the will of the patient13
 most importantly patients triaged not to receive intensive care or ventilatory support require adequate relief of suffering especially for breathlessness14 in covid-19 patients with breathlessness clinical experience suggests opioidsa common palliative care interventioncan be safe and effective and should be widely available15
 the relief of the covid-19-related huge additional burden of serious health-related suffering will require opioids and especially inexpensive off-patent injectable and immediate release oral morphine16 yet the poorest 50 of people in the world have access to only 1 of the globally distributed opioids in morphine-equivalent and as a result access to opioid medication in many countries even for palliative care is inadequate1 17 patients in lmics with respiratory failure from covid-19 will be largely unable to access opioids as pre-existing scarcity will be exacerbated by increased use of opioids in hospital intensive-care units we propose that lmics need to rapidly adopt two strategies first national opioid medication reserves have to be increased to build up a stockpile for the covid-19 pandemic the international narcotics control board incb has called on governments to ensure continued access to controlled medicines including opioids during this pandemic reminding them that in acute emergencies it is possible to use simplified procedures for the export transportation and provision of opioid medications18 to avoid cost escalation pooled purchasing platforms need to be adopted including making information on price-points public and accessible1 19 second rapid basic training on rational use of opioid medications must be offered to all primary caregivers and health-care professionals in emergency departments and intensive-care units and much of this can be done online20 21
 in this most challenging time health responders can take advantage of palliative care know-how to focus on compassionate care and dignity provide rational access to essential opioid medicines and mitigate social isolation at the end of life and caregiver distress the call to fully incorporate palliative care into global health1 22 could finally be realised in the urgency of the pandemic if so the covid-19 pandemic will have catalysed medicine to better alleviate suffering in life and death23
  scoring system to triage patients for spine surgery in the setting of limited resources application to the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic and beyond background as of may 4 2020 the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic has affected 35 million people and touched every inhabited continent accordingly it has stressed health systems worldwide leading to the cancellation of elective surgical cases and discussions regarding health care resource rationing it is expected that rationing of surgical resources will continue even after the pandemic peak and may recur with future pandemics creating a need for a means of triaging patients for emergent and elective spine surgery methods using a modified delphi technique a cohort of 16 fellowship-trained spine surgeons from 10 academic medical centers constructed a scoring system for the triage and prioritization of emergent and elective spine surgeries three separate rounds of videoconferencing and written correspondence were used to reach a final scoring system sixteen test cases were used to optimize the scoring system so that it could categorize cases as requiring emergent urgent high-priority elective or low-priority elective scheduling results the devised scoring system included 8 independent components neurologic status underlying spine stability presentation of a high-risk postoperative complication patient medical comorbidities expected hospital course expected discharge disposition facility resource limitations and local disease burden the resultant calculator was deployed as a freely available web-based calculator httpsjhuspine3shinyappsiospineurgencycalculator conclusions we present the first quantitative urgency scoring system for the triage and prioritizing of spine surgery cases in resource-limited settings we believe that our scoring system although not all encompassing has potential value as a guide for triaging spine surgical cases during the covid pandemic and post-covid period sciubba daniel m  ehresman jeff  pennington zach  lubelski daniel  feghali james  bydon ali  chou dean  elder benjamin d  elsamadicy aladine a  goodwin c rory  goodwin matthew l  harrop james  klineberg eric o  laufer ilya  lo sheng-fu l  neuman brian j  passias peter g  protopsaltis themistocles  shin john h  theodore nicholas  witham timothy f  benzel edward c occupational health responses to covid19 what lessons can we learn from sars david koh hui goh poh   healthcare workers hcws in health care establishments include doctors nurses laboratory and paramedical staff health attendants and cleaners other than health care workers anyone who are physically present or associated with health care institutions were at high risk of infection by sarscov worldwide hcws comprised a significant 21 of all sars patients but in countries such as canada and singapore more than 40 of the patients were hcws
10
 performance of certain procedures such as intubation and nebulization of sars patients was recognized as having a significant risk of infection however even lowexposure situations and transient exposures to infected cases posed infection risks there were also reports of superspreaders who often were initially undiagnosed and who spread the disease to clusters of hcws healthcare workers are also a recognized highrisk exposure group to sarscov2 as of 2 march 2020 more than 3400 hcws have been infected in china with 13 deaths reported
11
 a covid19 superspreader was reported in a wuhan hospital the patient presented with abdominal symptoms and was initially admitted to a surgery department resulting in over 10 hcws being infected
12
 in many other countries currently thousands of hcws have been infected and hundreds have died though not all have occurred because of occupational exposure this is because household and community transmission have also played a role in the infection of hcws in general hcws are now better equipped and better trained and prepared with infection control techniques as compared to the time of sars the number of hcws as a proportion of all cases of covid19 appears to be smaller and hcws comprise less than 20 of cases several factors may have contributed to this for example in singapore there are established occupational medicine departments to protect hcws in major singapore government hospitals in 2020 in comparison no such departments existed in 2003 to reduce the risk of occupational exposure to infection personal protective equipment ppe have been stockpiled hcws are mask fitted repeated training in infection control techniques have been given and strict adherence to infection control protocols is mandated there is also extensive daily monitoring of health among staff
13

 world health organization has developed several technical guidance documents regarding covid19 for hcws including rights roles and responsibilities of hcws
14
 which comprises key considerations for safety and health as part of a who preparedness and response initiative they have also established a risk assessment tool that is to be used by health care facilities to determine the risk of sarscov2 infection of all hcws who have been exposed to a covid19 patient this tool also provides recommendations for appropriate management of these hcws according to their infection risk
15

 however the magnitude of the pandemic with its explosive increase in number of infected patients requiring treatment in health care facilities has resulted in health care establishments being overwhelmed in many countries there are shortages of ppe such as n95 masks and surgical masks for health care workers and ventilators for patients even in the more developed countries with robust health care systems
16
 there has also been a profound loss of trust in authority with perceptions that policy is guided more by scarcity than science
17
 in the developing countries the situation is even more dire during the sars outbreak hcws in affected countries worked under great stress and in constant fear besides being exposed to the virus they experienced fatigue burnout stigma and were at risk for physical and psychological violence the need to protect themselves by having to wear uncomfortable ppe at all times the necessity to monitor body temperature several times a day enforced restriction of movements within and between health care establishments and having to work long hours in physically separate teams were common features of health care work about a third 2935 of hospital workers in toronto
18
 experienced a high degree of distress as measured on the impact of event scale in singapore over ten thousand hcws in nine health care settings were surveyed during the sars outbreak
19
 many reported feeling more stressed at work experiencing an increase in workload and having to work overtime most respondents agreed that people close to me are worried for my health and that people close to me are worried they might get infected through me in addition there was also fear and stigmatization of hcws and their family members from the public because of their occupation table 1 during this covid19 outbreak hcws are similarly working under extreme conditions over long hours many hcws have fears for their personal health and many have their family members worried for them the need for management of stress and fatigue among hcws is important and should be recognized and provided for
20

 at the same time stigmatization and ostracization of hcws have been witnessed due to their occupation hcws are shunned and harassed by some members of a fearful public these reactions arise largely from ignorance and anxiety such adverse reactions have also been directed towards other groups of people such as those under quarantine or persons of specific races and nationalities the cdc has identified persons of asian descent people who have travelled and emergency responders or healthcare professionals as groups who may be at risk of being stigmatized
21

 on the other hand there have are also been positive reactions from the public and strong expressions of gratitude and support for hcws many members of the public do appreciate the hcws dedication to work and the sacrifices they make and there has been a general outpouring of support from the public for hcws in many countries besides the obvious stressors of working long hours under conditions of risk of infections and separation from their families and loved ones another mental health challenge faced by health care workers is the dilemma they face when deciding how to ration scarce health care resources to patients
22
 in countries such as italy where the number of patients who need ventilators outnumbered the available equipment health care workers were forced to make uncomfortable life or death decisions
23
 the lack of resources contributed in part to the high covid19 death rate in italy this is unfortunately another challenge seen in covid19 outbreak that was not encountered during the sars outbreak mental health support for hcws can be provided via multidisciplinary mental health teams which include psychiatrists psychiatric nurses clinical psychologists and other mental health workers regular accurate and clear communication updates should be provided in order to allay prevailing uncertainty and fear that the hcws are experiencing hcws caring for covid19 patients may also require regular clinical screening for depression and anxiety
20

 however specific mental health issues may need to be managed by different approaches for example one possible solution to help clinicians directly involved in managing critically ill patients from making ethically difficult choices such as deciding who receives ventilator care is to form a triage committee
24
 such a committee can comprise volunteers including respected clinicians and leaders among their peers the committee can be tasked to make these difficult choices in order to spare the frontline clinicians from the dilemma of rationing scarce medical resources severe acute respiratory syndrome was spread to hcws mainly by direct mucous membrane contact with infectious respiratory droplets and exposure to contaminated surfaces prevention and control measures were early detection and isolation of cases and quarantine of exposed members of the public these measures were effective for example secondary cases of sars were minimal when the source cases were isolated within 2 days of onset of symptoms however if isolation was delayed the number of secondary cases increased rapidly for hcws effective preventive measures involve wearing of gloves gowns eye protection n95 masks practising good personal hygiene and selfmonitoring for early disease symptoms and early treatment although the implementation of such measures on a massive scale was initially challenging most health systems and hcws eventually coped however sustaining such extensive preventive measures over prolonged periods was difficult for the covid19 outbreak we have witnessed extensive contact tracing and quarantine measures implemented in major chinese cities affecting millions of people implementing such measures requires advance planning of suitable locations for quarantine giving support to patients who are in quarantine and being strict to those who break the laws by enforcing penalties health care resources have also been marshalled and mobilized on an unprecedented scale to respond to those who require treatment however a current challenge is the worldwide shortage of medical supplies such as ppe and medical equipment such as ventilators and even test kits for diagnosis advice given for the general public for covid19 has seen a greater emphasis placed on hand washing personal hygiene such as not touching the face with contaminated hands respiratory hygiene eg practising cough etiquette by coughing or sneezing away from others or into the sleeves and wearing masks if feeling unwell social distancing avoidance of crowds travel advice and advice that persons who are well need not wear masks
25

 due to the limited supply of masks the initial general advice has been for masks to be worn by ill patients and people who have close contact or who are looking after ill patients for the general public information on types of masks to wear surgical masks would suffice rather than n95 masks the proper way of wearing and disposing of masks in a safe and socially responsible manner has been given
26
 however it is important to note that such information continues to evolve the latest guidelines from centers for disease control and prevention cdc in april 2020
27
 recommend that masks or face coverings should be worn by the public when they go out one reason for the change in advice is the recognition that there may be asymptomatic cases who might spread infected respiratory droplets to other members of the public if they are not wearing face coverings or masks social distancing has been implemented as part of the efforts to flatten the curve the curve refers to the projected number of people who will contract covid19 over a period of time by implementing community isolation measures the daily number of disease cases can be kept at a manageable level for medical providers hence it may help lessen the healthcare burden
28

 as the situation evolves some countries are employing more restrictive measures such as travel bans and lockdowns it was reported that by the end of march 2020 more than 100 countries had instituted either a full or partial lockdown impacting billions of residents
29

 severe acute respiratory syndrome was widely viewed as a public health threat but was less appreciated as an occupational disease among the occupational groups at risk were hcws animal and food preparation handlers transport workers ranging from flight attendants to taxi drivers and laboratory researchers working with the sarscov for example more than a third of the early cases of sars prefebruary 2003 occurred in persons who handled killed or sold food animals or in those who prepared or served food thus in addition to public health measures an appropriate occupational health response is also necessary
10

 in the current covid19 outbreak diverse occupational groups are recognized to be at risk for example in singapore 68 of the first 25 locally transmitted cases were probably related to occupational exposure
30
 the workers who are in the hospitality retail food and beverage industry who served infected tourists transport workers multinational company workers who attended an international meeting a domestic worker and even a security officer who served quarantine orders were all at risk these occupations were not covered by the occupational health legislation of singapore in 2003 which was the factories act however in 2020 the workplace safety and health act in singapore applies to many of these workers thus if and when the disease is officially recognized as an occupational disease these workers and not only factory workers will be covered by the health and safety law a major concern of many workers is the fear of job losses or loss of income this is apparent from the economic impact of covid19 where in many countries nonessential services have been halted and many people stay at home and avoid going out for shopping or entertainment selfemployed workers workers in a gig economy and those working in entertainment hospitality tourism and travel sectors to name a few will be threatened with loss of income and job losses in order to manage the economic fallout many governments have provided stimulus packages to assist such groups companies and occupational health departments may also play a role in the national and international pandemic response and in managing such concerns among workers under their care

 since august 2003 after the containment of sars new diseases have periodically surfaced to confront the world on a regular basis these include the appearance of viruses eg merscov various influenza viruses eg h1n1 swine flu h5n1 avian influenza h7n9 zika virus and the deadly ebola virus such ongoing and sporadic events remind us that it is a certainty that emerging infections will continue to remain as real threats to our world and we should be ever vigilant and ready to respond  precautions for operating room team members during the covid-19 pandemic joseph forrester d aussama nassar k paul maggio m mary hawn t   an interventional platform operating room interventional suites and endoscopy ppe taskforce was convened by the hospital and medical school leadership and tasked with developing a common algorithm for ppe use to be used throughout the interventional platform this taskforce comprised members from each interventional stakeholder group the goal was to have these guidelines created by the ppe taskforce ratified by hospital leadership and implemented across the interventional platform within 72 hours before beginning work on the algorithm a set of guiding principles were agreed upon to ensure common vision throughout the process table 1
 we reviewed current data describing covid-19 transmission in the hospital and nonhospital settings6 7 8 9 ppe taskforce members relied on existing published decision-making algorithms and assessments of operating room risk developed during outbreaks associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and ebola virus disease10 11 12 the draft algorithm was then vetted by experts from infection control and infectious disease and approved by hospital leadership to ensure accuracy and compliance with institutional best practice usability was assessed by feedback from healthcare providers in our institution we reviewed our current and anticipated ppe on hand developed predictive models for our current use rate and the implications of implementation of our guidelines to ppe days on hand a decision tree algorithm describing our institutional guidelines for precautions for operating room team members was created fig 1
 the underlying assumption was that every patient is potentially infected with covid-19 until proven otherwise this assumption is based on growing community spread of covid-19 which placed the burden for ruling out infection on the healthcare team patients were initially triaged by acuity into urgent and emergency procedures no guidance was provided for elective procedures as these had been stopped in accordance with county order4 rapid testing for covid-19 virus was not possible for emergency procedures we assumed all patients undergoing emergency procedures to be infected by covid-19 until proven otherwise the ppe requirement for the entire team managing emergency cases is to don a fitted n95 respirator mask in addition to droplet ppe gown gloves eye protection urgent cases were stratified into high- and low-risk procedures depending on the anticipated viral burden at the surgical site and the likelihood that a procedure would aerosolize virus classified as aerosol-generating procedures agp all agp of the aerodigestive tract nasopharyngeal oropharyngeal tracheal lung were considered high risk given the known viral load in these areas and potential for aerosolization consistent with previous experience with sars1

13 14 15 covid-19 virus rna had been documented in the gastrointestinal tract16 given the potential for aerosolizing intraluminal contents during endoscopy this was considered a high-risk agp similarly due to extended contact with potentially high levels of virus despite a lower risk of creating aerosol open or laparoscopic surgery on the bowel in the presence of gross contamination was also considered a high-risk agp patients were stratified based on their risk of having active infection for patients who screened positive for symptoms fever cough sore throat the surgeon would consider delaying the operation if surgical delay would result in unacceptable risk then any patient with positive symptoms would undergo urgent reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr testing if a patients operation was unable to be delayed for testing then the patient would be re-triaged into the emergency category and presumed covid we decided to make rt-pcr testing of symptomatic patients mandatory given the availability of in-house testing at our institution with the caveat of a 24-hour turn around if a patient tested positive operation would proceed after approval by surgical anesthesia and hospital leadership for these covid patients all members of the operating room are required to don a fitted n95 respirator mask with droplet attire gown gloves and eye protection for symptomatic patients who test negative by rt-pcr operating room team members would use standard surgical attire bag mask ventilation and endotracheal intubation are deemed as agp with a high-risk for virus transmission irrespective of the covid-19 status of the patient in the unlikely event that a patient is both asymptomatic and tests false-negative we recommend donning fitted n95 respirators and face shields for intubation and extubation at a minimum the face shield will protect the n95 from droplet contamination and allow for safe reuse on multiple patients this is an important part of our conservation strategy additionally we stipulated that all providers not directly involved with intubation leave the operating room before intubation and extubation to protect our cleaning staff at the conclusion of an operation we stipulated droplet precautions for all cleaning personnel at the time these guidelines were created we had few controlled air purifying respirators caprs to address this supply challenge we stipulated that a capr could be substituted for an n95 on a case-by-case basis a capr would be allowed only if the provider failed n95 fit test and no other provider fitted for n95 could provide a similar level of service during the algorithm creation process there was a nationwide critical shortage of n95 masks in an attempt to conserve the n95 masks we mandate face shields to be placed over the n95 mask at the completion of the case the face shield can be disinfected and the n95 mask can be re-used for non-covid patients or patients under investigation pui finally education and training on proper donning and doffing of ppe is crucial for healthcare worker safety improper doffing in particular can be a high-risk procedure for healthcare workers17

18 we instituted mandatory training on proper donning and doffing of ppe for all healthcare workers in addition to a donning and doffing buddy system for healthcare providers when managing covid or pui patients17
 it is important to note that our patient risk-stratification algorithm is dependent on both symptomatology and the ability to perform rt-pcr to determine a patients infection status recognizing the false negative rate of the test and concern for asymptomatic transmission because access to rapid testing is variable any institutions adopting these guidelines will need to adjust them to reflect local testing availability similarly ppe availability anticipated ppe use rates and supply-chain disruptions may require modification of the algorithm the current covid-19 pandemic has necessitated rapid development of novel hospital guidelines across a spectrum of clinical environments despite covid-19 being a new threat we have shown that by developing an easy-to-follow decision tree algorithm for the interventional platform teams we can ensure optimal healthcare worker safety this algorithm prioritizes patients based on disease severity testing status and symptomology while ensuring rational use of ppe in a resource-constrained setting the algorithm has been shared with healthcare providers and stakeholders nationwide and is expected to be widely adopted  rapid diagnostic methods for acute viral respiratory infections jos navarro-mar m   acute respiratory infection ari of viral etiology is the most frequent clinical syndrome affecting humans millions of people suffer from ari mainly during the colder seasons every year fortunately most cases are self-limited and evolve toward healing without the need for an etiological treatment about twenty viruses have been involved as causative agents of ari excepting infections caused by emerging viruses such as mers-coronavirus cov sars cov or new influenza viruses flu severe cases that require special attention and management rarely occur patients within the extreme stages of life ie infants and elder adults andor individuals with underlying conditions or risk factors are mainly affected by a more severe infection on the other hand specific antiviral therapy is only available for flu and respiratory syncytial virus rsv infections however an overwhelming demand of healthcare services takes place yearly coinciding with seasonal epidemics of flu and rsv which leads to an increase in visits to emergency units in antibiotics use and in requests of laboratory and imaging tests whenever a rapid detection test rdt is included in the portfolio of ari diagnosis appropriate sensitivity and specificity values must have been demonstrated so that the assay can be used for the purpose it was implemented in this situation the question is whether a rdt is cost-effective mainly it might reduce the use of antibiotics as serious bacterial co-infections are rare minimize the need for ancillary tests decrease the duration of hospital stay and if necessary allow the rapid implementation of a cohort in order to avoid nosocomial transmission1 attending to these requirements which technique should be used and when and how should it be used for the rapid diagnosis of ari many questions arise when one tries to implement a rational diagnostic algorithm should we investigate all viruses in all ari cases or selected viruses in selected individuals should we investigate all viruses only in special cases should we use rdts only in emergency units in all cases or only in hospitalized patients obviously different clinical settings require different diagnostic procedures a clinical diagnosis of ari can be made in outpatients and only in exceptional situations a rapid etiological diagnosis is needed as has occurred with suspected cases of pandemic flu in pregnant women and morbidly obese individuals or to identify influenza virus infection as a cause of respiratory outbreaks in close institutions contrarily all possible respiratory viruses should be investigated in situations of high risk for severe complications eg in people with hematological malignancies in consonance with the wide spectrum of clinical situations that a physician can find a significantly high number of rdts are available ranging from rapid antigen detection tests radts to automatic nucleic acids amplification techniques naats radts were primarily designed for rsv and flu being immunochromatographic assays ic the most widely employed because of their ease of use however and specially with radts for flu variable sensitivity and specificity values have been observed depending on several factors ie manufacturer type of sample patients age delay of sampling since the onset of symptoms etc2 overall radts for flu or rsv carried out in nasopharyngeal washes or aspirates pediatric population and with samples collected within the first 72 h since the onset of symptoms have demonstrated the best results3 4
 recently a fda-cleared rdt for flu and rsv detection the sofia influenza ab and rsv fluorescent immunoassays fia quidel corp seems to improve the sensitivity and specificity of ic assays since they combine an immunofluorescence-based lateral-flow technology with automatic digital scan and interpretation of the test strip which minimizes potential operator errors due to manual reading5 6 gmez et al evaluate the sofia influenza ab and rsv fia using cell culture andor rt-pcr as reference methods showing a good sensitivity and specificity especially for flu detection this assay enhances the diagnostic accuracy compared with classical ic assays higher sensitivity is obtained with nasopharyngeal aspirates vs exudates 906 vs 61 respectively and with pediatric vs adult samples 878 vs 553 respectively5
 nowadays apart from the particular situations commented above there is a consensus in order not to use diagnostic tests for detecting respiratory viruses in outpatients with ari in emergency units rdts are commonly employed especially for rsv and flu although they have not demonstrated its utility in decreasing antibiotics prescription andor the use of ancillary tests in this setting7 even in the diagnosis of rsv infection for which rdts offer better sensitivities the results from these assays may be counterproductive and lead to a false sense of security in establishing cohorts of hospitalized patients the use of rdts in emergency units has only been associated with a reduction in antibiotics consumption once the individuals return to be attended as outpatients at their health centers7
 regarding rdts for flu detection the poor sensitivity and negative predictive values make controversial their use in emergency units in this situation excepting high-risk individuals a diagnostic test for flu is not necessary if the patient is going to be discharged if the clinical status of the patient makes necessary special healthcare andor hospitalization flu should be directly investigated by naats besides etiological diagnosis of flu serves for prompt antiviral treatment and for the rapid implementation of control measures to prevent nosocomial outbreaks8 9
 currently different commercial naats for flu and rsv detection are available10 although they are not considered point-of-care assays as some radts are automatic naats require a minimal hands-on-time and offer a rapid and more reliable result compared with the one obtained with radts11 12 13 14 15 16 however as naats can detect asymptomatic shedding or very low viral loads in the respiratory tract the clinical significance of a naat-positive result in these cases is controversial also there are no data supporting the use of naats for monitoring the outcome of the infection andor the response to antiviral treatment even more controversy is seen with the recommendation of use of rapid diagnostic tests for respiratory viruses other than rsv and flu some commercial radts and automatic naats are available to detect a variable range of respiratory viruses10 an example of the former method is maripoc designed for antigen detection of rsv flu a and b adenovirus parainfluenza viruses 13 human metapneumovirus and streptococcus pneumoniae in respiratory samples the potential cost-benefits of this technique have been recently reported17 however the real utility of this assay is still unclear furthermore automatic multiplex naats for detecting an extended spectrum of respiratory viruses have demonstrated excellent performance18 but the high costs of these assays limit their use in routine for this reason they are usually reserved for special situations such as severely ill patients admitted to intensive care units in conclusion according to the clinical setting the epidemiological situation and the severity of the disease it is necessary to establish rational and cost-effective diagnostic algorithms for respiratory viruses flu testing is recommended for hospitalized patients with influenza-like illness however empiric antiviral treatment should be initiated as soon as possible without the need to wait for any influenza testing results  critical care in public health emergencies robert kanter k bradley fuhrman p jerry zimmerman j   responses to major public health emergencies are organized within a national response framework as outlined by the federal department of homeland security1 emergency responses are always coordinated at the most local jurisdictional level possible usually at the city or county level responses to larger disasters need support from adjacent counties the state and sometimes from the federal level the hospital emergency incident command system heics2 provides a leadership framework within and among organizations responding to an emergency heics emphasizes flexibility for any type of event scalability to the size of the event clear lines of authority and consistent communications disaster plans at every hospital incorporate heics principles critical care responses to phes are scaled according to the size and severity of the emergency table 18-1
3 4 5 responses are categorized as 1 ordinary surge 2 temporary reactive mass critical care and 3 sustained mass critical care for a sudden-impact event involving modest 10 to 15 increases above usual peak hospital capacity at one or more local hospitals ordinary surge methods would suffice to provide normal standards of critical care to all those who need it ordinary critical care surge needs are met by canceling elective admissions quickly discharging all patients who can safely leave the icu mobilizing staff and adding beds as feasible most hospitals have occasional experience with ordinary critical care surge responses mass critical care approaches would be implemented when a very large phe threatens to overwhelm critical care resources it is recommended that mass critical care personnel be able to care for up to three times the usual number of critically ill patients for up to 10 days without outside help in these circumstances population-based goals would attempt to maximize numbers of survivors by providing immediate lifesaving interventions to all persons who need them and delaying or forgoing other interventions thus standards of mass critical care are not equivalent to normal circumstances and should be considered to be crisis standards of care sudden impact events that stress the resources of a community may require the implementation of temporary reactive mass critical care experience with a massive surge of critically injured patients after a major fire demonstrated the satisfactory outcomes that are possible as a result of well-organized responses that included elements of the temporary reactive mass critical care approach6 a sustained phe that exceeds resources over a wide area may require the sustained implementation of mass critical care no historical precedents exist for sustained mass critical care in many states existing laws would permit mass critical care to be implemented on a temporary reactive basis under the authority of an individual hospitals incident commander for a sudden impact event that threatens to overwhelm the resources of a hospital phe powers are defined on a state-by-state basis7 where laws exist to authorize sustained mass critical care this authority is generally at the level of a state public health official mass critical care whether temporary or sustained should guarantee the following lifesaving interventions that can be performed immediately 1 mechanical ventilation 2 fluid resuscitation 3 vasopressors 4 antidotes and antibiotics and 5 analgesia and sedation lifesaving mass critical care interventions would be extended to much larger than usual numbers of patients by the following approaches 1 substitution of equivalent available interventions for scarce or unavailable treatments 2 adapting nearly equivalent available interventions instead of other scarce or unavailable treatments 3 conservation of resources and 4 reuse of some single-use items such modifications from usual practices would be proportional to the gap between needs and resources and would be implemented in an organized way by each hospitals heics if a phe affected persons of all ages equally then children aged 0 to 14 years would account for 20 of the patients and children aged 0 to 19 years would account for 28 of the patients8 younger patients may be more vulnerable to infections dehydration toxins and trauma and are less able to protect themselves in a dangerous environment thus children may be overrepresented in a patient population during a phe accidents involving a child-specific activity or terrorism intentionally targeting children may result in a patient population predominantly made up of children some planning scenarios considered by the department of homeland security exceed the entire national critical care capacity3
 survival rates from high-risk pediatric conditions tend to be better when children receive care at pediatric hospitals9 10 11 12 the younger the patient the more age-specific are the treatment requirements a national survey estimated a pediatric icu picu peak capacity of 54 beds per million pediatric population13 because normal picu occupancy exceeds 50 fewer than 30 vacant picu beds per million age-specific population are generally available in a region because each region may only be served by a single or a few pediatric hospitals events that disable a pediatric hospital may disproportionately degrade regional pediatric care quantitative models indicate that survival in a phe would be better if pediatric patient surge is distributed to pediatric beds throughout a region rather than overloading facilities near the scene of an emergency14 appropriate utilization of pediatric hospitals would be promoted by clear identification of pediatric hospitals15 16 unfortunately control of patient distribution may be impossible in a phe17 as a result all hospitals must be prepared to care for some children18 even if pediatric regional resources are used optimally hospital vacancies to accommodate pediatric surges are empirically much more limited than for adult patients19 whether or not patients are distributed optimally to hospitals outcomes from a hypothetical large phe are likely to be better with mass critical care approaches14 20
 when a sudden-impact phe is announced picu clinical leaders must immediately focus attention on safety of patients and staff the hospitals heics is activated normal operations continue until other instructions are received staff who are already in the hospital report to their normal assigned work area notifying their supervisor of their arrival picu clinical leaders review the hospital disaster plan including job action sheets and discuss pertinent aspects with the staff when possible the picu clinical leaders will be informed about type number and arrival time of anticipated patients however such information is often unavailable and inaccurate scheduled admissions are reviewed for potential cancellation patients in the picu are evaluated for transfer to a lower level of care or discharge based on the initial assessment icu leaders need to determine the number of additional patients who could be accommodated with available staff equipment supplies and space to provide normal standards of care additional needs for staff equipment and supplies should be communicated through appropriate channels in the heics additional staff is called in when heics instructs the staff present to do so staff already in the hospital may be reassigned by heics staff responding from outside should report to a labor pool area for assignment areas designated for expansion of services and overflow are prepared when instructed by heics as information about the event becomes available picu physician and nurse leaders provide incident-specific just-in-time teaching to staff when warranted just-in-time teaching is especially important when less experienced supplemental providers are assigned to the picu rapidly accommodating patients from the emergency department ed or operating room will be essential in allowing those areas to continue receiving new patients at all times clinical leaders must maintain awareness of the environment operational problems disaster-related communications and reactions of staff patients and families triage sorts patients to match their needs with available resources triage is an evolving process relative to shifting needs and resources prehospital field triage and care is beyond the scope of this chapter but when it is effective patients are selected who will benefit from ed care some mild patients not requiring ed care may have been overtriaged and others may arrive at the ed without prehospital assessment the worried may well constitute a large proportion of patients arriving at an ed severely ill or injured patients may arrive later than those with less serious conditions in a sudden impact emergency triage categories are assigned in the ed by an experienced clinician whose sole role is to act as triage officer elements of the triage process may have to be repeated later according to evolving imbalances of patient needs and resources triage at the ed is performed according to the nature of the phe when potential contamination of victims by toxins is involved initial triage outside the hospital first identifies those needing immediate decontamination to protect the patient staff and entire hospital facility likewise when a highly transmissible virulent infection is involved triage prior to entering the ed identifies and isolates potentially infectious patients at the earliest time to avoid exposing staff and other patients failures of triage at the early stages of decontamination and infection control may subsequently incapacitate an entire hospital when pertinent the patients medical record should clearly indicate decontamination procedures done and the patients infection control status physiologic triage identifies patients needing immediate lifesaving interventions physiological triage tools identify patients in five categories 1 those needing immediate lifesaving interventions 2 those who need significant intervention that can be delayed 3 those needing little or no treatment 4 those who are so severely ill or injured that survival is unlikely despite major interventions and 5 those who have already died care of patients triaged to group 4 those who are so severely ill or injured that survival is unlikely must deviate most significantly from usual approaches to intensive care because of overall demands on the system scarce resources must be allocated to other patients who are more likely to survive group 4 patients are sometimes referred to as expectant expectant patients are defined by current resource constraints as well as physiological observations palliative care is always provided to expectant patients also see the discussion of rationing at the end of this chapter it is beyond the scope of this chapter to advocate one triage tool in preference to others no single tool is always rapid completely accurate appropriate to all ages and disorders and already familiar to all providers21 staff should be familiar with the physiological triage tool in use locally when indicated decontamination reduces toxic effects for the victim and avoids contamination of staff and the hospital facility the airway is monitored and maintained during decontamination antidotes are given after cleaning the site of administration age-specific issues include hypothermia in infants and behavioral limitations warm water may prevent hypothermia young children need assistance undressing while some older children resist undressing and require encouragement and some privacy22 23
 for a public health emergency involving a highly virulent transmissible infection infection control must begin outside the ed entrance and continue without interruption in the hospital while the patient is infectious infection control practices can be summarized as follows241standard precautions apply to all patients regardless of infection status hand hygiene use of gloves gown mask eye protection depending on the anticipated exposure and safe injection practices2contact precautions are used when infection may be spread by direct contact when a single-patient room is not available more than 3 feet separation between beds reduces sharing of items between patients staff should wear a gown and gloves for contact with the patient or contaminated objects3droplet precautions prevent transmission of pathogens spread through close respiratory contact because these pathogens do not remain infectious over long distances special air handling is not required when a single-patient room is not available more than 3 feet separation with a curtain between beds reduces droplet transmission staff should wear a mask for close contact with the patient4airborne precautions prevent transmission of infections transmissible over long distances when suspended in the air a negative pressure isolation room reduces airborne transmission staff should wear a mask or fit-tested n-95 respirator depending on disease-specific recommendations infection control practices for specific clinical syndromes are detailed in standard references24 and later in this chapter
 hospital care of children is more efficient more effective and less stressful when the child is accompanied by a family member or familiar caregiver this need must be balanced against other triage considerations unaccompanied children must be properly identified tracked and reunited with their families requiring proper identification of adult caregivers before releasing children to them pediatric safe areas in hospitals with appropriate staff supervision are necessary sample child identification and tracking documents have been designed18
 many of the same considerations pertain in sudden-impact and gradual-onset phes however a gradual onset allows event-specific preparation resources can be augmented and procedures can be developed and practiced staff can be trained experience in the early phase of the emergency would provide evidence to refine event-specific recommendations very rapid publication of such experience has provided rapid evolution of management recommendations in recent phes such as the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome the h1n1 influenza epidemic and anthrax exposures patient care space may be adapted by converting single patient spaces to be used by two or three patients after exhausting picu space additional space for mass critical care also may be adapted by using intermediate care units postanesthesia care units eds procedure suites or non-icu hospital rooms overflow of critically ill adolescents or young adults may be shared between picus and adult icus overflow of young infants or term newborns may be shared by picus and neonatal icus nonhospital facilities should only be used for mass critical care if hospitals become unusable supplemental providers may include physicians nurse practitioners physician assistants nurses respiratory therapists pharmacists and emergency medical technicians who have skills in non-icu pediatrics or nonpediatric critical care rapid credentialing procedures just-in-time education and close supervision by experienced picu clinicians would promote the role of supplemental providers mechanical ventilation is detailed in other chapters of this textbook most hospitals have only a small supply of standard ventilators and circuits in excess of usual icu capacity it may be necessary to consider temporary use of transport and anesthesia ventilators and bilevel positive pressure breathing devices some pediatric hospitals use a single type of ventilator for patients of all sizes with appropriate circuits and software algorithms in other hospitals ventilators usually used for adults that have high compliance circuits and adult algorithms may have to be adapted for use in infants or small children some difficulties may be encountered the inspiratory flow or pressure sensor may not be sensitive to an infants small inspiratory effort thus triggering of inspiration may fail for synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation assist control or pressure support likewise ventilator algorithms to terminate pressure support inspiration may fail in the presence of air leaks around endotracheal tubes a substantial air leak around an uncuffed endotracheal tube may result in frequent ventilator alarms indicating low pressure or low exhaled tidal volume
 in a volume-controlled mode adult ventilators may be unable to provide small tidal volumes and inspiratory flow appropriate for a small infant pressure-dependent losses of tidal volume in compressible spaces of adult ventilator circuits exaggerate breath-to-breath variation in delivered tidal volume if peak inspiratory pressure varies with patient effort or changing respiratory mechanics difficulties in providing small tidal volumes as well as variation in ventilation due to leaks around uncuffed endotracheal tubes may be alleviated by using a time-cycled pressure-limited mode of ventilation supplemental providers need considerable assistance in caring for an infant on a ventilator maintaining endotracheal tube patency stabilization and proper cuff inflation and evaluating episodes of hypoxia are challenges even for experienced picu clinicians few hospitals stockpile enough mechanical ventilators to support three times the usual number of icu patients the temporary use of manual ventilation with a self inflatable bag may be essential to meet mass critical care goals manual ventilation is labor intensive tiring to operators and may expose staff to infection risks as a result of close prolonged bedside contact however manual ventilation has been used successfully via tracheostomy tubes for days in a polio epidemic26 temporarily for hours via endotracheal tubes in a power failure27 and during weather emergencies28 29 30 in the patient transport setting manual ventilation provides similar gas exchange compared with mechanical ventilation31 32 33 work to manually deliver small tidal volumes to an infant is less than that needed for an adult infection risks are negligible except for specific transmissible infections self-inflating bags can be used with ambient air or low-flow oxygen when temporary manual ventilation is provided until mechanical ventilators are available outcomes are likely to be superior to the outcomes in cases of untreated respiratory failure just-in-time training and supervision of supplemental providers may improve their performance in providing appropriate gas exchange and avoiding barotrauma mass critical care can only be provided if essential equipment and supplies are available on site resupply and rental deliveries may be impossible during a phe thus hospitals must balance the benefits of an adequate stockpile against costs of keeping items on site that may never be used the task force on mass critical care3 has recommended that a hospital first should target a mass critical care capacity of three times the usual maximum icu capacity for 10 days on-site stockpiles per mass critical care treatment space are planned accordingly summarized in table 18-2
 warming devices for infants are necessary to avoid cold stress while many interventions may be carried out by adapting nearly equivalent equipment and supplies some adult equipment cannot be adapted to infants and small children it is essential to stock adequate numbers of resuscitation masks endotracheal tubes suction catheters chest tubes intravenous catheters and gastric tubes in pediatric sizes in a crisis resuscitation bags intended for adults can be used to manually ventilate infants however small resuscitation bags intended for infants cannot provide an adequate tidal volume for an adult or child if cuffed endotracheal tubes are used it may be possible to cover all pediatric needs with 30- 40- 50- and 60-mm cuffed tubes reducing the need to stock uncuffed tubes in all other sizes guidelines for mass critical care ventilators have been provided3 34 because few institutions will have enough ventilators to serve three times the usual number of icu patients the option to temporarily provide manual ventilation depends on having adequate numbers of self-inflatable resuscitation bags and endotracheal tubes immediately available in order to extend medication stockpiles in mass critical care rules should be formulated ahead of time regarding appropriate substitutions dose and frequency reductions converting parenteral to enteral administration restrictive indications and shelf-life extension3 experience in recent phes indicates that very large quantities of analgesics and sedatives are essential6 35 weight-based dosing may be simplified to improve efficiency by specifying a limited number of weight range categories when time constraints make it difficult to weigh patients length-based estimates of weight may suffice36
 while all-hazard planning prepares for picu operations across all types of phes some responses must be event-specific these responses are detailed extensively in standard references24 37 in addition to general critical care support event-specific hospital responses and treatments are briefly outlined in table 18-3
 for any type of emergency clinical interventions also will be necessary for illnesses and injuries that are indirectly related or unrelated to the primary event these illnesses and injuries include patients hospitalized prior to the onset of the phe
 if a phe overwhelms resources despite mass critical care approaches rationing might be considered rationing might occur on a first-come first-served basis or by selecting patients most likely to survive as a result of brief lifesaving interventions such criteria have been suggested for selecting adults for mass critical care when needs exceed resources3 38 proposed eligibility criteria include absence of severe chronic conditions predicted mortality not exceeding an arbitrary upper limit and improving clinical status on periodic reevaluations at the present time neither evidence nor consensus of opinion nor law supports the concept of rationing much less a particular rationing procedure for phe rationing to be a feasible option public and professional consensus is a necessary foundation only then could states create a legal basis and liability protections39 better evidence is needed to formulate eligibility criteria and operational plans for phe rationing references are available online at httpwwwexpertconsultcom  public health emergency and crisis management case study of sars-cov-2 outbreak hemin choi wonhyuk cho min-hyu kim joon-young hur   the sars-cov-2 outbreak is a public health emergency and our globalized economy has helped spread this new infectious disease from wuhan china to every continent except antarctica south korea was considered the second most affected nation until march 2020 however as of late may 2020 the south korean public health system is deemed a model of virus containment south koreas public health authorities never implemented a true lockdown 123 most businesses stayed open and borders have not been completely closed down to prevent overseas travel this relative lack of mandate was due to two assumptions 1 public health authorities have been confident about the countrys capacity to trace test and treat the sars-cov-2 patients and 2 they assumed that citizens would generally follow social distancing rules without more restrictive measures  this case study describes the major cluster transmissions of sars-cov-2 in south korea and analyzes the public health authorities emergency measures to the pandemic crisis it follows the case-centric approach to case study which is different from theory-centric or theory-building approaches 4 as it is used for a mechanistic explanation of the outcomes of a particular case south koreas pandemic response is a complex case with a unique context public health authorities have put in place various emergency measures without enacting stay-at-home orders or remaining in lockdown our analysis uses secondary sources such as government archival data public agencies publications and media reports  this research asks how the south korean public health system managed the pandemic crisis flattened the curve without coercive measures like lockdown and discusses the consequences then we highlight important components of south koreas response to public health emergencies with lessons for crisis management practice finally the article identifies the distinctive features of south korean public health authorities crisis management such as widespread testing and diagnostic capacity evidence informing and communication contact tracing and alert texting face mask distribution and quarantine care  pneumonia patients with unknown etiology were first reported to whos china country office in late december 2019 on 3 january 2020 chinese national authorities identified 44 of these patients and on 20 january 2020 issued a statement reporting evidence of human-to-human transmission the international committee on taxonomy of viruses assigned the official name of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 hereafter sars-cov-2 which causes novel coronavirus disease 2019 while most patients with a sars-cov-2 infection have moderate symptoms such as fever coughing or shortness of breath a significant number of people have experienced severe and sometimes deadly pneumonia in both lungs as of late may 2020 there were more than 58 million confirmed cases of sars-cov-2 with more than 360000 deaths around the world the who declared it a pandemic in march 2020 although experts argue that they should have warned of the danger earlier the who considered to have performed well during the 2002 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic has reacted less effectively during the current outbreak leading to calls for an overhaul of the entire organization in south korea the outbreak got serious in late february 2020 and peaked in mid-march 2020 as shown in figure 1 in south korea the first confirmed case identified on 20 january 2020 was a 35-year-old chinese woman the first confirmed case of a south korean national with sars-cov-2 was identified on 23 january 2020 like many other viruses sars-cov-2 is an rna virus and the viruss rna sequence was released in late january 2020 to be used for producing diagnostic testing kits in early february 2020 koreas centers for disease control korea centers for disease control and prevention hereafter centers for disease control authorized the first testing kits made by a south korean biotech company to diagnose sars-cov-2 infection since then the centers for disease control have been aggressively expanding testing alongside comprehensive contact tracing data and systematic quarantine care for infected people with these massive testing and contact tracing efforts by public health authorities the virus initially seemed to be disappearing as shown in figure 1 averaging only about three new cases a day until mid-february however on 18 february 2020 a super-spreader 5 attended a gathering of a religious sect called the shincheonji this 61-year-old woman known as patient 31 was found to have transmitted sars-cov-2 to an unusually large number of people who attended religious events in the shincheonji temple in the southeastern city of daegu home to 25 million people approximately three-quarters of the total number of sars-cov-2 cases ended up being clustered in daegu and as of march 2020 about 60 of the total infections nationwide were traced to this religious group daily infections rose exponentially nearing 1000 the shincheonji super-spreader developed a fever on 10 february 2020 but attended four shincheonji events before being diagnosed with sars-cov-2 public health authorities determined that this huge transmission was due to the behavioral characteristics of the religious group members sit side-by-side in a cramped space for a significant amount of time during their temple service this reinforced awareness of the need for social distancing and the importance of following sars-cov-2 guidelines to avoid such places due to the reclusive and secretive nature of the religious sect uncertainty in tracking escalated the outbreak group members including patient 31 tried to refuse diagnostic testing thereby spreading the virus while public health authorities have not found the precise epidemiological link between patient 31 and her source of infection further investigation by the centers for disease control showed that group members traveled between south korea and their wuhan china fringe branches in january 2020  this massive transmission left daegu short of hospital beds and healthcare professionals in march the centers for disease control announced a new guideline treatment would depend on the severity of patients symptoms patients with mild symptoms were quarantined at community treatment centers and only transferred to an intensive care unit or negative pressure room when their conditions deteriorated 6  in march 2020 other clusters were reported outside of worst-hit daegu at river of grace community church in gyeonggi province more than 80 people tested positive these cases drew international attention as security camera footage showed church leaders spraying saltwater into followers mouths as they believed that this practice would protect them from sars-cov-2 another cluster outbreak with hundreds of new cases occurred at a guro-gu call center in seoul this was especially concerning as it happened in a workplace located in a commercialresidential mixed-use building in a capital city with a population of 10 million additionally in march 2020 an outbreak hit a central government complex located in sejong city 7 and the oceansfisheries ministry alone suffered more than 30 confirmed cases  the public health authorities and the central and local headquarters for disaster and safety countermeasures exerted extensive measures to control the spread and in april 2020 south korea seemed to be recovered from large cluster transmissions of sars-cov-2 death tolls seemed to flatten as shown in figure 2 in late april when the number of new cases dropped to single digits for several days in a row public health authorities decided to ease social distancing restrictions shifting from strict measures asking individuals and groups to cancel events gatherings and travels to promoting distancing in daily life people were able to go to restaurants parks and shops although public health experts warned of the possibility of new clusters  national celebration over crushing the virus was short-lived a 29-year-old man visited multiple nightclubs in a leisure district in seoul on 1 may 2020 and tested positive for sars-cov-2 on 7 may 2020 these venues accounted for more than 160 cases and community transmissions south korea was under modified social distancing restrictions at the time clubs and shops were allowed to be open and receive customers but people were still urged to avoid unnecessary contact with others and stay home after the nightclub cluster was discovered nightclubs and bars were ordered to shut down indefinitely which led to dismay among citizens who had hoped that life was returning to normal based on the trend shown in figure 3 contact tracing was very tricky in this instance although clubs were supposed to verify all visitors names and contact details before allowing them to enter the venue public health authorities found patron information insufficient for tracking and sometimes completely bogus many of these nightclubs were popular among lgbt lesbian gay bisexual and transgender communities in seoul fears of being involuntarily outed may have made some visitors hesitant to identify themselves  another characteristic of sars-cov-2 transmission in south korea is the disproportionate effect on younger people in other nations older people with underlying conditions were hit hardest table 1 presents data from the centers for disease control showing that the largest number of confirmed cases 2770 occurred in the 2029 age group this higher number of younger patients is a double-edged sword since the young are more likely to recover the country suffers fewer deaths as shown in table 1 however younger people such as patient 66 who visited five bars in one night and contacted as many as 2000 people move around more in addition many young people remain asymptomatic which complicates both testing and contact tracing in mid-may the new waves of infections related to the nightclub clusters seemed to be under control thanks to the public health system that south korea used to get on the top of its earlier outbreaks the daily confirmed cases had remained below 20 though there were still many reasons to be concerned about the newer waves as shown in the new cluster in e-commerce logistics warehouses in late maymore than 90 new cases were linked to a cluster of infections at a logistics facility in bucheon west of seoul run by coupang corpcoupang is one of the largest e-commerce firms whose logistics facilities and warehouses scrambled to manage a surge in demand taken overall however south koreas public health system has not been overwhelmed nationally while flattening the curve from new outbreaks without stringent lockdown measures or other severe restrictions on movement such as those implemented in new zealand australia england and canadaand many experts remain puzzled at the outcome in south korea particularly when considering the countrys proximity to china and large volume of travelers from there in south korea while some businesses were restricted and some people had to work from home or go on unpaid leave indefinitely and most restaurants shops and leisure venues stayed open and workplace habits have remained largely unchanged social distancing and the use of face masks were encouraged but only on a voluntary basis and as part of a public health campaign new waves of clusters such as the nightclub transmission or the more recent e-commerce warehouse outbreak may be inevitable as other cities or countries re-open their economies however under this new normal of recurring waves of infection effective public health systems with adequate crisis management are crucial to establishing the balance between tight restrictions and restarting economic and social activities  hospitals and medical professionals form the core of mitigation and containment measures and are the heart of the response to the public health emergencies caused by the sars-cov-2 pandemic protecting these public health systems from being overwhelmed has been crucial exponential increases in numbers of confirmed cases of infection meant that many countries had to focus on the most vulnerable patients particularly those who were older or suffered underlying medical conditions it is easy to agree that those who are experiencing symptoms should have access to testing but this is complicated by the availability of tests their cost and who is paying for them  notably diagnostic testing and treatment are free for confirmed patients of sars-cov-2 in south korea for both citizens and foreigners staying in the country the south korean public health authorities have maintained a solid commitment to free testing and free treatment principles based on the act on infectious disease prevention this free testing and treatment sparked public controversies among both tax payers and policy makers but the local governments and national health insurance service nhic agreed to continue covering all the costs prioritizing risk aversion in order to rein in the transmission of the virus without the barrier of cost residents in south korea are more likely to voluntarily consult with public health authorities about their symptoms and contacts south korea also experienced a medical surge which refers to a heightened ability to provide adequate medical care during a crisis exceeding the limits of the normal medical infrastructure the early-stage daegu outbreak was a definitional example of a medical surge as shown in figure 4 south korea has among the lowest number of doctors per 1000 inhabitants 234 denmark 400 sweden 412 and norway 482 have about twice as many doctors per capita numbers of nurses are slightly better south korea has 774 nurses per 1000 inhabitants more than italy 459 new zealand 514 and norway 67 but still lower than denmark 1584 and germany 145 a common myth holds that south korea and asian countries in general enjoy greater human capital in the public health sector than others in reality however south koreas health infrastructure is not necessarily better and may be worse than many other oecd member countries while south koreas health infrastructure is below average among oecd countries south koreas national health system offers care with low barriers of physicalgeographical access to doctors and at low cost a universal national health care system covers almost all citizens regardless of income level at a standardized low cost 89 therefore other than surgery the price of medical treatment is almost the same as the so-called big mac price every administrative jurisdiction furthermore has its own local public health center staffed with health care experts including at least one full-time public doctor also known as a public health physician php these certified physicians serve in a public health center or sub-center in a rural village instead of serving in the military this system allows limited medical resources to be reasonably allocated across all geographic locations of the country affordably these low barriers to care explain why south korea 166 far surpasses the oecd average 69 and the rest of the world in the number of consultations patients have with doctors in a year as shown in figure 5 the approachability and affordability of public health resources not the sufficiency of them may point to an important context of pandemic response  a significant number of phps are certified field epidemiologists also known as epidemic intelligence service eis officers during the early stage of the outbreak these phps worked as local field epidemiologists screening initial diagnostic test kits and promptly investigating the results phps exercise various field-level discretions on contact tracing based on an understanding of the patients situation such as whether to coordinate with field epidemiologists from the headquarters to access a patients credit card and mobile phone usage or to check security camera footage of the patients movements these coordinated systems enabled the quick identification of the clusters and allowed for swift follow-up decisions on the exercise and length of quarantine measures and the number of contacts to reach out to for testing autonomic and immuno-vascular mechanisms of antihypertensive effects of taichi the diagnostic capacity or the ability to test a large number of patients is of great importance not only in identifying and treating the virus but also in establishing the reliability of medical data on which to base follow-up decisions on the pandemic response this capacity requires a healthy supply chain of testing kits at both manufacturing and distribution levels as well as an efficient testing system since the sars-cov-2 outbreak in january 2020 the south korean public health system has tested more than 750000 cases its daily capacity surpassed 15000 tests very early in the response in february 2020 just after the release of the rna sequence of sars-cov-2 long before its first reported case the south korean public health authorities coordinated with the countrys reasonably well-developed biotech sector and started stashing testing kits in january 2020 the drug safety ministry and the centers for disease control swiftly authorized a pre-approval procedure known as emergency use authorization eua for sars-cov-2 testing kits to ease formalities and bureaucratic processes six days later on 4 february 2020 public health authorities were able to use the authorized diagnostic kits for sars-cov-2 testing  all too often red tape has worked as a barrier to building sufficient testing capacity amid public health crises 10 however the south korean public health authorities effectively managed the tension between the compelling demand to provide the diagnostic kits for sars-cov-2 testing and the required level of quality assurance for rigorous diagnosis south korea decided to take pre-emptive state action ensuring an abundant supply chain of testing kits and other necessary medical supplies instead of waiting for the market mechanism to respond to demand  contrary to its high responsiveness to the sars-cov-2 pandemic south koreas management of the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov outbreak in 2015 failed the initial response to conduct pre-emptive quarantine and crisis communication 11 thanks to bureaucracies in the authorization process a newly developed and faster in vitro kit for mers-cov testing was not approved for use as a result it took a minimum of several days to get confirmed results from a lab-based diagnosis these lessons led to a law passed in 2016 which allowed for the emergency use of testing kits and expedited authorization procedures for in vitro diagnosis in situations of significant public health crisis  drive-through style testing stations both time-efficient and safe diffused from a public hospital kyungpook national university hospital to a local government goyang city and then nationally and even internationally later the phone booth-style testing facilities also known as walk-through stations were installed adding the ease of installation and adjustment to the merits of speedy safe testing whole sample collection procedures which took about 30 min in previous screening stations take only about five minutes in a walk-through system most of the excess time more than 10 min in the previous system was spent disinfecting the sample collection space in order to protect the next patient the phone booth-style station allows medical personnel to examine patients from behind plastic-molded panels eliminating the need for time-intensive cleanup  south korea is known for its sophisticated mobile and digital technologies and transnational tech companies and digital technology has been the core of aggressive contact tracing strategies while confirmed patients were required to report symptoms and detailed contacts for previous days even days when they did not present any symptoms the public health authorities did not rely solely on this self-report they used so-called digital surveillance technologies which could be controversial and various other sources of information such as mobile phone data including locational information of individuals credit card statements and security camera footage for tracing detailed contacts public health authorities conducted in-depth investigations on sars-cov-2 hotspots aimed at comprehensive contact tracing and follow-up measures encouraging quick testing for example during the outbreak at the guro-gu call center in seoul in march 2020 the centers for disease control and local governments established a joint investigation team to perform epidemiologic analysis for contact tracing this investigation traced detailed follow-ups for 14 days after the discovery of confirmed cases while the containment measures were in place the call center was located in a 19-storey building in a highly populated urban area commercial offices occupied 11 floors and residential apartments took up the other eight floors the public health experts closely tracked all patients under investigation pui including 922 employees working in the commercial offices 203 residents of the apartments and 20 visitors they determined each persons detailed movements in the building such as precise office seating and patterns of movement between floors during the timeframe of 21 february to 8 march 2020 they tracked mobile phone location data and security camera footage in the building and sent more than 16000 text messages to people traced who had spent more than five minutes in the building the investigation team concluded from this in-depth contact tracing that although both residents and employees in the building had regular contact in the elevators or the lobby almost all of the patients were the ones who sat on one side of the 11th floor this connection recognizes that the duration of close contact is an important risk factor of sars-cov-2 transmission and that follow-up measures should consider it digital surveillance technology was more heavily used in the recent outbreak in seoul nightclubs but the unique context of this cluster should be considered the media reported that the nightclubs that the 29-year-old man visited were venues popular among lgbt communities although those clubs do not openly advertise themselves as such either on their official websites or on social media that information along with publicly released identifying details about the mans age movements and place of residence could mean that the mans sexual orientation could be forcibly outed which may risk his social andor professional life even though these clubs were required to collect names and contact information and take temperatures before admitting guests public health authorities contact tracing became trickier as almost 2000 club patrons in the cluster left false or incomplete contact information or avoided follow-up calls  tracing the nightclub cluster proved tougher than even the february outbreak clustered in the shincheonji religious sect though these secretive group members were unwilling to cooperate with the public health authorities the group at least had relatively comprehensive contact details of their 200000 members after some drama the public health authorities obtained that detailed information and effectively traced them however tracking or tracing the nightclub-goers required very different approaches  the public health authorities and local governments employed a more technology-based approach to comb through the nightclub-goers they requested that all mobile network operators lg sk and kt submit signal tower records and found that 10905 people were in the proximity of the nightlife suburb of seoul from 24 april to 6 may 2020 the public health authorities decided to send text messages to all of them as an all-out effort to reach people potentially exposed to the virus asking recipients to get tested and self-quarantine the cell tower information is very detailed in the nightclub area there are signal towers every 50 to 100 m the public health authorities narrowed the tracing down to people whose phone got the signal from the cell tower for more than 30 min cell phones did not have to be used to be traced just powered on while maintaining the ability to expand the tracing coverage to people in the area for a shorter time the public health authorities and police forces investigated all security camera footage both in nightclubs and on the street tracking the movements from the bars to the subway stations there are more than 37000 public security cameras managed by seoul city and more than 1150000 public security cameras in the country and the police force can request to investigate privately installed security camera footage surveillance technology if authorized is able to trace almost every movement the public health authorities traced credit card transactions of more than 500 people to complement the mobile data  the use of digital surveillance technology for contact tracing exposed the delicate balance between privacy issues and public health emergency management south korean public health authorities effective containment of the sars-cov-2 has required the public to tolerate a certain degree of privacy infringement authorities can trace peoples movements through digital technology mobile phone data and security camera footage with or without their consent we should note that this condition of tolerance among south koreans cannot be easily generalized to other contexts even in south korean society where in modern history citizens often had to cede control over their private information to government authorities this aggressive system of contact tracing sparked fears and dissent particularly among minorities such as religious sects foreigners and lgbt people these text messages indicating precise knowledge of ones whereabouts at a specific day and time were understandably ill-received as was the knowledge of credit card monitoring  the failure of public health officials to inform citizens can lower confidence in the public response to the pandemic which in turn hinders the effectiveness of voluntary measures such as social distancing for this reason communication with citizens is particularly critical for democracies 12 in which many of the pandemic responses are voluntary and do not rely on coercive authoritarian state orders 131415 in south korea the centers for disease control have communicated relevant information to citizens and policy makers through various channels  the centers for disease control have held media briefings since the first confirmed case was reported one noticeable characteristic of these press conferences has been that every detail of the shared materials in the briefings is identical to those in ministerial debriefings this means that citizens enjoyed high levels of understanding and could make informed decisions on circumstances such as self-quarantine or face masks presenters were very engaged with journalists and the general audience even when communicating technical details demonstrating the media training of public health specialists  the public health authorities played the role of fact-checkers in order to prevent infodemics about the virus and promoted social distancing measures through various media outlets they offer real-time updates on the spread of the virus via social media websites and television to reach out to the largest possible population open data platforms provided details of testing and contact tracing so that programmers and app developers could innovate effective and efficient ways to provide alternatives  almost every movement taken by confirmed patients is released in real time and all people with a registered mobile phone get text alerts when there is sars-cov-2 hotspot nearby everyone gets automatic emergency messages such as the 15th imported case tested positive in jongno-gu district is staying at the somerset palace hotel in seoul for more information about the paths such as restaurants and shops traced please visit our website alert texting details exhaustive lists of routes with the estimated times of visits the public authorities send texts within 24 h after any case is confirmed test-positive  the system of emergency text alerts creates a trade-off between publicizing information about confirmed cases and protecting patient privacy such highly detailed information about the movements of each known case sometimes including age address and employer can reveal a patients identity various stigmas such as the outing concerns of nightclub-goers may prevent people from coming forward for testing to respond to these concerns the public health authorities announced the adoption of anonymous testing options on 14 may 2020 publicly promising to collect phone numbers and not names soon after the announcement the number of those who came forward for testing had doubled to more than 35000 tests from nightclub-related clusters the authorities have asked the public not to blame specific individuals or communities and warn that prejudiced speech on confirmed cases will worsen the pandemic as some of the clubbers may lie low to avoid demonization south koreas journalist associations drafted and released pandemic reporting guidelines requesting that the media avoid using sensational language or infringing on patients privacy south korean public health authorities have clearly communicated that it is a criminal offense to leak the private information of sars-cov-2 patients  the south korean health authorities recommend wearing a face mask covering the nose and mouth to protect other people from sars-cov-2 infection based on research showing that face masks reduce airborne virus transmission more than threefold the health outcomes for the wearer have been controversial scientific studies have been inconclusive on its effectiveness however public health experts generally agree that face masks provide at least a positive externality in reining in community transmission since they reduce the chances that people will infect others nearby 16 indeed many countries that initially discouraged wearing face masks later turned it back asking citizens to cover up their noses and mouths even with make-shift masks whenever out in public in south korea this recommendation was not too disruptive as most average citizens were already accustomed to wearing filtration face masks due to worsening air quality even though the sars-cov-2 curve seems to be flattened people still continue to wear masks to protect themselves a more problematic issue was the shortage of face masks particularly the filtration masks such as n95 or kf-94 particulate-filtering facepiece respirators needed by health professionals south korean public health authorities and state economists shared the view that face masks hand sanitizers and other core medical supplies are different from many other goods in the market as they benefit more than just the person using them as such the government decided to impose price controls and rationing to respond to mask shortages they worried that industries overwhelmed by demand would respond to those willing to pay higher prices even if these customers were panic-buying hoarding or reselling the supplies at even higher prices south korean public health authorities limited the price of a face mask to about 120 which was slightly below the market price at the time they also imposed rationing of two face masks per week per person and prioritized health professionals dealing with sars-cov-2 infections the authorities also bought a large share of the available masks to distribute them at a low price to people located in sars-cov-2 hotspots they were able to efficiently monitor these prices and restrictions thanks to the digitalized pharmacy health data portal run by the health insurance review and assessment service hira platform through this integrated platform pharmacists and public health authorities can review whether a customer has already bought a face mask elsewhere before a sale the public health authorities divided citizens into five groups based on date of birth and assigned each group to a specific day of the week to buy face masks they required every citizen to present identification cards allowing pharmacists to review their mask purchasing history they also asked each pharmacy to record every mask transaction in the hira data platform with a persons id number furthermore the authorities required pharmacies to digitally update stock and sales in the data system and asked them to release the data to the public allowing developers to come up with apps showing real-time mask stock levels at each pharmacy participation in data release was not mandatory but 22000 pharmacies out of 23000 nationwide 95 have agreed to share it the nations largest chat app kakaotalk and naver its largest search engine began providing map services showing a pharmacys inventory of face masks in real time many other similar apps followed in terms of production the authorities banned the export of masks until local production was sufficiently ramped up to distribute the masks in the rationed market at the early stage of market intervention authorities failed to supply the promised number of masks and pharmacies did not have enough stock for all customers as stipulated under the adopted rationing scheme many citizens were frustrated and this sparked public criticism but soon production stabilized and the average citizen could buy masks without waiting in a long queue as of may 2020 the authorities announced that over 80 percent of the demand for masks rationed in the market was supplied by local production the south korean public health authorities approached quarantine measures as comprehensive care rather than just limiting movements or contacts with the aim of high levels of compliance when inbound travelers arrived at the airport medical personnel asked them to install a self-health check app to continuously monitor them they also escorted people outside of the building for testing if needed either they or local governments boarded them on a chartered minivan or a bus to a police facility to await test results overnight people without symptoms or from less risky regions were allowed to go directly to quarantine facilities either provided by the authorities or by themselves 17 in most facilities provided by local governments all food and amenities were offered in the form of a care box and people could usually see their test results the following morning passengers with sars-cov-2 symptoms or those who have traveled to high-risk regions were placed in quarantine all in-bound travelers were required to submit their health conditions on the self-health check app called the self-quarantine safety protection mobile app during their 14-day incubation period during the 14 days people received home-quarantine guidance and information from their local government about how to report symptoms they may have developed local government officials assigned to self-quarantined patients called two times a day not only checking the physical health condition but also monitoring their psychological health if necessary psychological counseling services were also provided not only for quarantined patients but also for family members who are in the home since psychological condition strongly linked with fundamental vulnerability 1819 the korean neuropsychiatric association with the ministry of health and welfare has published guidelines to help quarantined people deal with anxiety encouraging frequent online communication south koreas ict-based quarantine care system was made possible by its superlative penetration rate in terms of smartphone ownership and internet usage to this end technology plays an important role in terms of citizens quarantine quality of life it prevents isolation and supports close care by the government another quarantine option was a living and treatment center community treatment center which is an isolation facility for confirmed patients with mild symptoms this service was provided to patients with old parents or young children without extra room at home for self-quarantine depending on their capabilities each local government provided a slightly different quarantine care package and living facility options some cities provided a full package of medical equipment individual relief kits and hygiene kits some cities offered living facilities without cost and others charged the pandemic is still overwhelming many other countries healthcare systems with exponentially rising numbers of patients creating unprecedented challenges south korean public health authorities deployed extensive digital surveillance technologies in fighting sars-cov-2 and contact traced huge numbers of potential or probable cases to test and quarantine them before further community transmission the case of south korea also shows that it is important to provide sufficient information to the public on sars-cov-2 cases so that citizens may comply with public health measures such as wearing face masks and social distancing as to south koreas approach to face mask distribution economists though skeptical about price controls may acknowledge that this case is an allowable rare exception though price controls are generally inferior to market forces the market sometimes needs a bit of help 20 and face mask rationing in south korea may be the case that proves it many countries had to implement restrictive lockdowns affecting their whole population and economy while south korea took a different approach let transmission happen and then quickly control it the south korean public health authorities approach was not preventive but reactive new waves recurred in an open economy and across relatively open borders a significant number of people died of the sars-cov-2 infection approximately 260 deaths may seem small compared to the tolls in other countries but the number is large in the epidemic history of the country new waves of clusters such as those of the shincheonji sect or the nightclubs could have been avoided if public health authorities had implemented more preventive measures such as nation-wide lockdown or border closings such as that in new zealand there could have been many what if moments really but what if this pandemic does not easily end in a short period of time and economies must re-open no public health system can lock down all activity for an indefinite timeframe therefore public health systems should build more capacity in order to effectively deal with unpredictable new waves of outbreaks what is most notable in south koreas pandemic response is the success of these measures in controlling transmission this capacity was largely attributable to the mers experience in 2015 citizens tolerance to digital surveillance technology and privacy infringement in exchange for a lockdown-free economy is another unique condition not easily generalized or benchmarked however public health experts may want to consider the use of digital surveillance a deliberate analysis on its costs and benefits may illuminate a path out of this unprecedented and possibly unending global crisis this article is a very early observation and presents only a very incomplete picture at the time of writing the pandemic may not have reached its peak more serious waves may occur in the future more follow-up research is needed with in-depth analysis on each case to understand and control the virus new waves of clusters such as those of the shincheonji sect or the nightclubs or e-commerce warehouses could have been avoided if public health authorities had implemented more preventive measures such as nation-wide lockdown or border closings such as that in new zealand there could have been many what if moments really but what if this pandemic does not easily end in a short period of time and economies must re-open no public health system can lock down all activity for an indefinite timeframe therefore public health systems should build more capacity in order to effectively deal with unpredictable new waves of outbreaks  medication management and adherence during the covid-19 pandemic perspectives and experiences from lmics irene kretchy a michelle asiedu-danso james-paul kretchy   prior to the incidence of the covid-19 pandemic lmics had a double disease burden of chronic infectious and non-communicable diseases ncds like hivaids tuberculosis hepatitis diabetes cardiovascular diseases cancers chronic pulmonary diseases and mental illnesses11
 patients with chronic diseases are at a higher risk of threat from the pandemic as the covid-19 is best combatted by a strong immune system yet chronic diseases like hiv diabetes and kidney diseases are immunosuppressing making patients more vulnerable to infections with difficulties in management12 13 14 while stress and anxiety are normal reactions during crisis situations15 the negative impact of covid-19 outbreak may affect the clinical outcomes of patients with chronic conditions like mental illness and cardiovascular diseases whose development and management are linked to stress and anxiety16
 in the face of the current pandemic many countries have had to make tough decisions in order to safeguard its people these decisions include lockdowns and restrictions on peoples movement and mobilization of health personnel to the frontline of the covid-19 infection this may be a major problem for patients with chronic diseases requiring revisits follow-ups check-ups and prescription refills since access to health facilities and their attending physicians may be denied also the increased likelihood of being infected at hospitals has forced most patients to avoid their health facilities for physician consultations there is also unconfirmed information on the health benefits of some products for either preventing or treating covid-19 in some media outlets and this has caused a surge in unsafe self-medication habits of some over-the-counter medications in some reports patients have also relied on community pharmacies for their medication needs which should be available for them17
 unfortunately lmics often rely heavily on pharmaceutical imports and the impact of the pandemic may be felt when essential medicines are unavailable and inaccessible to meet the needs of all especially those with chronic diseases the global shut down worldwide has led to fewer imports and exports and most pharmaceutical manufacturing firms have shifted their focus to the production of medicines and medical equipment targeted at the fight against covid-19 in their nations there seems to be a shift in the restrained import of pharmaceuticals towards battling the current covid-19 pandemic thus leaving a huge gap for pharmaceutical imports that target other chronic diseases this focus by pharma industries will disadvantage lmics due to the rather vulnerable and inadequate pharmaceutical manufacturing capacities in these countries to meet their general pharmaceutical needs and those for chronic diseases with limited supply to meet the increased demand created the market values of medicines for chronic diseases have escalated making them unaffordable for several patients in lmics who require them in addition to ensuring that these medicines are available chronic diseases rely heavily on linear adherence patterns for adequate therapeutic outcomes18 and this needs to be emphasized especially during this covid-19 pandemic for instance persons living with hiv require optimal adherence to their medications to ensure better immunity viral suppression and treatment success despite the stress and risk of infection for patients with diabetes strict adherence to medications maintain good glycemic control and prevent complications such as diabetic ulcers and increased blood pressure which further compromise their chances of survival if infected with covid-19 in general favorable therapeutic outcomes across many chronic disease states will be achieved when optimal medication adherence levels are maintained unfortunately the pandemic has left many in fear and with high stress levels19 while many people struggle to cope with the constant news of the spread and effects of covid-19 on their media channels they do not have adequate forms of social support to manage this stress as a result of lockdowns and self-isolation yet the negative effects of stress on disease outcomes and medication adherence have been documented20 21 22 the psychological impact of this pandemic might leave many patients with chronic diseases with little hope of improving their health outcomes thereby decreasing adherence and perhaps eroding health gains made prior to the pandemic23
 positive health outcomes for patients with chronic diseases have been attributed to pharmaceutical care interventions and this has been consistently reported in literature18

24 pharmaceutical care interventions aim to optimize medicines utilization for improved therapeutic outcomes25 these interventions have been reported to save lives and improve patient quality of life26 and in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic this role is relevant in augmenting efforts being made by other members of the healthcare team to ensure patient safety and wellbeing although different practice models relate to pharmacy the concept of pharmaceutical care was proposed and instituted in the mid-1970s to represent general services in patient care where the patient is the primary beneficiary of the actions by pharmacist27 the role of pharmaceutical care is significant for people with chronic illnesses and is particularly relevant during this covid-19 pandemic period where many people have various medicines-related concerns the concept has also been relevant for community practice where services and functions of community pharmacists in promoting and supporting rational medicines use and counseling is imperative28
 in providing pharmaceutical care during the covid-19 pandemic the focus of community pharmacists will be on the prevention identification andor resolution of drug therapy problems for patrons to their facility community pharmacists are ideally positioned for this role because they are the most accessible group of health practitioners during this covid-19 pandemic to address the substantial issues of inappropriate use of and promote rational use of medicines to people in the community as well as to special populations like patients with chronic conditions29

30 some pharmaceutical care practices that have been effective in improving patient outcomes for a number of chronic diseases includes the provision of appropriate drug information and counseling on chronic medications making essential medicines available addressing polypharmacy and medication safety concerns assessing medication needs promoting adherence and providing follow-up services31 32 33 34 35 36
 most countries have been forced to lockdown their major cities and restrict movement within such cities this restraint has led to many patients relying on community pharmacies for their medication needs and health information37 patients with chronic diseases may want to know what to do with their management and medicines during this pandemic while community pharmacists play key roles in educating patients on preventive measures and the pandemic in general providing adequate health information on chronic diseases and its management will directly address the concerns of patients in this category who may be confused and worried about their health these patients may also have questions about medicines to take during this period and the community pharmacists can also serve as information verification hubs to clarify the various remedies being advertised on media platforms for the prevention or treatment of covid-19 again in meeting the task of maintaining needed essential services community pharmacists need to engage their clients in frequent transparent communications especially with people with chronic conditions to identify their medication needs and provide support appropriately a strong community engagement will also ensure trust in the health system by patients who will be assured of continuity of health services to meet their essential needs at the community level without having to risk being infected in health facilities this is also important to ensure that people continue to seek care when appropriate and have it available when needed as people with chronic diseases and other ailments report to community pharmacies for non-covid-19 specific health needs community pharmacists can assist to identify suspected cases to avoid further community spread by following laid down protocols community pharmacists can assist to detect and prevent the spread of the pandemic within communities for instance the community practice pharmacists association of the pharmaceutical society of ghana has communicated some guidelines to help community pharmacists to triage and report suspected cases of covid-19 to district health management teams the proximity to community pharmacists become crucial in the triaging diseases of common occurrence with similar covid-19 symptoms for appropriate assessment and referral of suspected cases in an attempt to promote continuity of medication supply and accessibility to meet the demands of persons with chronic diseases while promoting social distancing and self-isolation during the pandemic community pharmacies can employ mobile delivery and courier services to promote door-step prescription refills and other non-prescription supplies this is to increase medication availability within these times while preventing spread of covid-19 to vulnerable patient groups pharmacists are also collaborating amongst themselves on social platforms to source medications for patients this does not only enhance availability to medications for patients in need but reduces social interaction of vulnerable chronic disease patients to the pandemic although there are no approved specific medicines to prevent or treat covid-19 social media and other information channels have been flooded with claims of potential remedies for the virus the community pharmacy will therefore be the most patronized health facility for people to either seek for or verify these recommended therapies examples of these popular remedies include hydroxychloroquine azithromycin preparations with high doses of vitamin c garlic capsules lemon tinctures and apple cider vinegar community pharmacists are thus tasked with the role of providing information on the authenticity of these claims to promote rational use of medicines for patients with chronic illnesses especially who are likely to be taking their prescription drugs wrongful uptake of information translating into irrational use of these other social opinionated remedies might lead to drug interactions with their routine chronic medications38 in addition the proper use of over-the-counter medications for managing simple ailments of common occurrence in patients with chronic illness also need to be monitored by community pharmacists by playing their traditional roles of counselling patients on their medications the contribution of community pharmacists in supporting rational use of medicines during this covid-19 pandemic will be emphasized reiterating the need for patients with chronic disease to adhere to their medication regimen has
